sustainability reporting document

about this document
swedish match is a global company with its corporate headquarters in stockholm, sweden. the company’s largest geogra-
phies in terms of both sales and operating profit are scandinavia and the us. other important markets include brazil, russia,
and parts of asia. many decisions are made at the national or regional level, by the group’s operating units within the product
areas of snus and moist snuff, other tobacco products (cigars and chewing tobacco), lights (lighters, matches, and comple-
mentary products) as well as other operations (primarily distribution for the swedish market). the company strives to achieve
a common approach on sustainability while at the same time allowing for differences at local and operating unit level. this
helps to promote both a high level of engagement and continuous improvement.
  swedish match is currently in the process of re-evaluating and refining its efforts with regard to sustainability with the aim to
provide clearer focus with regard to areas that are material to our company both today and in the future, recognizing the larger
sustainability issues facing society as a whole. the aim is to provide a clear roadmap with measurable goals and targets for
key focus areas. swedish match is taking a deliberate and rationale approach in this process, with the aim of having a well
defined strategy in place to be communicated around the time of the publication of the 2016 annual report.
  swedish match has previously reported according to the gri g3 guidelines at level b with the aim of transitioning toward
reporting in a manner that is broadly based on the principles of gri g4. at this stage the company’s primary focus is on fur-
ther developing a solid and relevant strategy for our sustainability efforts. this 2015 sustainability reporting document should
therefore be regarded as interim/transitional update, reporting on quantitative indicators in line with previous years.

the structure of retirement plans offered to swedish match employees are based on defined benefit plans and other types of
benefits. for defined benefit plans, the employer’s obligations to pay pensions under the plan are met directly by the organiza-
tion’s general resources as well as through a fund held and maintained separately from the resources of the organization. for
more information about how swedish match works with benefit plans, please refer to pages 61-62 and pages 76-78 (note 21,
employee benefits) in the 2015 annual report.
  estimates have been calculated using the project unit credit method (ias 19) on december 31, 2015, december 31, 2014,
and december 31, 2013.




1) the figures for economic performance using the gri methodology do not correspond to figures reported in swedish match’s annual report due to definitions set forth by gri which may differ from swedish
  match’s reporting under the ifrs methodology.
2) please note that the figures for the extent to which the plan’s pension liabilities are estimated to be covered by the assets that have been set aside to meet them have been restated for 2014 and 2013 com-
  pared to what was reported in the 2014 sustainability report.

wood consumption decreased 24 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower production volumes for matches, mainly
from within the brazilian operations. excluding wood, tobacco leaf used in the production of swedish match’s smokefree
tobacco products as well as cigars, is the largest group of materials, accounting for 33 percent of total usage in metric tons
during 2015. the usage of tobacco leaf was down 5 percent from 2014. cardboard, used for packaging materials in the pro-
duction of all products, accounted for 18 percent in 2015, down significantly from 2014 due to lower production volumes for
matches. while the use of coated board decreased compared to 2014, down 13 percent, the use of film (used for packaging
materials in the us production of smokefree products and cigars) was up significantly from 2014, mainly due to product mix
shifts within the cigar operations. plastics accounted for 11 percent of the total materials used. nylon, used in the production of
lighters, accounted for 8 percent. paraffin, used in match production, was down 17 percent compared to 2014 due to lower
production volumes and accounted for 4 percent of total materials used. butane and propane gas, used in the production of
lighters, accounted for 3 percent.

wood is also a renewable material.




3) when reporting environmental data in relation to msek sales, numbers are based on figures in the 2015 annual report. furthermore, the baseline used for setting environmental 2016 targets was average
  data per manufacturing facility for 2010 and 2011.
4) materials reported refer to the most significant materials categories within each product area. the list of materials reported is therefore not exhaustive.
5) wood is reported in volume (m3) instead of weight (metric tons). due to the inherent inaccuracies when using density conversion rates, wood is not converted into metric tons.

materials used in relation to total weight of smokefree products amounted to 0.9 metric tons in 2015. the snus factories in
sweden have had to manage an increasing complexity in terms of production, due to new product initiatives that have resulted
in an increasing number of small batches and scrapped finished goods. for the production of cigars, 7.2 metric tons of materials
were used per million cigars, a decrease of 14 percent. for match production, total materials used were 45.1 metric tons plus
432.5 m3 of wood per billion matches. for lighters, 11.4 metric tons of materials were used per million lighters.

swedish match’s primary direct energy sources are wood chips (a renewable energy source) and natural gas. wood chips
accounted for 53 percent of all direct energy consumed in 2015 while natural gas accounted for 46 percent. fuel distilled from
crude oil accounted for 1 percent. the use of wood chips declined by 7 percent to 49,294 mwh in 2015 with lower production
volumes for matches in brazil. the total amount of natural gas decreased by 8 percent compared to 2014, largely due to less
usage in the moist snuff factory in owensboro, the us, as a result of an overall decrease in production volumes as well as mild
weather conditions during the year. the use of fuel distilled from crude oil was virtually flat.

per unit of output produced, total direct energy consumed decreased by 4 percent to 2.5 mwh per unit of output by weight for
smokefree products. for cigars, the 2015 figure was higher than during the prior year, as the increase in total direct energy
consumed was higher than the increase in production volumes. for matches, total direct energy consumed per unit of output
increased by 12 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 as the overall decline in direct energy consumption did not correspond to
the decline in production volumes. for lighters, total direct energy consumed per unit of output was significantly higher com-
pared to 2014. consumption in 2014 was unusually low reflecting low usage in the assen factory in the netherlands due to
exceptionally warm weather conditions.

electricity accounted for 83 percent of total indirect energy consumed while purchased steam and district heating accounted
for 9 and 8 percent, respectively. in 2015, the total amount of electricity consumed was slightly lower compared to 2014. while
district heating decreased by 9 percent, purchased steam decreased by 5 percent.
  in 2015, 31 percent of swedish match’s indirect energy consumed was composed of renewable energy sources, up from 18
percent in 2014. this renewable energy refers to electricity purchases in sweden, where the company’s suppliers undertake
to produce and supply the amount of electricity that swedish match consumes without the use of fossil fuels. in 2015, the
match factories in sweden started to consume electricity from renewable energy sources, which explains the change in the
overall share of indirect energy from renewable energy sources.

energy saved due to conservation and efficiency improvements
in 2015, several energy efficiency improvement projects were registered. for the production of smokefree products, a project
was completed to optimize reusable heating which enabled savings in terms of district heating. for the production of cigars, air
conditioning units were replaced to increase energy efficiency. examples from the company’s lighter facilities include intro-
ducing energy efficient and more environmentally friendly air conditioning, modifications to molding machinery, installing of
led lamps and fluorescent lamps with lower wattages, and replacing an old compressor unit.
  in total, swedish match registered projects that led to energy improvements of 898 mwh in 2015. in terms of total cost savings,
these registered projects led to cost savings of 783,115 sek in 2015 (using average 2015 currency rates from the swedish riksbank).

water
total water withdrawal by source
in 2015, swedish match withdrew 879,218 m3 water, a decrease of 2,408,055 m3 (73 percent) compared to 2014. the
decrease refers to the water withdrawn for the company’s irrigation of poplar farms in brazil. the amount of water that is
needed to be withdrawn for irrigation purposes varies significantly from one year to another due to natural differences in climate
behavior, such as the amount of rain that has fallen during the year. figures for water withdrawal are therefore highly vola-
tile. in relation to total company sales (msek), total water withdrawals decreased by 75 percent to 60.7 m3.

in 2015, 61 percent of swedish match’s total water withdrawals were taken from surface water, followed by municipal water
supplies or other water utilities (33 percent). six percent was withdrawn from ground water. nearly all water withdrawals from
surface water took place in the company’s poplar farms in brazil.

in 2015, 73 percent of the company’s total water was withdrawn for the production of lights products, a result of water with-
drawals taking place in the company’s poplar farms in brazil. approximately 20 percent was withdrawn for the production of
smokefree products while production of cigars accounted for 7 percent of total water withdrawals.
  for the production of smokefree products, total water withdrawals increased by 19 percent to 174,168 m3 in 2015. the snus
factories in sweden have had to manage an increasing complexity in terms of production. for the production of cigars, total water
withdrawals increased by 30 percent to 58,976 m3. in late 2015, opportunities were identified to reduce water consumption in the
santiago factory in the dominican republic, and investments were made to change the urinals to a water free model. the
impact can be observed from october 2015 and the trend in 2016 clearly shows significantly less water usage than in 2015.
for the manufacturing of lights products, water withdrawals decreased by 79 percent due to the decrease of water withdrawals
for the poplar farms in brazil.

generation of electricity, heat, or steam from biomass accounted for 66 percent of the company’s greenhouse gas emissions
in 2015, down 7 percent from 2014. with regards to other sources, generation of electricity, heat, or steam decreased by 10
percent compared to 2014 and accounted for 31 percent of the company’s direct greenhouse gas emissions. swedish match
emitted 745 metric tons of direct greenhouse gases from the transportation of materials, products, and waste, a decrease of
65 percent compared to 2014. this was mainly due to the use of less fuel for transports of raw materials in brazil. fugitive
emissions accounted only for a small part of the company’s emissions of direct greenhouse gases.

in 2015, 82 percent of swedish match’s total waste was generated in the production of lights products while waste from pro-
duction of smokefree products accounted for approximately 14 percent. waste generated in the production of cigars
accounted for approximately 4 percent. the vast majority of the waste (according to definitions by gri) is generated in the
production of matches in sweden, where pure wooden waste from match splint is used for incineration to generate district
heating for local communities.
  in 2015, compared to 2014, total waste generated in the production of smokefree products increased by 6 percent to 3,341
metric tons, attributable to the snus factories in sweden as large projects, testing and a new production unit in kungälv, sweden
have impacted total waste generation. in the production of cigars, total waste decreased by 21 percent to 883 metric tons. in
early 2014, a new scale was installed in the santiago factory in the dominican republic, providing more accurate estimates of
total waste. in the production of lights, total waste increased by 1 percent, to 18,896 metric tons.

2015, approximately 79 percent of the company’s total waste referred to incinerated waste, mainly from the company’s
match factories in sweden. the majority of waste produced in the swedish match factories refers to pure wooden waste used
for incineration to generate district heating for the local communities. approximately 9 percent of the total waste was treated as
landfill, followed by 6 percent treated as recovery/recycling/reuse. hazardous waste treatment accounted for 3 percent.
approximately 2 percent was composted.
  in 2015, incinerated waste increased by 3 percent compared to 2014, while landfill and recovery/recycling/reuse decreased
by 6 and 12 percent respectively.

12) for match production in sweden, total waste excluding biomass (pure wooden waste from match splint) is tracked internally instead of total waste. biomass is a “positive waste” as it is used for incineration
  to generate district heating (biofuel) for local communities, and waste excluding biomass is a more relevant performance indicator when setting reduction targets.
