    moral and sexual harassment in the workplace
    in 2008 the protocol for the prevention and handling of workplace harassment,
    drawn up by mapfre the year before following talks with the workers’ legal
    counsel, was implemented and applied. this protocol, which establishes the
    actions necessary to evaluate any harassment claims made and the opportune
    measures for resolving potential conflicts and imposing fines where necessary,
    can be readily accessed by all employees on the firm’s intranet.
            also in 2008, corporate training programs given to managers and
    coordinators included informative chats to raise awareness of this protocol, with
    203 attendees in all.
            three harassment claims were brought during the year, all of which were
    resolved using the in-house procedures put in place to this end. the equality
    committee was duly informed of all proceedings. it is worth noting that all the
    professionals acting as instructors on this topic had first received specific
    training themselves.

    insurance) have been integrated in to the cac24 centre, which operates as a
    single virtual customer service centre, guaranteeing that calls are answered by
    the most qualified operator, regardless of where in spain the caller and
    operator are located. customers can use this call centre to conduct any
    business (make a claim, request product information or take out a policy)
    without having to leave their home or workplace.

            likewise, internal audits are carried out to calculate answering times
    and check on how incidents and claims were dealt with. visits made by
    maintenance team managers as well as quality surveys on the level of
    satisfaction and sectorial surveys are carried out in order to analyse quality
    standards applied and the perception mapfre clients may have with regards
    to the quality offered. quality audits are carried out on management processes
    as well as regular telephone checks to control policies and determine reasons
    for non-payments. all of these measures allow for follow up, on a regular
    basis, of cancelations, the evolution of client portfolios, and enable the
    company to act accordingly in order to recover lost clients.
            abroad, mapfre measures its customers’ satisfaction through a
    combination of public and in-house surveys.
            all of mapfre’s units and countries in which the company operates are
    fully committed to complying with quality standards. an example is the setting
    up of a network of repair centres that regroups a number of centres
    committed to providing mapfre clients with special benefits, quality service,
    and preferential treatment.
            mapfre is aware of the importance of client confidentiality and as a
    consequence, follows appropriate procedures to guarantee the protection of
    personal data.
            mapfre relies on qualified employees to offer advice via the many
    supports in place to distribute company products on the services offered.
            mapfre was rewarded the following awards for the level of quality

    training
    mapfre is strongly committed to training its suppliers to further improve the
    quality of services provided to clients and policyholders. for this reason,
    suppliers receive information on mapfre’s company culture and quality
    standards. service suppliers are provided with systems, materials and
    informative files, amongst which the following:
            — the operating and internal regulations manual aimed at health
    experts from mapfre caja salud, simple and easy to use, explains

    investment decision-making for assistance company managers and technical
    vehicle status evaluation.

    quality
    all component companies follow up on quality standards applied for the
    provision of services by suppliers mainly through client surveys or visits to the
    supplier’s facilities. service provided deadlines and rates are evaluated.
    suppliers are also assessed through the number of incidences reported by
    operators, visits, meetings with providers, communication with clients, and
    internal and specific audits. in addition, the general department of technology
    and procedures conducts half-yearly supplier satisfaction surveys. supplier
    satisfaction surveys were also conducted in colombia, puerto rico and chile.

   environmental commitment
   since its foundation, mapfre adopted the concept of sustainability as a value,
   promoting respect for the environment over the course of its development. in
   2005, this concept was expressly incorporated in its code of good governance.
           mapfre’s environmental policy is based on three main pillars: the
   integration of the environment into the business, management of environmen-
   tal matters, and promoting a sense of responsibility towards the environment.
   in 2008 mapfre updated its environmental policy to align it with the group’s
   new organisational structure following its recent restructuring. this policy can
   be accessed at http://www.mapfre.com under the social responsibility section.



   assessment of mapfre’s environmental
   record in 2008
   the group continued to make progress on delivering its targets in relation to
   direct environmental impacts and has continued to implement its
   environmental management system throughout mapfre’s corporate buildings
   across spain and in centres devoted to non-administrative activities.
           the table below outlines the various targets for reducing the group’s
   direct environmental impact and an assessment of these targets, indicating
   planned initiatives and the degree of compliance:

         in terms of the group’s indirect environmental fallout, mapfre’s internal
audit department has monitored the environmental aspects of corporate actions in
the fields of procurements, investments, contracting and other supplier manage-
ment initiatives. in addition, the range of products and services of environmental
interest marketed to the group’s customers has been extended geographically
and sector-wise, while cooperation with public entities and authorities on the
promotion of environmentally responsible behaviour has been strengthened.



eco–efficiency
mapfre quantitatively assesses environmental impacts derived from its
activity and consequently has identified main areas of concern to address and
defined appropriate objectives and actions to take.
consuming resources is one mapfre’s main impacts on the environment and
eco-efficiency measures have been taken to reduce employee consumption,
amongst which we would highlight the following:
         — installation, in seven buildings, of water saving devices in the taps,
which allow for savings of between 35 and 50 percent. this brings the total
number of buildings fitted out with these devices to 13. the installation process
began in 2007.
         — application of energy efficiency and saving criteria to reform work
performed on existing buildings and to the integral design and construction of new ones.



                                                                                                                                                                                               51

   environmental risks. amongst other activities, it develops tools to assess such
   risks in the insurance sector but also in sectors which may further impact on the
   environment.



   relationships with stakeholders
   organisations and public authorities

   and the united nations’ environmental programme for financial entities and
   the insurance sector (unep fi) as well as in work groups dedicated to
   analysing and assessing environmental risks. the firm has signed agreements
   of collaboration with relevant state organisations specialised in water saving
   and energy efficiency.

   the environment and suppliers
   mapfre has given guidelines to suppliers on how to tackle risks which may
   impact the environment in certified work centres to enhance good practices
   which respect the environment.

   employees
            mapfre’s employees in spain received a total of 2,459.5 hours of
   environmental training, of which 48% were managed by the group’s
   environmental department. mapfre’s environmental commitment remains a
   core component of its corporate training agenda.
            in a bid to promote environmentally responsible behaviour, in 2008 the
   employees were asked to partake of the “car sharing” initiative designed to
   facilitate contract between individuals keen to share their private vehicles on
   their daily commutes.
            mapfre’s environment portal is now accessible to employees; it
   includes an environmental suggestion box which registered 120 consults
   during the year.
