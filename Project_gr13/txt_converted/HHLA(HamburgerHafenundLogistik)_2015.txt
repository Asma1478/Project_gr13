    klaus-dieter peters               ladies and gentlemen,
    chairman of the executive board
                                      hamburger hafen und logistik ag (hhla) looks back on a suc­
                                      cessful year. the company succeeded in improving its revenue
                                      and operating result significantly in the 2014 financial year. group
                                      revenue rose by more than 5 percent to € 1.2 billion, while the
                                      operating result (ebit) improved by 10 percent to € 169 million.
                                      we therefore exceeded our forecasts.

                                      the operating environment was difficult, however. global economic
                                      growth was restrained and the trend in world trade also proved
                                      weaker than in the previous year. both political and economic crises
                                      hampered throughput developments in markets of relevance to us,
                                      such as ukraine and russia. operating conditions in hamburg also
                                      remained challenging. there were numerous traffic bottlenecks last

                                      companies deviated from their timetables to an unusually large
                                      extent. on top of this, the delay in dredging the river elbe, which
                                      is urgently needed, is having an increasingly serious impact on the
                                      nautical accessibility of our terminals. at the same time, a growing
                                      number of ever-larger container ships are calling at our terminals.
                                      together with tight time frames for shipping on the river elbe, this cre­

                                      in far east traffic. feeder traffic to the baltic sea decreased. this
                                      was partly due to falling volumes in trade with russia, caused largely
                                      by the sanctions imposed as a result of the ukraine crisis and the
                                      country’s economic downturn. ultimately, throughput growth in
                                      hamburg was unable to fully compensate for the drop of almost
                                      30 percent at our container terminal odessa (cto) caused by
                                      the political and economic crisis in ukraine. despite the difficult
                                      macroeconomic envir­onment, however, we completed the terminal
                                      expansion in odessa, which was already started back in 2010, and
                                      put a new berth into operation. this also sends out a clear signal
                                      that we are still committed to odessa. with this long-term invest­
                                      ment, we are ensuring that we will have the option of capitalising
                                      on future market opportunities once the political and economic
                                      environment has stabilised.

                                      all in all, the container segment remained stable at the prior-year
                                      level with throughput of around 7.5 million teu. segment revenue
                                      rose by over 4 percent to almost € 744 million, while the operating

                                    partly on the traffic situation. if the vehicles which transport
                                    containers to or from the terminal all arrive at the same time,
                                    instead of being spread over the course of 24 hours, the

                                    pose a challenge for the terminals and for the road network

                                     in future, it should be possible to check all data relating to a
                                     container with the aid of computers – rather than manually
                                    – before the truck even arrives. this saves time for both the
                                     terminals and the drivers. the latter can be sure that their
                                     designated container really is ready for them. the timely

   questions were: how are containers delivered to and
   from the particular liner services in the 100 hours before
   and after a ship arrives at the terminal? how are inbound
   and outbound deliveries divided between the different
   carriers, i. e. feeder ships, trains and trucks? when and
   how strongly does storage capacity utilisation at the
   container terminal start to increase, and when does it
   begin to fall again?

   to answer these questions, münchow programmed a
   statistical analysis which maps trends for the last ten
   incoming vessels from each liner service. münchow ex­
   plains how the results help the terminal: “thanks to the
   improved data, staff can now forecast the anticipated
   levels of work more precisely and consequently better plan
   for forthcoming operations. as a result, all three modes of
   transport – ships, trains and trucks – can be processed
   more smoothly.”

ments made for the hhla group regarding market

sidiaries are companies controlled by the group. the group is deemed
to control a company if it has an exposure or right to fluctuating returns
resulting from its involvement in the investee and if it can also use its
power over the investee to affect these returns. in particular, the group
controls an investee if – and only if – it all of the characteristics listed in
ifrs 10.7 apply. subsidiaries’ financial statements are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the time when control begins
until the time when control ends.

non-controlling interests are valued at the time of acquisition using the
relevant share of the acquired company’s identifiable net assets. changes
in the group’s shareholding in a subsidiary which do not lead to a loss of
control are recorded in the balance sheet as equity transactions.

hhla annual report 2014

112 notes to the consolidated financial statements
    general notes




the following revised and new iasb/ifric standards and interpretations
were mandatory for the first time in the financial year under review:

standard                           content and significance
ifrs 10 consolidated financial     ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements was published in may 2011 and supersedes the previously valid guidelines on
statements                         control and consolidation in ias 27 consolidated and separate financial statements and sic 12 consolidation – special
                                   purpose entities. due to the new definition of control in ifrs 10, all companies are subject to the same criteria when
                                   identifying control relationships. this has not had significant effects on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.
ifrs 11 joint arrangements         this standard was published by the iasb in may 2011. ifrs 11 replaced the previous regulations on accounting for
                                   joint ventures (ias 31 interests in joint ventures and sic 13 jointly controlled entities). the new standard provides
                                   accounting guidance for companies which exercise joint control over a joint venture or joint operation. the previous
                                   option of pro rata consolidation for joint ventures has been eliminated. partners in a joint venture must henceforth use
                                   the equity method. these amendments had no substantial impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements. the
                                   figures for the previous year have been restated accordingly.
ifrs 12 disclosure of interests    according to the ifrs 12 standard published in may 2011, companies must disclose details which enable users of
in other entities                  financial statements to assess the type of risks and financial consequences entailed in the company’s interests in
                                   subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and non-consolidated structured companies (special-purpose entities).
                                   ifrs 12 applies to companies who produce balance sheets as per ifrs 10 and ifrs 11. the standard comprises
                                   the disclosure obligations contained in ias 27 consolidated and separate financial statements, ias 28 investments
                                   in associates and ias 31 interests in joint ventures. applying the standard led to more detailed notes in hhla’s
                                   consolidated financial statements see note 3.
amendments to ifrs 10,             the amendments passed in june 2012 to ifrs 10, 11 and 12 clarified the transition guidance for the first-time adoption
ifrs 11 and ifrs 12                of these standards. these primarily provide relief for the transition to the new standards. the amendments come into
                                   effect with the above-named standards. this guidance had no impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.
ias 27 separate financial          ias 27 (amended in 2008) was revised in the course of publishing the ifrs 10, 11 and 12 standards. ifrs 10 replaces the
statements (amended in 2011)       portion of the previous ias 27 (amended in 2008) which deals with consolidation. ias 27 (amended in 2011) now deals
                                   solely with separate financial statements. this amendment has no effect on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.
ias 28 investments in              when ifrs 11 joint arrangements was altered in may 2011, ias 28 was amended at the same time. now, sole use is
associates and joint ventures      to be made of the equity method. this explicitly includes joint ventures. the regulations on material influence remained
(amended in 2011)                  unchanged. now, if an associate becomes a joint venture or vice versa, it is still reported using the equity method and
                                   no revaluation is conducted. this amendment had no impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.
ias 32 offsetting financial        the amendments were published by the iasb in may 2011. they clarify the requirements for offsetting financial assets
assets and financial liabilities   and liabilities in the balance sheet. all counterparties involved must have a legally enforceable right to set off – both in
                                   the course of ordinary business and in the case of insolvency – as of the balance sheet date. it stipulates which gross
                                   settlement mechanisms can be viewed as net settlement in the context of the standard. the amendment had no impact
                                   on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.
ias 36 impairment of assets:       the amendments to ias 36 published by the iasb in may 2013 reduce the disclosure requirements for recoverable
recoverable amount disclo-         amounts. at the same time, however, they broaden the scope of information required in the notes when impairment
sures for non-financial assets     losses are recognised or reversed. this had no impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements in the reporting
(amended in 2013)                  year.
ias 39 financial instruments:      following the amendment to ias 39 published in june 2013, hedge accounting is not discontinued in certain circum-
recognition and measure-           stances if a hedging instrument is novated to a central counterparty (clearing house) as a result of legal requirements.
ment – novation of derivatives     this has no impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements.

application of the following amendments to standards is voluntary for the
financial year and hhla has chosen not to make use of these:

standard                          content and significance
ifric 21 levies                   the interpretation published in may 2013 clarifies when a company should recognise a liability to pay a levy imposed
                                  by the respective authorities. the iasb states that adoption is mandatory for financial years which begin on or after
                                  1 january 2014. in the eu, the mandatory adoption date was set as the start of the first financial year beginning on or
                                  after 17 june 2014. early adoption is permitted. this interpretation is not expected to have a major effect on hhla’s
                                  future consolidated financial statements.
amendment to ias 19:              the amendments published in november 2013 clarify a number of requirements laid out in ias 19. the company will
defined benefit plans:            continue to deduct contributions paid by employees themselves or third parties for benefit plans offered by the com-
employee contributions            pany from the service cost in the future. this only applies if there is no link between the amount of the contributions and
                                  the employee’s years of service. the amendments apply to financial years which begin on or after 1 july 2014. early
                                  adoption is permitted. this clarification will have no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
annual improvements to            the annual round of improvements published in december 2013 affects the following standards: ifrs 2 share-based
ifrs 2010 – 2012 cycle            payment, ifrs 3 business combinations, ifrs 8 operating segments, ifrs 13 fair value measurement, ias 16
                                  property, plant and equipment, ias 24 related party disclosures and ias 38 intangible assets. the amendments take
                                  effect for financial years that begin on or after 1 july 2014. early adoption is permitted. hhla does not anticipate any
                                  significant effects for the consolidated financial statements.
annual improvements to            the annual round of improvements published in december 2013 affects the following standards: ifrs 1 first-time
ifrs 2011 – 2013 cycle            adoption of ifrs, ifrs 3 business combinations, ifrs 13 fair value measurement and ias 40 investment property.
                                  the amendments apply to reporting years which begin on or after 1 july 2014. early adoption is permitted. hhla
                                  does not expect the amendments to have any significant effects on the consolidated financial statements.


the following iasb standards and interpretations have not yet been
adopted by the eu and have not been applied:

standard                          content and significance
annual improvements to            the iasb published the 2012–2014 round of improvements in september 2014, which affects to the following standards:

                                  after 1 january 2016. early adoption is permitted. the impact on hhla’s consolidated financial statements is currently
                                  being examined.
amendments to ifrs 10 and         the iasb approved amendments to ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements and ias 28 investments in associates
ias 28 sale or contribution of    and joint ventures in september 2014. these clarify how unrealised gains from transactions between an investor and a
assets between an investor and    joint venture or an associate should be reported. the efrag announced in february 2015 that the process of endors-
its associate or joint venture    ing these amendments had been suspended for the time being because inconsistencies had been identified between
                                  the amended standard and the existing ias 28. the previously issued application date – 1 january 2016 – has been

swaps)                  prices quoted reflect the actual transactions for similar instru-
                        ments. the market values are calculated with present value and
                        option pricing models to determine the fair value. whenever
                        possible, these models use the relevant market prices and interest
                        rates observed at the balance sheet date, obtained from recog-
                        nised sources, as input parameters. the fair value of available-
                        for-sale financial assets is determined on the basis of market
                        prices. the relevant fixed interest rate amounts to between 3.82
                        to 4.33 %. any variable components to be included are based
                        on 1-m to 6-m-euribor rates. the derivatives have a remaining
                        maturity period of up to two years.
