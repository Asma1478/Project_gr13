our ambition is that skandia – by continuing to think ahead – will evolve
to be the leading savings company in sweden. our most important
task is to maximise value creation for our customers, who are also our
owners. we do this with sustainability in mind – something that beneﬁts
our customers’ savings over the long term as well as the society they
live in today.

shared value strategies, i.e., how an organisation can combine societal
beneﬁt with business beneﬁt for customers and owners. examples of how
skandia creates long-term sustainable value include disability insurance

three pillars of sustainability
in short, sustainability is a matter of working long-
term to reduce impacts on people and the environ-
ment. traditionally the concept is described from the
perspective of three dimensions:                                              environmentally
                                                                                sustainable
• social sustainability
• environmental sustainability
• economic sustainability

a prerequisite for sustainable development is that
                                                                                  sustainable
these three dimensions mutually support each other                               development
when we manage and use our resources in a long-term
sustainable manner.                                              socially                       economically

overarching areas. these then form the foundation

skandia is working towards and communicates about.

facts about skandia’s customer-elected council
of delegates
the general meeting is skandia’s highest deci-
sion-making body and is conducted by a council of
delegates that is nominated and voted into oﬃce by
skandia’s 1.4 million owners. three general meetings
were held in 2015. apart from these, the council of
delegates held informal meetings for the purpose of
monitoring the company’s development.

the council of delegates has three main duties:
• appointing skandia’s board of directors                   customer-elected council of delegates
• adopting the articles of association and owner
  instructions
• deciding on remuneration of senior executives
  of skandia

as the owners’ representative, the council of dele-
gates is responsible for the owners’ dialogue with the
board, where the owner instructions is the most                      board of directors

tions the council of delegates lays out the values that
are to permeate operations, which apart from corpo-
rate social responsibility consist of long-termism,
focus on customer beneﬁt, and a sound openness                              ceo
towards customers and other stakeholders.
   the mandate period for delegates is three years.
after the annual general meeting in 2016 the council
of delegates will be fully constituted with 21 dele-
gates, with the successive election of seven members
every year.

egates and corporate governance is provided in skan-

work was also carried out to further develop the organisation and
processes for responsible investments.

advocacy dialogues with. following are a few examples:

research and opinion-shaping
activities for combating ill-health
skandia is working to show the gains that can be made
from foreseeing, preventing and remedying ill-health
and conveying them in both human and economic
terms. we believe that it is through joint strengths –
together with other business actors, the public sector,
non-proﬁts and the research community – that
socially sustainable development can be achieved.

the cost of ill-health and skandia’s health calculator
the ohälsans pris (“the cost of ill-health”) confer-
ence held during the autumn was a joint arrangement
sponsored by skandia, karolinska institutet and the
organisation en frisk generation. the focus was on the
major challenges that lifestyle-related illnesses are
presenting for society. among other topics, professor

governance of environmental aspects
skandia’s environmental responsibility is deﬁned in the
group’s sustainability policy. developing environmental
governance and incorporating environmental concerns
into the entire organisation continues to be a priority
area in which skandia’s business planning process
plays a central role. environmental aspects of opera-
tions are a standing item on the sustainability council’s
agenda as are aspects that the esg organisation
addresses in its investment decisions. skandia’s great-
est direct environmental impacts are made primarily
by the group’s real estate holdings, which are managed
by skandia’s real estate company, whose company-
adapted sustainability policy is aligned with the
skandia group’s sustainability policy. skandia’s real
estate company is certiﬁed according to iso 14001.
