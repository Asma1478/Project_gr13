in addition, we are actively promoting the responsible
production and use of chemical products, and better
information sharing with the public. for example, we are
working with the european soap and detergent industry
association (a.i.s.e.) on formulation improvements, as well
as providing consumer guidance on how to use detergents
properly (www.washright.com). we launched and then
expanded a p&g internet site (www.scienceinthebox.com) to
help inform consumers and stakeholders about the science and
safety behind our european cleaning products. very high public
interest in this site led to a similar site covering the science and
safety of skin and hair care products (www.pgbeautyscience.com)
and another site covering p&g’s approaches to product safety
and views on a variety of chemical management and science
policy issues (www.pgperspectives.com). for more on this
work, see science in-the-box on the next page.

from a policy standpoint, we continue to believe that
chemicals management programs should be based on:
1. efﬁcient risk-based priority-setting processes that use
   hazard data and basic exposure information together to
   identify issues of potential concern, followed by practical
   risk evaluations that analyze chemicals in a tiered fashion to
   resolve such issues.
2. risk management decision making that combines
   information on a chemical’s risks, beneﬁts and costs with
   an understanding of societal concerns; the risks, beneﬁts
   and costs of alternatives; and the use of appropriate
   precautionary measures.
3. communications that provide meaningful and relevant
   safety information to stakeholders, such that they can make
   knowledgeable decisions.

p&g ensures that our operations are safe for our employees, consumers
and the environment. we reduce or prevent the environmental impact of product
manufacturing whenever possible.


manufacturing materials flows
2006-2007
as the diagram illustrates, p&g’s use of material resources is
highly efﬁcient. the vast majority of materials are converted to
products, and the output of the manufacturing waste (which is
largely non-hazardous) is low.

the future of distribution?
a p&g global engineering project is focusing on designing
and constructing sustainable manufacturing and distribution
centers and transporting ﬁnished product in a sustainable way.

a critical pilot this year was development of the “big box”
distribution center in amiens, france. this is the biggest
conventional distribution center in western europe, about
600,000 square feet, able to store 70,000 pallets of
p&g products.

the amiens distribution center incorporates the best thinking
on sustainable design, from within p&g and outside.




examples of sustainable solutions adopted at the distribution
center are:
• solar panels for hot water supply and photovoltaic cells for
  energy production
• windmill turbine to produce up to 10 percent of the energy
  needed on site
• natural light via translucent roof panels (energy savings up to
  30 percent)
• energy-efﬁcient ﬂuorescent lighting, daylight dimming and
  motion detection (energy savings up to 70 percent)
• forklift trucks with ac regenerative motors (the battery is
  recharged when the forklift’s mast comes down), yielding
  energy savings up to 30 percent)
• recyclable wall and roof cladding panels
• carpet with 80-percent recyclable yarn
• wood from sustainable tree plantations
• local vegetation

another example is use of “low embodied energy material,”
designed to reduce a building’s energy footprint. the amiens
distribution center uses wood frames (glulaminated, from eco-
certiﬁed forests) for the roof trusses, docks, doors and other
structures instead of concrete or steel frames.

p&g france celebrates 15 years
of seashore preservation
this year is the 15th anniversary of p&g’s long-term
commitment to the french government’s seashore protection
agency conservatoire du littoral and its scientiﬁc programs
and communication.

in 1992, p&g france created the p&g foundation for
seashore protection in a unique private company/public
agency partnership with the conservatoire du littoral. the
foundation has had two key missions: funding and developing
environmental research and helping the conservatoire
communicate its accomplishments, thus enhancing the
organization’s scientiﬁc credibility. the foundation has given
p&g france stronger visibility in the environmental sphere,
especially with government agencies. as a result, p&g france
was appointed to the commission preparing the french
environmental charter, which became part of the french
constitution in 2005.

the foundation is marking the anniversary by engaging
stakeholders in debate to raise awareness of environmental
philanthropy, which is being developed in france. the foundation     the foundation is marking

                                                     laws protecting consumers from misuse of their personal
                                                     information, and many others are following suit.

                                                     information. even in countries without privacy legislation, we
                                                     still adhere to our privacy policy. we want to have the trust
