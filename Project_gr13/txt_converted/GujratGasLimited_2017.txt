                           energy has profound implications on mankind and their socio-economic-political spheres integrated across the globe. the
                           global energy basket is led by oil, closely contested by coal and then followed by natural gas and other fuels in respective order
                           of their share in global consumption pattern. among the leading nations of energy consumption, india has had a tremendous
                           growth trajectory of around 5% over the last one and half decade to consistently position itself at the third3 place only next to
                           china and united states respectively for nearly a decade. india has been highly dependent on imports of oil and gas with a cagr
                           of around 8% since the last decade. the government of india has urged all stakeholders to increase the domestic production of
                           oil and gas to reduce import dependence from 77% to 67% by the year 20224 . india has been rated the fastest growing g20
                           economy registering an economic growth of around 7.1%5 in the fiscal concluded on march 31, 2017 even after recording a
                           sluggish index of industrial production6 . this is further complemented by the fact that the energy intensity of gdp of india is
                           lower than the world average including that of united states, brics, among others. the world economy is expected to almost
                           double over the next 20 years with india and china accounting for around half of the expected increase3.
                           globalisation is an economic phenomenon, but impacts all fields of human life making it a boon and a bane. the consolidation
                           brings in efficiency and equitable access to resources across the globe but also makes it vulnerable to the changes happening in
                           the global arena like britain's exit from the european union (brexit), paris agreement (on climate change), the refugee crisis,
                           conflict in the middle east, few nation’s electoral mandate, china’s economic sluggishness, opec and non-opec nation’s
                           decision for oil production cut, to name a few. while these may not have a direct impact on the indian economy per se, however
                           they do create volatility in the global trade. the same is reflected in one of the globally traded commodities, crude, which settled
                           at levels below us$ 60/ bbl after an inconsistent trajectory in the recent past.
                           the disruption in the global oil and gas market impacted the prices starting fy 2014-15, after having a stable run for more than
                           half a decade, attributed to the increased supplies and dwindling global demand which piled up inventories. the stability was
                           reinstated to the levels of around us$ 50-55/ bbl through the production cut agreed by opec and non-opec countries. this
                           phase left the stakeholders globally guessing about the prices and the consequential impact on the economic activities all
                           across.
                           in addition to the above, the indian economy evidenced some major policy changes in the fiscal concluded on march 31, 2017
                           including the passing of the goods and services tax (“gst”) bill in both the houses of parliament which received the assent of
                           the honourable president of india on september 08, 2016, demonetisation of the legal tender of all currency having
                           denomination of rs. 500/- and rs. 1,000/- with an intention to curb - corruption, counterfeiting, antisocial activities; changing
                           from cash economy to digital payments, etc. complementing the initiatives like start-up india, digital india, make in india, smart
                           cities, etc. the demonetization along with the implementation of the gst is likely to have a positive impact over the medium
                           term including widening of the tax net and improved tax compliance. further the currency so channelized into the banking
                           system would reduce the lending rates and augment the growth of indian economy. the fiscal and monetary policy reforms
                           were supported by sectoral initiatives which included introduction of hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy, lpg give it
                           up campaign, pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy), marketing and pricing freedom for new gas production, diesel price
                           deregulation, discovered small field policy, etc4.
                           notwithstanding the aforementioned factors and ever dynamic business environment, the indian economy and the oil and gas
                           industry (including city gas distribution (cgd)) could sustain and maintain the growth momentum. while the geo-political
                           events, policy changes and other chaos posed globally and within the country could be meted out gallantly during the bygone
                           fiscal reflected in sustenance of demand, but nevertheless failed to leave its mark denting the cgd growth. the cgd business
                           is a sun-rise business drawing focus of policy makers and associated stakeholders towards tapping the immense growth
                           potential and though may be subjected to challenges due to the ever dynamic business environment would not deter from the
                           growth path in the long run. in addition the global consensus exhibited during the paris agreement on climate change makes it
                           evident the clean and green fuels would continue to enjoy priority and support from policy makers and key stakeholder alike.

                           ministry of environment and forests, etc. among other initiatives that marked the focus on natural gas usage includes
                           introduction of hydrocarbon exploration and licensing policy, marketing and pricing freedom for new gas production,
                           discovered small field policy, gas4india campaign, smart cities, etc. the government of india’s commitment for a gas-based
                           economy is patent in its efforts to increase the share of natural gas in the country’s energy basket from 6.5%7 towards
                           achieving global benchmark.
                           to increase the share of natural gas in india’s energy mix, harness domestic sources, expand existing and erect new terminals for
                           lng imports, floating storage facilities, gas transportation, etc. for catering the growing needs of existing and new demand
                           centres, the efforts have assertively been augmented7 under the vision of the government of india. complementing these
                           efforts public and private sector companies including city gas distribution (cgd) companies, natural gas pipeline companies,
                           lng terminal companies, and other industry stakeholders have joined hands to promote the natural gas sector with zeal.
                           gas4india an unified cross-country, multimedia, multi-event campaign aims to communicate the national, social, economic
                           and ecological benefits of using natural gas as the fuel of choice to every citizen who uses, or will use in the near future, gas in
                           any way - to cook, travel, light their homes, and power their businesses. harmonising these initiatives the sectoral regulator, the
                           petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (pngrb), which governs and regulates the downstream gas industry, has been
                           proactive and aggressive in authorising about 75 city gas distribution networks and 53 natural gas pipeline projects to
                           integrate and roll out infrastructure development on pan india basis.
                           your company has been optimally making the best utilisation of these opportunities by participating actively in the cgd
                           bidding process tendered by pngrb in the cgd bid round – vi. your company is proud to claim that it was victorious in 6
                           geographical areas (ga’s) contiguous to the existing areas of operation in state of gujarat which includes the dahej-vagra
                           taluka (district bharuch), panchmahal district, ahmedabad district (excluding areas already authorized), anand district
                           (excluding areas already authorized), dahod district and amreli district. these contiguous areas and the potential demand
                           loads would enhance the customer base across all business area propelling growth in volume and synergise the company’s
                           overall business. your company would continue to evaluate new opportunities to diversify its existing business into new
                           markets organically and inorganically.
                           in addition to the aforesaid opportunities the industry is glaring at yet another avenue of growth and abundance in the form of
                           commercially introducing cng in two wheeler business. two wheelers comprise around 25% of the total vehicles on road at
                           national level . further there are other initiatives in the pipeline such as cng stations for cng run train, lng by trucks, green
                           corridor, among other in-house research initiatives being carried out relentlessly.
                           similar to any other business, the company faces challenges in the form of competition, from other conventional fossil fuels
                           due to the abundance, accessibility and availability at much cheaper rates, notwithstanding the other subsidized/ non-
                           subsidized renewable fuels as well. the fuel also faces threat in the form of disparity in the tax structure compared to alternate
                           fuels. the impetus on growth of natural gas sector as mentioned in the above sections has attracted a lot of new players in cgd
                           business. notwithstanding these your company shall continue to focus placing environmentally clean natural gas to affordable
                           markets for sustainable growth.
                      3.   sales and market performance
                           your company which has an expanse of around 96,000 square kilometres of licensed area under its umbrella and continues to
                           hold the leadership position of being the largest city gas distribution company in the country catering to more than 11.6 lakh
                           residential consumers, over 12,750 commercial customers, dispensing cng from 252 operational cng stations for vehicular
                           consumers and providing clean energy solutions to over 3,050 industrial units through its wide spread operations with around
                           20,000 kilometres of natural gas pipeline network.

                           manufacturers, which benefited from lower input costs. however, healthy growth in manufacturing value added is at odds with

                           the consumption dampened and deferred in the second half of fy2016 due to the cash crunch, will resurface in fy2017 and lift
                           consumption growth in the country. the increase in central government capital expenditure targeted in the fy2017 budget
                           augurs well for public investment. the union budget continues to prioritize infrastructure and rural development with higher
                           outlay on roads and highways, electric power, affordable housing, among others. the growth is projected to pick up to 7.4% -
                           7.6% in fy2017-2018, owing to improved consumption, public and private investment which is expected bears fruits. the
                           implementation of a new goods and services tax beginning in july 2017 should lower prices for capital goods, providing impetus
                           to investment. this coupled with various initiatives in the natural gas sector as mentioned in earlier sections is expected to
                           propel growth for the business going forward.

                           base from about one-third of the global average in the per capita consumption. the economy which is evenly poised for growth
                           at over and above 7% in the coming fiscals would also correspondingly increase the energy demand thereto. government of
                           india is aggressive in pushing the usage of clean and green natural gas across sectors with special focus to the growth of png in
                           the household and cng for vehicles. this shall lead to impending development of robust downstream gas distribution
                           infrastructure in the country.

                      the company’s board of directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the companies act, 2013 (“the act”)
                      with respect to the preparation of these standalone ind as financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position,
                      financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the company in accordance with
                      the accounting principles generally accepted in india, including the indian accounting standards (ind as) specified under section 133

                      and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                      auditor’s responsibility
                      our responsibility is to express an opinion on these standalone ind as financial statements based on our audit. we have taken into
                      account the provisions of the act, the accounting and auditing standards and matters which are required to be included in the audit
                      report under the provisions of the act and the rules made thereunder.
                      we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards on auditing specified under section 143(10) of the act. those standards
                      require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
                      standalone ind as financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                      an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the standalone ind as
                      financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
                      misstatement of the standalone ind as financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the
                      auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the company’s preparation of the standalone ind as financial statements that
                      give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. an audit also includes

                      company’s directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone ind as financial statements.
                      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
                      standalone ind as financial statements.

                              parties covered in the register maintained under section 189 of the act. therefore, the provisions of clause 3 (iii) [(a) to (c)] of

                      management’s responsibility for internal financial controls
                      the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control
                      over financial reporting criteria established by the company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the
                      guidance note on audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting issued by the institute of chartered accountants of
                      india (‘icai’). these responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that

                      the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
                      records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the companies act, 2013.
                      auditor’s responsibility
                      our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. we
                      conducted our audit in accordance with the guidance note on audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting (the
                      “guidance note”) and the standards on auditing, issued by icai and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the
                      companies act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial
                      controls and, both issued by the institute of chartered accountants of india. those standards and the guidance note require that we
                      comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal
                      financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material
                      respects.
                      our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial
                      reporting and their operating effectiveness. our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an
                      understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
                      evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. the procedures selected depend on
                      the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
                      fraud or error.
                      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
                      company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting.

                      inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting
                      because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
                      improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. also,
                      projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
                      internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
                      compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
                      opinion
                      in our opinion, the company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and
                      such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st march 2017, based on the internal control
                      over financial reporting criteria established by the company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the
                      guidance note on audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting issued by the institute of chartered accountants of
                      india.

                            (ii) historical cost convention
                            the financial statements are prepared on accrual basis of accounting under historical cost convention, except for the following:
                            =    certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value;
                            =    defined benefit plans - plan assets measured at fair value; and
                            =    share based payments
                            use of estimates and judgements
                            the presentation of the financial statements are in conformity with the ind as which requires the management to make
                             estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and
                             disclosure of contingent liabilities. such estimates and assumptions are based on management's evaluation of relevant facts
                             and circumstances as on the date of financial statements. the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
                            estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to the accounting estimates are recognised
                             in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
                            this note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are
                             more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally
                             assessed. detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with
                             information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.
                            information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment
                             within the next financial year are included in the following notes:

                            cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost for bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended
                            use; like freight, duties, taxes and other incidental expenses, net of cenvat recoverable.
                            the company capitalises to project assets all the cost directly attributable and ascertainable, to completing the project. these
                            costs include expenditure of pipelines, plant and machinery, cost of laying of pipeline, cost of survey, commissioning and testing
                            charge, detailed engineering and interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of such assets. the gas distribution
                            networks are treated as commissioned when supply of gas commences to the customer(s).
                            subsequent expenditures, including replacement costs where applicable, incurred for an item property plant and equipment are
                            added to its books value only if they increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed
                            standard of performance and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. the carrying amount of any component accounted
                            for as a separate asset is de-recognised when replaced. all other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during
                            the reporting period in which they are incurred.
                            component accounting of assets: if significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,
                            then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. the company has
                            identified, reviewed, tested and determined the componentisation of the significant assets.
                            assets installed at customer premises, including meters and regulators where applicable, are recognised as property plant and
                            equipment if they meet the definition provided under ind as 16 subject to materiality as determined by the management and

                            future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset
                            (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is charged to revenue in
                            the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
                            the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the
                            asset.

                            subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits
                            associated with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and
                            maintenance costs are expensed as and when incurred. when part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount
                            of the replaced part is derecognised.

                            computed using straight line method (slm) over the useful lives of the assets as specified in schedule ii to the companies act,
                            2013, read with the following notes:
                            i.    the schedule specifies useful life of pipelines as 30 years for those used in exploration, production and refining of oil and
                                  gas. the company has considered the useful life of 30 years for th pipelines used in city gas distribution business.
                            ii.   city gas stations, skids, pressure regulating stations, meters and regulators are estimated to have useful life of 18 years
                                  based on technical assessment made by technical expert and management.
                            iii. cost of mobile phones, are expensed off in the year of purchase.
                            the management believes that these useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets
                            are likely to be used. the useful lives are reviewed by the management at each financial year end and revised, if appropriate. in
                            case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount (remaining net value of assets) is charged over the revised remaining
                            useful lives.
                            based on management estimate, residual value of 5% is considered for respective tangible assets except for the pipeline
                            network assets where the residual value is considered to be nil as the said assets technically and commercial not feasible to
                            extract from underground.

                            the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment (ppe) are reviewed at the end of
                            each financial year and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
                            component accounting of assets: if significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,
                            then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment and accordingly
                            depreciated at the useful lives specified as above.
                            depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment acquired / disposed off during the year is provided on pro-rata basis
                            with reference to the date of addition / disposal.

                            intangible assets are amortized over their individual estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, commencing from the year in
                            which the same are available to the company for its intended use. the useful lives as estimated by the management for the
                            intangible assets are as follows:
                            i.    right of way (row) permissions                        30 years
                                  (considered more than 10 years as inextricably linked and dependent on the useful life of pipeline networks as referred
                                  above for which the right of way has been obtained).
                            ii.   software                                               6 years.
                            cost of lease-hold land is amortized equally over the period of lease.
                            no amortisation is charged on right of use (rou) of land being perpetual in nature. the same is tested for impairment based on
                            principles of ind as 36 discussed subsequently.
                            the company has constructed / installed cng stations' buildings and machineries, on land taken on lease from various lessor
                            under lease deed for periods ranging from 35 years to 99 years. however, assets constructed / installed on such land have been
                            depreciated at useful lives as referred above, as the management does not foresee non-renewal of the above lease
                            arrangements by the lessor.
                            capital assets /facilities installed at the customers’ premises on the land of the customers/cng franchisee whose ownership is
                            not with the company have been depreciated at the useful lives specified as above.
                      (e)   impairment of non-financial assets
                            in accordance with ind as 36 on “impairment of assets” at the balance sheet date, non-financial assets are reviewed for
                            impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
                            for the purpose of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing
                            use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, is considered as a cash generating
                            unit. if any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset/cash generating unit is made. assets
                            whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount are written down to the recoverable amount. recoverable amount is
                            higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use. assessment is also done at each balance sheet
                            date as to whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized for an asset in prior accounting periods may no
                            longer exist or may have decreased.
                            impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and
                            loss, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income (oci). for
                            such properties, the impairment is recognised in oci up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus.
                      (f)   revenue recognition
                            revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. the company recognises revenue when the
                            amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and no
                            significant uncertainty exists regarding the amount of consideration that will be derived from the sale of goods /services and
                            regarding its collection. the company bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer,
                            the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
                            sale of natural gas is recognized on supply of gas to customers by metered/assessed measurements as no significant
                            uncertainty exists regarding the measurability or collectability of the sale consideration. sales are billed bi-monthly for
                            domestic customers, monthly/fortnightly for commercial and non-commercial customers and fortnightly for industrial
                            customers as the timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the sales agreement.
                            revenue on sale of compressed natural gas (cng) is recognized on sale of gas to consumers from retail outlets.
                            the amount recognised as revenue is stated inclusive of excise duty and exclusive of sales tax /value added tax (vat) and
                            service tax and is net of trade discounts or quantity discounts.
                            unbilled revenue is recognised as the related supply of natural gas are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing
                            cycle to the balance sheet date.

                            gas transmission income is recognized in the same period in which the related volumes of gas are delivered to the customers.
                            commitments (take or pay charges) income from customers for gas sales and gas transmission is recognized on establishment
                            of certainty of receipt of consideration from its customers.
                            the amounts charged from customers for initial gas connections are accounted based on the terms of the underlying contract
                            with customers when the performance obligation is satisfied. the performance obligation is considered to be satisfied on
                            completion of the connection which is separate from supply of gas. such revenue is accounted as connection, service and
                            fitting income under other operating revenue.
  80                        the amounts collected towards connection charges from certain domestic customers are “non-refundable charges”.

                                                                                                                                               2016-2017
                                                                                                                                           th
                                                                                                                                         5 annual report

                            accordingly, the same are recognized as revenue as and when the company commences the supply of gas to the customers
                            and such amount is charged to customers. until then, the amounts so collected are shown as “advances received from
                            customers” in the balance sheet. the company has provided the instalments facility to certain domestic customers towards
                            “connection charges” which are non-refundable, the total amount of such instalments are recognized as revenue as and when
                            the company commences the supply of gas to the customers.
                            the amounts collected from certain domestic customers which includes amount “refundable” in nature. accordingly, the same
                            are recognized as a liability under head “deposit from customers” in the balance sheet.
                            revenue in respect of interest/ late payment charges on delayed realizations from customers and cheque bounce charges, if
                            any, is recognized on grounds of prudence and on the basis of certainty of collection.
                            liquidated damages, if any are recognized at the time of recording the purchase of materials in books of accounts and the
                            matter is considered settled by the management.
                            interest income is recognized on time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicable.
                            dividend income is recognised, when the right to receive the dividend is established by the reporting date.
                            investment property rental income is recognised as revenue on accrual basis as per the terms of the underlying contract with
                            customers.
                            other operating income and misc. income are accounted on accrual basis as and when the right to receive arises.
                      (g)   borrowing
                            borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. borrowings –interest bearing loans are
                            subsequently measured at amortised cost by using the effective interest method (eir method). any difference between the
                            proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of borrowing
                            using the effective interest method (eir). the eir amortization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
                            fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of loan to the extent that it is probable that
                            some or all the facility will be draw down. in this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. to the extent there is no
                            evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is deferred as a payment for liquidity
                            services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
                            borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or
                            expired. the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another
                            party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss
                            as other income or other expenses as well as through the eir amortization process.
                            borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability
                            for at least 12 months after the reporting period. where there is a breach of a material provision of a long term loan arrangement
                            on or before the end of reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the
                            company does not classify the liability as current, if the lender agreed, after the reporting period and before the approval of the
                            financial statement for issue, not to demand payment as a consequence of the breach.
                      (h)   borrowing cost
                            the company is capitalising general and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or
                            construction of qualifying asset up to the date of commissioning. qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a
                            substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. the expenses incurred in connection with the arrangement
                            of specific borrowings are capitalized over the period of the borrowing and every year such cost is apportioned to assets based
                            on the actual amount borrowed during the year. all other borrowing costs are recognized as expense in the period in which they
                            are incurred and charged to the statement of profit and loss.
                            investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is
                            deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

                      financial asset
                      initial recognition
                      a financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet only when, the company becomes party to the
                      contractual provisions of the instrument.
                      initial measurement
                      at initial recognition, the company measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a
                      financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
                      acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
                      subsequent measurement
                      for purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into:
                      =   financial assets measured at amortised cost;
                      =   financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); and
                      =   financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvtoci).
                      the company classifies its financial assets in the above mentioned categories based on:
                      =   the company’s business model for managing the financial assets, and
                      =   the contractual cash flows characteristics of the financial asset.
                      a financial assets is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
                      =   the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual
                          cash flows and
                      =   the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                          and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
                          financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method. amortised
                          cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part
                          of the eir. the eir amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. the losses arising from impairment are
                          recognised in the profit or loss.
                      a financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:
                      =   the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting the contractual cash
                          flows and selling financial assets and
                      =   the assets contractual cash flows represent sppi.
                      a financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through
                      other comprehensive income. in addition, the company may elect to designate a financial asset, which otherwise meets
                      amortized cost or fvtoci criteria, as at fvtpl. however, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a
                      measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).
                      equity investments:
                      all equity investments in scope of ind as 109 are measured at fair value. equity instruments which are held for trading are
                      classified as at fvtpl. for all other equity instruments, the company may make an irrevocable election to present in other
                      comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. the company makes such election on an instrument by-
                      instrument basis. the classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
                      if the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding
                      dividends, are recognized in the oci. there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to statement of profit and loss, even on sale

                      of investment. however, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. equity instruments included
                      within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the profit and loss.
                      de-recognition
                      a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily
                      derecognised (i.e. removed from the company's balance sheet) when:
                      1. the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired, or
                      2. the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the
  82                     received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either

                                                                                                                                      2016-2017
                                                                                                                                  th
                                                                                                                                5 annual report

                          i)    the company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
                          ii)   the company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has
                                transferred control of the asset.
                      when the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
                      arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. when it has neither
                      transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the company
                      continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the company’s continuing involvement. in that case, the company
                      also recognises an associated liability. the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects
                      the rights and obligations that the company has retained.
                      continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original
                      carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the company could be required to repay.
                      embedded foreign currency derivative
                      embedded foreign currency derivatives are not separated from the host contract if they are closely related. such embedded
                      derivatives are closely related to the host contract, if the host contract is not leveraged, does not contain any option feature and
                      requires payments in one of the following currencies:
                      =   the functional currency of any substantial party to that contract,
                      =   the currency in which the price of the related good or service that is acquired or delivered is routinely denominated in
                          commercial transactions around the world,
                      =   a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in
                          which the transaction takes place (i.e. relatively liquid and stable currency).
                      foreign currency embedded derivatives which do not meet the above criteria are separated and the derivative is accounted for
                      at fair value through profit and loss. the company currently does not have any such derivatives which are not closely related.
                      impairment of financial assets
                      the company assesses impairment based on expected credit loss (ecl) model to the following:
                      =   financial assets measured at amortised cost
                      =   financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
                      expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
                      =   the 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial
                          instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or
                      =   full time expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the
                          financial instrument).
                      the company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables or contract
                      revenue receivables. under the simplified approach, the company is not required to track changes in credit risk. rather, it
                      recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls together with appropriate management estimates for credit loss
                      at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
                      the company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. the
                      provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted
                      for forward looking estimates. at every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the
                      forward-looking estimates are analysed.
                      ecl impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of
                      profit and loss. this amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit and loss. the balance sheet

                      presentation for various financial instruments is described below:
                      =   financial assets measured as at amortised cost and contractual revenue receivables - ecl is presented as an allowance, i.e.,
                          as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. the allowance reduces the net carrying
                          amount. until the asset meets write-off criteria, the company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross
                          carrying amount.
                      =   financial assets measured at fvtoci - since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance is not
                          further reduced from its value. rather, ecl amount is presented as accumulated impairment amount in the oci.

                            for assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the company combines financial instruments on the basis of shared
                            credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit
                            risk to be identified on a timely basis.
                            the company does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (poci) financial assets, i.e., financial assets which are
                            credit impaired on purchase/ origination.
                            financial liabilities
                            initial recognition and measurement
                            financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
                            borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
                            all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly
                            attributable transaction costs.
                            the company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loan and borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial
                            guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.
                            subsequent measurement
                            =   financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
                            =   financial liabilities subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss
                            financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated
                            upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are
                            incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the
                            profit or loss.
                            financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date
                            of recognition, and only if the criteria in ind as 109 are satisfied. for liabilities designated as fvtpl, fair value gains/ losses
                            attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in oci. these gains / loss are not subsequently transferred to profit
                            and loss. however, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. all other changes in fair value of such
                            liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. the company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value
                            through profit and loss.
                            financial guarantee contracts
                            financial guarantee contracts issued by the company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the
                            holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt
                            instrument. financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that
                            are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of
                            loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of ind as 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative
                            amortisation.
                            loan and borrowings
                            after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
                            effective interest rate (eir) method. gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as
                            well as through the eir amortisation process. amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
                            acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir amortisation is included as finance costs in the
                            statement of profit and loss.
                            derecognition
                            a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. when an existing
                            financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability
gujarat gas limited




                            are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the
                            recognition of a new liability. the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
                      (k)   offsetting financial instruments
                            financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable
                            right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability
                            simultaneously. the legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal
                            course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the group or the counterparty.

                      (l)   fair value measurement
                            the company measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
                            fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
                            market participants at the measurement date. the fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to
                            sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
                            =   in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
                            =   in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
                            the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the company. the fair value of an asset or a liability is
                            measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market
                            participants act in their economic best interest.
                            the company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
                            measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
                            all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair
                            value hierarchy, described as under, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
                            =   level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
                            =   level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or
                                indirectly observable.
                            =   level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
                                unobservable.
                            for assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the company determines whether
                            transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
                            significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
                            the company's management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as
                            unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in
                            discontinued operations. the management comprises of the managing director / chief executive officer and chief financial
                            officer.
                            external valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets. involvement of external
                            valuers is decided upon annually by the valuation committee after discussion with and approval by the management. selection
                            criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. valuers are
                            normally rotated every three years. the management decides, after discussions with the company's external valuers, which
                            valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.
                            at each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be
                            re-measured or re-assessed as per the company’s accounting policies. for this analysis, the management verifies the major
                            inputs applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation.
                            the management, in conjunction with the company's external valuers, also compares the change in the fair value of each asset
                            and liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.
                            for the purpose of fair value disclosures, the company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,
                            characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
                            this note summarises accounting policy for fair value. other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. (refer

                      (n)   non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation
                            non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale
                            transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. they are measured at the lower of their
                            carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee
                            benefits, financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this
                            requirement.
                            an impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. a gain is
                            recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative
                            impairment loss previously recognised. a gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset
                            (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.
                            non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. non-current assets classified as
                            held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet.
                            a discontinued operation is a component of the company that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that
                            represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose
                            of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. the results of
                            discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit and loss.

                            specified in an arrangement.

                            the inception of the lease. the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings or other
                            financial liabilities as appropriate. the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the
                            interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine. if not, the company’s incremental borrowing rate is used.

                            balance of the liability for each period.

                            deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
                            future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
                      (s)   earnings per share
                            basic earnings per share
                            basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the company by the weighted average
                            number of equity shares outstanding during the period. earnings considered in ascertaining the company's earnings per share is
                            the net profit for the period after deducting preference dividends, if any, and any attributable distribution tax thereto for the
                            period.
                            diluted earnings per share
                            diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the
                            after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares and the weighted
                            average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential
                            equity shares.
                      (t)   provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
                            provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
                            probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
                            estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. provision for contractual obligation is disclosed based on management's
                            assessment of the probable outcome with reference to the available information supplemented by experience of similar
                            transactions. when the company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a
                            separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. the expense relating to a provision is presented in the
                            statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
                            provision in respect of loss contingencies relating to claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties etc. are recognised when it is
                            probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated reliably.
                            provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. provisions for restructuring are recognised by the company when it
                            has developed a detailed formal plan for restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that the company will carry out the
                            restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
                            where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
                            considering the class of obligations as a whole. a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
                            one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
                            provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end
                            of the reporting period and are not discounted to present value. the estimates of outcome and financial effect are determined
                            by the judgment of the management, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from
                            independent experts.
                            the measurement of provision for restructuring includes only direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are both
                            necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the company.

                            contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
                            1. a present obligation arising from the past events, when it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
                               settle the obligation;
                            2. a present obligation arising from the past events, when no reliable estimate is possible;
                            3. a possible obligation arising from the past events, unless the probability of outflow of resources is remote.
                            contingent liabilities are not provided for and if material, are disclosed by way of notes to financial statements.
                            a contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
  89                        occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.

                                                                                                                                            2016-2017

                                                                                                                                      5 annual report

                            contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never
                            be realised. however, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits
                            will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.
                            a contingent asset is disclosed by way of notes to financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
                            provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

                            gail & others, civil appeal no. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the hon’ble supreme court of india had passed the interim order
                            on 28th february 2014. the court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the
                            appellant is directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of rs. 12.00 per mmbtu (exclusive of taxes). the company
                            has already provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of rs. 12.00 per mmbtu (exclusive of taxes).

                            use of gas against demand in earlier years. the company has refuted this erroneous claim contending that no contractual
                            provisions of the agreement executed with ggl allow such claim. the management is of the firm view that the company is not
                            liable to pay any such claim. the company has already taken up the matter with concerned party/authorities to withdraw the
                            claim.

                      level 1: level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. this includes mutual funds that have quoted
                                price. the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav.
                      level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the counter
                                derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as
                                possible on entity-specific estimates. if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the
                                instrument is included in level 2.
                      level 3: if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. this is the
                                case for unlisted equity securities included in level 3.

                      market comparison technique: the valuation model            comparable unobservable entity       the estimated fair value would
                      is based on three approaches :-                             has been taken as a base for the     increase (decrease) if:
                      1. market approach : this approach uses information         valuation of unquoted equity         there is a change in pricing
                          generated by market transactions of the company         shares and its management's          multiple owing to change in
                          being valued or the transactions of comparable          own assumptions for arriving at a    earnings of the entity.
                          companies. the following market-linked                  fair value such as projected cash    considering the diverse asset and
                          information may be used for determining valuation       flows used to value a business       investment base of the company
                          under this approach.                                    etc.                                 with differing risk/return profiles,
                      = quoted price of the company being valued,                 as stated , highest priority is      a sum of the parts approach has
                      = past transaction value of the company being valued,       given to unadjusted quoted price     been adopted for the valuation.
                      = listed comparable companies' trading multiples like       of listed entities andlowest         under this method, the value of

                          before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation,    inputs such as future cash flows     investment has been arrived at

                          transaction of comparable companies.the valuation                                            presented as the sum of all its
                          arrived at based on the market approach reflects                                             business / investments /assets.
                          the current value of the company perceived in the
                          active market. however, as the valuation arrived at
                          using market multiples is based on the past/current
                          transaction or traded values of comparable
                          companies/businesses, it may not reflect the
                          possible changes in future trend of cash flows being
                          generated by a business.
                      2. income approach : the income approach reflects
                          present value of future cash flows. for valuing a
                          business, the discounted cash flow (dcf)
                          methodology is used under this approach. this
                          methodology works on the premise that the value
                          of a business is measured in terms of future cash
                          flow streams, discounted to the present time at an
                          appropriate discount rate. this method is used to
                          determine the present value of business on a going
                          concern assumption. the dcf technique recognizes
                          the time value of money.
                          the value of the firm is arrived at by estimating the
                          free cash flow to firm (fcff) and discounting the
                          same at the weighted average cost of capital
                          (wacc). fcff is estimated by forecasting free cash

                          flows available to the firm (which are derived on the
                          basis of the likely future earnings of the company).
                      3. cost approach : the cost approach essentially
                          estimates the cost of replacing the tangible assets
                          of the business. the replacement cost takes into
                          account the market value of various assets or the
                          expenditure required to create the infrastructure
                          exactly similar to that of a company being valued.

                           contractual obligations, and arises principally from the company's receivables from customers and investments in debt
                           securities.
                           the carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
                      (a) other financial assets
                           the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits with banks having good reputation, good past track
                           record and high quality credit rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis.
                      (b) trade and other receivables
                           the company's exposure to credit risk is the exposure that company has on account of goods sold or services rendered to a
                           contractual counterparty or counterparties, whether with collateral or otherwise for which the contracted consideration is yet
                           to be received. the company's customer base are industrial, commercial-non commercial, domestic and cng.
                           the commercial and marketing department has established a credit policy for each category of customer viz. industrial,
                           domestic and commercial.
                           the company raises the invoice for quantities sold based on periodicity as per the agreement. sales are subject to security
                           deposit and/or bank guarantee clauses to ensure that in the event of non-payment the company's receivables are secured.
                           for sales to domestic customers for household purposes like cooking, geyser application, etc., invoices are raised periodically.
                           security deposits along with connection deposits are taken for mitigation of potential credit risk arising in the event of non-
                           payment of invoices.
                           cng sales made through operators of the cng stations owned by the company and cng franchises outlet are exposed to
                           credit risk as amounts so collected is deposited/transferred in company bank account on next working day. bank guarantee /
                           security deposit is taken to mitigate the credit risk. for cng sales made through oil marketing companies (omcs), the
                           company raises the invoice for quantities sold based on periodicity as per the agreement. the omcs are well established
                           companies viz. hpcl, bpcl, ioc, essar oil ltd. where no significant credit risk is anticipated.
                           the company provides for allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and
                           other receivables.
                           a default on a financial asset is when the counter party fails to make contractual payment within 180 days of when they fall due.
                           this definition of default is determine by considering the business environment in which the company operates and other
                           macro economic factors.
                           assets are written off when there are no reasonable expectation of recovery such as debtor declaring bankruptcy or failing to
                           engage in a repayment plan with group. where receivables have been written off the company continues to engage in
                           enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables. where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit and loss.

                              interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. fair value interest rate risk is the risk
                              of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. cash flow
                              interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will fluctuate because of
                              fluctuations in the interest rates.
                              on period under review the company do not have any borrowings at fixed rate and has not entered into interest rate swaps

                      sensitivity analysis
                      profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest expense from borrowings as a result of change in interest rates.
                      the company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the
                      company does not have any designate derivatives (interest rate swaps) . therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date
                      would not affect profit or loss.

                           the exercise price is calculated at 10% discount to the closing price of the shares on record date, being the date on which the
                           grant of options were approved as per esop 2008. the graded vesting of options granted, over a period of 4 years from the
                           date of grant is as follows:

                       % of option vested                cumulative          vesting date
                       25%                               25%                 on expiry of two years from their grant date (“first vesting date’)

                      best available market price, in which event the difference between the net price realized on sale after taxes and charges and the
                      exercise price will accrue as gains to the employee.

                      (i)    entity’s responsibilities for the governance of the plan
                             risk to the plan
                             following are the risk to which the plan exposes the entity :
                             a actuarial risk:
                                 it is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. this can arise due to one of the following reasons:adverse salary
                                 growth experience: salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result into an increase in obligation
                                 at a rate that is higher than expected. variability in mortality rates: if actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality
                                 rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected. since there is no condition of vesting on the
                                 death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on the relative values of the
                                 assumed salary growth and discount rate. variability in withdrawal rates: if actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed
                                 withdrawal rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected. the impact of this will depend on
                                 whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date.
                             b investment risk:
                                 for funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the insurer may not be the fair
                                 value of instruments backing the liability. in such cases, the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount
                                 rate. this can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount
                                 rate during the inter-valuation period.
                             c liquidity risk:
                                 employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate significant level of benefits. if some
                                 of such employees resign / retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows.
                             d market risk:
                                 market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial markets. one
                                 actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. the discount rate reflects the time value of money. an
                                 increase in discount rate leads to decrease in defined benefit obligation of the plan benefits & vice versa. this assumption
                                 depends on the yields on the corporate / government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in
                                 the yields as at the valuation date.
                             e legislative risk:
                                 legislative risk is the risk of increase in the plan liabilities or reduction in the plan assets due to change in the legislation /
                                 regulation. the government may amend the payment of gratuity act thus requiring the companies to pay higher benefits to
                                 the employees. this will directly affect the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the same will have to be
                                 recognized immediately in the year when any such amendment is effective.
                      (ii)   the company has participated in group gratuity scheme plan with life insurance corporation of india (lic), reliance & hdfc life
                             insurance co. ltd through gratuity trust to meet its gratuity liability. the present value of the plan assets represents the balance
                             available at the end of the year. the total value of plan assets is as certified by the lic, reliance & hdfc life insurance co. ltd.

                             (b) the trustees of the plan have outsourced the investment management of the fund to an insurance company. the insurance
                                 company in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is
                                 within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. due to the restrictions in the type of investments that
                                 can be held by the fund, it may not be possible to explicitly follow an asset-liability matching strategy to manage risk actively
                                 in a conventional fund.

                           party to the contract and the date a reassessment is required by ind as 109 when there is a change in the terms of the contract
                           that significantly modifies the cash flows. accordingly the company has applied this exception.

                           the same date in accordance with previous gaap (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless
                           there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error. ind as estimates as at 1 april 2015 are consistent with the
                           estimates as at the same date made in conformity with previous gaap. the company made estimates for following items in
                           accordance with ind as at the transition date as these were not required under previous gaap:

                           where these are impracticable to implement. classification and measurement is done on the basis of facts and circumstances
                           existing on the transition date. accordingly the company has determined classification of financial asset based on facts and
                           circumstances existing on the transition date.

                                                                                                                                        th
                                                                                                                                      5 annual report

                                   notes to standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                      footnotes to the above reconciliation are as under:
                      1)    investment property
                            under ind as, land and building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in production or
                           supply of goods and services or sale in the ordinary course of business are to be classified as investment property. under the
                           igaap, investment properties were presented as part of freehold land. the company has reclassified land valuing rs 1.30
                           crores as investment property. however, there is no impact on the total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment.
                      2)    own your asset scheme (oyas)
                            under igaap, assets given to employees under oyas scheme were reflected as fixed assets and depreciated over their respective
                           useful lives. under ind as, this has been accounted as a finance lease and the wdv of the underlying assets has been derecognised.
                           the difference between the cost of the asset and present value of the consideration received in the future has been recognized as
                           an employee cost over the period. the consideration due from the employees over the period has been recognised as receivable.
                           consequently an amount of rs 0.39 crores has been derecognised from ppe on the transition date. the total equity of the
                           company reduced by rs 0.03 crore as on the transition date. the impact of reversal of the depreciation and the employee cost are
                           similar to each other for the year ended 31st march 2016, hence there is no significant impact on equity as on 31st march 2016.
                      3)    fair valuation of investments in mutual funds
                            under igaap, the company accounted for short term investments in mutual funds at cost . under ind as, the company has
                           designated such investments as fvtpl investments. carrying value of investments in mutual fund was rs. 936.99 crores as
                           per previous gaap on the date of transition. consequently the value of total equity on the transition date has increased by rs.
                           0.22 crores(net of tax) while the value of investment have increased by rs 0.34 crores.
                      4)    interest accrued but not due
                            under igaap, the company has invested in fixed deposits with the banks. the interest is accrued on the same at each reporting
                           date which is disclosed separately as interest accrued and due separate from the fixed deposit. under ind as, the fixed deposits
                           are to be reported at amortised cost. accordingly interest accrued but not due of rs 1.24 crores and rs. 2.76 crores as on the
                           transition date and 31st march 2016 respectively has been reclassified to respective fixed deposits. there is no impact on the
                           total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment.
                      5)   interest bearing loans and borrowings
                           under igaap, transaction costs incurred in connection with interest bearing loans and borrowings were charged to profit or
                           loss when incurred. under ind as, transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of financial liability and
                           charged to profit or loss using the eir method. accordingly the total equity increased by rs 1.57 crores on the transition date
                           and rs 0.64 crores on 31st march 2016. the profit for the year ended 31st march 2016 reduced by rs 0.93 crores as a result
                           of additional interest expense.
                      6)   proposed dividend and tax thereon
                           under igaap, dividends proposed by the board of directors after the balance sheet date but before the approval of the
                           financial statements were considered as adjusting events. accordingly, provision for proposed dividend was recognised as a
                           liability. under ind as, such dividends are recognised when the same is approved by the shareholders in the general meeting.
                           accordingly the liability proposed dividend of rs 41.43 as at 31 march 2016 and rs 82.85 as on the transition date included
                           under provisions has been reversed with corresponding adjustment to retained earnings. consequently, the total equity
                           increased by an equivalent amount.
                      7)   fvtoci financial assets
                           under igaap, the company accounted for long term investments in unquoted and quoted equity shares as investment
                           measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. under ind as, the company
                           has designated such investments as fvtoci investments. at the transition date , difference between the fair value and igaap
                           carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, net of related deferred taxes. this has resulted in a
                           decrease in total equity by rs 31.97 crores on 31 march 2016 (net of tax).
                      8)   accounting for excise duty on sale of goods
                           under igaap, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. however, under ind as, sale of goods includes excise duty
                           which is considered as an expense. thus sale of goods for the financial year 2015-16 under ind as has increased by rs. 139.90
                           crores with a corresponding increase in other expense. this adjustment has no impact on the total equity on the transition date
                           as well as 31 march 2016.
                      9)   employee benefits

                           under ind as, remeasurements i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in the
                           net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability are recognised in other comprehensive income instead of profit or loss.
                           under igaap, these remeasurements were forming part of the profit or loss for the year. this adjustment has no impact on the
                           total equity on the transition date as well as 31 march 2016.
                      10) deferred tax assets (net)
                           igaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach, which focuses on differences between taxable

                      consolidated ind as financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017)
                      report on the internal financial controls under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of section 143 of the companies act, 2013
                      (“the act”)
                      in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the company as of and for the year ended 31st march 2017,
                      we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of gujarat gas limited (formerly known as gspc distribution
                      networks limited) (“the holding company”) and its associate company, guj info petro limited (gipl) which is company
                      incorporated in india, as of that date.
                      management’s responsibility for internal financial controls
                      the respective board of directors of the holding company and its associate company, which is company incorporated in india, are
                      responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria
                      established by the company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the guidance note on audit of
                      internal financial controls over financial reporting issued by the institute of chartered accountants of india (“icai’’). these
                      responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
                      effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies, the
                      safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
                      records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the companies act, 2013.
                      auditor’s responsibility
                      our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. we
                      conducted our audit in accordance with the guidance note on audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting (the
                      “guidance note”) issued by icai and the standards on auditing, issued by icai and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of
                      the companies act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the institute of chartered
                      accountants of india. those standards and the guidance note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform
                      the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established
                      and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
                      our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial
                      reporting and their operating effectiveness. our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an
                      understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
                      evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. the procedures selected depend on
                      the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
                      fraud or error.
                      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditor in terms of their report
                      referred to in the other matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
                      company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
                      meaning of internal financial controls over financial reporting
                      a company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
                      reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
gujarat gas limited




                      accepted accounting principles. a company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
                      that
                            (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
                                dispositions of the assets of the company;
                            (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
                                accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
                                made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
                            (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of

                                the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

                                                                                                                                         th
                                                                                                                                       5 annual report

                                                                  independent auditor’s report

                      inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting
                      because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
                      improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. also,
                      projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
                      internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
                      compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
                      opinion
                      in our opinion, the holding company and its associate company, which is company incorporated in india, have, in all material respects,
                      an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting
                      were operating effectively as at 31st march 2017, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the
                      company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the guidance note on audit of internal financial controls
                      over financial reporting issued by the icai.
                      other matters
                      our aforesaid report under section 143(3)(i) of the act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls
                      over financial reporting insofar as it relates to its associate company, which is a company incorporated in india, is based on the
                      corresponding report of the auditor of such company incorporated in india.

                      subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. the group controls an entity when
                      the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those
                      returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity. subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on
                      which control is transferred to the group. they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
                      the group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets,
                      liabilities, equity, income and expenses. intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between
                      group companies are eliminated. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
                      impairment of the transferred asset. accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned where necessary.
                      associates
                      investment in associate has been accounted for using equity method in accordance with ind as 28 - investments in associates
                      and joint ventures. under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted
                      thereafter to recognise the group’s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the
                      group’s share of other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. dividends received or receivable
                      from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.
                      any excess / short of the amount of investment in an associate over the cost of acquisition at the date of investment is
                      considered as capital reserve and has been included in carrying amount of investment and disclosed separately. the carrying
                      amount of investment is adjusted thereafter for the post acquisition changes in the share of net asset of associate.
                      when the group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any
                      other unsecured long-term receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made
                      payments on behalf of the other entity.
                      unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in
                      these entities. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
                      transferred. accounting policies of equity accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency
                      with the policies adopted by the group.
                      the financial statements of associates are prepared up to the same reporting date as that of the company i.e. 31st march 2017
                      for the current year, 31st match 2016 for the comparative year and 1st april 2015 for the transition date.

                      use of estimates and judgements
                      the presentation of the financial statements are in conformity with the ind as which requires the management to make
                      estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and
                      disclosure of contingent liabilities. such estimates and assumptions are based on management's evaluation of relevant facts
                      and circumstances as on the date of financial statements. the actual outcome may differ from these estimates.
                      estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to the accounting estimates are recognised
                      in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

                            more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally
                            assessed. detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with
                            information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.
                            information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment
                            within the next financial year are included in the following notes:

                      (a)   property, plant and equipment
                            property plant and equipment are stated at their cost of acquisition / construction less depreciation and impairment, if any. the
                            cost comprises of the purchase price and any attributable cost for bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended
                            use; like freight, duties, taxes and other incidental expenses, net of cenvat recoverable.
                            the group capitalises to project assets all the cost directly attributable and ascertainable, to completing the project. these
                            costs include expenditure of pipelines, plant and machinery, cost of laying of pipeline, cost of survey, commissioning and testing
                            charge, detailed engineering and interest on borrowings attributable to acquisition of such assets. the gas distribution
                            networks are treated as commissioned when supply of gas commences to the customer(s).
                            subsequent expenditures, including replacement costs where applicable, incurred for an item property plant and equipment are
                            added to its books value only if they increase the future benefits from the existing asset beyond its previously assessed
                            standard of performance and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. the carrying amount of any component accounted
                            for as a separate asset is de-recognised when replaced. all other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during
                            the reporting period in which they are incurred.
                            component accounting of assets: if significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,
                            then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. the group has identified,
                            reviewed, tested and determined the componentisation of the significant assets.
                            assets installed at customer premises, including meters and regulators where applicable, are recognised as property plant and
                            equipment if they meet the definition provided under ind as 16 subject to materiality as determined by the management and
                            followed consistently.
                            any item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no
                            future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset
                            (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is charged to revenue in
                            the income statement when the asset is derecognised.
                            the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the
                            asset.
                            capital work in progress:
                            capital work in progress includes expenditure incurred on assets, which are yet to be commissioned and capital inventory,
                            which comprises stock of capital items/construction materials at respective city gas network.
                            all the directly identifiable and ascertainable expenditure, incidental and related to construction incurred during the period of
                            construction on a project, till it is commissioned, is kept as capital work in progress (cwip) and after commissioning the same is
                            transferred / allocated to the respective “fixed assets”.

                            further, advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance sheet date are
                            classified as capital advances under other non- current assets.
                      (b)   investment properties
                            investment properties comprises of free hold or lease hold land that are held for rental yield and/or capital appreciation.
                            investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs.
                            subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits
                            associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and
                            maintenance costs are expensed as and when incurred. when part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount
153                         of the replaced part is derecognised.

                                                                                                                                            2016-2017

                      (c)   intangible assets
                            intangible assets include amount paid for obtaining the right of use (rou) of land, right of way (row) permissions for laying
                            the gas pipeline network and cost of developing software for internal use. the group capitalises software as intangible asset
                            where it is expected to provide future enduring economic benefits. cost associated with maintaining software programmes are
                            recognised as expenses as and when incurred.
                            on the acquisition of an undertaking, the difference between the purchase consideration and the value of the net assets
                            acquired is recognized as goodwill / reserve.
                            any item of intangible assets is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
                            disposal. any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the intangible asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal
                            proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset) is charged to revenue in the income statement when the intangible
                            asset is derecognised.
                      (d)   depreciation and amortisation methods, estimated useful lives and residual values
                            depreciation is calculated to systematically allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment, intangible asset and investment
                            property net of the estimated residual values over the estimated useful life. freehold land is not depreciated. depreciation is
                            computed using straight line method (slm) over the useful lives of the assets as specified in schedule ii to the companies act,
                            2013, read with the following notes:
                            i.     the schedule specifies useful life of pipelines as 30 years for those used in exploration, production and refining of oil and
                                   gas. the group has considered the useful life of 30 years for the pipelines used in city gas distribution business.
                            ii.    city gas stations, skids, pressure regulating stations, meters & regulators are estimated to have useful life of 18 years
                                   based on technical assessment made by technical expert and management.
                            iii.   cost of mobile phones, are expensed off in the year of purchase.
                            the management believes that these useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets
                            are likely to be used. the useful lives are reviewed by the management at each financial year end and revised, if appropriate. in
                            case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount (remaining net value of assets) is charged over the revised remaining
                            useful lives.
                            based on management estimate, residual value of 5% is considered for respective tangible assets except for the pipeline
                            network assets where the residual value is considered to be nil it is technically & commercially not feasible to extract from
                            underground.
                            the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment (ppe) are reviewed at the end of
                            each financial year and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.
                            component accounting of assets: if significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,
                            then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment and accordingly
                            depreciated at the useful lives specified as above.
                            depreciation on items of property, plant and equipment acquired / disposed off during the year is provided on pro-rata basis
                            with reference to the date of addition / disposal.
                            investment properties are depreciated based on the useful life prescribed in schedule ii to the companies act, 2013.
                            intangible assets are amortized over their individual estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, commencing from the year in
                            which the same are available to the group for its intended use. the useful lives as estimated by the management for the
                            intangible assets are as follows:
                                   i.    right of way (row) permissions             30 years
                                         (considered more than 10 years as inextricably linked and dependent on the useful life of pipeline networks as
                                         referred above for which the right of way has been obtained).

                                   ii.   software                                    6 years.
                            cost of lease-hold land is amortized equally over the period of lease.
                            no amortisation is charged on right of use (rou) of land being perpetual in nature. the same is tested for impairment based on
                            principles of ind as 36 discussed subsequently.

                            lease deed for periods ranging from 35 years to 99 years. however, assets constructed / installed on such land have been
                            depreciated at useful lives as referred above, as the management does not foresee non-renewal of the above lease

                            capital assets /facilities installed at the customers’ premises on the land of the customers/cng franchisee whose ownership is
                            not with the group have been depreciated at the useful lives specified as above.
                      (e)   impairment of non-financial assets
                            in accordance with ind as 36 - impairment of assets at the balance sheet date, non-financial assets are reviewed for
                             impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
                             for the purpose of assessing impairment, the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing
                             use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets, is considered as a cash generating
                             unit. if any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the asset/cash generating unit is made. assets
                             whose carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount are written down to the recoverable amount. recoverable amount is
                             higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s net selling price and its value in use. assessment is also done at each balance sheet
                             date as to whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognized for an asset in prior accounting periods may no
                             longer exist or may have decreased.
                            impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the statement of profit and
                             loss, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation surplus taken to other comprehensive income (oci). for
                             such properties, the impairment is recognised in oci up to the amount of any previous revaluation surplus.
                      (f)   revenue recognition
                            revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. the group recognises revenue when the amount
                            of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the group and no significant
                            uncertainty exists regarding the amount of consideration that will be derived from the sale of goods /services and regarding its
                            collection. the group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of
                            transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
                            sale of natural gas is recognized on supply of gas to customers by metered/assessed measurements as no significant
                            uncertainty exists regarding the measurability or collectability of the sale consideration. sales are billed bi-monthly for
                            domestic customers, monthly/fortnightly for commercial and non-commercial customers and fortnightly for industrial
                            customers as the timing of the transfer of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms of the sales agreement.
                            revenue on sale of compressed natural gas (cng) is recognized on sale of gas to consumers from retail outlets.
                            the amount recognised as revenue is stated inclusive of excise duty and exclusive of sales tax /value added tax (vat) and
                            service tax and is net of trade discounts or quantity discounts.
                            unbilled revenue is recognised as the related supply of natural gas are performed and revenue from the end of the last billing
                            cycle to the balance sheet date.
                            gas transmission income is recognized in the same period in which the related volumes of gas are delivered to the customers.
                            commitments (take or pay charges) income from customers for gas sales and gas transmission is recognized on establishment
                            of certainty of receipt of consideration from its customers.
                            the amounts charged from customers for initial gas connections are accounted based on the terms of the underlying contract
                            with customers when the performance obligation is satisfied. the performance obligation is considered to be satisfied on
                            completion of the connection which is separate from supply of gas. such revenue is accounted as connection, service and
                            fitting income under other operating revenue.
                            the amounts collected towards connection charges from certain domestic customers are “non-refundable charges”.
                            accordingly, the same are recognized as revenue as and when the group commences the supply of gas to the customers and
                            such amount is charged to customers. until then, the amounts so collected are shown as “advances received from customers”
                            in the balance sheet. the group has provided the instalments facility to certain domestic customers towards “connection
                            charges” which are non-refundable, the total amount of such instalments are recognized as revenue as and when the group
                            commences the supply of gas to the customers.

                            the amounts collected from certain domestic customers which includes amount “refundable” in nature. accordingly, the same
                            are recognized as a liability under head “deposit from customers” in the balance sheet.
                            revenue in respect of interest/ late payment charges on delayed realizations from customers and cheque bounce charges, if
                            any, is recognized on grounds of prudence and on the basis of certainty of collection.
                            liquidated damages, if any are recognized at the time of recording the purchase of materials in books of accounts and the
                            matter is considered settled by the management.

                                                                                                                                         5 annual report

                            dividend income is recognised, when the right to receive the dividend is established by the reporting date.
                            investment property rental income is recognised as revenue on accrual basis as per the terms of the underlying contract with
                            customers.
                            other operating income and misc. income are accounted on accrual basis as and when the right to receive arises.
                      (g)   borrowing
                            borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. borrowings –interest bearing loans are
                            subsequently measured at amortised cost by using the effective interest method (eir method). any difference between the
                            proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of borrowing
                            using the effective interest method (eir). the eir amortization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit & loss.
                            fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of loan to the extent that it is probable that
                            some or all the facility will be draw down. in this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. to the extent there is no
                            evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is deferred as a payment for liquidity
                            services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
                            borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or
                            expired. the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another
                            party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss
                            as other income or other expenses as well as through the eir amortization process.
                            borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for
                            at least 12 months after the reporting period. where there is a breach of a material provision of a long term loan arrangement on
                            or before the end of reporting period with the effect that the liability becomes payable on demand on the reporting date, the
                            group does not classify the liability as current, if the lender agreed, after the reporting period and before the approval of the
                            financial statement for issue, not to demand payment as a consequence of the breach.
                      (h)   borrowing cost
                            the group is capitalising general and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of
                            qualifying asset up to the date of commissioning. qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time
                            to get ready for their intended use or sale. the expenses incurred in connection with the arrangement of specific borrowings are
                            capitalized over the period of the borrowing and every year such cost is apportioned to assets based on the actual amount
                            borrowed during the year. all other borrowing costs are recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred and
                            charged to the statement of profit and loss.
                            investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is
                            deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
                      (i)   financial instruments
                            a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument
                            of another entity.
                            financial asset
                            initial recognition
                            a financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet only when, the group becomes party to the contractual
                            provisions of the instrument.
                            initial measurement
                            at initial recognition, the group measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a
                            financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the
                            acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.

                            subsequent measurement
                            for purpose of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into:
                                 =    financial assets measured at amortised cost;
                                 =    financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl); and
                                 =    financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvtoci).
                            the group classifies its financial assets in the above mentioned categories based on:
156                              =    the group’s business model for managing the financial assets, and

                                                                                                                                        2016-2017
                                                                                                                                    th
                                                                                                                                  5 annual report

                           =     the contractual cash flows characteristics of the financial asset.
                      a financial assets is measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:
                           =     the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect
                                 contractual cash flows and
                           =     the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
                                 principal and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
                      financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method. amortised cost is
                      calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir.
                      the eir amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. the losses arising from impairment are recognised in the
                      profit or loss.
                      a financial asset is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met:
                           =     the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting the contractual cash
                                 flows and selling financial assets and
                           =     the assets contractual cash flows represent sppi.
                      a financial asset is measured at fair value through profit or loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through
                      other comprehensive income. in addition, the group may elect to designate a financial asset, which otherwise meets amortized
                      cost or fvtoci criteria, as at fvtpl. however, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or
                      recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).
                      equity investments:
                      all equity investments in scope of ind as 109 are measured at fair value. equity instruments which are held for trading are
                      classified as at fvtpl. for all other equity instruments, the group may make an irrevocable election to present in other
                      comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. the group makes such election on an instrument by-instrument
                      basis. the classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.
                      if the group decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding
                      dividends, are recognized in the oci. there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to statement of profit and loss, even on sale
                      of investment. however, the group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. equity instruments included within
                      the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the p&l.
                      de-recognition
                      a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily
                      derecognised (i.e. removed from the group's balance sheet) when:
                      1.   the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset have expired, or
                      2. the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received
                      cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
                           i)    the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or
                           ii)   the group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred
                                 control of the asset.
                      when the group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement,
                      it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. when it has neither transferred nor retained
                      substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the group continues to recognise the
                      transferred asset to the extent of the group’s continuing involvement. in that case, the group also recognises an associated
                      liability. the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the

                      group has retained.
                      continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original

                           =    the currency in which the price of the related good or service that is acquired or delivered is routinely denominated in
                                commercial transactions around the world,
                           =    a currency that is commonly used in contracts to purchase or sell non-financial items in the economic environment in
                                which the transaction takes place (i.e. relatively liquid and stable currency).
                      foreign currency embedded derivatives which do not meet the above criteria are separated and the derivative is accounted for
                      at fair value through profit and loss. the group currently does not have any such derivatives which are not closely related.
                      impairment of financial assets
                      the group assesses impairment based on expected credit loss (ecl) model to the following:
                           =    financial assets measured at amortised cost
                           =    financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
                      expected credit losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:
                           =    the 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial
                                instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or
                           =    full time expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the
                                financial instrument).
                      the group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on trade receivables or contract revenue
                      receivables. under the simplified approach, the group is not required to track changes in credit risk. rather, it recognises
                      impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls together with appropriate management estimates for credit loss at each
                      reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
                      the group uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on the portfolio of trade receivables. the provision
                      matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivable and is adjusted for
                      forward looking estimates. at every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the
                      forward-looking estimates are analysed.
                      ecl impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of
                      profit and loss. this amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the statement of profit & loss. the balance sheet
                      presentation for various financial instruments is described below:
                           =    financial assets measured as at amortised cost and contractual revenue receivables - ecl is presented as an
                                allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. the allowance reduces the
                                net carrying amount. until the asset meets write-off criteria, the group does not reduce impairment allowance from
                                the gross carrying amount.
                           =     financial assets measured at fvtoci - since financial assets are already reflected at fair value, impairment allowance
                                is not further reduced from its value. rather, ecl amount is presented as accumulated impairment amount in the oci.
                      for assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the group combines financial instruments on the basis of shared credit
                      risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant increases in credit risk to
                      be identified on a timely basis.
                      the group does not have any purchased or originated credit-impaired (poci) financial assets, i.e., financial assets which are
                      credit impaired on purchase/ origination.
                      financial liabilities
                      initial recognition and measurement
                      financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
                      borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

                      all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly
                      attributable transaction costs.
                      the group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loan and borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial
                      guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.

                                                                                                                                              5 annual report

                            financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated
                            upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are
                            incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the
                            profit or loss.
                            financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date
                            of recognition, and only if the criteria in ind as 109 are satisfied. for liabilities designated as fvtpl, fair value gains/ losses
                            attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in oci. these gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to p&l.
                            however, the group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. all other changes in fair value of such liability are
                            recognised in the statement of profit or loss. the group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit
                            and loss.
                            financial guarantee contracts
                            financial guarantee contracts issued by the group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the
                            holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt
                            instrument. financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that
                            are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of
                            loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of ind as 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative
                            amortisation.
                            loan and borrowings
                            after initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
                            effective interest rate (eir) method. gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as
                            well as through the eir amortisation process. amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
                            acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir amortisation is included as finance costs in the
                            statement of profit and loss.
                            derecognition
                            a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. when an existing
                            financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability
                            are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the
                            recognition of a new liability. the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
                      (j)   offsetting financial instruments
                            financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable
                            right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability
                            simultaneously. the legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal
                            course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the group or the counterparty.
                      (k)   fair value measurement
                            the group measures certain financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date.
                            fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
                            market participants at the measurement date. the fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to
                            sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
                                 =    in the principal market for the asset or liability, or
                                 =    in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
                            the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the group. the fair value of an asset or a liability is
                            measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market

                            participants act in their economic best interest.
                            the group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
                            measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
                            all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair
                            value hierarchy, described as under, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
                                 =    level 1 - quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
                                 =    level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
159                                   directly or indirectly observable.

                                                                                                                                            2016-2017
                                                                                                                                        th
                                                                                                                                      5 annual report

                                 =    level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
                                      unobservable.
                            for assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the group determines whether
                            transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
                            significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
                            the group's management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as unquoted
                            financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement, such as assets held for distribution in discontinued
                            operations. the management comprises of the managing director/chief executive officer and chief financial officer.
                            external valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as unquoted financial assets. involvement of external
                            valuers is decided upon annually by the valuation committee after discussion with and approval by the management. selection
                            criteria include market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained. valuers are
                            normally rotated every three years. the management decides, after discussions with the group's external valuers, which
                            valuation techniques and inputs to use for each case.
                            at each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are required to be
                            re-measured or re-assessed as per the group’s accounting policies. for this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs
                            applied in the latest valuation by agreeing the information in the valuation.
                            the management, in conjunction with the group's external valuers, also compares the change in the fair value of each asset and
                            liability with relevant external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.
                            for the purpose of fair value disclosures, the group has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature,
                            characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
                            this note summarises accounting policy for fair value. other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant notes. (refer

                            inventory of gas (including inventory in pipeline and cng cascades) is valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. cost is
                             determined on weighted average cost method.
                            stores, spares and consumables are valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. cost is determined on moving weighted
                            average basis.
                            inventories of project materials (capital inventory) are valued at cost on moving weighted average basis.
                      (m) non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operation
                            non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction
                            rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. they are measured at the lower of their carrying
                            amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits,
                            financial assets and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.
                            an impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. a gain is
                            recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of any cumulative
                            impairment loss previously recognised. a gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset
                            (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of de-recognition.

                            non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. non-current assets classified as
                            held for sale are presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet.
                            a discontinued operation is a component of the group that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that

                                 granted, the fair value as of the date of grant of option is recognised as employee benefit expenses with a corresponding

                      (p)   leases
                            the determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
                            inception of the lease. the arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a
                            specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly
                            specified in an arrangement.
                            for arrangements entered into prior to 1 april 2015, the group has determined whether the arrangement contain lease on the
                            basis of facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.
                            as a lessee
                            finance lease
                            lease of property, plant and equipment where the group, as lessee, has substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
                            ownership are classified as finance leases.
                            at the commencement of the lease term, the group recognises finance leases as assets in its balance sheet at amounts equal to
                            the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the
                            inception of the lease. the corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings or other financial
                            liabilities as appropriate. the discount rate used in calculating the present value of the minimum lease payments is the interest
                            rate implicit in the lease, if this is practicable to determine. if not, the group’s incremental borrowing rate is used. any indirect
                            costs of the group are added to the amount recognised as an asset.
                            minimum lease payments is apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. the finance
                            cost is charged to the profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining
                            balance of the liability for each period.
                            operating lease
                            leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership is not transferred to the group as lessee
                            are classified as operating leases. lease payments under an operating lease are recognised as an expenses on a straight-line
                            basis over the lease term unless either:
                                 =    another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the payments to the
                                      lessors are not on that basis; or
                                 =    the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the
                                      lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases. if payments to the lessor vary because of factors other than general
                                      inflation, then this condition is not met.
                            as a lessor
                            finance lease
                            when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership transfer from the group to the lessee then it is classified as finance
                            lease. amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the group’s net investment in the leases.
                            finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment

                            statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless either:
                                 =   another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit even if the payments to the

                            law) and deferred tax charge or credit (reflecting the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable
                            income for the period). income tax expenses are recognised in statement of profit or loss except tax expenses related to items
                            recognised directly in reserves (including statement of other comprehensive income) which are recognised with the underlying
                            items.
                            income taxes
                            the income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the
                            applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to
                            temporary differences and to unused tax losses.
                            the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the
                            reporting period i.e. as per the provisions of the income tax act, 1961, as amended from time to time. management periodically
                            evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation.
                            it establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
                            advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid
                            and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction for relevant tax paying units and where the group is able to and
                            intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.
                            deferred taxes
                            deferred tax is provided in full on temporary difference arising between the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and their
                            carrying amounts in financial statements at the reporting date. deferred tax are recognised in respect of deductible temporary
                            differences being the difference between taxable income and accounting income that originate in one period and are capable of
                            reversal in one or more subsequent periods., the carry forward of unused tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
                            deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the
                            reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
                            liability is settled.
                            deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that
                            future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
                            deferred tax assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments
                            in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interest in joint arrangements where it is not probable that the differences will
                            reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
                            deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
                            investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interest in joint arrangements where it is probable that the differences
                            will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
                            deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
                            and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where
                            the group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the
                            liability simultaneously.
                            current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other
                            comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
                            equity, respectively.
                            any tax credit available including minimum alternative tax (mat) under the provision of the income tax act, 1961 is recognised
                            as deferred tax to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax credits

                            can be utilised. the said asset is created by way of credit to the statement of profit and loss and shown under the head deferred
                            tax asset.
                            the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
                            probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. unrecognised
                            deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
                            future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

                                                                                                                                       5 annual report

                      (r)   earnings per share
                            basic earnings per share
                            basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted average
                            number of equity shares outstanding during the period. earnings considered in ascertaining the group's earnings per share is
                            the net profit for the period after deducting preference dividends, if any, and any attributable distribution tax thereto for the
                            period.
                            diluted earnings per share
                            diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the
                            after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential equity shares and the weighted
                            average number of additional equity shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential
                            equity shares.
                            treasury share
                            treasury shares are not treated as outstanding ordinary equity shares and are therefore deducted from the number of equity
                            shares outstanding during the period in consolidated financial statements.
                      (s)   provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
                            provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
                            probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
                            estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. provision for contractual obligation is disclosed based on management's
                            assessment of the probable outcome with reference to the available information supplemented by experience of similar
                            transactions. when the group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a
                            separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. the expense relating to a provision is presented in the
                            statement of profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
                            provision in respect of loss contingencies relating to claims, litigation, assessment, fines, penalties etc. are recognised when it is
                            probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated reliably.
                            provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. provisions for restructuring are recognised by the group when it has
                            developed a detailed formal plan for restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that the group will carry out the
                            restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.
                            where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by
                            considering the class of obligations as a whole. a provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any
                            one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
                            provisions are measured at management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end
                            of the reporting period and are not discounted to present value. the estimates of outcome and financial effect are determined
                            by the judgment of the management, supplemented by experience of similar transactions and, in some cases, reports from
                            independent experts.
                            the measurement of provision for restructuring includes only direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are both
                            necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the group.
                            contingent liability is disclosed in the case of:
                            1.   a present obligation arising from the past events, when it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to
                                 settle the obligation;
                            2.   a present obligation arising from the past events, when no reliable estimate is possible;
                            3.   a possible obligation arising from the past events, unless the probability of outflow of resources is remote.

                            contingent liabilities are not provided for & if material, are disclosed by way of notes to accounts.
                            a contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
                            occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.
                            contingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never
                            be realised. however, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits
                            will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.
                            a contingent asset is disclosed by way of notes to financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
                            provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

                      the group is contesting the demands and the management including its advisors believe that its position is likely to be upheld in the
                      appellate process. no tax expense has been accrued in the financial statements for the tax demand raised. the management believes
                      that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the group's financial position and results of
                      operations.

                            natural gas regulatory board (pngrb) against erstwhile ggcl alleging charging of tariff illegally under the city gas network
                            distribution agreement entered into between the parties. the matter was decided against erstwhile ggcl by pngrb.
                            erstwhile ggcl has preferred an appeal at appellate tribunal for electricity (aptel) against the pngrb order. erstwhile ggcl
                            has also sought an interim stay on the pngrb order which was granted by aptel. the aptel has in its order stated that it is an
                            interim order without considering the merits of the case. company has submitted bank guarantee of rs. 40 crores in favour of
                            upl.

                            pgnrb had vide its orders dated 13.09.2011 of chairman and dated 10.10.2011 of the majority members (three member panel
                            of board) unanimously held that gail had adopted restrictive trade practices by blocking off direct connectivity to gspc and
                            further, directed respondents to immediately give direct connectivity to gspc at dahej terminal. the pll offtakers (gail) filed
                            appeals against the said pngrb orders before the appellate tribunal for electricity (aptel). on 23-february-2012 aptel had
                            issued an interim order for shifting the delivery point from gail-gspl delivery point to gspl-pll delivery point. on 18-

                                  notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                            gspcl has filed an appeal against the aptel’s above referred judgment before hon’ble supreme court of india (gspcl vs. gail
                            & others, civil appeal no. 2473-2476 of 2014) and the hon’ble supreme court of india had passed the interim order on 28th
                            february 2014. the court has stated that the ends of justice would be met if as a matter of interim arrangement, the appellant is
                            directed to pay interconnectivity charges at the rate of rs. 12.00 per mmbtu (exclusive of taxes). the company has already
                            provided and paid interconnectivity charges at the rate of rs. 12.00 per mmbtu (exclusive of taxes).
                      (iii) one of the gas suppliers of the company has submitted a claim of rs. 108.44 crores (p. y. rs. 481.85 crores), for overdrawn
                            use of gas against demand in earlier years. the company has refuted this erroneous claim contending that no contractual
                            provisions of the agreement executed with ggl allow such claim. the management is of the firm view that the company is not
                            liable to pay any such claim. the company has already taken up the matter with concerned party/authorities to withdraw the
                            claim.

                            20.12.2016 by paying 25% of demand of rs 10.88 crores. the company has already provided the liability of rs 25 crores in the
                            books of accounts for the financial year 2015-16.

                            the group is having certain claims which are pursuing through legal processes. the management believe that probable outcome
                            in all such claims are uncertain. hence, the disclosure of such claims is not required in the financial statements.

                      # fair value of financial assets and liabilities which are measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying value
                      (ie..amortised cost).
                      level 1: level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. this includes mutual funds that have quoted
                      price. the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav.
                      level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, traded bonds, over-the counter
                      derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible
                      on entity-specific estimates. if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in
                      level 2.
                      level 3: if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. this is the
                      case for unlisted equity securities included in level 3.

                      2. income approach : the income approach reflects present
                         value of future cash flows. for valuing a business, the
                         discounted cash flow (dcf) methodology is used under this
                         approach. this methodology works on the premise that the
                         value of a business is measured in terms of future cash flow
                         streams, discounted to the present time at an appropriate
                         discount rate. this method is used to determine the present
                         value of business on a going concern assumption.
                           the dcf technique recognizes the time value of money.the
                           value of the firm is arrived at by estimating the free cash
                           flow to firm (fcff) and discounting the same at the
                           weighted average cost of capital (wacc). fcff is estimated
                           by forecasting free cash flows available to the firm (which are
                           derived on the basis of the likely future earnings of the
                           company).
                      3. cost approach -the cost approach essentially estimates
                         the cost of replacing the tangible assets of the business. the

                         replacement cost takes into account the market value of
                         various assets or the expenditure required to create the
                         infrastructure exactly similar to that of a company being
                         valued.

                           contractual obligations, and arises principally from the company's receivables from customers and investments in debt
                           securities.
                           the carrying amount of following financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure:
                      (a) other financial assets
                           the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits with banks having good reputation, good past track
                           record and high quality credit rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis.
                      (b) trade and other receivables
                           the company's exposure to credit risk is the exposure that company has on account of goods sold or services rendered to a
                           contractual counterparty or counterparties, whether with collateral or otherwise for which the contracted consideration is yet
                           to be received. the company's customer base are industrial, commercial-non commercial, domestic and cng.

                           the company raises the invoice for quantities sold based on periodicity as per the agreement. sales are subject to security
                           deposit and/or bank guarantee clauses to ensure that in the event of non-payment the company's receivables are secured.
                           for sales to domestic customers for household purposes like cooking, geyser application, etc., invoices are raised periodically.
                           security deposits along with connection deposits are taken for mitigation of potential credit risk arising in the event of non-
                           payment of invoices.
                           cng sales made through operators of the cng stations owned by the company and cng franchises outlet are exposed to
                           credit risk as amounts so collected is deposited/transferred in company bank account on next working day. bank guarantee /
                           security deposit is taken to mitigate the credit risk. for cng sales made through oil marketing companies (omcs), the
                           company raises the invoice for quantities sold based on periodicity as per the agreement. the omcs are well established
                           companies viz. hpcl, bpcl, ioc, essar oil ltd. where no significant credit risk is anticipated.
                           the company provides for allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and
                           other receivables.
                           a default on a financial asset is when the counter party fails to make contractual payment within 180 days of when they fall due.
                           this definition of default is determine by considering the business environment in which the company operates and other
                           macro economic factors.

                           engage in a repayment plan with group. where receivables have been written off the company continues to engage in
                           enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables. where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit and loss.

                           b) interest rate risk
                              interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. fair value interest rate risk is the risk
                              of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates. cash flow
                              interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest bearing investments will fluctuate because of
                              fluctuations in the interest rates.
                              on period under review the company do not have any borrowings at fixed rate and has not entered into interest rate swaps
                              for its exposure to long term borrowings at floating rate.

                                                                                                                                                       (rs. in crores)

                      sensitivity analysis
                      profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest expense from borrowings as a result of change in interest rates.
                      the company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the
                      company does not have any designate derivatives (interest rate swaps) . therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date
                      would not affect profit or loss.

                      a reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) equity and
                      profit or loss by the amount shown below:

                       particulars                                                    profit or (loss)                              equity (net of tax)
                                                                          100 bp increase         100 bp decrease        100 bp increase            100 bp decrease

                           c) commodity price risk
                              risk arising on account of fluctuations in prices of natural gas is managed through long term purchase contracts entered
                              with the respective parties. the company monitors the movements in the prices closely while entering into new contracts.
                           d) equity price risk
                              the company do not have any investment in quoted equity shares hence not expose to equity price risk.

                      31, 2017 (march 31, 2016: 12%). the weighted-average interest expense on interest-bearing borrowings (excluding liabilities with

                      (i)    entity’s responsibilities for the governance of the plan
                             risk to the plan
                             following are the risk to which the plan exposes the entity :
                             a actuarial risk:
                                 "it is the risk that benefits will cost more than expected. this can arise due to one of the following reasons:adverse salary
                                 growth experience: salary hikes that are higher than the assumed salary escalation will result into an increase in obligation
                                 at a rate that is higher than expected.variability in mortality rates: if actual mortality rates are higher than assumed mortality
                                 rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected. since there is no condition of vesting on the
                                 death benefit, the acceleration of cash flow will lead to an actuarial loss or gain depending on the relative values of the
                                 assumed salary growth and discount rate.variability in withdrawal rates: if actual withdrawal rates are higher than assumed
                                 withdrawal rate assumption than the gratuity benefits will be paid earlier than expected. the impact of this will depend on
                                 whether the benefits are vested as at the resignation date."
                             b investment risk:
                                 for funded plans that rely on insurers for managing the assets, the value of assets certified by the insurer may not be the fair
                                 value of instruments backing the liability. in such cases, the present value of the assets is independent of the future discount
                                 rate. this can result in wide fluctuations in the net liability or the funded status if there are significant changes in the discount
                                 rate during the inter-valuation period.
                             c liquidity risk:
                                 employees with high salaries and long durations or those higher in hierarchy, accumulate significant level of benefits. if some
                                 of such employees resign / retire from the company there can be strain on the cash flows.
                             d market risk:
                                 market risk is a collective term for risks that are related to the changes and fluctuations of the financial markets. one
                                 actuarial assumption that has a material effect is the discount rate. the discount rate reflects the time value of money. an
                                 increase in discount rate leads to decrease in defined benefit obligation of the plan benefits & vice versa. this assumption
                                 depends on the yields on the corporate / government bonds and hence the valuation of liability is exposed to fluctuations in

                                 within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. due to the restrictions in the type of investments that
                                 can be held by the fund, it may not be possible to explicitly follow an asset-liability matching strategy to manage risk actively
                                 in a conventional fund.

                                  notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                      footnotes to the above reconciliation are as under:
                      1)    investment property
                            under ind as, land and building held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in production or
                           supply of goods and services or sale in the ordinary course of business are to be classified as investment property. under the
                           igaap, investment properties were presented as part of freehold land. the group has reclassified land valuing rs 1.30 crores
                           as investment property. however, there is no impact on the total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment.
                      2)    own your asset scheme (oyas)
                            under igaap, assets given to employees under oyas scheme were reflected as fixed assets and depreciated over their
                           respective useful lives. under ind as, this has been accounted as a finance lease and the wdv of the underlying assets has been
                           derecognised. the difference between the cost of the asset and present value of the consideration received in the future has
                           been recognized as an employee cost over the period. the consideration due from the employees over the period has been
                           recognised as receivable. consequently an amount of rs 0.39 crores has been derecognised from ppe on the transition date.
                           the total equity of the group reduced by rs 0.03 crore as on the transition date. the impact of reversal of the depreciation and
                           the employee cost are similar to each other for the year ended 31st march 2016, hence there is no significant impact on equity
                           as on 31st march 2016.
                      3)    fair valuation of investments in mutual funds: under igaap, the group accounted for short term investments in mutual
                           funds at cost . under ind as, the group has designated such investments as fvtpl investments. carrying value of investments
                           in mutual fund was rs. 936.99 crores as per previous gaap on the date of transition. consequently the value of total equity on
                           the transition date has increased by rs. 0.22 crores(net of tax) while the value of investment have increased by rs 0.34 crores.
                      4)    interest accrued but not due
                            under igaap, the group has invested in fixed deposits with the banks. the interest is accrued on the same at each reporting
                           date which is disclosed separately as interest accrued and due separate from the fixed deposit. under ind as, the fixed deposits
                           are to be reported at amortised cost. accordingly interest accrued but not due of rs 1.24 crores and rs. 2.76 crores as on the
                           transition date and 31st march 2016 respectively has been reclassified to respective fixed deposits. there is no impact on the
                           total equity or profit as a result of this adjustment.
                      5)    interest bearing loans and borrowings
                            under igaap, transaction costs incurred in connection with interest bearing loans and borrowings were charged to profit or
                           loss when incurred. under ind as, transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of financial liability and
                           charged to profit or loss using the eir method. accordingly the total equity increased by rs 1.57 crores on the transition date
                           and rs 0.64 crores on 31st march 2016. the profit for the year ended 31st march 2016 reduced by rs 0.93 crores as a result
                           of additional interest expense.
                      6)    proposed dividend and tax thereon
                            under igaap, dividends proposed by the board of directors after the balance sheet date but before the approval of the
                           financial statements were considered as adjusting events. accordingly, provision for proposed dividend was recognised as a
                           liability. under ind as, such dividends are recognised when the same is approved by the shareholders in the general
                           meeting.accordingly the liability proposed dividend of rs 41.43 as at 31 march 2016 and rs 82.85 as on the transition date
                           included under provisions has been reversed with corresponding adjustment to retained earnings. consequently, the total
                           equity increased by an equivalent amount.
                      7)   fvtoci financial assets: under igaap, the group accounted for long term investments in unquoted and quoted equity
                           shares as investment measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. under
                           ind as, the group has designated such investments as fvtoci investments. at the transition date , difference between the fair
                           value and igaap carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, net of related deferred taxes. this
                           has resulted in a decrease in total equity by rs 31.97 crores on 31 march 2016 (net of tax).
                      8)   accounting for excise duty on sale of goods: under igaap, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. however,
                           under ind as, sale of goods includes excise duty which is considered as an expense. thus sale of goods for the financial year
                           2015-16 under ind as has increased by rs. 139.90 crores with a corresponding increase in other expense. this adjustment has
                           no impact on the total equity on the transition date as well as 31 march 2016.

                      9)   employee benefits: under ind as, remeasurements i.e. actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets, excluding
                           amounts included in the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability are recognised in other comprehensive income
                           instead of profit or loss. under igaap, these remeasurements were forming part of the profit or loss for the year. this
                           adjustment has no impact on the total equity on the transition date as well as 31 march 2016.
                      10) deferred tax assets (net) :
                           igaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach, which focuses on differences between taxable
                           profits and accounting profits for the period. ind as 12 requires entities to account for deferred taxes using the balance sheet
                           approach, which focuses on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet
                           and its tax base. the application of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on certain temporary
 211                       differences which was not required under igaap as discussed below. further, group has reclassified mat credit entitlement to
                           deferred tax assets.

                             created on difference of fair value and book value as the differences arose on balance sheet items. ind as 12 - income taxes,
                             mandates creation of deferred tax on temporary differences based on difference in book base and tax base including those
                             arising on account of a fair valuation of assets due to business combination. consequently, a deferred tax liability of rs 641.89

                             financial statements), the group controls the trust. accordingly, the same has been consolidated as a subsidiary. the shares of
