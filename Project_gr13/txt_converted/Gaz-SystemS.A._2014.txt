upgraded transmission system and cross-border
interconnections will open new prospects and strengthen
the company's position both domestically and across
europe.

we strive to achieve our business objectives whilst applying
the principles of sustainable development and responsible
management. new improved business practices and
dialogue with our stakeholders enable us to build a long-
lasting and constructive relationship with the environment in
which we operate. our reporting standards adhere to
guidelines set by the global reporting initiative (gri) and
the employee volunteering strategy adopted by the
company in 2013 also allowed our staff to get involved in
taking responsibility for the environment. none of these
initiatives, however, would have gone far without the
organisational and financial support of the company.

our achievements, demonstrated by gaz-system’s rapid
growth and improved efficiency, would all not be possible
without the commitment, knowledge and skills of our
employees. together, we are building a strong and reliable
organisation based on trust and mutual respect. i am proud
to have the privilege of being part of the great team with
which i have a possibility to work on the most ambitious of
projects important for the entire economy.

i wish you all an enjoyable read.

yours faithfully,

another important study from the company's point of view
was the use of ultrasonic clamp-on flow meters to determine
flow disturbances in measuring systems. a scientific study
concerning the optimisation of energy management in

out. the study had the form of an energy audit, combined
with a pre-feasibility study of projects to improve energy
management at the hołowczyce and jarosław compressor
stations. the hołowczyce compressor station was further
examined to identify opportunities for energy savings and
operating cost reduction.
