fresenius helios also remains highly successful in its home
market. last summer we acquired the niederberg hospital in
north rhine-westphalia, the company’s 112th hospital across
germany. we have further increased the number of patients
treated – and invested almost € 350 million in upgrading and
modernizing our facilities. this is something we will continue
to do. in wiesbaden, for example, we will spend well over
€ 200 million on a completely new hospital building with more
than 900 beds and 22 operating rooms. that is a large invest-
ment. but when completed in 2020, it will be a highly modern
facility with a functional design concept that minimizes dis-
tances for both patients and staff. and one that will improve
the medical quality we can provide.                               fresenius medical care introduced a completely new generation of

approximately 4,680 mg co2 in 2016 (2015: 29,747 mg co2).
   water consumption in all helios hospitals was
4,760,500 m3 (2015: 4,434,810 m3). the majority of all water
is consumed for sterilization processes, process cooling,
and water recycling plants. to reduce consumption, some hos-
pitals are using well water, for instance for the cooling tow-
ers of air-conditioning systems.
   proper waste disposal is of great importance to hospitals.
helios views waste disposal management as a process: it
starts with avoiding any future waste, and ends with the consis-
tent recycling or environmentally friendly disposal of the
same. requirements pertaining to environmental protection,
occupational health and safety, and infection protection and
hospital hygiene are taken into account. that relates particu-
larly to major waste groups such as clinical waste, i.e., from
the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. in 2016, the
total amount of clinical waste generated in all helios hos­
pitals was 21,560 t (2015: 20,775 t).

                                         agement report and group management report of fresenius se & co. kgaa. based on a detailed report from

                                         may 2016. when doing so, the supervisory board considered the international activities of the group,
                                         potential conflicts of interest, the question of the independence of candidates, as well as diversity, both in terms

work of the committees
during the reporting year, the audit committee held three meetings and four conference calls. the main
focus of its monitoring activities was on the preliminary audit of the annual financial statements of fresenius
se & co. kgaa and the group for 2015 and discussions with the auditors on their reports and the terms of
reference of the audit. another matter dealt with by the audit committee was its recommendation to the super-
visory board regarding which auditing firm to propose to the annual general meeting for election as auditor
for the annual financial statements of fresenius se & co. kgaa and the group for 2016. the supervisory
board’s proposal to the annual general meeting in 2016 to elect kpmg ag wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
berlin, as auditor was based on a recommendation by the audit committee. finally, the audit committee
also reviewed in detail:

▶   the 2016 quarterly reports,
▶   controlling reports on the development of acquisitions,
▶   compliance,
▶   the risk management system, the internal control system, and the internal auditing system, and
▶   approval of non-audit services by kpmg ag wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, berlin.

committee at the respective subsequent meeting.
    the company’s nomination committee met once in march 2016 in preparation for the supervisory
board elections in may 2016.
    the joint committee, whose approval is necessary for certain important transactions of fresenius
se & co. kgaa and for certain legal activities between the company and the else kröner-fresenius foundation,

appoint the management board members of fresenius management se.

auditors of kpmg issued their unqualified audit opinion on the company’s financial statements and manage­
ment report. the same applies to the company’s consolidated financial statements, which were prepared
in accordance with the ifrs accounting principles, and with the regulations that govern these statements

auditor’s reports were submitted to each member of the company’s supervisory board in a timely manner.
at their meetings on march 9 and 10, 2017, first the audit committee and then the supervisory board
discussed all the documents in detail.
   the auditors delivered a detailed report on the results of the audit at each of these meetings. they found
no weaknesses in the risk management system or the internal control system with regard to the accounting
process. the auditors attended all meetings of the supervisory board and all meetings and conference calls
of the audit committee.
   the audit committee and the supervisory board approved the auditor’s results. also, the audit committee’s
and the supervisory board’s own review found no objections to the company’s financial statements and
management report or the consolidated financial statements and the group management reports.
   at its meeting on march 10, 2017, the supervisory board approved the financial statements and manage­
ment reports presented by the general partner and the statements contained therein with respect to future
development of the company.
