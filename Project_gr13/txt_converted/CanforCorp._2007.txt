                       dear fellow shareholders


                       2006 was a very difficult and challenging

                       year. with the decline in housing starts,

                       prices for both lumber and osb also declined.

                       our bottom line benefited however, by the

                       refunded softwood lumber duties and the

                       much improved pulp markets, resulting

                       in a profit of $471.8 million after tax.

                       although many external challenges impacted

                       our performance, we also experienced

                       internal challenges including two greenfield

sustainable forest management certification
canfor continues to be a leader in third-party sustainable forest management (sfm) certification of its forestry
operations.
     canfor maintains certification under the canadian standards association (csa) standard for sustainable
forest management (can/csa-z809-02) for its forest management agreement area at grande prairie, alberta,
for its tree farm licences at chetwynd, prince george and vavenby, british columbia, for its forest licences at
fort st john, houston, prince george, fort nelson, vanderhoof, vavenby, quesnel and radium, british columbia
and for its pulpwood agreements at fort st john and fort nelson, british columbia. a new certification to the
csa sfm standard has been acquired for canfor’s forest licence at mackenzie, british columbia.
     currently 96% of the allowable annual cut from canfor’s forest tenures is certified to the csa sfm standard.
plans are in place to complete the certification of the remaining operations in alberta and québec during the next
year. canfor is committed to having sustainable forest management certification in place for all of its tenures.
     canfor’s forestry operations have implemented 14 sfm plans certified to the csa sfm standard. each of these
plans has been developed and is maintained with the active participation of a locally based public advisory group,
which includes a broad range of stakeholders. the public participation process works according to clearly defined
operating rules that have been developed and agreed to by the participants. all elements of the sfm plans including
the public process are subject to annual internal and external surveillance audits. the sfm plans, associated
reports and audit summaries are available at http://www.canfor.com/sustainability/certification/csa.asp.

compliance report

canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of
this process. the following is an inventory of compliance for canfor’s majority owned manufacturing operations.
      in 2006, canfor had the following non-compliance situations (reported in accordance with government non-
compliance reporting criteria):


air
at pulpmills – particulate emissions from a power boiler exceeded the permit limit on one quarterly stack test.
at a pulpmill a small quantity of anhydrous ammonia was leaked to atmosphere as a result of a pinhole in a line.
      at wood products operations, one burner was below compliance temperature on seven occasions, one
burner was below compliance temperature on three occasions, and two burners exceeded smoke opacity limits
on one occasion each. a power boiler exceeded smoke opacity limits on two occasions. particulate from an osb
drier exceeded permit during three quarterly compliance tests. a wet electrostatic precipitator at a plywood plant
was bypassed five times due to mechanical and electrical malfunctions. weekly inspections on a sawmill planer
baghouse were not documented as required by permit for two weeks out of a six month period. at a sawmill
visible emissions from two cyclones were observed by the ministry of environment.


effluent
at pulpmills – in october, 2006, canfor pulp limited partnership (cplp) observed dark ponded water in an area
on the banks of the fraser river and reported the dark ponded water to the appropriate regulatory agencies.
the partnership also undertook certain remedial work and investigations to determine the source of the dark
ponded water. the partnership’s experts have concluded that the source is likely a leak from the partnership’s
intercontinental mill’s ash pond.
      the partnership, in conjunction with the bc ministry of environment, is considering and developing remedial
options. the cost to remediate the ash pond and surrounding area cannot be determined at this time, but the
partnership believes it will not have a material effect on its financial condition.
      at a panel plant a quarterly effluent report was submitted after the due date. at a sawmill significant
vegetation growth on a berm surrounding a sanitary lagoon was noted by the ministry of environment.


landfill – no issues to report.


spills
at manufacturing operations – canfor had 11 (4 at pulpmills; 7 at solid wood) reportable spills in 2006. all were
contained, cleaned up and preventive actions taken. the spills included: two spills of pulp stock/filtrate; one spill of    0
a pulp process chemical; one spill of untreated pulp mill effluent, one spill of hydraulic oil, two spills of transformer   canfor

oil as a result of vandalism, one spill of thermal oil, two spills of diesel and one spill of quench water.                 c o r p o r at i o n

                             performance versus objectives in 2006

                             air quality
                             we will contribute to airshed research in prince george so that air quality improvement can be accelerated
                             through cost effective management actions.


                             performance
                             canfor’s contribution to airshed research in prince george in 2006 included staff support and funding for the
                             approved airshed research project. the main elements of this initiative include:

                                  development of an emissions inventory with best available information on all significant sources of
                                  particulate,

                                  modeling of source impacts on ambient levels of particulate, and

                                  cost/benefit evaluation of source reduction opportunities.

                                  the outcomes from this project will support the planning of management actions based on predicted benefit
                             to air quality. the models developed will provide a tool to predict impacts from proposed new sources, source
                             reductions and community growth.


                             (ems)
                             we will provide environmental coordinators of our operations with the knowledge and resources required to
                             achieve continual improvement, reduce the frequency of noncompliance incidents and minimize impact on the
                             environment. three key areas of focus are:

                                  training of new environmental coordinators

                                  support for further development of environmental management systems

                                  managing the 2006 audit program for maximum benefit to auditors and operations


                             performance
                             a half-day ems training session was conducted for new environmental coordinators in may 2006. several
                             mills were provided with consultant assistance in developing or updating environmental aspects lists for their
                             sites. all environmental audits included an evaluation of environmental management systems against company
                             ems targets.

we will support canfor’s drinking water system operators with:

     regulatory updates

     drinking water audit protocol used at all environmental audits

     on site inspections for operations that have not previously been visited by engineers qualified to assess
     potable water systems.


performance
drinking water system operators have been provided with information on the drinking water protection act
and regulations. the drinking water audit protocol has been applied at all sites audited in 2006. drinking water
systems at all new canfor operations were inspected by a qualified engineering firm. most identified risks have
been addressed while further works are in progress.


wood residue management
we will finalize and implement phase out plans for canfor’s remaining tier 1 burners.


performance
the $55 million energy system and joint venture pellet project at our houston sawmill will result in phase out of
the houston tier 1 burner by the end of march, 2007. options for canfor’s last tier 1 burner in fort st. john are
being considered. they include third party utilization, energy systems, and pellet plant construction.


audits
we will conduct corporate environmental audits of one pulp mill, seven sawmill operations, and two
remanufacturing plants.


performance
corporate environmental audits were conducted at five sawmill operations and one remanufacturing plant.
audits not conducted as planned in 2006 were deferred to 2007.

                             the following are corporate level objectives and targets for 2007.


                             air quality
                             research is underway to identify effective particulate reduction strategies for the prince george airshed. while
                             particulate is considered a risk to human health, ambient levels of odour constitute a nuisance and a potential
                             impediment to community growth. despite significant emission reductions, these levels have not improved
                             since condensate strippers were installed at the pulpmills in 1989. in order to identify cost effective reduction
                             strategies for odorous emissions we will initiate a study to characterize sources of odour at canfor operations
                             in the community.
                                  we will finalize and implement a phase out plan for canfor’s one remaining tier 1 burner.


                             audits
                             we will conduct corporate environmental audits of seven sawmills, two pulp mills, two panel plants and one
                             remanufacturing plant.


                             managing responsibly

                             canfor is a company that is committed to excellence in environmental performance across the company. new
                             technologies, well-trained employees, and third party auditing of operations are all part of a comprehensive and
                             effective environmental management program.
                                  canfor’s ghg emissions were reduced by 17% between 2004 and 2005 with start-up of the pg pulp

     report 2006

     over the past year canfor has remained dedicated to reducing emissions and finding innovative energy
solutions. by increasing wood residue usage in the production of heat and electricity canfor was able to lessen
the need for traditional energy sources. in 2006 canfor generated approximately 1.7 million tonnes of byproduct
wood residuals of which 70% or about 1.2 million tonnes was utilized for renewable heat and electricity
generation, the production of wood pellets, sawdust pulp and fibreboard. utilization will increase in 2007 with
completion of the houston energy system pellet plant project and improved output of the prince george pulp
cogeneration facility.
     canfor will continue to actively pursue value added opportunities for our remaining surplus wood residue.

                             over the course of the past 18 months, all of canfor’s operations completed comprehensive health &
                             safety audits using a standard audit process. the results of and recommendations from these audits make up
                             the basis for designing and implementing action plans to improve the health & safety performance of canfor’s
                             operating divisions.
                                  canfor continued with its practice of holding an annual health & safety conference in prince george. over
                             270 salaried and hourly delegates from across all of canfor’s operating divisions attended the 2006 conference.
                                  now in its 56th year since inception, the annual president’s safety awards were presented to four operating
                             divisions to recognize their exceptional health & safety performance. the 2006 recipients were isle pierre (lowest
                             medical incidence rate (mir) for 2006; uneeda and quesnel (greatest percentage mir improvement, 2006/2005);
                             and intercontinental pulp (lowest mir for three consecutive years, 2004-2006)
                                  in 2006, the b.c. forest safety council, in conjunction with worksafe bc (wcb), introduced its ‘safe
                             companies’ certification program for the provinces woodlands operations. two of canfor’s larger woodlands
                             divisions, fort nelson woodlands and prince george woodlands, were among a very small group of woodlands
                             licenecees and contractors (13 province wide) to successfully pass the stringent health & safety certification
                             audit process and receive their certified ‘safe companies’ designations.




                             canfor has set an overall mir target of 2.00 which it expects its operations to achieve by the end of 2008.

management’s discussion and analysis




the management’s discussion and analysis (md&a) provides a review of the significant developments that have impacted canfor’s performance during
2006 relative to 2005. factors that could impact future operations are also discussed. these factors may be influenced by known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those stated in this discussion. in addition to the risks and uncertainties
discussed at the end of this md&a, factors that could have a material impact on any future oriented statements made herein include, but are not limited to:
general economic, market and business conditions; product selling prices; raw material and operating costs; foreign exchange rates; interest rates; changes
in law and public policy; the outcome of trade disputes; and opportunities available to or pursued by canfor.
       this md&a should be read in conjunction with canfor’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. the financial information
contained within this report has been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles. throughout this discussion, reference
is also made to ebitda (calculated as operating income before amortization), which canfor considers to be an important indicator for identifying trends in
the performance of each operating segment and of the company’s ability to generate funds to meet its debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements.
ebitda is not a generally accepted earnings measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows as determined in
accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles. as there is no standardized method of calculating ebitda, canfor’s use of the term may
not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
       the information in this report is as at february 22, 2007.
       all financial references are in millions of canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.
       in this md&a, canfor corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as “canfor” or “the company” unless the context requires otherwise.



overview of 2006

2006 was an important year for canfor, with several key accomplishments, but also a year of difficult market conditions and operating
challenges. prices for wood products deteriorated throughout the year, which, combined with the continued strength of the canadian
dollar, contributed to weaker financial results. the company experienced operating challenges from the beetle-infested wood
throughout central bc and in the start-up of new technology and capital in its mills.
      in 2006, the company continued to deliver on its strategy of focussing on the growth of its wood products business. to this end,
canfor reorganized its coastal assets and the nbsk pulp and paper assets were separated through the creation of the canfor pulp
income fund. canfor then distributed fund units representing 49.8% of the pulp and paper business to its shareholders, providing a
significant shareholder value return. canfor acquired the new south group of companies in the carolinas, diversifying product mix
and extending the company’s manufacturing base into the united states. furthermore, a long-term resolution was negotiated in the
softwood lumber dispute, which has provided a framework for greater certainty and, with the duty refunds fully received, financial
flexibility going forward with a strong balance sheet.
      markets are expected to continue to be difficult through 2007, but the company’s efforts are focused on reducing costs and
improving productivity and efficiency, which, combined with a loyal, growing customer base, will allow canfor to weather this downturn.
another challenge in 2007 will be to deal with the impact of the mountain pine beetle. the epidemic is well known, but the ever-
changing fibre quality impacts are not. significant effort is going into understanding the beetle impacts, both present and future, for the
company.

creation of the canfor pulp income fund
in order to better focus the growth and profitability of the company on wood products and to unlock shareholder value, on july 1, 2006
canfor transferred its prince george nbsk pulp and paper business (the pulp business) into the canfor pulp limited partnership and
created the canfor pulp income fund (cpif). for every canfor share owned, shareholders received, in a tax-free event, 0.1 units of cpif.
at that point, canfor shareholders owned all of the outstanding units of cpif, which represented a 20% indirect interest in the pulp
business, with canfor owning the other 80%.
      on november 30, 2006, canfor completed a further distribution to its shareholders consisting of an in-kind taxable dividend of 1.49
units of cpif for every 10 shares of canfor held. following this dividend, canfor owns a 50.2% interest in the pulp business.
      in the 6 months from its inception to december 31, 2006, cpif declared distributions of $1.24 per unit. the units reached a high
price of $14.75 in january 2007.

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                       softwood lumber agreement (sla) & return of duty deposits
                       the governments of canada and the united states implemented an agreement for the settlement of the softwood lumber dispute, which
                       began in may 2002. the agreement became effective on october 12, 2006, at which time the us department of commerce revoked all
                       existing antidumping (add) and countervailing (cvd) duty orders on softwood lumber shipped to the us from canada. approximately 81%
                       of deposits paid, together with accumulated interest, were returned to canadian lumber producers. the remaining 19% (us $1 billion)
                       was retained by the us government for distribution to the us forest industry petitioners and for use in funding “meritorious activities”
                       such as disaster relief, the promotion of sustainable forestry management and low income housing. while the agreement provides a
                       more certain framework for the next seven years, the risk of lumber tax and volume restrictions remains.
                            at december 31, 2006, canfor had received almost all of the deposits due and reported in income an amount of $551.2 million, net
                       of tax, or $3.87 per share.


                       new south companies, inc.
                       on march 6, 2006, canfor completed its acquisition of new south companies, inc. (new south) at a cost of us $181.6 million. new south
                       operates three sawmills with an annual capacity of 430 million board feet of southern yellow pine (syp), one remanufacturing facility and
                       two lumber treating plants located in north and south carolina and an international lumber import business. new south also operates
                       a lumber-trucking fleet of 55 trucks on the us east coast. canfor acquired top quartile assets and an experienced management team,
                       which will provide a footprint for future growth in one of the fastest growing housing regions in north america. the acquisition also
                       allowed canfor to diversify regionally and into new products and markets.


                       restructuring of coastal logging operations
                       on march 20, 2006, the owners of howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp) took another step towards ensuring the
                       viability of hslp by each contributing $45 million of assets. canfor contributed its englewood logging operation and associated timber
                       licences while oji paper canada ltd contributed cash to a new limited partnership, coastal fibre limited partnership (cflp). cflp
                       transferred these assets to western forest products inc. (wfp) in return for a long-term agreement with wfp to supply cflp with
                       fibre, and cflp will supply this fibre to hslp.


                       houston pellet plant and energy project
                       construction of the pellet plant, which is 60% owned by canfor, was completed in 2006 on time and on budget. the plant has met all
                       expectations on its ramp-up, achieving full capacity (135,000 tonnes of pellets on an annual basis to markets in japan and europe) by
                       the end of 2006. the other part of the project, the bark-fired energy system, is expected to be completed in march of 2007. this “green
                       energy” project, upon completion, will take all the bark produced at the houston sawmill and will provide the heat required for both
                       lumber and pellet production.

                       2006 compared to 2005

                       2006 was a challenging year, with difficult market conditions affecting the profitability of canfor’s lumber and panels segments. lumber
                       prices averaged 17% lower in 2006 than in 2005 and ended the year 37% lower than at the start of the year. osb prices averaged
                       32% lower in 2006 and ended the year at 51% less than at the start of the year. the decline in plywood prices was less dramatic, with
                       prices averaging 5% lower in the year. as a result of the poor pricing environment, market curtailments were taken in the year, which
                       reduced production by 116 million board feet of lumber, 84 million square feet of osb and 6 million square feet of plywood. the results
                       (excluding the duty refund) for the lumber and panels segments decreased by $342.7 million in 2006, to a combined operating loss of
                       $185.8 million.
                              in contrast, strong pulp markets in 2006 resulted in an excellent year for the pulp and paper segment. pulp prices rose throughout
                       the year, averaging 12% higher than 2005 and closing the year 22% higher than at the start of the year. as a result, the pulp and paper
                       segment’s operating income increased by $119.7 million, to $141.9 million in 2006.

                       as the majority of canfor’s sales are to us customers, the strengthening of the canadian dollar since 2003 has significantly reduced
                       revenues and net income. in 2006, the dollar averaged 88.2 cents, or nearly 7% higher than in 2005.

in addition to exposure to foreign exchange and changes in product prices, canfor’s financial results are impacted by seasonal factors
such as weather and building activity. adverse weather conditions can cause logging curtailments, which can affect the supply of raw
materials to sawmills, plywood and osb plants, and pulp mills. market demand also varies seasonally to some degree. for example,
building activity and repair and renovation work, which affects demand for lumber and panel products, is generally stronger in the spring
and summer months. shipment volumes are affected by these factors as well as by global supply and demand conditions. shortages
in railcar supply had an adverse impact on shipment volumes in the first quarter of 2005 and a container truckers’ strike at the port of
vancouver impacted offshore shipments in the third quarter of 2005.

                       following the spinout of the pulp business on july 1, 2006, canfor is continuing to consolidate 100% of the earnings from cplp, however,
                       the 20% non-controlling interest is reversed on the income statement beginning in the third quarter of 2006, and a further 29.8% at the
                       end of november, 2006, which affects comparability of net income of prior periods. the results from the new south operations, which
                       were acquired in march 2006, also impact the comparability of the quarterly results.


                       fourth quarter results

                       operating income of $656.1 million and net income of $465.3 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with an
                       operating loss of $14.7 million and a net loss of $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. diluted earnings per share was $3.26 in the
                       fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $(0.09) in the fourth quarter of 2005.
                              the fourth quarter 2006 results include the cvd and add refund ($717.7 million) and associated interest income ($97.7 million),
                       which together amounted to $551.2 million after tax. this was partially offset by restructuring, mill closure and severance costs of
                       $4.3 million after tax (2005 – $0.1 million), a write down of equity and other investments totaling $16.2 million after tax (2005 – nil), a
                       $9.9 million after-tax foreign exchange loss on long-term debt and temporary investments (2005 – $3.9 million), and $1.1 million of tax
                       adjustments related to prior year reassessments.
                              the comparability of the fourth quarter results in 2006 and 2005 was also impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar,

            24         which averaged 3% stronger in the fourth quarter of 2006 than in the same period in 2005, and weaker prices for lumber (25% lower),
                       osb (48% lower) and plywood (5% lower), partially offset by a 22% increase in pulp prices.

 report 2006

the fourth quarter results by business segment were as follows:


lumber
the lumber segment reported operating income of $645.2 million, or, excluding the duty refund, an operating loss of $72.5 million in
the fourth quarter, compared to an operating loss of $13.1 million in the same period in 2005. as a result of the weak market conditions,
a number of curtailments were taken in the quarter, primarily over the christmas period, which, in combination with the early onset of
winter weather, resulted in a 2% decline in production, to 1,028.7 million board feet, compared to the fourth quarter of 2005.
     the new south operations, which were acquired on march 6, 2006, produced 92.4 million board feet of lumber in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and contributed operating income of $3.3 million, which includes $8.0 million received from the coalition for fair lumber
imports following the implementation of the sla in october.


panels
the panels segment reported an operating loss of $26.5 million in the quarter, compared to an operating loss of $2.7 million in the fourth
quarter of 2005, mainly as a result of the sharp decline in osb prices.
     osb production was 184.8 million square feet in the fourth quarter of 2006, or 63% higher than the same period in 2005, primarily
as a result of the new osb joint venture in fort st. john (peace valley osb), which began production in late december 2005. production at
the polarboard operation was 8% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of taking four weeks of market-related downtime.
     plywood production of 105.7 million square feet was 4% lower than in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of taking 8 days of
market-related downtime at the two plywood plants over christmas, and other downtime totaling approximately 3 days due to various
mechanical issues in the quarter.


pulp and paper
the pulp and paper segment earned operating income of $50.1 million in the quarter, compared to operating income of $16.8 million
in the fourth quarter of 2005, mainly as a result of higher pulp prices. pulp production of 310,800 tonnes was 2% higher in the fourth
quarter of 2006, primarily as a result of maintenance downtime taken in the fourth quarter of 2005.


corporate costs
corporate costs were $12.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. the fourth
quarter 2006 expense includes $2.9 million of additional severance and lease costs related to the integration of slocan and canfor.
corporate costs in the fourth quarter of 2005 were higher than usual due to a $6.5 million accrual for the executive long-term incentive
plan related to the 2005 and 2004 fiscal years, $1.0 million of severance costs and higher donations, consulting fees and employee
relocation costs.


non-operating items
interest income of $88.6 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to interest expense of $9.3 million in the fourth
quarter of 2005. as mentioned above, the 2006 quarter included interest on the duty refund of $97.7 million.
     equity losses and other expenses amounted to $20.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, mainly comprising a $0.9 million loss
from equity investees, a $19.1 million write-down of the equity investment in lakeland mills and winton global lumber, and $0.4 million
of other write-downs. equity and other income in 2005 amounted to $7.9 million and was comprised of equity losses from affiliates of
$1.3 million, seaboard general partnership income of $8.9 million and miscellaneous income of $0.3 million. in the fourth quarter of
2005, a $2.3 million favourable adjustment was recorded to the loss on the timber take-back recorded in an earlier quarter.
     although the results from cplp continue to be consolidated in the pulp segment’s operating income, above, the non-controlling
interest is backed out on the income statement, which amounted to $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, and, therefore affects the
                                                                                                                                             25

                       2006 results by business segment

                       the following discussion of canfor’s operating results relates to the operating segments and the non-segmented items as per the
                       segmented information note in the company’s financial statements. canfor’s operations include the following three operating
                       segments: lumber, panels and pulp and paper.


                       lumber
                       the segment consists of logging and forestry operations, which harvested from approximately 10.9 million cubic metres of allowable
                       annual cut in northern british columbia, northern alberta and quebec in 2006, and operates 13 sawmills in british columbia, one in
                       alberta, one in quebec, two in south carolina and one in north carolina. the combined lumber production capacity of these sawmills
                       is 5.3 billion board feet. other operations include two lumber remanufacturing facilities, one in british columbia and one in washington
                       state, two whole-log chipping plants and two finger-joint mills. the south carolina operations include two lumber treating plants, a
                       finger joint plant, an international lumber import business and a trucking division. the segment also includes canfor’s wood products
                       marketing division, located in vancouver. canfor has a 60% interest in the houston pellet plant, which commenced operations late in
                       2006 and has an annual capacity to produce 135,000 oven-dried tonnes of wood pellets.

the segment’s operating income before the duty recovery declined by $264 million from 2005, driven largely by the impact of
unfavourable changes in both market prices and the us exchange rate. the aggregate negative impact of market-related indicators
totalled just over $186 million when comparing 2006 with 2005, and the resulting market-related curtailments contributed to a 4%
unfavourable production variance to 2005. further impacting financial performance relative to 2005 was the impact of a 13% reduction
in chip prices.


softwood lumber agreement (sla) & return of duty deposits
effective october 12, 2006, the governments of canada and the united states implemented an agreement for the settlement of the softwood
lumber dispute, which began in may 2002. the softwood lumber agreement (sla), which received formal approval by the canadian
parliament on december 14, 2006, has a term of seven years and provides for an extension of two years. either government can give notice
to terminate the sla after 23 months, but there is an additional 12-month notice period before the agreement can be terminated.
       under the terms of the sla, the us department of commerce revoked all existing antidumping (add) and countervailing (cvd) duty
orders on softwood lumber shipped to the us from canada. approximately 81% of deposits paid, together with accumulated interest,
were to be returned to canadian lumber producers. the remaining 19% (us $1 billion) was to be retained by the us government for
distribution to the us forest industry petitioners and for use in funding “meritorious activities” such as disaster relief, the promotion
of sustainable forestry management and low income housing. approximately us $40 million will be utilized for a joint us/canada
committee designed to strengthen and build the north american lumber market.
       in the fourth quarter, the full amount of the duty deposits and accumulated interest was refunded by the us government, with the
us $1 billion repayable by the canadian producers as a special assessment to be collected by the canadian government. at december 31,
2006, canfor had received cash of us $921.5 million and had accrued us $164.0 million for this assessment, which was paid to the canadian   27
government on january 31, 2007. the net duty refund recognized in the lumber segment’s operating income was $717.7 million.                 canfor

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                       new export tax structure under the sla
                       the sla requires that, effective october 12, 2006, an export tax on lumber shipped to the us be collected by the government of canada
                       and returned to the province of origin of the lumber. the province of bc had the right to choose between an export charge only (option
                       a) or a lower export charge with a quota (option b) for each of the bc coast and bc interior regions. the province of bc chose option a
                       for both the bc coast and the bc interior and will have the opportunity to change options on january 1, 2010 and january 1, 2013.
                             the export tax rate is determined monthly, and is based on the “random lengths framing lumber composite price” as follows:

                       export tax trigger price                                                                                                          tax rate

                       over us $355		                                                                                                                         0%
                       us $336–$355		                                                                                                                         5%
                       us $316–$335		                                                                                                                        10%
                       us $315 and under		                                                                                                                   15%


                             the sla also includes a “surge mechanism”, which increases the export tax rate for the month by 50% when the monthly volume
                       of exports from a region exceeds a certain “trigger volume” as defined in the sla.
                             with the exception of daaquam, which, as a border mill, benefits from tax-exempt status under the sla, canfor’s exports to the us
                       have been subject to the highest export tax bracket of 15% (with no applicable surge increase) since the agreement began as a result
                       of the current low composite pricing levels. canfor expensed export taxes of $22.0 million in 2006, subsequent to the implementation
                       of the sla.


                       markets
                       canfor markets lumber products throughout north america and overseas. in addition to its own production, canfor also markets lumber
                       produced from independent mills in north america and offshore countries to complement its product line. in 2006, approximately 78%
                       of canfor’s lumber sales were made to the us market and 13% to the canadian market. virtually all lumber destined for north america
                       was shipped by rail and truck. the remaining 9% of shipments went offshore, principally to japan, but also to korea, china, taiwan and
                       europe. offshore modes of transportation consisted of 85% by container ship and 15% by break-bulk vessel.
                             with the addition of new south companies in march of 2006, canfor expanded its product mix with the introduction of southern
                       yellow pine (syp) lumber and established a base for lumber imports from overseas. sales of spf lumber produced by canfor were down
                       by 5% over 2005, as a result of lower production. however, the acquisition of new south companies increased the total sales of lumber
                       by 11% for the year.
                             lumber markets deteriorated from the pace set in 2005. market demand declined slightly in the first half of the year and
                       deteriorated further during the second half of the year as the number of new homes constructed dropped significantly. home prices
                       have been steadily rising in the past two years, with recent increases largely fueled by housing investment speculators. as housing
                       affordability declined, many consumers were forced out of the market. as a result, inventories of new homes increased and new home
                       construction declined in many parts of the us, particularly in the second half of 2006. total annual housing starts were 1.8 million units 8
                       for 2006, a decrease of 13% over 2005. construction of single-family units decreased by 15% to 1.5 million units 8. canadian housing
                       starts increased slightly in 2006, from 225.5 million units to 227.4 million units 9.
                             the repair and remodeling sector of the housing market remained strong throughout 2006. although the two sectors typically
                       follow each other, repair and remodeling expenditures were buoyed by high levels of existing home sales during 2005 and 2006.
                       canfor’s lumber sales to home centre retailers increased in 2006 compared to 2005 and sales to the other market segments were
                       down slightly.

     offshore lumber demand was relatively strong for 2006, and canfor’s total offshore sales volumes increased by 14% over the
previous year. the japanese economy remained strong and consequently total housing starts increased from 1.236 million units in
2005 to 1.289 million units in 2006. western style 2x4 wooden housing construction was particularly strong, exceeding 100,000 units for
the year. canfor’s sales to china increased by 112% over 2005, to 34.7 million board feet, as a result of increased sales and marketing
efforts. major initiatives in china include the opening of canfor’s china office and the establishment of the canfor training center for
wood frame house construction, a school to teach north american style house construction to chinese builders.


operating performance
spf lumber production decreased by 164 million board feet, or 4%, from the prior year. as a result of the unfavourable market
environment, production curtailments representing approximately 116 million board feet of lumber were taken in 2006. the other
significant factors in the lower production are the effects of shift reductions and the plateau mill’s 9-day shutdown in the second quarter
of 2006 to complete work on the capital project.
     one of canfor’s key operating performance indicators is the percentage of prime lumber (or higher grade, such as square edge,
j-grade, machine stress rated lumber and select studs) that its mills produce. in 2006 this percentage improved moderately over
2005. however, two other key performance indicators in the areas of fibre recovery and mill productivity were both down slightly from
2005 levels. fibre recovery is a measure that looks at the volume of lumber returned per cubic meter of log processed, and productivity
is a measure of lumber production per labour hour. this combination of lower productivity and market curtailments contributed to an
increase in unit conversion costs. the most significant factors in the decrease in recovery and productivity in 2006 were the impact of
the smaller, dryer beetle infested logs and the longer than expected start-up curve at the plateau mill following the mill rebuild.
     during the fourth quarter, the grande prairie fingerjoint line, which had an annual capacity of 9 million board feet of lumber, was
closed indefinitely due to the difficult operating and market conditions.
     capital spending in 2006 totalled $76.9 million compared to $158.7 million in 2005. the major project in 2006, the houston pellet
plant, commenced operation in the fourth quarter. the second phase of the project includes a new energy system, which has an
anticipated start-up date of march 2007.                                                                                                      29

                       the new south operations produced 341.4 million board feet of syp for the period after the acquisition date of march 6, 2006. the annual
                       capacity of the graham sawmill in burlington, north carolina, is being expanded by 65 million board feet, to 170 million board feet. the
                       project, which is expected to be completed and fully ramped up by july 2008, includes a new second shift, a new kiln and additional
                       storage capacity at the mill location


                       panels
                       the panels segment includes two plywood plants, one in prince george and one in fort nelson, british columbia, with a combined
                       annual production capacity of 440 million square feet (3/8” basis). the segment also includes an oriented strand board (osb) facility,
                       polarboard, located in fort nelson, with an annual production capacity of 650 million square feet (3/8” basis) of osb and peace valley
                       osb in fort st. john, which is jointly owned with louisiana pacific corporation, and has an annual capacity of 820 million square feet
                       (3/8” basis) of osb, of which canfor’s share is 50%. a panel and fibre operation, located in new westminster, british columbia, produces
                       hardboard paneling, refined fibre and wood fibre composite mat products for building, automotive and industrial uses.

                       operating income in the panels segment declined by $78.7 million in 2006, primarily as a result of the sharp decline in osb prices,
                       combined with the impact of the strengthened canadian dollar.

                       markets
                       canfor’s osb production is primarily performance rated sheathing, which is used in wall construction of new homes and in repair and
                       remodeling projects. canfor’s plywood production is primarily sheathing, which is used to frame walls in new home construction. the
                       majority of canfor’s osb sales are to the us market and the majority of its plywood sales are to the canadian market. virtually all panel
                       products destined for north america were shipped by truck, rail and ocean vessel.
                              the north american structural panel market was, like the lumber market, affected by the decline in the housing market, particularly
                       during the latter half of 2006. considerable osb capacity has come on stream during the past two years, and, although there were mill
                       curtailments in the fourth quarter, there was still a surplus of supply in the market . consequently the 2006 price of osb averaged us
                       $217 per thousand square feet 3/8” basis (delivered to the north central region), down 32% from the 2005 average of us $319. there

            30         was also a surplus supply of plywood in 2006. however, fourth quarter shutdown announcements of two canadian plants helped balance

        canfor
                       supply with demand and resulted in higher prices for the fourth quarter of 2006. the average price during 2006 for 3/8” plywood delivered
c o r p o r at i o n   to toronto was cdn $367 per thousand square feet, down 5% from last year’s average price of cdn $387 per thousand square feet.

plywood shipments were 442 million square feet in 2006, a slight increase from 2005. plywood sales to industrial customers increased
significantly over the level reached in 2005.
      osb shipments were 441 million square feet , down 6% from last year. canfor has focused its marketing efforts on directing more
sales directly to the home centre, pro dealer, and industrial segments. these strategic customers were targeted in order capitalize on
better returns, geographical advantages, and potential customer growth.


operating performance
plywood - ebitda as a percentage of sales dropped 3% from 2005 driven largely by market prices and chip prices. despite scheduled

maintenance downtime at the north central plywood operation, not taken in the prior year, productivity improvements over 2005 drove a
modest gain in total plywood production. an improvement in prime product yield helped to minimize the negative impact of the canadian
dollar’s appreciation against the us dollar and the $20 decline in plywood pricing.
      a decision was made late in the fourth quarter to move to a modified shift schedule at the tackama plywood plant which will reduce the
total operating hours by approximately 30% commencing january 2007. the change is expected to reduce costs and improve productivity.


osb - ebitda as a percentage of sales fell from 25% in 2005 to -45% in 2006, with a selling price decline of over $140 per msf being

the most significant factor. although the polarboard facility lost nearly a month of production due to a fire and mechanical failures
and a further 4 weeks to market curtailment, gains in both productivity and efficiency were achieved over 2005, along with a moderate
improvement in unit cash conversion costs. polarboard’s operating performance in 2005 was impacted by its capacity expansion project
and various start-up issues and mechanical failures.
      peace valley osb continues to make anticipated and steady progress on its start-up. the mill was operating at expected levels at
the end of 2006 and is anticipated to be operating at its designed production capacity in early 2008. overall, steady progress is expected
to continue as the mill works at improving its uptime, efficiency, product quality and costs.
      also included in the panels segment is the panel and fibre operation, which produces hardboard, panelboard and erosion control
products. the operation recorded a relatively small loss for the year, which was largely attributable to the write-down of assets
constituting the woodmat business, which will be discontinued in mid-2007 as a result of automakers phasing out wood-based panels
in the doors of premium cars. an automatic bagger project implemented on the ecofibre line of business in 2006 is anticipated to result
in improved earnings in 2007.

                       pulp and paper
                       canfor’s pulp and paper segment is comprised of the canfor pulp limited partnership (cplp) and the taylor pulp mill. cplp produces
                       premium pulp and specialty paper. cplp’s premium pulp, which is produced from long northern british columbia wood fibres, offers
                       the strength sought by paper makers worldwide, and consists of the prince george, intercontinental and northwood pulp mills. premium
                       pulp is also referred to as northern bleached softwood kraft (nbsk). nbsk is primarily a bleached product; however, unbleached and
                       semi-bleached grades are also produced at the prince george pulp mill. all of the mills are located within five kilometres of each other
                       in prince george, british columbia with the exception of taylor, which is located near fort st. john, british columbia. the pulp mills
                       have the annual capacity to produce over one million tonnes of nbsk pulp. over 200,000 tonnes of bleached chemi-thermo mechanical
                       pulp (bctmp) are produced at the taylor mill. the paper machine, located at the prince george pulp and paper mill, has the capacity,
                       at optimum product mix levels, to produce 135 thousand tonnes of kraft paper. cplp’s pulp marketing division is located in vancouver.
                       all pulp produced by cplp, taylor and the howe sound limited partnership (discussed under related party transactions) is sold by
                       cplp’s sales and marketing group to customers primarily in north america, europe and asia. the kraft paper produced by cplp is sold
                       by a 50% owned general partnership to customers in north america and europe.


                       completion of spinout of the pulp income fund
                       on july 1, 2006, canfor completed the transfer of its prince george nbsk pulp and paper business (the pulp business) to cplp in
                       exchange for a $125 million promissory note, 14.254 million class a limited partnership units and 57.016 million class b exchangeable
                       limited partnership units (the spinout). canfor exchanged its class a limited partnership units for an equal number of fund units of
                       canfor pulp income fund (cpif). upon the completion of the spinout, the existing common shares of canfor were cancelled and canfor
                       shareholders were entitled to receive one new common share of canfor and 0.1 of a fund unit of cpif, with the distribution of the fund
                       units being structured as a return of capital on the canfor shares. as a result, on the date of the spinout, canfor shareholders owned
                       all of the issued and outstanding new common shares and all of the issued and outstanding fund units, with the outstanding fund units
                       representing a 20% indirect interest in the pulp business.
                            on november 30, 2006, canfor completed a distribution to its shareholders consisting of an in-kind taxable dividend of 1.49 fund
                       units of cpif for every 10 shares of canfor corporation held. following this dividend, canfor owned 35.494 million class b exchangeable
                       limited partnership units.
                            through its interest in cplp, which is indirectly exchangeable for fund units, canfor retains a 50.2% interest in the pulp business
                       and continues to consolidate cplp in its financial statements, with a provision for non-controlling interests.

        annual

 report 2006

     operating income of the pulp and paper segment increased by $119.7 million when compared to 2005 results. strong performance
at all mills, including an annual record for total tonnes produced, combined with improved markets and lower costs, and a 12% increase
in the average pulp list price, were partially offset by the strengthening canadian dollar. sales were also favourably impacted by the
shift of a higher volume of sales to north american markets, primarily at the expense of europe, which resulted in higher revenues, as
the north american market list prices averaged us $34 per tonne higher than those in europe. overall costs were favourable to 2005,
primarily due to the beneficial impact of lower chip prices, lower overall maintenance expense and lower energy costs resulting from
the full year of operation of the cogeneration project at the prince george pulp mill.


markets
cplp experienced strong and improved demand during 2006 compared to 2005. this was partly driven by increased consumption from
europe and asia, but was mostly due to the large reduction in canadian nbsk production capacity. approximately 1 million tonnes or
16% of canadian capacity was shut down in 2006, primarily as a result of mill closures in eastern canada due to high fibre and energy
costs and the negative effect on sales prices resulting from the strengthening canadian dollar.
     list prices increased in all markets during 2006, with the benchmark price for nbsk pulp delivered into northern europe averaging
us $683 per tonne in 2006 compared to us $611 in 2005. inventory levels for nbsk pulp declined to 24 days of supply, with 30 days of
supply generally considered to be a balanced market.

operating performance
an annual production record for total tonnes highlighted 2006, surpassing the previous record set in 2004 by 20,000 tonnes. nbsk
production during the year was 32,200 tonnes higher than 2005, as a result of improved performance and reliability at all facilities and
the ramp up of the prince george pulp mill to its full rate from its curtailed production in 2005 due to the precipitator installation. total
maintenance downtime for the prince george mills was 39 days in 2006, the same as 2005. the pulp mills have moved to an 18-month
cycle for major maintenance outages and stagger these between the three mills, with one facility missing a major shut each year.
     production of bctmp at the taylor mill fell by 6% in 2006, to 194,400 tonnes. equipment failures, chip supply and quality issues,
maintenance downtime of 9 days (2005 – 8 days) and a 3-day production curtailment over the christmas period, due to a shortage of chip
supply and market conditions, were the main reasons for the reduced production.
     the cogeneration facility at the prince george pulp mill operated for the full year in 2006 averaging 919 megawatt hours per day
compared to 788 in 2005. the facility was commissioned in 2005 and commenced power generation in may 2005. a 4-day outage was
taken in december 2006 to allow for the installation of improvements to upgrade the ash handling system, which contributed to the
reduced power generation during the fourth quarter. additional modifications to the cogeneration system are expected during 2007 to
further improve its performance.
     in 2006, the paper machine produced 1,700 tonnes more than in 2005. operations continue to focus on higher margin bleached

                       2007 outlook

                       the market price environment for wood products is expected to continue to be difficult through 2007. canfor is focusing its efforts on
                       reducing costs, improving productivity and efficiency, which, combined with a loyal and growing customer base, will allow the company
                       to weather this downturn in the cycle. another challenge in 2007 will be the impact of the mountain pine beetle. the epidemic is well
                       known, but the ever-changing fibre quality impacts are not. significant resources are being devoted to this issue. canfor’s strong balance
                       sheet provides options for growth, which the company will prudently explore.


                       lumber markets
                       housing construction forecasters14 believe that the us housing market is expected to remain at current levels until the second half of
                       2007. the inventory of unsold homes is predicted to decline, and once that has occurred new home construction is anticipated to increase
                       through the latter part of 2007 and into 2008. canadian housing starts are forecast to decrease by approximately 10% in 2007. the
                       outlook for the repair and remodeling market for 2007 is more positive than for new housing construction, but overall spending in that
                       sector is projected to be 4% lower than in 2006, largely because of reduced consumer confidence and lower existing home sales.
                              the supply of lumber from canada shipped to the us is expected to be lower in 2007 because of the effect of the softwood lumber
                       agreement (sla) recently implemented with the united states. as discussed earlier, under the sla, if lumber prices fall below certain
                       thresholds, canadian shipments to the us are subject to increasing levels of export tax. in addition, if actual shipments are higher than
                       a calculated maximum shipment volume set for each month, an additional surge tax will be added. in times of low lumber prices and
                       higher taxes, it is possible that the canadian industry will be forced to curtail production in order to reduce financial losses.
                              the supply of european lumber into north american markets has declined significantly and is expected to continue to be minimal
                       during 2007. considerable log shortages in europe, strong domestic demand, the euro/us exchange rate and low north american prices
                       are expected to keep most european produced lumber in their domestic market. demand is also anticipated to remain strong from
                       asian markets. total housing starts in japan are expected to surpass those in 2006, particularly in the 2x4 housing market. it is believed
                       that canadian demand for lumber will remain steady, as housing starts are predicted to remain above 200,000 units15 , particularly in
                       western canada as a result of strong oil and gas activity. as a result, north american lumber prices are expected to improve in the
                       second half of 2007.


                       panel markets
                       the near-term outlook for structural panels in 2007 is positive as a seasonal increase in both plywood and osb demand is expected in
                       time for the spring construction season. the second half of 2007 should show an increase in demand as us housing starts are projected
                       to increase above current levels. however, additional new osb capacity is expected to start up in 2007, which will put further pressure
                       on the already depressed market. although the supply for plywood will be more balanced in 2007, resulting from the shutdown of two
                       canadian mills in the fourth quarter of 2006, the low price of osb will continue to put downward pressure on plywood.


                       pulp markets
                       in january 2007, list price increases were announced in all markets. for northern europe, a us $30–$40 increase was announced, which
                       will take prices to us $760-$770 per tonne. in the united states, a us $20 increase will bring prices to us $790. the asian markets also
                       saw a us $20 list price increase announcement, which would take prices to us $730–$760 depending on the country of delivery. looking
                       ahead into 2007, it is believed that demand and pricing will hold up well through the first half of the year. while global economies are
                       projected to slow somewhat, the year is beginning with very low global inventories and nbsk market pulp is expected to continue to be
                       in short supply. some moderation in prices is expected in the second half of 2007.

labour disruption
on february 9, 2007 canadian national railway (cn) broke off negotiations with the united transportation union (utu), the union
representing its train conductors and yard service crews. the utu commenced strike action on february 10, 2007 and cn has been
running a reduced schedule since then using management replacement workers. the company is dependent on cn’s rail service for
its shipment of finished products and inbound deliveries of chemicals and fibre to cplp. contingency plans have partially mitigated the
effects of this work stoppage for both outbound and inbound shipments, but the company has incurred additional costs as a result of
the action.


2006 non-segmented items

corporate & other costs
corporate and other costs of $39.3 million, which are comprised of corporate, head office and information technology costs, increased
by $2.6 million in 2006 compared to 2005, as a result of recording $2.9 million of additional severance and lease costs related to the
integration of slocan and canfor, partially offset by lower travel spending.


interest income (expense)
net interest income of $56.2 million in 2006 reflects the receipt of $97.7 million in interest on the duty refund, as discussed earlier. excluding
the duty interest, the net interest expense of $41.5 million was $0.7 million lower than the net expense of $42.2 million in 2005.
     the $41.5 million expense in 2006 is net of interest income of $8.3 million, which was $4.4 million lower than in 2005 due to the
lower cash and cash equivalents balance in the first 10 months of the year. long-term debt interest of $40.6 million was expensed in
2006, or $9.0 million less than in 2005 as a result of principal reductions and the impact of the stronger canadian dollar on us dollar
interest payments. other interest expenses of $9.2 million in 2006 were primarily related to short-term borrowings, credit facility and
letter of credit fees, standby charges and interest penalties on tax reassessments, which increased by $3.3 million in total over 2005.


other income (expense)
other expenses amounted to $29.6 million in 2006, compared to other income of $12.8 million in 2005. the expense in 2006 includes
a $19.1 million write down of the company’s equity investment in lakeland mills and winton global lumber, $5.9 million of costs
incurred by cplp directly on the spinout transaction ($2.2 million of which are backed out in the non-controlling interest line), $3.6
million of corporate development costs incurred by canfor to effect the segregation of the pulp business, $0.2 million of equity losses
from affiliates and miscellaneous expenses of $1.3 million, partially offset by $0.5 million of gains on the sale of property. other income
in 2005 was comprised of equity income from affiliates of $2.7 million, seaboard general partnership income of $8.9 million and $2.1
million in gains on the sale of property, partially offset by losses on the disposal of investments.
     canfor’s affiliated companies, which are accounted for on an equity basis, consist of lakeland mills ltd., winton global lumber
ltd., vernon seed orchard co. and kyahwood forest products. lakeland and winton global operate sawmills in the prince george region
and supply wood chips to canfor’s pulp mills. kyahwood, which is owned 49% by canfor, is a value-added lumber facility in moricetown,
british columbia. the combined income of these affiliates decreased by $2.9 million from 2005 as a result of market and foreign
exchange factors, similar to those discussed in the lumber segment.
     the $8.9 million in income from the seaboard general partnership recorded in 2005 was the result of asset sales. canfor has a
minority interest in the partnership.

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                       unusual expense (2005)
                       the “unusual expense” of $8.8 million ($6.2 million after tax) recorded in 2005 was for the loss on timber taken back by the government
                       of british columbia (the crown) following the introduction of its forestry revitalization plan in 2003, in which licensees, including canfor,
                       were required to return 20% of their aac from replaceable tenures to the crown. approximately half of this volume was redistributed to
                       create opportunities for woodlots, community forests and first nations and the other half was made available for public auction.
                             the effect of the timber take-back resulted in a reduction of approximately 2.4 million cubic metres to canfor’s existing aac on
                       its replaceable tenures. canfor worked with the government to identify those licenses and operating areas that were to be returned to
                       the crown, and negotiations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. canfor received compensation of $57.0 million for the loss
                       of tenures and a $5.0 million payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs. canfor does not expect that the take-
                       back will adversely affect its ability to obtain adequate timber supplies for its operations in the future or materially affect the costs of
                       obtaining those supplies.


                       income taxes
                       an income tax expense of $169.4 million was recorded in 2006 (2005 – $12.4 million).
                             the most significant factor when comparing the 2006 and 2005 tax figures, other than the size of the respective taxable income
                       figures, is the impact of a change in federal corporate income tax rates in 2006 and a reduction in the british columbia corporate tax rate
                       in 2005, which gave rise to favourable adjustments of $41.9 million in 2006 and $21.0 million in 2005, as a result of revaluing the future
                       income tax liability balances. in addition, the income tax expense is net of the benefit of utilizing the remaining $14.1 million of deferred
                       tax credits (2005 – $12.5 million) derived from restructuring howe sound pulp and paper limited in 2001.


                       discontinued operations

                       coastal operations
                       on march 20, 2006, canfor completed the transfer of its englewood logging operation and associated timber licences (englewood
                       operations) to a new limited partnership, coastal fibre limited partnership (cflp), jointly owned with oji paper canada ltd., which
                       contributed cash of equal value. in consideration of the transfer canfor received a partnership interest valued at $45.0 million, which
                       approximates book value of the assets transferred. on the same day, cflp transferred the englewood operations and cash of $35
                       million to western forest products inc. (wfp) in return for a long-term agreement with wfp to supply cflp with fibre, and cflp will
                       supply this fibre to hslp. canfor’s 50% interest in cflp has been proportionately consolidated and the long-term fibre agreement with
                       wfp, which is valued at $40.0 million, has been recorded in “long-term investments and other assets” on the balance sheet, and will
                       be amortized as the fibre is supplied to cflp.
                             an after-tax loss of $3.9 million from the coastal operations was recorded in 2006, comprised of an operating loss to march 20,
                       2006 and a loss on the disposition of the englewood operations. prior to being shut down on december 15, 2005, the coastal operations
                       incurred a loss of $4.4 million after tax including $2.5 million of after-tax charges for severance, lease termination costs and an
                       allowance for bad debts. log shipments of 180.1 thousand cubic metres were made in 2006 prior to the transfer in march and were
                       862.1 thousand cubic metres in 2005.


                       sawmills
                       canfor completed the sale of its fort st. james, slocan and valemount sawmills in british columbia for total cash proceeds of $59.0
                       million in the second quarter of 2005. after-tax operating income of $3.3 million was earned by these operations in 2005 prior to the sale
                       dates and a net after-tax loss of $4.7 million was recorded on the dispositions. lumber shipments from discontinued operations in 2005
                       were 120.5 million board feet 16 up to the respective dates of disposition of the mills in the second quarter.

transactions with related parties

howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp)
hslp is jointly owned by canfor and oji paper co., ltd and operates the port mellon kraft pulp and newsprint mill. canfor no
longer reflects its share of hslp’s results in its financial statements, as the investment was written off in 1998. as discussed under
discontinued operations, the transfer of the englewood logging operations and associated tenures to wfp in exchange for a long-term
fibre supply agreement is resulting in lower fibre costs for hslp, which, in conjunction with other marketing and debt restructuring,
should assist the mill’s efforts to return to sustainable profitability in the future. canfor and oji are in the late stages of restructuring
hslp’s long-term debt obligations.
       canfor markets the pulp production of hslp, for which in 2006 it received commissions of $3.4 million under the terms of its
agency sales agreement 17. at december 31, 2006, canfor had prepaid $27.9 million to hslp in advance of the due date of receivables
for pulp marketed, or to be marketed, and collected on its behalf. this agreement provides for oji to prepay up to a maximum amount
of $60 million and canfor up to a maximum of $50 million, which is used as short-term operating funds by hslp. canfor charges hslp
a market rate of interest for the period of prepayment, which amounted to $2.3 million in 2006 and the prepayment is covered by the
assignment of current and future accounts receivable. in addition, canfor has granted extended credit terms to hslp up to a maximum
of $10 million.
       in 2006 canfor purchased $17.4 million of pulp logs for resale to hslp at canfor’s cost, to meet hslp’s future requirements.
there was a balance outstanding of $10.2 million at december 31, 2006 for these logs. canfor charged hslp a market rate of interest
for this service.
       under a long-term fibre agreement with wfp (discussed in discontinued operations), cflp purchases chips for resale to hslp,
which amounted to $17.4 million in 2006. there was a balance outstanding of $13.4 million at december 31, 2006. cflp charges hslp
a commission for this service. these amounts have been proportionately consolidated in canfor’s financial statements.
       canfor sawmills sold chips to hslp in the amount of $4.7 million in 2006, for which there was no balance outstanding at december
31, 2006. canfor provides management, fibre supply and other services to hslp at cost, for which it charged $1.0 million in fees for 2006.
there was a balance outstanding of $0.7 million at december 31, 2006 with respect to these fees and other receivables.


lakeland and winton global
canfor purchases pulp chips and lumber, at market value, from lakeland mills ltd. and winton global lumber ltd., in which it holds a
one-third equity interest. in 2006, canfor purchased $8.6 million in pulp chips and $9.4 million in lumber from these mills. canfor earned
commission income of $0.3 million on lumber sales in 2006.


kyahwood forest products
in 2006, kyahwood, a joint venture operated by canfor and the moricetown first nation, provided remanufacturing services, at market
value, to canfor in the amount of $5.1 million.


other
other related party transactions include log purchases by canfor of $4.0 million from takla track & timber ltd., in which canfor holds
a 22% investment. canfor holds a minority interest in seaboard general partnership, which provided shipping services to canfor through
seaboard international shipping company amounting to $3.6 million in 2006.

                       canfor’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities, at 2.2:1 at the end of 2006, was slightly lower than the 2005 ratio of 2.4:1, mainly
                       due to the income tax payable of $235.4 million (compared to $4.1 million in 2005) and the accrual of the special duty assessment of
                       $186.7 million, as discussed earlier.
                             as a result of the duty refund received in the last two months of the year, canfor’s net debt was in a negative position, resulting
                       in a net debt to equity ratio (defined as the ratio of total debt, net of cash equivalents and highly liquid short-term investments, to
                       shareholders’ equity) of (26):126, compared to 14:86 in 2005.

at the end of 2006, canfor had $1,023.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $126.0 million of short-term deposits. the changes in
the components of these cash flows during 2006 are detailed in the consolidated cash flow statement of the financial statements. the
more significant changes are discussed below:


operating activities
in 2006, canfor generated cash of $1,140.2 million from operations, compared to $193.3 million generated in the prior year. the duty
refund and associated interest were the main reasons for the increase in cash. excluding the duty refund, operating earnings before
amortization (ebitda) decreased by $194.6 million in the year and changes in non-cash working capital generated $484.1 million of cash,
as compared to a negative $55.8 million in 2005.
     in 2006, the major changes in non-cash working capital were a $33.3 million increase in accounts receivable, a $223.9 million
increase in income taxes payable, a $28.8 million decrease in inventories and a $161.7 million increase in accounts payable. the
increase in accounts receivable at year-end is primarily due to the effect of the weaker canadian dollar on us dollar receivables, while
the decrease in inventories is mainly as a result of the sawmill curtailments during the christmas period. the increase in income taxes
payable reflects the taxes payable on the duty refund and associated interest, while the increase in accounts payable is primarily due
to the $187.7 million (us $164.0 million) special duty assessment accrual, as discussed in the lumber segment, partially offset by
reductions in other payables. income tax payments of $8.0 million were made in the year (2005 - $2.8 million) and net interest received
amounted to $46.0 million including $97.7 million of interest on the duty refund (2005 – net interest paid of $41.9 million).


financing activities
in 2006, financing activities consumed $14.3 million of cash, mainly comprising scheduled long-term debt payments of $100.2 million,
$23.0 million of net repayments on operating bank loans and $17.6 million of distributions paid by cplp to non-controlling interests.
these outflows were largely offset by $126.7 million of proceeds from new debt, including us $110.0 million of new financing by cplp
(discussed below).
     in 2005, financing activities consumed $81.3 million in cash, mainly comprising scheduled long-term debt payments of $68.4
million, $13.8 million for the repurchase of canfor shares for cancellation, and $1.9 million received on the exercise of stock options.
no cash dividends were paid in 2006 or 2005.


investing activities
cash used in investing activities amounted to $417.6 million in 2006. the main cash outflows were $206.1 million for the acquisition of
new south, as discussed earlier, $119.0 million for the purchase of highly liquid short-term investments following the receipt of the duty
refund, and capital expenditures of $107.1 million. these outflows were partially offset by $2.8 million from the sale of property, plant
and equipment and the receipt of an $11.4 million final incentive payment related to the electrical cogeneration project at the prince
george pulp mill.                                                                                                                            39

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                            in 2005, investing activities consumed $248.8 million in cash. the main cash outflows were $334.5 million of capital expenditures
                       and a $50.0 million payment to hslp for tax losses. proceeds from investing activities included $62.0 million in compensation from the
                       government of british columbia for timber tenures and associated infrastructure, as discussed under unusual expense above, $59.0
                       million from the sale of the fort st. james, slocan and valemount sawmills, $8.3 million of electrical cogeneration incentive payments
                       and $7.5 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, the majority of which was from the sale of surplus land.
                            of the $107.1 million that canfor invested in capital assets in 2006, $48.0 million was to improve the company’s cost position,
                       productivity and production capacity. the other $59.0 million was to maintain the existing productive capacity of the operations or to
                       ensure canfor’s safety and environmental performance. the largest investments in the year included the energy ($19.1 million), pellet
                       plant ($12.8 million) and planer ($2.5 million) projects at the houston operation, $8.7 million for the plateau project and $2.3 million for
                       peace valley osb.
                            in 2005, capital expenditures of $334.5 million were made, mainly comprised of $103.7 million for the plateau mill modernization
                       project, $85.0 million for the construction of peace valley osb, $26.7 million for the electrical cogeneration facility and $12.9 million for
                       the prince george pulp mill’s recovery boiler precipitator upgrade.


                       financial requirements and liquidity

                       at the end of 2006, canfor had $451.0 million of bank operating lines of credit available, of which $1.1 million was drawn down and an
                       additional $53.9 million was utilized for several standby letters of credit. these credit facilities are presented as “operating bank loans”
                       on the consolidated balance sheet.
                            provisions contained in canfor’s long-term borrowing agreements limit the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur
                       and the amount of dividends it may pay on its common shares. the amount of dividends the company is permitted to pay under its long-
                       term borrowing agreements is determined by reference to consolidated net earnings less certain restricted payments. as at december
                       31, 2006, the company was permitted under these agreements to incur $1.6 billion of additional long-term debt and to pay up to $831
                       million, or $5.83 per share, in dividends on its common shares.
                            on january 31, 2007, canfor paid us $164.0 million to the government of canada with respect to the special assessment arising
                       from the duty refunds. 2006 income tax payments of approximately $230.0 million will be made in 2007.
                            in 2007, canfor plans to invest approximately $170.0 million on capital projects, including $68.0 million for maintenance of business
                       and $102.0 million for a number of improvement projects, including the graham sawmill capacity expansion project and the completion
                       of the houston energy project.
                            in 2007, $87.5 million is required for scheduled long-term debt repayments.
                            canfor intends to finance its planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments from existing cash reserves and cash
                       generated from its operations.


                       new financing in 2006
                       on november 30, 2006, cplp completed a debt financing by private placement of us $110 million of unsecured notes (the notes). the
                       notes bear interest at 6.41% and are repayable in full on their maturity date of november 30, 2013. the proceeds from the issuance
                       of the notes were used to repay the $125 million promissory note to canfor. cplp also entered into a 3-year $75 million syndicated
                       unsecured revolving bank credit facility (the revolving facility) with $30.6 million of the revolving facility reserved for a standby letter
                       of credit. the revolving facility bears interest and fees at rates that vary depending on the ratio of net debt to operating earnings before
                       interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and which may be based on lenders’ canadian prime rate, bankers acceptances, us base
                       rate or us libor rate.
                            in the fourth quarter of 2006, new south obtained a new us $50 million line of credit, expiring in 2011, to replace their existing
            40         line of $37.5 million.

other contractual obligations not included above are:

       purchase obligations and contractual obligations in the normal course of business. for example, purchase obligations of a more
       substantial dollar amount generally relate to the pulp business and are subject to “force majeure” clauses. in these instances, actual
       volumes purchased may vary significantly from contracted amounts depending on canfor’s requirements in any given year.

       deferred reforestation, for which a liability of $110.5 million has been recorded at december 31, 2006 (2005 – $111.0 million).
       the reforestation liability is a fluctuating obligation, based on the volume of timber harvested. the future cash outflows are a
       function of the actual costs of silviculture programs and of harvesting at the time and are based on, among other things, the
       location of the harvesting.

       capital expenditures, as no significant contractual obligations had been entered into at december 31, 2006.



critical accounting estimates

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded in the financial statements. management regularly reviews these
estimates and assumptions based on currently available information. while it is reasonably possible that circumstances may arise which
cause actual results to differ from these estimates, management does not believe it is likely that any such differences will materially
affect canfor’s financial position.


employee future benefits
canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing both pension and other retirement benefits to most of its
salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans. canfor also provides certain health care
benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees. the costs and related obligations of the pension and other retirement
benefit plans are accrued in accordance with the recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants (cica).
       canfor uses independent actuarial firms to perform actuarial valuations of the fair value of pension and other retirement benefit
plan obligations. the application of these recommendations requires judgments regarding certain assumptions that affect the accrued
benefit provisions and related expenses, including the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations, the expected
rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and the assumed health care cost trend rates. management and the
board of directors’ pension committee evaluate these assumptions annually based on experience and the recommendations of its
actuarial firms. changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses
are in excess of 10% of the greater of the accrued benefit obligations and the market-related value of plan assets.

                       increase (decrease) in total service and interest cost                                                  $     2.6                $      (2.0)



                       deferred reforestation
                       canfor accrues an estimate, in current dollars, of its future liability to perform forestry activities, defined to mean those silviculture
                       treatments or activities that are carried out to ensure the establishment of a free-growing stand of young trees, including logging road
                       rehabilitation. an estimate is recorded in the financial statements based on the number of hectares of timber harvested in the period.
                       the actual costs that will be incurred in the future may vary based on, among other things, the actual costs at the time.


                       future income taxes
                       in accordance with cica recommendations, canfor recognizes future income tax assets when it is more likely than not that the future
                       income tax assets will be realized. this assumption is based on management’s best estimate of future circumstances and events. if
                       these estimates and assumptions are changed in the future, the value of the future income tax assets could be reduced or increased,
                       resulting in an income tax expense or recovery. canfor reevaluates its future income tax assets on a regular basis.


                       impairment of goodwill
                       goodwill, which is the excess of the purchase price paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired, is not amortized
                       but is assessed annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.

impairment of long-lived assets
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable, as measured by comparison of their net book value to the estimated future cash flows
generated by their use. impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally using discounted future cash flows expected
from their use and eventual disposition.


changes in accounting policies

effective january 1, 2007:

financial instruments
the cica has issued three new handbook sections which will apply to canfor as of january 1, 2007: section 3855 “financial instruments”,
section 3865 “hedges” and section 1530 “comprehensive income.” section 3855 prescribes when a financial instrument should be
recognized on the balance sheet and at what amount. it also specifies how to present financial instrument gains and losses. section
3865, which is optional, provides alternative treatments to section 3855 for when qualifying transactions are designated as hedges for
accounting purposes. section 1530 introduces new requirements for situations when certain gains and losses must be temporarily
presented outside of net income in a new statement of comprehensive income, which will be presented with equal prominence to the
regular income statement.
      canfor has elected not to utilize hedge accounting on its existing derivative financial instruments (which are discussed below, under
financial market risk). as a result, these instruments, which were previously not recognized on the balance sheet, and gains and losses
were not recognized until the contracts were exercised, will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. at january 1, 2007, the fair
value of these derivative instruments amounted to $3.9 million, representing unrealized losses, which will be recorded as an opening
retained earnings adjustment, with changes in fair value to be subsequently recorded in the income statement.
      at december 31, 2006, canfor had a deferred unrealized foreign exchange loss on long-term debt of $14.2 million on its balance
sheet as a result of terminating a previous hedging relationship under the accounting rules in existence in 2002. deferred financing costs
of $2.8 million were also recorded at december 31, 2006. as a result of implementing section 3855, these balances will be transferred
to opening retained earnings at january 1, 2007. the foreign exchange translation adjustment on the balance sheet, $3.0 million at
december 31, 2006, will be transferred to the opening balance of “accumulated other comprehensive income”.
      the aggregate opening retained earnings adjustment resulting from the implementation of the new policy on january 1, 2007 is
approximately $15 million, net of future income taxes.


effective january 1, 2006:

no new accounting policies were adopted in 2006.


cash and cash equivalents
the presentation of “cash and cash equivalents” on the balance sheet was amended in 2006 to exclude short-term investments with
maturity dates greater than 90 days from the original acquisition date, with changes in these balances presented as investing activities
on the cash flow statement. the definition of “cash and cash equivalents” on the cash flow statement was also amended to exclude credit
facilities labeled as “operating bank loans” on the balance sheet, with changes in these balances now presented as financing activities.
these changes in presentation reduced the prior year’s cash and cash equivalents balance on the balance sheet by $7.4 million and by
$4.0 million on the cash flow statement.

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                       effective january 1, 2005:

                       variable interest entities
                       effective january 1, 2005, canfor adopted the cica’s new accounting guideline for the consolidation of variable interest entities. the
                       primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting
                       rights. the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfor’s financial position or results of operations.


                       vendor rebates
                       in september 2005, the cica issued a new abstract, eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer (including a
                       reseller of the vendor’s products), effective january 1, 2006. the eic clarifies the measurement and presentation of vendor discounts
                       and volume rebates, which canfor had previously presented under “costs and expenses”. canfor elected to adopt the standard effective
                       january 1, 2005, which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by $103.3 million in that year.


                       risks and uncertainties

                       risks and uncertainties fall into the general business areas of markets, international commodity prices, competition, currency exchange
                       rates, environmental issues, forest land base, government regulations and policy reform, and, for canadian companies, a history of
                       trade disputes and issues and aboriginal land claims. the future impact of the various uncertainties and potential risks described in the
                       following paragraphs cannot be quantified or predicted with certainty. however, canfor does not foresee unmanageable adverse effects
                       on its business operations from, and believes that it is well positioned to deal with, such matters as may arise.


                       aboriginal issues
                       canadian judicial decisions have recognized the continued existence in the country of aboriginal title and rights to lands continuously
                       used or occupied by aboriginal groups. as a result, aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal title and rights over substantial portions
                       of british columbia, including areas where canfor’s forest tenures and other operations are situated. these decisions have added to
                       uncertainty regarding property rights in canada (including forest tenure and other resource rights), particularly in those areas where
                       treaties have not been concluded with aboriginal groups, such as much of british columbia. the courts have also confirmed that a duty
                       to consult with aboriginal groups arises when the crown has knowledge of the potential existence of an aboriginal right or title and
                       contemplates conduct that might adversely impact it, but has not extended this duty to third parties, such as forest companies.
                             as issues relating to aboriginal rights, title and consultation continue to be heard, developed and resolved in canadian courts,
                       canfor will continue to cooperate, communicate and exchange information and views with aboriginal groups and government in order
                       to foster good relationships and minimize risks to its tenures and operational plans, and will continue to participate with the crown in
                       its consultation processes including aboriginal groups. due to their complexity, it is not expected that the issues regarding aboriginal
                       rights and title or consultation will be finally resolved in short term and, accordingly, the impact of these issues on the timber supply
                       from crown lands and canfor’s tenures and on canfor’s operations is unknown at this time.
                             canfor believes in building mutually beneficial and lasting relationships with local first nations with treaty and aboriginal rights or
                       whose interests overlap with canfor’s areas of operations. canfor has also formalized some of its relationships with aboriginal people
                       through agreements that generally seek to increase first nations’ participation in canfor’s planning and harvesting activities while
                       strengthening canfor’s access to fibre. canfor also has numerous business relationships ranging from short and long-term contracts
                       with aboriginal businesses to jointly holding forest licenses with local first nations. currently, canfor is in the process of assessing
                       and analyzing canfor’s relationships with aboriginal peoples, and is developing a corporate strategy to monitor, assess, and address
                       risks and opportunities involving first nations.
                             consistent with canfor’s belief in seeking opportunities to improve its relationships with aboriginal peoples, canfor has created
            44         and filled a permanent position for a manager of aboriginal affairs to advise canfor and assist in negotiations and strategy development.
        canfor         the manager of aboriginal affairs will also be responsible for helping to ensure that canfor monitors and fulfills any obligations it has
c o r p o r at i o n
                       arising out of contracts signed with local aboriginal peoples.

chip revenues
wood chips are a by-product of canfor’s lumber manufacturing process and are primarily sold to cplp. these chips are the principal
raw material utilized by cplp in its pulp manufacturing operations. canfor has a fibre supply agreement with cplp, which contains
a pricing formula that currently results in cplp paying canfor market prices for wood chips and also contains a provision to adjust the
pricing formula to reflect market conditions. canfor currently provides approximately 65% of cplp’s chip requirements. if lumber market
conditions are such that canfor is unable to provide the current volume of chips to cplp as a result of sawmill closures, whether temporary
or permanent, cplp’s financial results could be materially affected. similarly, if cplp were to cease pulp operations for an extended period
of time, canfor would have a limited market for its chip supply and this could affect its ability to run the sawmills economically.


environmental issues
the species at risk act (sara) was proclaimed by the government of canada in june 2003. the purpose of the act is to prevent the
extinction or extirpation of wildlife species present in canada for at least 50 years, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are
extirpated, endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and encourage the management of other species to prevent them
from becoming at risk. the economic implications of sara are potential reductions in timber harvests and increases in harvesting costs,
none of which can be predicted at this time.
     in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto agreement. the climate change plan for canada, which set
out canada’s kyoto implementation strategy, indicated that federal and provincial energy and environment ministers endorsed the
principle that companies that had taken early action should not be disadvantaged by an output-based emissions regime. canfor was an
early signatory to the climate change voluntary challenge and registry program, a federal program introduced in 1997 to encourage
companies to inventory and track their greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs) and take actions to stabilize and reduce those emissions.
canfor has implemented projects that have improved energy efficiency and displaced purchased fossil fuel energy with renewable
biomass energy, thereby reducing ghg emissions both on absolute and per unit of production bases. canfor has opportunities to further
reduce ghg emissions particularly through increased utilization of sawmill wood residuals.
     in november 2003, the forest products association of canada (fpac), on behalf of canfor and other forest products companies,
signed a “memorandum of understanding respecting action on climate change” (mou) with the federal government. the mou
established a framework for expected upcoming negotiations of a pulp and paper sector covenant with the federal government. the mou
specified that, “the government of canada will work with fpac parties and other industries to design a system that will not disadvantage
those firms that have taken early action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. the change of government that occurred in early 2006
has resulted in uncertainty about whether the 2003 mou signed between fpac and the then liberal government will be honored by the
current conservative government. the conservative government issued a notice of intent (noi) in october 2006 to regulate priority air
pollutants and ghgs under a clean air act to protect the health of canadians and the environment. the noi establishes short (2010 –
2015), medium (2020 – 2025) and long-term (after 2050) time frames for the regulation of ghgs and priority pollutants. the forest
products sector is named as one of the targeted sectors for regulation, but it is anticipated that the government will consult with the
industry prior to setting the regulations. the frameworks for short-term regulations and specific short-term emission reduction targets
are expected to be announced early in 2007, followed by consultation with industry sectors and the public.

                       management’s discussion and analysis




                            the air quality forum process that the pulp and paper sector has undertaken with non-governmental organizations and the federal
                       government over the past two years has generated data and information that could be used to develop emission reduction targets. the
                       wood products sector has been gathering data with environment canada, but substantial further data gathering is necessary to provide
                       a basis for future regulatory targets. it is expected that the pulp and paper sector regulatory timeline would be earlier in the short-
                       term target window (2010 – 2015, as above) and for wood products, later in the short-term window. it is unclear at this time what the
                       specific regulatory targets will be and the related economic impact on canfor and on the industry. there is the potential that the federal
                       government could offer incentives (such as the recently announced renewable power production incentive) and mechanisms such as
                       emission trading to help mitigate the impact of future air emission reduction regulations. furthermore, some of the parameters targeted
                       for federal regulation are already regulated by provincial jurisdictions. to avoid duplication between federal and provincial regulatory
                       jurisdictions, equivalency agreements would need to be signed.
                            canada-wide standards have been established by the government of canada for respirable particulate (pm 2.5) and ozone levels
                       in the ambient air, which will become effective in 2010. it is not clear how the canada-wide standards will interrelate with the pending
                       federal clean air act and related regulations and targets.
                            canfor has two remaining ‘tier 1’ burners in british columbia, and is one of three companies utilizing a third tier 1 burner located
                       at another company’s premises. tier 1 burners are regulated by the bc ministry of environment for phase out by december 31, 2007.
                       one of the two canfor tier 1 burners at its houston sawmill will be shut down before the end of 2007, with the start-up of the houston
                       pellet joint venture in september 2006 and a bark-fired energy system at the houston sawmill in march 2007. it is anticipated that the
                       co-operative burner located in quesnel will not be required beyond 2007 because of local demand that will utilize surplus wood residuals
                       in the area. canfor is seeking economically viable solutions for the remaining tier 1 burner at its fort st. john sawmill.


                       financial market risk
                       demand for forest products, both wood products and pulp and paper, is closely related to global business conditions and tends to be
                       cyclical in nature. product prices can be subject to volatile change. canfor, like the majority of the canadian forest products industry,
                       competes in a global market and the majority of its products are sold in us dollars. consequently, changes in foreign currency
                       relationships can impact canfor’s revenues and earnings.


                       financial instruments
                       subject to risk management policies approved by its board of directors, canfor, from time to time, uses simple derivative instruments,
                       such as forward exchange contracts and futures contracts to hedge future movements of exchange rates and commodity prices.
                            at december 31, 2006, canfor had entered into pulp swaps to hedge future pulp sales, along with matching us dollar forward exchange
                       contracts. there was a combined unrealized loss of $1.0 million on the pulp swaps and forward contracts at the end of the period.
                            at december 31, 2006, canfor had entered into energy derivatives to hedge future natural gas and diesel purchases. there were
                       unrealized losses of $2.9 million on these contracts, respectively, at the end of the period.
                            since canfor’s long-term debt is primarily fixed in rate, there is no significant impact to net income when interest rates change.

the sensitivity of canfor’s results to currency fluctuations and prices for its principal products, when operating at full capacity, is
estimated to be approximately as follows:

the above sensitivities do not reflect the correlation that canfor believes exists between us dollar denominated commodity prices and
the us dollar exchange rate.


government regulation
canfor is subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety and other laws and regulations
imposed by federal, provincial and local authorities, including those governing the use, storage, handling, generation, treatment,
emission, release, discharge and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of contaminated soil and ground
water and the health and safety of employees. if canfor is unable to extend or renew a material approval, licence or permit required
by such laws, or if there is a delay in renewing any material approval, licence or permit, canfor’s business, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. future events such as any changes in these laws and regulations
or any change in their interpretation or enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown conditions, may give rise to additional
expenditures or liabilities.


income trust taxation
on october 31, 2006 the canadian federal government announced proposed plans to apply a tax on distributions from publicly traded
income trusts, such as the canfor pulp income fund. for existing income trusts, the government is proposing a four-year transition
period, until the 2011 taxation year, before the tax would be applicable.


labour agreements and competition for professional and skilled labour
any labour disruptions and any costs associated with labour disruptions at canfor’s mills could have a material adverse effect on its
production levels and results of operations. canfor’s various collective agreements with the uswa (united steelworkers of america), the
cep (communications, energy and paperworkers union) and ppwc (pulp, paper and woodworkers of canada) have terms expiring in
april 2008 and june 2009. any future inability to negotiate acceptable contracts could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected
workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to unionized workers.
       market conditions may cause shortages of both professional and skilled labour, which could have an adverse impact on the
operation and management of canfor’s facilities.

                       maintenance obligations and facility disruptions
                       canfor’s manufacturing processes are vulnerable to operational problems that can impair canfor’s ability to manufacture its products.
                       canfor could experience a breakdown in any of its machines, or other important equipment, and from time to time, planned or unplanned
                       maintenance outages that cannot be performed safely or efficiently during operations must be conducted. such disruptions could cause a
                       significant loss of production, which could have a material adverse effect on canfor’s business, financial condition and operating results.


                       mountain pine beetle
                       the infestation of mountain pine beetle (dendroctonus ponderosae) has reached critical levels in many timber supply areas throughout
                       the interior of british columbia and in some of canfor’s operating areas. the impact of this outbreak is expected to affect the long-term
                       timber supply in the interior of british columbia.
                            the mountain pine beetle has attacked much of the mature lodgepole pine forest throughout the interior of british columbia and
                       is now emerging in the western regions of alberta. once attacked, the pine trees typically die within 1 to 2 years.
                            in response to the infestation, bc’s provincial government has significantly increased the allowable annual cut (aac) levels in the
                       heavily affected timber supply areas. the increase is designed to salvage as much of the dead and damaged lodgepole pine timber as
                       possible, and to direct harvesting in an attempt to reduce the spread of the beetle. as a result, canfor has also significantly increased
                       its harvest of dead pine within many of its operating areas.
                            a recent timber supply study conducted by the council of forest industries (cofi) has analyzed the general trends of the mountain
                       pine beetle outbreak and forecasts the expected impacts on aac. the study predicts that the timber supply areas surrounding
                       vanderhoof and quesnel will experience a significant reduction in aac in the next 10 to 15 years. this reduction is expected because
                       these timber supplies consist of over 60% mature lodgepole pine that is either dead or at risk of attack and the remaining stands of
                       spruce, balsam fir and douglas fir are insufficient to support historic harvest levels. the timber supplies surrounding prince george
                       and mackenzie have the advantage of log diameter and a large inventory of non-pine species. as a result, there is more flexibility in
                       these timber supply areas to harvest other stands while the pine sites recover from the infestation. the study also predicts that most of
                       the damaged pine volume in these areas could be recovered, which may in turn mitigate the need for a significant reduction in harvest
                       levels. as a result, the study predicts that in 10 to 15 years the aac in the prince george timber supply areas will likely reduce to slightly
                       below historic levels, and in the mackenzie areas the aac will remain unchanged. other timber supply areas where canfor has operating
                       areas, such as in fort nelson, fort st. john, and chetwynd, are not expected to experience a reduction in harvest levels resulting from
                       the current mountain pine beetle infestation.
                            a major assumption about the impact on harvest levels is the shelf life of the dead pine. shelf life represents the length of time
                       the timber is usable for a given product. one of the determining factors that contribute to shelf life is the moisture condition of the area
                       where the timber is located. the impact of moisture variability on the shelf life of timber is still being studied, but indications are that it
                       can vary from 3 to 15 years depending on the moisture levels. for alternative products such as wood chips for pulp production and bio
                       energy opportunities, the shelf life is expected to be much longer.
                            given the nature and extent of the infestation, its long-term operational and financial impact on canfor is not quantifiable at this
                       time, but could be significant.


                       obligations to bc hydro
                       under a cogeneration agreement with bc hydro, if the cogeneration project at the prince george pulp mill generates less than 390
                       gwh in any year and the shortfall cannot be made up by excess generation of up to 390 gwh in prior years or excess generation in the
                       subsequent year, cplp is required to pay bc hydro an amount equal to $3.27 million multiplied by the ratio of the uncorrected shortfall
                       to the annual requirement of 390 gwh. as of december 31, 2006, cplp has no repayment obligation under the terms of the agreement

            48         and a standby letter of credit in the amount of $30.6 million was issued to bc hydro.

stumpage rates
the british columbia government introduced a market pricing system (mps) for the bc interior on july 1, 2006. canfor is actively
participating in discussions on mps with the ministry of forests, which is scheduled for its first annual update on july 1, 2007. canfor
will continue to seek to manage and reduce the stumpage costs for its interior operations under the stumpage appraisal system. the
near-term imperative is to ensure that the stumpage system accurately reflects the market value of timber and is responsive to the
deteriorating quality of the beetle-impacted fibre.


surge tax
as discussed earlier, the sla includes a surge mechanism, which increases the export tax by 50% when the monthly volume of exports
from a region exceeds a certain trigger volume, as defined in the sla. the surge tax is applied retroactively for all shipments during the
month when the surge occurred. canfor utilizes a daily tracking system, developed by the canadian government’s department of foreign
affairs and international trade, to manage its shipment volumes so as not to trigger the surge tax. in addition, the governments of bc
and alberta are sending out daily “warnings” to all exporters when it appears that there is a possibility of a surge. however, the total
volume of exports from the region, including shipments from canfor’s competitors, cannot be estimated with complete certainty.


transportation services
canfor relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products, as well as delivery of raw materials, a significant portion of
which are transported by railroad, trucks and ships. if any of canfor’s third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the
raw materials or products or distribute them in a timely manner, canfor may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all, or
unable to manufacture its products in response to customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on canfor’s financial
condition and operating results. in addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with canfor,
canfor may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost.


outstanding share data

at february 22, 2007, there were 142,563,767 common shares issued and outstanding. in addition, at february 22, 2007, there were
261,969 stock options outstanding with exercise prices ranging from $7.57 to $11.80 per share.


disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting

the company has established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information disclosed in this md&a and the related
financial statements was properly recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the board and the audit committee. the company’s
chief executive officer (ceo) and chief financial officer (cfo) have evaluated and are satisfied with the effectiveness of these disclosure
controls and procedures for the period ending december 31, 2006.
     the ceo and cfo acknowledge responsibility for the design of internal control over financial reporting (icfr), and confirm that
there were no changes in these controls that occurred during the most recent interim period ended december 31, 2006 which materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s icfr.

                       management’s responsibility and auditors’ report




                       management’s responsibility
                       the information and representations in this annual report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the board
                       of directors. the consolidated financial statements were prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally
                       accepted in canada and, where necessary, reflect management’s best estimates and judgments at this time. it is reasonably possible that
                       circumstances may arise which cause actual results to differ. management does not believe it is likely that any differences will be material.
                       the financial information presented throughout this report is consistent with that contained in the consolidated financial statements.
                             canfor maintains systems of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures to provide reasonable assurances as to the
                       reliability of the financial records and the safeguarding of its assets. the internal audit department performs independent reviews
                       of the accounting records and related procedures. the internal audit department reports its findings and recommendations both to
                       management and the audit committee.
                             the board of directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is
                       ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis. the board
                       carries out these activities primarily through its audit committee.
                             the audit committee is comprised of 3 directors who are not employees of the company. the committee meets periodically
                       throughout the year with management, external auditors and internal auditors to review their respective responsibilities, results of the
                       reviews of internal accounting controls, policies and procedures and financial reporting matters. the external and internal auditors meet
                       separately with the audit committee.
                             the consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis have been reviewed by the audit committee,
                       which recommended their approval by the board of directors. the consolidated financial statements have been audited by
                       pricewaterhousecoopers llp, the external auditors, whose report follows.

                       auditors’ report
                       to the shareholders of canfor corporation
                       we have audited the consolidated balance sheets of canfor corporation as at december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005, and the consolidated
                       statements of income and retained earnings and cash flow for the years then ended. these financial statements are the responsibility of the
                       company’s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
                            we conducted our audits in accordance with canadian generally accepted auditing standards. those standards require that we
                       plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
                       includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes
                       assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
                       statement presentation.
                            in our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company
                       as at december 31, 2006 and december 31, 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
                       accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

                       notes to the consolidated financial statements




                       d e c e m b e r 3 1 , 2 006

                       1. significant accounting policies

                       basis of presentation of financial statements
                       these financial statements include the accounts of canfor corporation (the company) and its subsidiary companies, hereinafter referred
                       to as “canfor”. canfor’s majority interest in the canfor pulp limited partnership (cplp) (note 3), has been consolidated, with a provision
                       for non-controlling interests. investments over which the company exercises significant influence are accounted for using the equity
                       method, in which the original investment is recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted for the company’s share of post acquisition
                       earnings. joint ventures are proportionately consolidated.


                       use of estimates
                       the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
                       make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. it is reasonably
                       possible that circumstances may arise which cause actual results to differ from management estimates, however, management does
                       not believe it is likely that such differences will materially affect canfor’s financial position.
                                 significant areas requiring the use of management estimates are deferred reforestation costs, inventory valuations, amortization
                       rates, valuation of goodwill and investments, and pension and other benefit plan assumptions.


                       cash and cash equivalents
                       cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts and highly liquid money market instruments with maturities of three months
                       or less from the date of acquisition, and are valued at cost, which approximates market value.


                       temporary investments
                       temporary investments are highly liquid money market instruments with maturities greater than three months from the date of
                       acquisition, and are valued at cost, which approximates market value.


                       valuation of inventories
                       inventories of lumber, panels, pulp and kraft paper are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value. logs and chips are
                       valued at average cost or the greater of net realizable value and replacement cost if lower than average cost. processing materials and
                       supplies are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.


                       property, plant, equipment and timber
                       canfor capitalizes the costs of major replacements, extensions and improvements to plant and equipment, together with related interest
                       incurred during the construction period on major projects.

        annual

 report 2006

     amortization of logging and manufacturing assets is calculated on a unit of production basis. amortization of plant and equipment
not employed in logging and manufacturing is calculated on a straight-line basis.
     logging roads are amortized on a basis related to the volume of timber harvested. for those tree farm licenses and timber licenses
which are renewable with the province of british columbia, amounts capitalized as timber are amortized over the estimated tree growth
cycle as volume is harvested. non-renewable licenses are amortized over the period of the license.


goodwill
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. goodwill is not
amortized but is assessed annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. the
fair value of goodwill is estimated in the same manner as goodwill is determined at the time of acquisition


deferred charges
software development costs relating to major systems are deferred and amortized over periods not longer than five years. start-up costs
for the newly constructed oriented strand board mill are being amortized over a period of three years.


deferred reforestation
canfor accrues the undiscounted cost of the reforestation required under its timber harvest agreements at the time that the timber is
harvested. the liability is re-measured at fair value at the end of the fiscal period.


employee benefit plans
canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide both pension and other retirement benefits to most of its
salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans. canfor also provides certain health care
benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees.
     canfor accrues the costs and related obligations of the defined benefit pension and other retirement benefit plans using the
projected benefit actuarial method prorated on service and management’s best estimates of expected plan investment performance,
salary escalation, and other relevant factors. for the purpose of calculating the expected return on plan assets, those assets are valued
at fair value. actuarial gains or losses arise from the difference between the actual and expected long-term rates of return on plan
assets for a period or from changes in actuarial assumptions used to determine the accrued benefit obligation. the excess of the net
accumulated actuarial gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is amortized over
the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is 15 years for both pension and other benefit plans. past service
costs arising from plan amendments are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
employees active at the date of the amendment. on january 1, 2000, canfor adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute
of chartered accountants relating to the accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits using the prospective application
method. canfor is amortizing the transitional obligation on a straight-line basis over 15 years, which was the average remaining service
period of employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plan as of january 1, 2000.
     pension expense for the defined contribution plans is based on a percentage of employees’ salaries or on a contribution required
under collective agreements.
     for hourly employees covered by forest industry union defined benefit pension plans, earnings are charged with canfor’s
contributions required under the collective agreements.

                       notes to the consolidated financial statements




                       revenue recognition
                       canfor’s revenues are derived from the following major product lines: lumber, pulp, kraft paper, panel products and raw logs. revenue
                       is recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, goods have been
                       delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured. sales are reported net of discounts and allowances. amounts charged to customers
                       for shipping and handling are recognized as revenue, and shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are reported as cost of
                       sales. lumber duties are recorded as a component of costs of sales.


                       foreign currency translation
                       the majority of canfor’s sales and long-term debt are denominated in foreign currencies. foreign currencies are translated into
                       canadian dollars using the temporal method as follows: monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; non-monetary
                       assets and liabilities at historical rates; and revenues and expenses at exchange rates prevailing at the time the transaction occurs.
                       exchange gains and losses are reflected in income immediately. however, prior to january 1, 2003, canfor hedged its us dollar long-
                       term debt with its us dollar revenue streams. exchange losses deferred prior to canfor’s termination of this hedging relationship are
                       recognized into income in the same periods as the corresponding debt repayments.
                            canfor’s foreign operations are considered to be self-sustaining and the assets and liabilities are translated using the current rate
                       method. the translation gain or loss is included as a component of shareholders’ equity.


                       income taxes
                       canfor accounts for income taxes using the liability method. under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined
                       based on the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences
                       are measured using the current tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences reverse. future tax benefits, such as capital
                       loss carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is considered more likely than not. the effect on future
                       tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the substantive enactment date of
                       the change occurs.


                       derivative financial instruments
                       canfor utilizes derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage its foreign exchange
                       and commodity price risk. for example, from time to time, canfor purchases foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge anticipated
                       sales to customers in the united states and the related accounts receivable and also enters into swap transactions to reduce its exposure
                       to fluctuating pulp, natural gas and diesel prices. canfor’s policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
                       purposes.
                            canfor formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
                       objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and
                       liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. canfor also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge
                       and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values
                       or cash flows of hedged items.
                            gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge us dollar denominated sales are recognized as an
                       adjustment to revenue at the time that the contract is exercised. gains and losses on natural gas and diesel swaps are recognized as an
                       adjustment to manufacturing costs and gains and losses on pulp swaps are recognized as an adjustment to sales when the contracts
                       are settled.

 report 2006

impairment of long-lived assets
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable, as measured by comparison of their net book value to the estimated future cash flows
generated by their use. impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally using discounted future cash flows expected
from their use and eventual disposition.


stock-based compensation plans
canfor has three stock-based compensation plans, as described in note 13. no stock options have been granted since 2002.

      cash consideration received from employees when they exercise the options is credited to share capital.

      compensation expense is recognized for canfor’s contributions to the employee share purchase plan when they are made.

      compensation expense is recognized for canfor’s deferred share unit plan when the deferred share units are granted, and
      changes in market value of the underlying shares are reflected in earnings at the end of each period.


2. change in accounting policies

effective january 1, 2007:

financial instruments
the cica has issued three new handbook sections which will apply to canfor as of january 1, 2007: section 3855 “financial instruments”,
section 3865 “hedges” and section 1530 “comprehensive income.” section 3855 prescribes when a financial instrument should be
recognized on the balance sheet and at what amount. it also specifies how to present financial instrument gains and losses. section
3865, which is optional, provides alternative treatments to section 3855 for when qualifying transactions are designated as hedges for
accounting purposes. section 1530 introduces new requirements for situations when certain gains and losses must be temporarily
presented outside of net income in a new statement of comprehensive income, which will be presented with equal prominence to the
regular income statement.
      canfor has elected to not utilize hedge accounting on its existing derivative financial instruments (note 23). as a result, these
instruments, which were previously not recognized on the balance sheet and gains and losses were not recognized until the contracts
were exercised, will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. at january 1, 2007, the fair value of these derivative instruments
amounted to $3.9 million, which will be recorded as an opening retained earnings adjustment, with changes in fair value to be
subsequently recorded in the income statement.
      at december 31, 2006, canfor had a deferred unrealized foreign exchange loss on long-term debt of $14.2 million on its balance
sheet as a result of terminating a previous hedging relationship under the accounting rules in existence in 2002. deferred financing costs
of $2.8 million were also recorded at december 31, 2006. as a result of implementing section 3855, these balances will be transferred
to opening retained earnings at january 1, 2007. the foreign exchange translation adjustment on the balance sheet, $3.0 million at
december 31, 2006, will be transferred to the opening balance of “accumulated other comprehensive income”.
      the aggregate opening retained earnings adjustment resulting from the implementation of this new policy on january 1, 2007 is
approximately $15.0 million, net of future income taxes.


effective january 1, 2006:

no new accounting policies were adopted in 2006.

                       notes to the consolidated financial statements




                       cash and cash equivalents
                       the presentation of “cash and cash equivalents” on the balance sheet was amended in 2006 to exclude short-term investments with
                       maturity dates greater than 90 days from the original acquisition date, with changes in these balances presented as investing activities
                       on the cash flow statement. the definition of “cash and cash equivalents” on the cash flow statement was also amended to exclude credit
                       facilities labelled as “operating bank loans” on the balance sheet, with changes in these balances now presented as financing activities.
                       these changes in presentation reduced the prior year’s cash and cash equivalents balance on the balance sheet by $7.4 million and by
                       $4.0 million on the cash flow statement.


                       effective january 1, 2005:

                       vendor rebates
                       in september 2005, the cica issued a new abstract, eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer (including a
                       reseller of the vendor’s products), effective january 1, 2006. the eic clarifies the measurement and presentation of vendor discounts
                       and volume rebates, which canfor had previously presented under “costs and expenses”. canfor elected to adopt the abstract effective
                       january 1, 2005, which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by $103.3 million for 2005.


                       variable interest entities
                       effective january 1, 2005, canfor adopted the cica’s new accounting guideline for the consolidation of variable interest entities. the
                       primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting
                       rights. the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfor’s financial position or results of operations.


                       cash and temporary investments
                       effective january 1, 2005, canfor retroactively amended its presentation of cash and temporary investments to include outstanding
                       cheques, which were previously included in accounts payable.




                       3. acquisitions and divestitures

                       pulp income fund transaction
                       on july 1, 2006, canfor completed the transfer of its prince george nbsk pulp and paper business (the pulp business) to the canfor pulp
                       limited partnership (cplp) in exchange for a $125 million promissory note, 14.254 million class a limited partnership units and 57.016
                       million class b exchangeable limited partnership units (the spinout). canfor exchanged its class a limited partnership units for an
                       equal number of units of canfor pulp income fund (cpif). upon the completion of the spinout, the existing common shares of canfor
                       were cancelled and canfor shareholders were entitled to receive one new common share of canfor and 0.1 of a unit of cpif, with the
                       distribution of the fund units being structured as a return of capital on the canfor shares. as a result, on the date of the spinout canfor
                       shareholders owned all of the issued and outstanding new common shares and all of the issued and outstanding fund units, with the
                       outstanding fund units representing a 20% indirect interest in the pulp business.
                             on november 30, 2006, canfor completed a distribution to its shareholders consisting of an in-kind taxable dividend of 1.49 units of
                       cpif for every 10 shares of canfor corporation held. the value of the dividend was deemed to be $10.99 per cpif unit. the accounting
                       value of the dividend equated to $182.8 million. following this dividend, canfor owned 35.494 million class b exchangeable limited
                       partnership units.
                             through its interest in cplp, which is indirectly exchangeable for fund units, canfor owns a 50.2% interest in the pulp business.
                       cplp is managed by canfor pulp holdings inc. (the general partner) on behalf of the limited partners.
           58                cplp paid distributions of $62.7 million in 2006. distributions to canfor, amounting to $45.1 million, have been eliminated upon
        canfor         consolidation.

new south is financially and operationally self-sustaining and, accordingly, the current rate method is used for the translation of their
financial statements to canadian dollars on consolidation. under this method, assets and liabilities, including any excess of purchase
price over book value arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. revenue and expense
items are translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the period. exchange gains or losses arising from the current rate
method of translation are deferred in a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

                       discontinued operations
                       on march 20, 2006, canfor completed the transfer of its englewood logging operation and associated timber licenses (englewood
                       operations) to a new limited partnership, coastal fibre limited partnership (cflp), jointly owned with oji paper canada ltd., which
                       contributed cash of equal value. in consideration of the transfer canfor received a partnership interest valued at $45.0 million, which
                       approximates the book value of the assets transferred. on the same day, cflp transferred the englewood operations and cash of
                       $35.0 million to western forest products inc. (wfp) in return for a long-term agreement with wfp to supply cflp with fibre (note 5),
                       and cflp will supply this fibre to howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp). canfor’s 50% interest in cflp has been
                       proportionately consolidated and the long-term fibre agreement with wfp, which is valued at $40.0 million, has been recorded in “long-
                       term investments and other assets” (note 5) on the balance sheet, and will be amortized as the fibre is supplied to cflp.
                                   in 2005, canfor completed the sale of its fort st james, slocan and valemount sawmills in british columbia for total cash proceeds
                       of $59.0 million. a net after-tax loss of $4.7 million was recorded on the dispositions. the sale of the fort st james mill and associated
                       harvesting rights was directed by the federal commissioner of competition as a condition to canfor’s acquisition of slocan forest
                       products ltd. on april 1, 2004. the decision to sell the slocan and valemount sawmills was made as part of a process to focus the
                       company’s manufacturing assets around certain product lines and fibre baskets. canfor retained the right to any refund of countervailing
                       and anti-dumping duty (note 15) paid prior to the dispositions.

                       stock option performance plan
                       the company has a stock option performance plan pursuant to which stock options were granted to selected officers and senior managers.
                       no new stock options were granted in 2006 or 2005. the stock option performance plan provided for the issuance of up to a maximum of
                       5.8 million common shares at an exercise price equal to the market price of the company‘s common shares on the date of grant. however,
                       there are various criteria that limit the amount of options exercisable during each option year within the option period. a summary of the
                       status of the plan as of december 31, 2006 and 2005, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

                       employee share purchase plan
                       the company has a share purchase plan, which is available to all employees. purchases of common shares under this plan occur on the
                       open market. under the plan the employees can purchase up to 10% of their base salary or wage. the company matches 30% of the first
                       5% of the amount contributed by the employee and pays the share purchase plan brokerage fees. in 2006, contributions of $1.5 million
                       were made towards the purchase of the company’s common shares under the terms of the plan (2005 – $1.8 million).


                       deferred share unit plan
                       on january 1, 2002, the company implemented a deferred share unit plan for non-employee directors of the company. a deferred
                       share unit (dsu) is a right granted to a non-employee director to receive one common share of the company, purchased on the open
                       market, or the cash equivalent, on a deferred payment basis. the maximum number of dsus outstanding under the plan is 1,000,000,
                       and currently each non-employee director is entitled to 2,500 dsus per year. the value of the dsus, when redeemed, is equal to the
                       market value of the shares on the redemption date, including the value of dividends paid on the company’s common shares, if any, as
                       if they had been reinvested in additional dsus on each payment date. the dsus may only be redeemed upon a director’s retirement
                       from the company, its subsidiaries or any affiliated entity. the value of the outstanding dsus at december 31, 2006 was $1.0 million
           64          (2005 – $1.0 million).

14. employee future benefits

canfor has several funded and unfunded defined benefit plans, as well as defined contribution plans, that provide pension, other
retirement and post-employment benefits to substantially all salaried employees and certain hourly employees. the defined benefit
plans are based on years of service and final average salary. canfor’s other post-employment benefit plans are non-contributory and
include a range of health care and other benefits.
       the company is in the process of winding up its taylor sawmill pension plan, following the closure of the mill in 2004, and, as a
result, a settlement loss of $0.1 million (2005 – $1.3 million) was recognized in the 2006 expense.
       total cash payments for employee future benefits for 2006 were $63.1 million (2005 – $65.2 million), consisting of cash contributed
by the company to its funded pension plans, cash payments directly to beneficiaries for its unfunded other benefit plans, cash contributed
to its defined contribution plans, and cash contributed to its forest industry union defined benefit plans.

the company measures its accrued benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for accounting purposes as at september 30th
of each year. in 2006, canfor had 7 registered defined benefit plans, for which actuarial valuations are performed every three years. the
most recent actuarial valuation for funding purposes of canfor’s single largest pension plan was on december 31, 2005.

canfor also provides pension bridge benefits to certain eligible former employees. at december 31, 2006, the actuarially determined
obligation for these benefits was $18.3 million (2005 – $13.8 million). the accrued benefit liability for these benefits, included in “other
accruals and provisions” (note 10) on the balance sheet at december 31, 2006, was $7.1 million (2005 – $7.0 million) and the related                                            67

                       point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects for 2006:

15. countervailing (cvd) and anti-dumping (add) duties

effective october 12, 2006, the governments of canada and the united states implemented an agreement for the settlement of the softwood
lumber dispute, which began in may 2002. the softwood lumber agreement (sla), which received formal approval by the canadian
parliament on december 14, 2006, has a term of seven years and provides for an extension of two years. either government can give notice
to terminate the sla after 23 months, but there is an additional 12-month notice period before the agreement can be terminated.
     under the terms of the sla, effective october 12, 2006, the us department of commerce revoked all existing add and cvd orders
on softwood lumber shipped to the us from canada. approximately 81% of deposits paid, together with accumulated interest, were to
be returned to canadian lumber producers. the remaining 19% (us $1 billion) was to be retained by the us government for distribution
to the us forest industry petitioners and for use in funding “meritorious activities” such as disaster relief, the promotion of sustainable
forestry management and low income housing. approximately us $40 million will be utilized for a joint us/canada committee designed
to strengthen and build the north american lumber market.
     in the fourth quarter, the full amount of the duty deposits was refunded by the us government, with the us $1 billion repayable by
the canadian producers as a special assessment to be collected by the canadian government. at december 31, 2006, canfor had accrued
$187.7 million (us $164.0 million) for this assessment, to be paid on january 31, 2007.
     in 2006, canfor recorded into income a duty refund of $717.7 million and interest income of $97.7 million. this refund amount is
net of the special assessment and includes the reversal of the cumulative additional cvd accrued in excess of the cash deposits and the
cumulative additional add deposits in excess of the calculated expense, which were $64.4 million and $108.8 million, respectively, at
september 30, 2006. substantially all of the duty and interest was collected before the end of the year.
     the sla requires that, effective october 12, 2006, an export tax on lumber shipped to the us be collected by the government of canada
and returned to the province of origin of the lumber. the province of bc had the right to choose between an export charge only (option
a) or a lower export charge with a quota (option b) for each of the bc coast and bc interior regions. the province of bc chose option
a for both the bc coast and the bc interior and will have the opportunity to change options on january 1, 2010 and january 1, 2013.
     the export tax rate is determined monthly, based on the “random lengths framing lumber composite price” as follows: 15% tax
at a composite price of us $315 or under; 10% at us $316-$335; 5% at us $336-$355 and nil when the price is over us $355. the sla
also includes a “surge mechanism”, which increases the export tax rate for the month by 50% when the monthly volume of exports from
a region exceeds a certain “trigger volume” as defined in the sla. export taxes of $22.0 million were paid in 2006.

                       during 2006, mill closure costs of $2.9 million were recorded, primarily related to the expected closure, in june 2007, of a mat plant
                       located at the panel and fibre operation, and severance costs at the tackama plywood plant as a result of reducing the number of shifts
                       at that operation during the year. other restructuring costs of $3.6 million were recorded in 2006, primarily comprised of dismantling
                       costs at the tackama sawmill, which was closed in 2005, and additional severance and lease costs related to the integration of slocan
                       and canfor in 2004, which were not identified at the time of the original accrual.
                                   during 2005, restructuring costs of $5.3 million were recorded. the expense includes mill closure costs of $3.8 million, which were
                       mainly related to the permanent closure of the tackama sawmill in 2005, severance costs of $1.1 million, and restructuring costs of $0.4
                       million associated with the formation of a jointly owned paper sales and marketing partnership with an external party.
                                   the following table provides a reconciliation of the restructuring, mill closure and other severance provision for the year ended

19. unusual expense

the forestry revitalization plan
in march 2003, the government of british columbia (the crown) introduced the forestry revitalization plan (the plan) that provides for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees. the changes prescribed
in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations, the elimination of existing timber processing regulations, and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses. through legislation, licensees were required to
return 20% of their replaceable tenure to the crown. the plan states that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open
up opportunities for woodlots, community forests and first nations and the other half will be available for public auction. licensees will
be compensated by the crown for the return of tenure and related infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges.
          the effect of the timber take-back resulted in a reduction of approximately 2.4 million cubic metres to canfor’s existing allowable
annual cut on its replaceable tenures.
          on october 28, 2005, canfor signed an agreement with the province of british columbia, in which canfor received $57.0 million in
compensation for the loss of tenures noted above, and a $5.0 million payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs. a
loss of $8.8 million was recorded in 2005 on the tenures taken back.

                       21. earnings per share

                       basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of
                       common shares outstanding during the period. diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net earnings available to common
                       shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period using the treasury stock method. under this method,
                       proceeds from the potential exercise of stock options are assumed to be used to purchase the company’s common shares.

23. financial instruments

commodity price risk
canfor uses a variety of financial instruments to reduce its exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,
lumber and pulp prices and energy costs.
       at december 31, 2006, canfor had entered into pulp swaps to hedge future pulp sales. there was an unrealized loss of $0.7 million
on the pulp swaps at december 31, 2006 (2005 – $0.1 million gain).
       at december 31, 2006, canfor had entered into energy derivatives to hedge future natural gas and diesel purchases. there were
unrealized losses of $2.9 million on these contracts at december 31, 2006 (2005 – $18.6 million gain)
        there were no lumber futures contracts outstanding at december 31, 2006 (2005 – 186 contracts outstanding).


credit risk
canfor does not have a significant concentration of credit risk as no one individual customer accounts for 10% or more of total company sales.
canfor reviews the credit history of all new customers before extending credit and also performs regular reviews of the credit performance
of existing customers. canfor may require payment guarantees, such as letters of credit, or obtains credit insurance coverage.


currency risk
a significant portion of canfor’s income from operations is generated from sales denominated in us dollars. in conjunction with
commodity price risk management, canfor enters into forward exchange contracts from time to time. at december 31, 2006, canfor had
us $5.1 million of forward contracts outstanding (2005 – $46.4 million). there was an unrecognized loss of $0.3 million at december
31, 2006 (2005 – $0.1 million). in 2006, contracts totaling $158.7 million were exercised and a gain of $3.6 million was realized (2005
– contracts totaling $97.5 million at a gain of $2.1 million).


interest rate risk
canfor is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments. the company has considered, but does not use, derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk.

25. howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp)

on march 10, 2001, canfor and oji paper co., ltd. (oji), its 50% co-venturer in the howe sound pulp and paper limited (howe sound)
joint venture, transferred the business of howe sound into a limited partnership, hslp. hslp continues to be jointly owned by canfor
and oji and continues to carry on the existing operations of howe sound.
       as part of the reorganization, howe sound was amalgamated with canadian forest products ltd. (cfp), canfor’s principal
operating subsidiary, and approximately $643 million of tax losses of howe sound became available to reduce the future taxable
income of cfp. in 2001, as part of the reorganization, cfp made a payment of $60.2 million to the partnership, which was applied to
reduce the long-term debt of howe sound assumed by hslp. further payments were made to the partnership in 2002 and 2004 of $5.0
million and $7.0 million respectively as a result of losses utilized, and a further, final payment of $50.0 million was made to hslp on
january 2, 2005.
       as a result of this reorganization, cfp recorded a future income tax asset and a deferred credit, which were both drawn down to
nil at december 31, 2006 ($18.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively, at december 31, 2005).
       canfor wrote off its investment in the joint venture in 1998 and no longer reflects its share of the joint venture’s assets, liabilities, cash
flows, and results in its earnings. canfor’s method of accounting for its interest in hslp did not change as a result of the reorganization.
       while canfor does not reflect hslp’s results in its earnings, it is required to include its share of the limited partner’s income or
loss, within the limits imposed by the income tax act (canada), in the calculation of taxable income. there was no impact on canfor’s
future income tax recovery in 2006. any income tax expense incurred by canfor will be reimbursed by hslp.


26. joint ventures

during 2006, canfor made capital contributions of $10.0 million to the canfor-lp osb limited partnership, which is jointly owned
with louisiana-pacific canada ltd. (2005 – $102.3 million). the mill, which is operating as peace valley osb, commenced production
in december 2005. canfor has agreed to supply 330,000 cubic metres of timber annually to the joint venture out of its existing timber
tenure in the area.

electrical cogeneration incentive payments

in 2003, canfor entered into an agreement with bc hydro to build an electrical cogeneration facility at the prince george pulp and paper
mill. under the agreement, bc hydro contributed $45.8 million of the project costs, with canfor contributing the balance. the agreement
was assigned to cplp effective july 1, 2006, with incentive payments totaling $11.4 million outstanding. the final incentive payment of
$11.4 million was received august 9, 2006 and transferred to canfor. the total incentive payments of $45.8 million were accounted for as
a reduction of property, plant and equipment transferred to cplp. the project was completed in 2005 at a net cost to the pulp business of
$69.6 million. the agreement entails a 15 year commitment with bc hydro for power displacement at the cogeneration facility, whereby
a proportionate repayment is required should the facility not generate the minimum of 390 gigawatt hours of electricity per year. as
required under the agreement, cplp has posted a letter of credit in the amount of $33.9 million as security.
       as of august 10, 2006, the cogeneration facility produced a total of 390.5 gigawatt hours of electricity, marking the fulfillment of
the first year of power production commitment. for the period from august 11, 2006 to december 31, 2006, the cogeneration facility
produced a total of 148.9 gigawatt hours of electricity or 85% of target with the completion of the second year at august 10, 2007. if the
project were to produce less than 390 gigawatt hours of electricity in any year during the term of the agreement, cplp will have until
the end of the succeeding year to make up the shortfall balance. if a shortfall balance carried over from a preceding year has not been
made up by the end of the succeeding year, cplp is required to compensate bc hydro for the shortfall balance by paying bc hydro an
amount determined by the shortfall balance divided by the annual target (390 gigawatt hours) multiplied by $3.27 million, being 1/15 of
the total incentive payments originally provided by bc hydro.
       as of december 31, 2006, cplp has no repayment obligation under the terms of the agreement.
