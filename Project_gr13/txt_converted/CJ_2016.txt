greetings to our valued stakeholders,
cj cheiljedang started out in 1953 as a sugar manufacturer, one of the basic food ingredients and a basic necessity of our lives. during the
sixty years since, cj cheiljedang has led the advancement of the domestic food market, expanding the scope of business to food ingredi-
ents, foods, feed & livestock, bio, and pharmaceutical products.

this year, we still face a very challenging time just as we have last year. last year, the global economy became more uncertain due to shrink-
age of the european market, the slow growth of the chinese economy, and the plunging oil prices. domestically, the mers aftermath, the
increase of household and corporate debt led to a drastic cut in spending and investment. this year the global market faces risk elements such
as another interest rate raise by the united states, slow growth of china and other emerging markets, and potential threat of terrorism and
an unstable international political climate which may maintain the slow growth trend. thus, we expect the domestic market will recover only
marginally as well. despite these difficulties, cj cheiljedang accomplished meaningful achievements in each business division last year, and
we will build upon those achievements to continue our sustainable growth for this year.

cj cheiljedang’s major achievements in 2015 include: enhanced cost efficiency in the food ingredients and processed foods division; aggres-
sive expansion of the feed & livestock division in southeast asia; and in the bio division, the launch of the world’s first environmentally friendly
methionine. these achievements helped us accomplish the highest operating income since our establishment. in addition, based on our man-
agement philosophy of 'creation', 'win-win' and 'sharing' we enhanced the "jeulgeoun donghang(happy companion)" movement, while fur-
ther strengthening our 'global csv project', which enabled us to gain recognition as a company with high social contribution not only domesti-
cally but overseas as well.

this is a valuable outcome made possible by the encouragement from stakeholders who have trusted and supported us, and the devotion
of our staff. we will not stay content with the achievements but further pursue meaningful csv activities, and continue our efforts to build an
innovative business model where 'social value' and 'corporate growth and profit' can coexist. as a prerequisite of such efforts, we make the
following three promises to our stakeholders.

first, we will secure the engine for sustainable future growth focusing on global businesses. in order to achieve our long-term goal 'great
cj', we will further spur on our main businesses to grow into a global no.1 brand, and we will identify new values and create opportunities in
order to secure new engine for growth. in order to secure the resources needed to grow globally, we will thoroughly eliminate all inefficien-
cies and waste throughout the company and innovate our corporate structure to maximize profitability.

second, we will build a management system that recruits human talents with global competences and nurture them systematically, who
will in turn bring results. by investing more on human resources development and r&d, we will secure the world’s top core competences in
all our businesses, which will help us accelerate a qualitative global growth.

third, we will implement csv activities that perfectly embody our management philosophy 'onlyone', 'ilryujojik(first class organization)',
and 'saeopboguk(building a stronger nation through business prosperity)'. we will devote ourselves to becoming a leader that contributes
to building a stronger nation through business by settling the csv business culture and innovation in the organizational culture with emphasis
on 'cj spirit'.

dear stakeholders, we at cj cheiljedang hope to continue to earn your support and trust by faithfully keeping the promise we made above.
we hope for your interest and encouragement this year as well for our sustainable growth, and wish health and happiness to all the families.

thank you.
                                                                      ceo of cj cheiljedang     chul-ha kim

  onlyone korea


  cj cheiljedang supports its proud country, korea.
  it is a country where ninety percent of the people own a national flag, a country
  that was once impoverished but is now one of the ten largest economies in the
  world. a country where one million people rushed to help when the oil spill cov-
  ered the sea, a country whose gdp has multiplied by 750 times over merely half
  a century, where not one accident occurred when crowds of seven million gath-
  ered in the seoul plaza for the world cup games. it is a country that has achieved
  something no other has. and cj cheiljedang will strive to stand tall in the world
  as a global lifestyle company representing korea.

  cj cheiljedang’s journey toward a creative business diversification
  cj cheiljedang believes the only way for a company to grow sustainably is by creating shared value with the society with
  which it coexists. based on this belief we are putting our efforts into embedding csv as part of the company culture, and our
  priority when considering expanding our business scope or going on a global scale with a business is win-win with the soci-
  ety, and whether we can create social value. in addition, we will continue to expand the businesses that have csv reflected in
  them, fulfilling our duty in social responsibility and shared growth.

active stakeholder engagement

stakeholder-oriented management
cj cheiljedang places stakeholders in the center in its operations, and listens closely to their opinions and actively implements them
in management activities. major stakeholder groups are suppliers, shareholders and investors, the local community and employees,
and we operate various communication channels for each group. the opinions gathered through those channels are broken down to
department level. stakeholder opinions were an important part of preparing the 2015 sustainability report, and we selected 5 issues
based on their opinions. we will implement various activities such as opening new communication channels in order to practice
stakeholder-oriented management, and enhancing the value of the stakeholders.

                           analysis of core issues and construction of report

                           according to the materiality analysis, providing accurate information on products and services, expanding communication with the cus-
                           tomers, and enhancement of shared growth policies and activities were identified as material issues. these are issues closely related to the
                           food business among cj cheiljedang’s major business divisions. this is because consumers’ interest on food is growing, and the demand for
                           shared growth with small and medium food companies is rising. we reflect these stakeholder interests in 5 core aspects in this report.


                            step 2         conducting the materiality test

                           based on 37 issues in 6 categories, we conducted an internal and external survey, and reflected expert opinions after integrating direct and
                           indirect financial impact on the company and goal related performances.

trends in global business area
the customer demand for healthy foods is steadily rising, and the market for them is expected to
expand. leading companies in the world are conducting r&d on healthy foods with low calories and
beneficial functions, containing unsaturated fats and natural sugars. efforts to secure global tech-
nological competitiveness will continue, from cultivating supporting r&d personnel to expanding
related facilities.

the reason for choice
surveys conducted on cj cheiljedang’s major stakeholder groups have shown a high degree of inter-
est on'r&d and innovation' at 27%. the reason behind this interest is the need to secure the engine
for future growth and innovative change that will provide the foundation for sustainable growth in an
uncertain global economy. as a response to the stakeholders’ interest in this aspect, cj cheiljedang
introduces its r&d strategies and the various programs to promote r&d.

r&d for functional sweeteners
consumers’ demand for sweeteners to replace sugar has kept rising since the year 2000. cj cheil-
jedang is conducting r&d on sugar substitutes with functions such as decreasing sugar absorption in
the body and suppressing blood glucose levels after meals. following the launch of "tagatose" in 2012
cj cheiljedang introduced to consumers for the first time in 2015 the zero calorie "allulose" which
was made with its unique method using enzymes. we will target the next generation global sweetener
market in step with the trend for 'healthy sweetness', investing boldly and securing mass production
technology.

expanding r&d for sustainable development
cj cheiljedang is moving toward the goal of achieving its vision 'great cj' by the year 2020
based on r&d. to this end, each division established r&d goals and built 5 specialized r&d
organizations - food research institute, bio technology research institute, feed & livestock
research institute, food ingredient research institute, and healthcare research institute
(the healthcare business division has been separated as an independent company in 2014).
the professionals at each research organization are working hard to improve quality and
develop innovative ideas and technology through r&d. at the same time, we are identifying
market trends and analyzing social and environmental effects to reflect them in long-term
r&d project strategies, and strive to discover new growth businesses and promising businesses.

building r&d organization and cultivating human resources                                at the specialized
research institutes in each division (food, food ingredient, bio, feed & livestock), there are
610 resident research personnel. with the need to improve competitiveness and enhance
company brand through innovative r&d results, we significantly expanded the research per-
sonnel in 2015, and newly established the beneficial microorganisms tf and r&d planning
team, building the basis for an enterprise-wide integrated r&d strategy. we aim to become
an outstanding r&d company with global competitiveness by restructuring the r&d organi-
zation for systematic r&d activities and by securing excellent and professional personnel.

eco-friendly r&d performance
with the sense of responsibility as the company specializing in foods representing korea, we
actively develop eco-friendly technologies. we aim to spearhead the development of eco-friendly
technologies including production lines with reduced environmental impact, development of new
packing material, and expanding eco-certified products.

developing eco-friendly products            we never cease our efforts to develop eco-friendly prod-
ucts. as a result of investments to develop technologies related to reducing environmental impact
in the production process, we succeeded in acquiring carbon labeling and low-carbon certifica-
tion for our product "hetbahn", and heightened recyclability of "minewater" by applying the eco-
friendly label in the bottle, and launched the eco-friendly gift set tray. in addition to developing
environmentally friendly 'green' feed that reduces methane emissions in 2014, we are presently
conducting a national project jointly with seoul national university to develop odor controlling
technology by reducing ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, to improve the shed environment.
                                                                                                              ratio of eco-friendly tray usage

friendly trays have been tested for drop damage in room and freezing temperatures and are used for
packaging of "canola oil", "beksul gold sesame oil" and "spamⓡ". the eco-friendly tray contributes
to heightening our image as an eco-friendly company by reducing environmental impact.

"hetbahn" acquired cfp (carbon footprint) label                "hetbahn" is cj cheiljedang’s represen-
tative brand that acquired the cfp label in 2011 for the first time in the world in the instant cooked
rice sector. it achieved a high carbon reduction rate at 27.4%, far outscoring other certified brands. in
particular, the "hetbahn cupbahn" introduced in 2015 takes the most advantage of the container’s                eco-friendly tray and low-carbon
                                                                                                                certified "hetbahn"
feature, enhancing consumer convenience while minimizing the use of packaging material to reduce
the amount of waste generated.

beneficial microorganisms fermenting technology based on the microorganism ferment-
ing technology we have acquired through continued r&d investments, we are spearheading the
world’s environment friendly bio industry. we developed 2 strains of fermented taste material and
officially registered them as food ingredient, and developed skin lactobacillus extracted from kim-
chi, which was the first in the world, and won the presidential commendation and jang young-shil
award in 2015 in recognition of our innovative technology. in addition, we introduced 'cj beneficial
microorganisms fermenting technology' at the 2015 creative economy expo, where the technology
was widely acknowledged. moving forward, we plan to expand the bio industry to various sectors
that can utilize fermenting technology such as cosmetics, energy drinks, vehicle coating material,
sportswear and health foods containing lactobacillus.

lohas certification for pastes          our korean paste products (gochujang, doenjang and ssam-
jang) which are free from synthetic preservatives, artificial coloring and msg and made via tradi-
tional fermenting method acquired the lohas certification, the first to do so among korean pastes.
we regard customers’ health and environment as the foremost value, and aim to continually practice
innovative product development and environmental management.

production of amino acids using eco-friendly method cj cheiljedang’s amino acid produc-
tion process is the fruit of green, eco-friendly bio-cycle. sugar canes are cultivated through photosynthe-
sis using carbon dioxide in the air, and the sugar canes are then used to produce raw sugar material for

amino acids. then we turn the byproducts from amino acid production into organic fertilizer, which sums
up to a 'zero-emission' eco-friendly biological process. in 2015 we developed the world’s first eco-friendly
fermenting method to produce l-methionine and applied it to the malaysian production line.

future biotechnology research the bio technology research institute is studying the 'white biol-
ogy' field such as biochemistry and biomass, based on the world class microorganism modification and
fermentation technology. we aim to lead the future biotechnology through biochemistry that develops
substitute materials for petroleum based chemicals through bioengineering and chemistry technology
using renewable resources, and industrial biomass research to obtain fermentable saccharides from vari-
ous agricultural byproducts and discarded wood, to find solutions to various environmental problems.

expanding sustainability through innovation
we are implementing continuous innovation activities throughout the company’s operations to
expand sustainability throughout the company. we select and implement innovation tasks and man-
age related indexes to help solve not only economic issues, but also related social issues.

management innovation we are eliminating overall management inefficiencies through inter-
nal organizational innovation. through structural reform, we underwent management innovation
based on core technologies, which enabled us to lower production costs. in addition to innovation
in the aspect of economic efficiency, we continue to pursue qualitative innovation by scm and
quality improvement and enhancing the work process.

environmental innovation we continue innovation in the environment sector as well. we achieved
significant results in the environment sector by converting the usage of plant wastes and improving treat-
ment costs. we discarded the existing method of dispoingl saline wastewater directly to drying the waste
to solid waste, reducing the waste discharge volume by more than 90%. in addition, we utilized low syrup
wastewater as the carbon source for water treatment, creating an annual profit of krw 480 million. we
aim to implement innovative waste treatment methods through continued eco-friendly technology, and
build a business model that achieves both environmental and economic goal simultaneously.

social innovation         we strive to promote win-win cooperation through shared growth as part of
our corporate culture. we continue to carry out profit sharing projects with suppliers such as reducing
logistics cost by participating in the sharing of logistics equipment, and improving yield by adjusting
the content of raw materials and supplementary materials, while implementing social innovation pro-
cesses that will promote collaboration with suppliers and the local community. meanwhile, we defined
social product innovation to be supplying products that promote customers’ health, which were made
with materials procured from smes with priority and domestically produced raw materials, and we
continue to increase the number of such items.


cj cheiljedang’s promise to the open future
we plan to expand the launch of differentiated high value-added, high-function product groups
through continued r&d and innovation activities by each business division, such as developing healthy
and nutritional foods and eco-friendly biotechnology including microorganism fermentation at the
integrated research institute. we will put first emphasis on customer value, leading the functional food
and indulgence food categories, including one-meal solutions with both taste and health. we will con-
tinue to develop health promoting products through world’s highest level of biotechnological prowess
to enhance our fundamental competitiveness and create the engine for long-term growth. in addition,
we will maximize efficiency through continued innovation of the internal processes to adapt to rapidly
changing market conditions, and channel that efficiency as fuel for long-term growth.

trends in global business area
with stronger environmental regulations around the world and heightened interest in the environ-
ment of the local communities, the importance of environmentally friendly management continues
to rise. moreover, efforts to minimize their environmental impact have become an essential duty for
global corporations. thus, many global leading companies establish environmental management
strategies in the long-term perspective, and minimize their environmental impact through continued
investments in equipment and r&d to achieve sustainable development.

the reason for choice
the survey conducted on cj cheiljedang’s major stakeholder groups showed that the issues of
'establishing a system to respond to climate change' and 'activities to reduce environmental impact
within the production process' ranked high at 15%. we are aware that ignoring environmental issues
and slack risk management can result is great social and environmental damage and recovery is costly
in terms of both time and expense. we hereby introduce our climate change strategy and system that
aims to prevent rather than deal with problems after they occur.

reflecting global case issues
starting with the overseas business operations of the bio business
division, we are working to open the cdp water information. we estab-
lished a team to take charge of building water related strategies and
water management system. major projects include building a water
inventory, water risk assessment, strategies to respond to water risks
as well as water management strategy. by improving and internalizing
the water management system, we will bring stability throughout the
company and establish responses for managerial decision-making.

understanding the responsibilities of a global green company
according to our long-term plan 'proactive response to climate change to secure competitive-
ness and pioneer the image of a global green company', we are implementing the green man-
agement system across all business locations. as part of this movement, we are actively imple-
menting environmental management activities such as securing low-carbon technologies,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting green consumption by expanding low-car-
bon products. while enhancing our efforts to reduce environmental impact within the local
community, we will strive to become the leader in eco-friendly management by developing eco-
friendly technologies and expanding business in that sector.

driving environmental management
cj cheiljedang is building the foundation for environmental management at domestic and
foreign business locations and the supply chain including suppliers. while operating the enter-
prise-wide environmental management organization, we are expanding low-carbon certified
products and also providing support to suppliers in their movement to settle sustainability
management.

establishment of the environmental management organization                           we established
the environmental management organization that overlooks systematic environmental management
across the whole company. we systematically manage the 23 production plants through the inte-
grated computer system, and we plan to expand it to include overseas business locations in the future.

building environmental management roadmap                 cj cheiljedang built the environ-
mental management roadmap that can be applied across the company, and evaluates the
achievements of the long-term strategy implemented according to the roadmap. centering on
the business sites that are designated as green management business site, we have developed
and are operating the operational performance and management performance indices related
to environmental management, and we plan to expand the scope and management criteria.

participation in the green management system                    in 2011, we acquired the first offi-
cial 'green management system' certification in the domestic food and beverage industry, and
we continue to maintain the system certification. in addition, after being designated as the 'envi-
ronmentally friendly company' for the first time in the industry in 1995, we have established the
enterprise-wide environmental management document system, minimizing waste of resources.

proactive response to climate change
we have set the greenhouse gas reduction goal by 2020, and we are leading green consumption
by expanding low-carbon products, proactively responding to climate change. we maintain
a close relationship with 'business institute for sustainable development' (under the 'korea
chamber of commerce and industry'), and spread eco-friendly policy throughout cj cheil-
jedang including the supply chain by transferring environmental management know-how to
small and medium suppliers. in addition, we continue our participation in the water donation
campaign with the korean committee for 'unicef' to help supply clean water to the children in
africa.

reflecting climate change in management decision-making
we decide important issues relating to climate change at the board of directors meeting.
through detailed and systematic decision-making process, matters such as purchasing and
selling emission rights, large-scale investments on greenhouse gases and energy conservation,
and investments to prepare against storm and flood damage are decided. for example, the
executives in charge of production and the management executives discuss and decide mat-
ters important to production such as reducing greenhouse gas emission in relation to climate
change and preparing for storms and flood.

establishment of organization in charge of climate change
we launched an organization to take charge of climate change and energy under the engineer-
ing team which oversees all of the company’s production. the new organization implements
activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. an employee at each
business location is designated to take charge of greenhouse gas, managing the emission vol-
ume and rolling out reduction projects.

management and response to climate change risk
based on the climate change risk management system we quickly respond to related issues.
we examine various risk elements and changing business conditions owing to climate change,
reflect the risk management performance in the kpi of employees in charge, providing promo-
tion and incentives to encourage them to actively fulfill their roles. in addition, in order to sup-
port competence development for responding to climate change for employees at the head
office and other business locations, we provide external training on energy, storm and flood

we classify climate change issue into two categories and manage them accordingly. the climate
risk is divided into the issue of reduction pertaining to the legislation of greenhouse gas emis-
sion rights, and the issue of adapting to climate change. these are also managed separately at
independent departments. in order to tackle the legislation of emission rights, we calculate the
volume to be reduced based on the expected emission volume; we manage the emission quota;
as well as buy and sell emission rights. meanwhile, we have a separate storm and flood manage-
ment process in place to prepare for increased storms and floods that may occur due to climate
change. to prepare for price risks such as crop fluctuations caused by climate change, the pur-
chasing department conducts forward contracts and purchasing.

reflecting climate change management work in performance evaluation
we have included climate change management issues such as greenhouse gas reduction and
storm and flood risk management in the kpi of personnel in charge at the head office and other
business locations. in particular, greenhouse gas and energy management is marked high in the
kpi of the personnel in charge at the head office, and is linked to the kpi of each business loca-
tions, so that climate change management work is directly linked to performance evaluation.

minimizing environmental impact
we are implementing greenhouse gas reduction activities in accordance with the life cycle of
the product, from production to distribution. we are putting our efforts to reduce greenhouse
gas reduction during the production process, and implementing conservation activities to pre-
pare for depletion of raw materials and fossil fuels. in addition, we continue our efforts to mini-
mize waste discharge and recycling byproducts into reusable resources.

reducing greenhouse gas emissions
as we were designated as a target company for the emission trading scheme implemented by the
government to manage greenhouse gas goals, we established the medium-and-long-term emis-
sion intensity reduction plan and continue our activities to reduce emissions. we have set to goal of
reducing direct greenhouse gas emissions by 30% until 2020, and we have successfully reduced 10%
in 2014. meanwhile, we plan to expand activities to reduce emissions so that from 2015 and by 2017,
we will be able to manage most of the greenhouse gas emission rights quota stably.

verification of reaching greenhouse gas reduction target                           all of cj cheiljedang’s
business sites including plants, shops, education centers and head office undergoes verification
of greenhouse gas emissions by the end of march of every year by a verification institute des-
ignated by the government. these numbers are reflected in the government’s comprehensive
greenhouse gas information system, and additional greenhouse gas reduction targets are set
each year and details of the reduction tasks are reported to the government. since we began the
public notice of reduction volume, we have continued to meet the greenhouse gas reduction
target suggested by the government.

  "hetbahn 210g", the first low-carbon certified processed food

  "hetbahn 210g" was selected as one of the products for the carbon labeling pilot project, and
  was the first to acquire low-carbon certification among processed foods. this case involves
  recovering heat from a nearby waste incinerator where waste heat was discharged into the
  air by using an underground pipe to recycle the heat, and is one of the representative cases of
  environmental management. through this system, 100g of greenhouse gas is reduced for each
  "hetbahn" that is produced, amounting to 10,000 tons of greenhouse gas reduction annually.

trends in global business area
customers’ trust in the global food industry in general is diminishing as issues such as sanitation and
exceeding the regulation for additives surface repeatedly. thus, global food companies not only observe
the food safety standard verification of the country they are exporting to, but also strictly control food
safety at the global level by utilizing various food safety management indexes, and establish their own
food safety standards to promote the transparency of their food safety activities.

the reason for choice
according to the survey conducted on cj cheiljedang’s major stakeholder groups, the issue of 'food
safety and developing products with health considerations for the customers' showed a high level of
interest at 51%. we understand that building a food safety infrastructure and providing accurate infor-
mation is the only way to secure customers’ trust. in this section, we describe our efforts to secure
food safety and active communication with the customers.

operation of the 'china food safety center'
amidst steady growth of global consumers’ interest on food safety,
cj cheiljedang moved the 'china food safety center' to beijing in
2015 to actively respond to the strengthening of the chinese food
safety policy and enhance communication with the customers.
the 'china food safety center' will secure differentiated core com-
petences by 2017, including building the chinese food safety man-
agement system, operating the prior safety verification process,
and reinforcing new analysis equipment to strengthen preemptive
control of heavy metals and other hazardous substances.

regaining customers’ trust on food safety
as a global food company, cj cheiljedang sees food safety to be of the utmost value. to this end
we cultivate food safety experts and introduce cutting-edge analysis equipment to conduct safety
management in all processes including the product launch to distribution. in addition, we 'qual-
ity and safety center ' that is in operation on the company-wide level oversees the comprehensive
food safety management work, and a safety personnel is assigned to each business location to
conduct food safety inspection over 50 times a year. we strive to regain customers’ trust by build-
ing a systematic food safety infrastructure.

building the food safety infrastructure
we put our efforts to prevent consumers’ doubts and secure competitiveness in food safety by build-
ing a customer safety and reassurance system throughout all processes, beginning from the procure-
ment of raw materials through to production, consumption and distribution. in the aspect of securing
product safety we will provide safe foods taking customers’ health and safety into consideration.

operation of the 'quality and safety center'                      in 1997, we established the 'food safety
center', the first in the country, with the duty to supervise food safety management, and currently
it has been renamed to 'quality and safety center'. the 'quality and safety center' operates the
safety verification system based on the know-how accumulated over the years, and has a guide-
line that is more rigorous than the standard presented by the ministry of 'food and drug safety',
and conducts thorough preparation and verification for food safety.

introduction of quality management system                    in order to ensure proactive food safety man-
agement, we operate the cj quality management system as the internal policy. together with
verifying the safety of raw materials managed through the qms, we continue to secure food safety
based on audit analysis and record tracking.

raw material and producer management                         we follow our independent agricultural raw
materials guideline when purchasing agricultural raw materials. when purchasing agricultural raw
materials from abroad, we adhere to the government’s safety verification regulations, while also
strictly applying our own quality management standards. we commission external expert institu-
tions to verify environmental risks to check for trace pesticides and heavy metals, and we import
from business locations that meet the iso 22000 standards and ship only raw materials that have
satisfied the conditions set forth in iso 21569. meanwhile, our purchasing amount for organic
sugar and organic flour in 2015 was krw 0.7 billion, and we plan to increase the purchase and pro-
duction of organic foods to meet the well-being trend. thus we are actively developing suppliers,
focusing on organic agricultural raw materials.

global food safety activities
in the industrialized countries such as the united states and eu, more stringent control on
imported foods is being legislated, while in emerging economies such as china and vietnam, basic
food safety issues are rising. as a global foods company exporting more than 1,100 products to 46
countries, we quickly respond to domestic and foreign food safety regulations while establishing
food safety based strategies to proactively respond to global regulations.

operation of global food safety system                 we are operating the global food safety system
in the united states, which is our major exporting market, china, japan and vietnam, in order to
secure consistent safety of our export products. we collect legislation and relevant information for
each country to respond accordingly, conduct new product safety verification, and improvement
advice and training for local business sites for thorough sanitation. in addition, we operate a system
that was built based on external administrative work such as customs and group audits

food safety verification
prior to launching, we undergo the safety verification process for new products to check for chem-
ical and/or microbial hazardous elements that may occur during purchasing of raw materials, pro-
duction process and finished product, as well as verifying product safety. this process is applied
not only to products produced in-house, but also to oem products, and new gift products, test
marketing products and special offer products are no exception.

tion process but also after the product has been delivered and arrives at the customer’s table. for
the distribution process, we established a monitoring system through close cooperation with 'cj
korea express', which is our subsidiary and various other distribution suppliers, and we maintain a
thorough distribution tracking system.

providing accurate information
we transparently open information on ingredients through the product labeling and out com-
pany website’s cj finder. in addition, we inspect all packaging and advertisements of all prod-
ucts in advance to prevent any false or exaggerated information. the marketing team and 'qual-
ity and safety center' routinely check the product and advertisements after product launch for
monitoring and providing accurate information on the food so that we will produce products
that consumers can eat with confidence.

product labeling
in terms of product labeling, we place nutrition statements for mandatory products that are
legally required by the food sanitation act as well as for some products that are not required
to do so. in particular, according to the food sanitation act article 11, we state a total of 9 nutri-
tional facts including calories, carbohydrates, sugars and protein.

country of origin labeling           through the country of origin management system, all foods
produced at cj cheiljedang specifies the country of origin of the ingredients so that customers
can check the information before choosing the product. we make sure to check the documents
of proof such as certificate of origin or import declaration certificate before writing the coun-
try of origin on the label, and conduct regular monitoring to provide accurate information on
the country of origin. we will further enhance related policies to include ingredients which are
added in only small amounts.

transparent product information we operate cj finder and product information faq
at our website to provide detailed information regarding our products. we provide information
not only on the product’s ingredients and nutrients, but also cooking recipes and how to use
and store, together with pictures so that customers can log on to our website and check out the
information. in addition, in the faq page, users can check frequently asked questions to quickly
find the information they need.



consumer-oriented management
all of the company’s activities including product planning, production, marketing and sales are
undertaken centering on the customer. executives including the top management listen directly
to the customers’ opinions and when customers are dissatisfied, we make sure to solve the
issue quickly and reasonably, and we continue innovation activities for our products and service
level from the customer’s perspective.


consumer centered management (ccm)                     in the first half of 2015, we acquired the ccm
certification that is supervised by the 'fair trade commission' and organized by the 'korea con-

being executed and improved centering on the customer. acquiring the ccm certification is rec-

expanding customer engagement process
we encourage active consumer participation by providing various opportunities where consum-
ers become producers. beginning from the basic feedback to improve product taste and quality,
we conduct activities in close contact with customers in order to develop new trend products
that reflect their hidden needs. in particular, customers participate in the production process of
new products to check for elements that may be inconvenient, while also contributing to stor-
age method and useful cooking instructions. we also carry out activities to identify customers’
hidden needs by closely observing their life.

about cj’s products and services' who create services together with the company to create new

at the launching stage they check labeling in the consumers’ point of view, and conduct regular
design review, playing a role in preventing risks that may occur after a product’s launch

are our major customers. their opinions have been applied to "cj alaska salmon" and "dasida
liquid seasoning" to improve those products.

employ consumers’ views are being developed. consumers’ ideas have been developed into
products such as the "bibigo gondre herb rice", and the program continues to bring value to
the consumers through their suggestions and participation.

they learn recipes using cj cheiljedang’s products and taste them, which gives us a chance to

actively provide information such as sharing their product reviews with other consumers and
introducing a variety of recipes. in 2014 we won the grand prize in the general companies sector
in the 2014 web award as recognition of our efforts to develop various experience event promo-
tions and actively communicate with the customers.

trends in global business area
recently global leading companies actively induce the participation from suppliers in acquiring funda-
mental technology necessary for production and expanding the sales route. enhancing competitiveness
through desirable win-win cooperation with suppliers may become an essential strategy to strengthen the
competitive edge in terms of cost and quality, and many companies operate shared growth programs tar-
geting suppliers within the supply chain, building a sustainability structure where financial and non-finan-
cial sectors contribute to each other’s advancement through a virtuous cycle.

the reason for choice

raw materials sourcing management
sourcing raw materials are carried out in accordance with strict domestic and foreign regulations
and after safety inspection has been completed. we lead the production of healthy food by con-
tinuing to expand the volume of organic agricultural raw materials and eco-friendly raw materials.


agricultural raw materials management when purchasing imported agricultural raw materi-
als for food, we designate an expert external institution to conduct hazardous substance inspection
that comply with global standards. in the case of feed raw materials we purchase according to the
'ministry of agriculture, food and rural affairs' notice, and in the case of domestically produced agri-
cultural products, we purchase according to environmental guidelines. meanwhile, the 'quality and
safety center' and research institute are currently conducting research to establish are purchasing
standard for domestic agricultural products. moving forward, we plan to continue expanding direct
transaction with the country of origin to protect the soil and save unnecessary distribution costs.


organic raw materials                  in response to the customer needs who value their health we con-
tinue to launch foods using organic raw materials. in particular, the ratio of organic materials such
as rice, tofu, flour and sugar continues to rise, and we are looking to find new organic producers.

risk management for partner company selection
cj cheiljedang uses a comprehensive partner evaluation system centering on financial analysis
for selecting a partner company. the comprehensive partner evaluation system includes items
on economic and environmental risk management, which makes comprehensive evaluation
possible, and helps build a more fair and desirable cooperative relations. in the future we will
carry out more systematic risk management by building an evaluation process that separates
economic, environmental and social risks.


quality risk      considering the fact that the quality of raw materials is closely linked to prod-
uct quality, we manage the supplier’s quality risk as one of the major risk elements. in particular,
the 'audit operational rules' is a guideline that is applied to cj cheiljedang and all suppliers,
which assesses whether there is a food safety management system and management status,
and aims to make improvements on elements that are lacking. we apply even more stringent
rules when selecting suppliers for agricultural raw materials. in the case of overseas agricultural
products, we select outstanding companies that employ strict quality management guidelines
and have them comply with the government’s safety verification regulations to control and pre-
vent risk factors. for domestic agricultural products, we only sign contracts with companies that
are registered with the flour mills, sugar and feed associations and whose safety are thereby
officially recognized.

partner management and support
we conduct routine inspections in evaluating suppliers to maintain steady quality of raw mate-
rials. in addition, we aim to ensure their management stability and sustainability through con-
tinued management and support.


supplier purchase performance analysis                    we operate a monthly purchasing strat-
egy committee to build long-term growth-sharing relations based on trust with the partners.
through the committee we optimize costs through verification of purchasing costs, supply &
demand and quality, while taking external variables such as market conditions, currency and
oil prices into consideration. we strive to secure steady supply and safe quality through a stable
process of categorizing and defining suppliers.


risk auditing grocess         we conduct regular audit on partners’ economic and environmen-
tal risks. in the case of a newly registered partner company we check for risks through prior audit
before signing the contract, and notify major risk management factors in advance and encour-
age them to implement them. in addition, we specify risk related provisions in the contract and
conduct continued monitoring through audits.

sustainable purchasing strategy through supplier standard we disclose general
information pertaining to suppliers to all suppliers through the cj procurement information
system (www.cjpis.co.kr). we publish and distribute the booklet "jeulgeoun donghang(happy
companion) with suppliers", and the notice is given by email. moving forward, we will select
kpi to be opened to suppliers through collaboration with a credit-rating agency and put
them up in the portal site with a view to operating and managing our purchasing policy in a
transparent and fair manner.



sharing benefits with partners according to performance                we carry out joint tasks
with partners such as cost reduction and quality improvement, productivity improvement,
and new product development, and share the benefits generated from those projects
according to prior contract. we share the task progress at the monthly 'shared growth             e a c h yea r, cj c h e i l j e d a n g p u b -

cj cheiljedang’s promise to the open future
cj cheiljedang is devoted to providing open opportunities for growth for domestic smes and
building a healthy industrial ecosystem by establishing a sustainable shared growth model.
we will establish advanced purchasing ethics, customs and strategies and implement them in
order to systematically manage suppliers. in addition, we will execute a partner selection risk
management and evaluation process that can be applied simultaneously to each business
division (food, bio, etc.) in order to maintain a consistent purchasing quality and support
suppliers’ independent viability improvement activities. meanwhile, the shared growth
support activities that were revolving around domestic partners will be expanded to domestic
and foreign food companies and farms, to promote harmonious win-win cooperation within
the food industry.

trends in global business area
global companies are moving toward a mutually complementary relationship with the local commu-
nity as corporate citizens. not stopping at just social contribution activities or donations, we provide an
opportunity for self-support, creating shared value between the local community and the company.



the reason for choice
surveys conducted on cj cheiljedang’s major stakeholder groups have shown a high degree of inter-
est on 'implementing strategic social contribution activities linked with business strategy' at 25%.
we believe the reason behind this interest is the reality of domestic agriculture today that is closely
related to the foods business, which is one of cj cheiljedang’s major business areas. in this report
aspect, we will introduce rural support programs and employee volunteer activities.

case of reflecting global issue – csv project in vietnam
since our entry into vietnam as part of private-public sector collaboration project in 2014, we are
implementing csv projects to enhance the rural value chain in vietnam. vietnam is a strategic country
with close business friendship with cj cheiljedang, and we utilize it as the base for sourcing diversifi-
cation. however, vietnam’s agricultural technology level is low compared to the volume of agricultural
produce, and lack competitiveness in infrastructure and processing facilities, leading to low income
of the farmers. in consideration of these issues surrounding the vietnamese rural area, we are imple-
menting a global csv project in ninh thuan province in collaboration with our major stakeholders
koica, yeungnam university and k-water from 2014 to 2017. the goal of the project is to increase the
income of the residents and enhance their self-support capabilities, thus enhancing the value chain of
the vietnamese rural area. one of the major achievements in 2015 was selecting a chili sees fit for cul-
tivation in ninh thuan province, and we plan to further expand the cultivation area in 2016.

partner in enhancing local communities’ competitiveness
cj cheiljedang implements "jeulgeoun donghang(happy companion)" with the aim of sharing
growth with the agricultural sector, smes and local communities. in particular, we understand
the importance of agriculture as the essential industry within the food industry, and we maintain
cooperative relationships to improve the fundamental competitiveness of agriculture.

win-win cooperation with rural areas
from our belief that agricultural development is closely linked to the development of the food
industry, we put our efforts into enhancing competitiveness and profitability of the rural farms.
agriculture is also a national basic industry directly linked with food security and the root of the
foods industry, but low productivity and aging of the rural demographic and free import of foreign
agricultural products hinder the growth and advancement of the agricultural industry. cj cheil-
jedang contributes the rural communities to secure differentiated competitiveness by developing
and supplying new seeds, and providing training in farming techniques and cultivation methods.

strategy and principles for win-win with rural communities                               cj cheiljedang sup-
plies seeds developed by the company and conducts contract farming and transfers farming
know-how. farmers are able to secure a stable buyer, enhance productivity and reduce cultivation
costs that lead to higher income, while the company can safely secure high quality raw materials,
which in turn consumers can use with trust, and this forms an ecosystem of virtuous circle.

supplying seeds developed by us                     we develop high value added seeds to enhance agri-
cultural productivity, and among the seeds developed, we supply those with outstanding pro-
ductivity to the farms. in particular, we proceed with contract farming using seeds whose stable
performance have been verified, and commercialize the agricultural products harvested. as an
example, the “cj happy bean no. 1” is an outstanding seed with high yield and can be harvested
with machines, and has been acknowledged to have contributed to the income of the farmers. we
will continue to actively develop high value added seeds, practice win-win cooperation with the
rural areas and contribute to the competitiveness of the domestic agricultural industry.

guidance on farming techniques and cultivation methods                            we regularly visit the con-
tract farms to check on the crop situation and encourage the farmers to produce good quality raw
materials. in particular, we tested a new farming technique that allows the reduction of production
costs and same-time harvesting, which substantially contributed to increasing the farms’ income.
the domestic chili pepper industry is steadily shrinking in terms of farming area and output, which
is caused by decreased net profits due to higher labor costs. we are spreading farming methods to
lower production costs as a way to solve this issue.                                                            kimchi cabbage farm in mungyeong

contract farming          we conduct contract farming so that farmers will have a stable source
of demand and the company will secure a stable supplier. currently rice, soybeans and mung
beans are produced in over 20 area under contract farming, and the produce is used as raw
material for our products.

  establishment of seed company 'cj breeding'
  in march 2015, we established 'cj breeding', the new seed company. 'cj breeding' was established
  with the goal of securing stability of raw materials by developing differentiated seeds, and to contrib-
  ute to enhancing domestic agricultural competitiveness. as an r&d based company specializing in
  seeds, the company will continue to expand the type of crops for seed development and supply them
  to the farmers for shared growth. we gather farmers and plant breeders as shareholders to practice
  sincere benefit sharing, which is a win-win cooperation model where a corporation, the academia and
  farmers continue to create added value through collaboration. in particular, in the basic crops field
  such as soybeans, rice and kimchi cabbage, we are developing excellent seeds with high yields and
  supply them to the farms for cultivation. based on these outstanding seeds, we plan to introduce 'cj
  happy bean no.1', 'the han no.1 kimchi cabbage', bean sprouts and kimchi.



employees’ participation in social contribution in the local community
well aware of the social responsibility of a company, we strive to spearhead social contribution
in the local community through employees’ active participation. as a member of society, we will
tap into the competence that we have and be reborn as a company that creates shared value
with the local community that is truly meaningful, and we will contribute to the advancement of
the country and society and grow together with the society.

joining hands for volunteer work
cj cheiljedang established the csv management team in 2013 to plan social contribution
activities that utilize its core competences and is focusing on implementing those plans into
action. the csv management team actively implements 'management of sharing' based on the
founding philosophy 'saeopboguk (building a stronger nation through business prosperity)' and
'gongjongongyeong(coexistence and co-prosperity)' by carrying out activities such as donors
camp, food bank, and the volunteer week that promotes volunteerism by organization unit.

donors camp donors camp is cj cheiljedang’s representative social contribution program
which aims to cultivate future human assets and stop the inheritance of poverty through education.
we provide various education support for marginalized children and teens, and introduced the
online sharing system that enables donors to participate conveniently. the teachers working at
institutions for marginalized children such as local children’s center, study room and rural branch
school post a teaching proposal through the internet on the type of education they need, which
the donor directly chooses the proposal they want to contribute to. the cj sharing foundation
matches the same amount to the donated amount and takes it directly to the site.

representative programs of the donors camp we operate the 'growing dream camp'
that helps children at the study room find their paths, and a program that dispatches college
students to study rooms as character development mentors, and we provide two-way support
for both the college students and children. in addition, we support the retraining and recharging
program for study room teachers in order to fundamentally improve the education level of the
low-income group.

food bank food bank is the food sharing program that distributes food to the marginalized
groups. major cj subsidiaries such as cj foodville, cj freshway and cj o’shopping participate
together with cj cheiljedang in food donation and employee volunteering, carrying out activ-
ities in many ways. in particular, we not only donate food but also specially-made gift set "jeul-
geoun donghang(happy companion) - food bank sharing of hope gift set" which consists of
basic food ingredients such as sugar, gochujang and flour. in 2015, 380 employees made 18,000
gift sets and personally delivered them through the moving food market program to individuals
who have limited mobility. this is an example of an integrated contribution service.

flea-market we hold the flea market events for employees where they can exchange goods
and donate the revenue. the krw 6 million that was raised at the flea market were used toward                       donations

utation and expertise are the first considerations, and we provide support so that they can make

decision-making process of the bod
the board of directors is currently chaired by an internal director, and major agendas are distributed
to all directors before the meeting to enable prior review into the matter. in addition, all directors are
given equal opportunities to speak in order to prevent the monopoly of agenda presentation, and to
mobilize the check and balance against the majority regarding major management agendas.

evaluation and remuneration
executive evaluation is conducted regularly through a fair and appropriate system. in particular, in the
case of registered executive officers who receive more than standard remuneration, the type of remu-
neration, the basis and amount are disclosed to spearhead the practice of transparent management.

practicing integrity management by observing the law
and principles and fulfilling our social responsibilities

the integrity management system
cj cheiljedang strives for integrity management that is based on cj group’s unique value
system called 'cj way'. we observe the fair trade act and also use the 'regulation on ethical
behavior' and 'management guideline on purchasing ethics' as the rules for all the employees
to follow. we aim for the whole organization to move toward integrity management by estab-
lishing a system that covers both internal and external aspects.

strengthening employees’ ethics awareness
cj cheiljedang encourages employees to voluntarily participate in the company’s integrity
management. all employees attend the 'integrity education' program to internalize 'integ-
rity', which is the core value of our organization, while also strengthening ethics awareness
through the ethics newsletter and whistle system.


ethics education for employees the basis for training programs for employees is 'cj                          2015 integrity education

spreading ethical management to suppliers
we promote ethical management to suppliers so that fair trading practices may spread
throughout the company including the supply chain. we define the management guideline
on purchasing ethics and stipulate fair trading conditions when contracting with suppliers. in
addition, when choosing a partner company and trading with them, their ethics and corpo-
rate culture are included as an important criteria. when signing a subcontracting agreement
we use the subcontracting contract as suggested by the fair trade commission, and have
them sign the 'partner company integrity pledge' before entering into agreement with them.
moreover, we prohibit suppliers from giving gifts or making monetary exchanges, and make
sure those who violate this rule will suffer cancelation of contract or legal responsibilities. ulti-
mately, we aim to contribute to spreading transparent trading customs and win-win growth
culture by pursuing win-win cooperation based on fair partnership with our suppliers.

securing sustainability through stable risk management
strengthening enterprise-wide risk management system
we strengthened the risk management system and provide detailed judgment criteria to enhance
the enterprise-wide risk response capability. as such, we clearly defined the duties and authority
of each organization, and built a system that enables quick response through a mobile app and pc
web. in addition, we conduct an ex post evaluation on whether the risk management rules have
been observed and improvement measures have been taken to provide continued feedback on risk
response, and promote risk awareness to all employees through company-wide education.

the company. in addition, we developed the risk response evaluation index and continue to take feed-
back and improvement measures. through this process, we strengthen our ability to respond quickly

major risks
cj cheiljedang has flagged 'climate change' and 'fluctuation in grain supply and demand' as the
major risks that will greatly affect future business, and responds proactively against those risks.

climate change risk           with increased external interest on climate change we are putting our
efforts into responding to the increasing administrative costs. we established the roadmap for
climate change response by stage and efficient energy management, and introduced advanced
energy optimization technologies to achieve the set goals, and continue to improve our internal
policies and training to enhance our climate change and energy management level.

fluctuations in grain supply and demand risk in order to respond to decrease in
demand and revenue as well as cost increase caused by changing global grains production and
prices, we have an internal organization under the food ingredient business division to moni-
tor the grains market conditions at all times. in addition, the research institute in charge of food
ingredients continues research to develop substitute materials in order to proactively prepare for
changing grains procurement conditions.


financial risks
as a company with global operations, cj cheiljedang strives to minimize foreign exchange
risks, especially the uncertainty caused by currency fluctuations and changes in profit/loss. in
addition we continue monitoring international grains prices and interest rates to enable a more
aggressive financial risk management.

financial risk management system the financial risk management system is divided
into market risk management activities and transaction confirmation activities, and each are
managed separately. market risk management activities include measurement and manage-
ment, analysis, reporting of market risks and tracking market conditions. meanwhile, transac-
tion confirmation activities include inspection of compliance with management principles and
review of financial transactions. in addition, the finance team and relevant teams such as the
grains importing department operate a monthly foreign exchange and derivatives committee,
thereby building an advance warning system on grains price and exchange rate risks.


non-financial risks
we put our efforts into preventing non-financial risks as well. we designate controlling depart-
ments for immediate and appropriate response to various risk factors such as environmental
risks and production process-related risks.

water resource risk regions suffering from chronic water shortage are steadily increasing
worldwide. water resource has become one of the priority elements among the global envi-
ronmental issues. thus, cj cheiljedang’s business sites under the bio business division both
domestically and abroad have strengthened their water risk management system, and contin-
ues to manage the water sources.

production process risk            we are building a process to prepare against risks at the head
office and between production lines at each business sites. we have set up a separate guideline
to prepare for exposure to hazardous substances and safety accidents that may occur during the
production process. meanwhile, we are strengthening the management level through a safety
accident prevention process, which ensures quick measures and the safety of the employees in
the event of an accident, and minimizes the impact on the local community and environment.

and enable them to balance work and life, so that we will build an advanced corporate culture.

open council          cj cheiljedang has built and operates the open council, which is the
'labor-management council' at each region and business site. instead of using the term
'labor-management council' which distinguishes workers from the employer, we use the term
'open council' to convey open communication between labor and management as well as open
management. the purpose of the open council is to bring company’s sound advancement and
enhance members’ social and economic status based on mutual trust. meetings are held regularly
each quarter, and temporary meetings are held whenever an agenda comes up. in addition, sep-
arate operation rules have been established for efficient operation of the council. agendas can be
broadly categorized into enhancing welfare benefits, improving working conditions and boosting
morale. recently, some agendas discussed at the council include self-development and promot-
ing the culture of a learning organization, expanding maternity protection at work, and strength-
ening safety and health management at the business sites.

maternity protection          a meeting is held each year for women employees and the manage-
ment, and their opinions are reflected throughout the company’s business. we implement mater-
nity protection activities including daycare at work, flexible work hours during child rearing, and
returnships for women with career breaks. we also operate the dream high project that provides
an opportunity to experience content prepared by the company such as cooking classes for the
employees’ families and movie nights.

   returnships cj cheiljedang actively participates in creating jobs for vulnerable groups who
have difficulty finding employment such as young adults, women and the elderly. we established
the “cj returnship” program that supports women with career breaks due to maternity leave,
which was the first in korea. employees who participate in the returnship program receive edu-
cation for re-employment after a 6-week internship, and then appointed to a post where they can
utilize their expertise. meanwhile, we allow working moms to choose between part-time or full-
time work hours to alleviate their hardships.

employee refreshment program                     cj cheiljedang provides support for various types of
accommodation facilities including condominiums, pensions and hotels both domestic and abroad, to
promote refreshment and leisure life of its employees. in addition, when at certain points of continued

building employee safety and health system
cj cheiljedang promotes safety and health awareness in the business locations by setting annual
objectives, risk assessments, and employee education and training. we aim to internalize the safety
and health culture by raising awareness and systematically improving the safety and health system.


safety and health management system cj cheiljedang has established the occupa-
tional health and kosha 18001(safety management system) at all domestic business sites and
operates systemic management on occupational health and safety through external certifications
and periodic post-evaluation. mandatory online and offline training courses are provided 4 times
a year and new employees must complete an additional 8 hours of training. in addition, a sur-
vey is conducted once a year regarding the welfare facilities to identify the employees’ needs for
improving working conditions. based on the survey, towels were added to the shower rooms in
the employees’ lounge; as well as bidets, hand sanitizers, plants in the offices, and massagers.


operation of the safety and health council we operate a company-wide, and for each
zone, safety and health councils to ensure employees are working in a pleasant, safe environ-
ment. the councils establish industrial safety and health standards and discuss, vote and improve
major safety and health related issues.

risk management at the business sites                       all business sites cj cheiljedang aims to realize
'no disaster business site'. meticulous management in the safety and health sector and preventing
serious industrial accidents involve taking measures to keep equipment safe; concentrated man-
agement on health risk groups through cerebral and cardiovascular disease incidence risk assess-
ment undertaken among all employees; prevention of serious accidents such as fire, explosion
& leakage and natural disasters such as torrential rain, typhoon, heavy snow; and diagnosis on
potential risks by specialized institutions and tasks to minimize damages. owing to these efforts,
cj cheiljedang’s jincheon plant acquired the bcms (iso 22301) certification in october 2015,
which was the first in the domestic food industry.

considers health-related issues of the employees such as quitting smoking, moderation in drink-
ing, exercises, and stress from work in collaboration with regional health organizations. we
support health check-up fees and renewal of group personal accidents insurance, as well as
                                                                                                                         certificate of outstanding

independent assurance statement



introduction
cj cheiljedang corporation ('cj cheiljedang') commissioned dnv gl business assurance korea ltd. ('dnv gl'), part of dnv gl group,
to undertake independent assurance of the sustainability report 2015 (the 'report'). the directors of cj cheiljedang have sole responsi-
bility for the preparation of the report. the responsibility of dnv gl in performing the assurance work is to the management of cj chei-
ljedang in accordance with the terms of reference. dnv gl’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and infor-
mation provided by the client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith.


scope of assurance
the scope of assurance included a review of sustainability activities and performance data over the reporting period 1st january to 31st
december 2015. this included:

·evaluation of the principles for defining the sustainability report content
 in the global reporting initiative (gri) sustainability reporting guidelines 4.0
·evaluation of the process for determining material aspects for reporting and the management
 approach to material issues and the process for generating, gathering and managing
 the quantitative and qualitative data in the report.


basis of our opinion
we performed our work using dnv gl’s assurance methodology verisustaintm1, which is based on our professional experience, interna-
tional assurance best practice including international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (isae 3000). we applied the limited level
of assurance. the audit was carried out in february and march 2016. the site visits were made to cj cheiljedang center. we undertook
the following activities as part of the assurance process:

·challenged the sustainability-related statements and claims made in the report and assessed
 the robustness of the underlying data management system, information flow and controls;
·interviewed representatives from the various departments;
·conducted document reviews, data sampling and interrogation of supporting databases and associated reporting
 system and associated reporting systems as they relate to selected content and performance data;
·reviewed the outcomes of stakeholder consultation report and the materiality assessment report.


limitations
the engagement excludes the sustainability management, performance and reporting practices of cj cheiljedang’s associated compa-
nies, subsidiaries, suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the report. dnv gl did not interview external stakeholders
as part of this assurance engagement. economic performance based on the financial data is cross-checked with internal documents, the
audited consolidated financial statements and the announcement disclosed at the website of korea financial supervisory service (http://
dart.fss.or.kr) as well as cj cheiljedang’s website (www.cj.co.kr). these documents, financial statements and the announcements are
not included in this assurance engagement. limited depth of evidence gathering including inquiry and analytical procedures and limited
sampling at lower levels in the organization were applied. the baseline data for environmental and social performance are not verified,
while the aggregated data at the corporate level are used for the verification. dnv gl expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility
for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this assurance statement.

appendix                               independent assurance statement                                                                    67




opinion and observation
on the basis of the work undertaken, nothing comes to our attention to suggest that the report does not properly describe the adher-
ence to the principles for defining report content in gri g4 nor is prepared ‘in accordance’ with gri g4 core option. the verification team
has observed that there is general awareness of sustainability context across all different levels of the organization. further opinions with
regards to the adherence to the following principles are made below;


stakeholder inclusiveness
cj cheiljedang has identified internal and external stakeholder groups such as consumers and customers, suppliers, governments,
shareholders, local communities and employees. cj cheiljedang engages with the stakeholders at the company and business unit lev-
els through various channels. the examples of approaches to engagement with selected stakeholders are described in the report. in the
future, cj cheiljedang could present the reasonable expectations and interests of stakeholders and report corresponding actions taken
in the report.


sustainability context
cj cheiljedang has stated the definition of the creating shared value (csv) based on the social and environmental value and its busi-
ness context in the report. its efforts to generate csv and various performances associated with sustainability are presented. the
stakeholders can review the improvement of sustainability performance with indicators. cj cheiljedang could provide the transpar-
ent information to the stakeholder with regard to core initiatives and relevant performance targets to achieve csv.

materiality
cj cheiljedang has conducted materiality assessment to prepare the report. the relevant issue pool is formed by analysing the key
issues from the global sustainability initiatives and standards, the topics which industry peer group considers material and the subjects
covered by mass media. the issues in the pool are rated by stakeholders via survey in terms of the impact for the prioritization. the audit
team has reviewed the materiality assessment process. in addition, cj cheiljedang has grouped the material issues into 5 aspects and
presented its management approaches in the report.
