     own sustainability.    our own survival comes under question and we see no option other than
                            to transform the way we conduct ourselves.

                            a corporation is akin to a human being. an important difference
                            perhaps being that it can survive beyond a normal human life span. for
                            long, corporations have been lauded for contributing to prosperity and
                            well-being. a reversal of sorts came a few years back, when concerns for
                            climate change and global warming surfaced, mighty economies crumbled,
                            large corporations abruptly became vulnerable and people suffered in
                            large numbers.

                            these developments taught many lessons and brought the concept of
                            'sustainability' to the forefront. we have learnt that singular focus on
                            financial performance is not good enough. environmental and social
                            performances are as important. responsible organisations have realised
                            that working for the sustainability of future generations ensures own
                               sustainability. there is now widespread acknowledgement that every
                                 stakeholder is important and there are business benefits in becoming
                                     environmentally and socially responsible.

                                          continuing maruti suzuki's sustainability mantra of 'give, get
                                            and grow', we have enhanced our focus on environment
                                               friendly manufacturing, products and supply chain.

                                                         together with our suppliers, we have
                            embarked on a journey to promote people friendly practices and create a

from the materiality assessment matrix
and categorised into economic,
environmental and social dimensions.
the progress against these parameters is
monitored at the operational levels by
respective divisional heads and at

                                               matters related to road safety.

                                               msil was invited by ministry of road transport and highways to discuss setting up of

make them a good road user for a life
time. as part of national road safety
mission, msil initiated a road safety
sensitisation programme in 2009-10. the
key features of this programme include
presentations in schools, screening of
short films on road safety, awareness
through banners, road safety rallies and
young drivers' contest.

msil has developed an interactive
presentation and small films targeting
students from fifth standard onwards.
mds instructors visit schools in their
respective cities and make presentations
and show films. this initiative received
overwhelming response with requests
coming from several school principals for
repeat programmes. in 2009-10, we were
able to cover nearly 6000 children. besides,
school children are also invited for road
safety rallies. such rallies were conducted
during road safety week in january, 2010
in association with siam-safe at india
gate and at auto-expo venue in pragati
maidan, new delhi. nearly 1800 students
participated in these rallies.
