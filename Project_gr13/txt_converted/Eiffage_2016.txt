         editorial


the year 2015 will be remembered at eiffage for the sudden death
of pierre berger, a man whose outstanding career was hailed
throughout our business field. it is a great honour to have been
chosen as his successor.

i will place all my passion for our business lines, all my expertise and
my experience at the service of our group in order to push ahead with
its development. it is up to me, along with the whole management
team, to write a new page in eiffage’s history in keeping with its values,
its identity and the strategic priorities implemented in the last few years.

we will focus on continuing to develop employee share ownership,
which is a vector of cohesion, and further intensify our training through
eiffage university, a strategic resource for the group. we will also
endeavour to consolidate our compact organisation, promote
our ambitious sustainable development policy and pursue the digital
transformation started with the major campaign launched in 2015
to promote the use of electronic documents. furthermore, as a result
of the work done by the eiffage foundation, which has established
a long-term relationship with associations with the aim of furthering
social integration, notably by helping people find suitable
accommodation, training and jobs, we are constantly strengthening
our roots in the areas of employment in which we operate.

eiffage is a strong group with outstanding teams, expertise and
references. by achieving a balance between concessions, contracting
activities and property development, we are able to withstand
the current period of market change. our strong, long-term foothold
in the various regions of france and other countries where we are
established helps us remain close to our clients.

we will strive harder than ever to keep one step ahead of changes
in our business fields, enabling us to propose innovative offerings
and products, and in doing so maintain our decisive competitive edge.
we must preserve our entrepreneurial spirit and independence
which encourage us to keep moving ahead while remaining
attentive to the needs of our clients and markets. by acting with
determination, concentrating on our fundamental priorities
and remaining true to our values, we will be able — together —
to raise the group’s colours ever higher.

michelin rdi campus,
a supersized campus
eiffage delivered the first phase of
the new michelin research, development
and industrialisation centre in ladoux
in autumn 2015. a 26,000 sq. m steel-
framed sun canopy covers the first
six buildings. heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems were installed on
the 40 floors of office space. careful
upstream planning of these operations,
as part of an integrated offering, ensured
that this well-organised work phase
went smoothly. by early 2018, this site —
featuring 85,000 sq. m of floor space
and 12 buildings — will be the biggest
campus in auvergne.

rejuvenating the grande arche in
la défense
the grande arche in la défense (near
paris) — one of the iconic monuments of the
grand paris area — is getting a facelift.
the 8,000 sq. m roof and french government
offices (on the south-facing side) are being
completely renovated. acting as the
contracting authority, eiffage concessions
planned the operation’s organisation and
is supervising the project. 11,000 sq. m
of facade and all the building’s equipment
are being renovated. some 600 craftsmen
from eiffage construction and eiffage
énergie will be working on site during the
project’s busiest period, in coordination
with valode & pistre architects. asbestos
was removed from the building and the
office decks were cleaned in 2015. work to
replace the marble on the facade is under
way. occupants are scheduled to move
in during the first quarter of 2017. eiffage
services will then take over to provide part
of the building’s maintenance until 2034.

green-er, a pilot university in grenoble
the green-er school of energy and water
management in grenoble showcases top
energy-saving technologies. the new
22,000 sq. m building, which was built by
eiffage construction and eiffage énergie
under the leadership of eiffage concessions
and handed over in june 2015, offers
better energy-saving performance than
buildings built in accordance with the 2012
thermal performance regulation (tr).
this was achieved by eliminating thermal
bridging, enhancing the building shell's
airtightness and optimising the use of natural
lighting. the green-er building will be
maintained by eiffage services for 26 years.

signboards unveil the attractions

40 years after erecting the first motorway
signboards highlighting points of cultural

first department served by the aprr
motorway network to install modernised
signboards with a completely new look.
in 2015, six new signs in orange-brown
hues were put up along the a5 motorway.
these signs are also livened up with
much more striking graphics and wording.
all aspects of the aube department’s
culture and leisure activities are now on
display, from the clairvaux cistercian
abbey to the champagne region’s
vineyards and wine cellars. these themes
are a harmonious addition to the original
six signs, renovated in late 2013, which
depict the city of troyes as a key centre
for heritage, fashion and the arts. the
example set by the a5 is now being rolled
out to other motorways managed by
aprr & area.

                               to optimise eiffage’s
                               operating costs
                               the group has implemented a far-reaching anti-waste plan in order
                               to cut unnecessary costs. operating costs are carefully analysed,
                               in areas including vehicle fleets, telephones and printouts, in order
                               to optimise cost controls.

                                   impairing waste, eiffage has set up a comprehensive anti-waste plan to
                                   rout out unnecessary costs and achieve significant savings.

                               the first step was to optimise the vehicle fleet. the group’s purchasing
                               department has cut down on short journeys for light utility vehicles weighing
                               under 3.5 tonnes. the rules on the allocation of these vehicles have been
                               revised. the pace of fleet renewal has been stepped up in order to bring
                               in more economical vehicles. the development of electric vehicles is
                               also being encouraged, to reduce fuel consumption and make a greater
                               contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with group policy.

                               rationalisation
                               cutting down on printing costs is another aspect of the drive to rationalise
                               costs. some 250 million pages are printed every year across the group,
                               representing an average of 5.5 million a week. the stock of photocopiers
                               is being reviewed and gradually resized. the number of printout points
                               is to be cut from 8,380 to 2,415 within the next two years. a pin code
                               or badge will henceforth be needed in order to print documents. print jobs
                               that are submitted but not executed are systematically cleared. colour
                               printing is subject to limits and scanning encouraged. the aim is to reduce
                               the overall print output to 175 million pages per year by the end of 2017.

training for managers
in the construction division, the occupational accident frequency rate was
brought down by 10.5% in france to 15.64, and by 4.5% in france plus other
countries to the new figure of 16.07. the principal hazards were falls from
height, operations at work stations and toppling or falling equipment.
as in the infrastructures division, priority was given to training managers,
bearing in mind that firmness is of the essence when it comes to safety.
175 regional, subsidiary, firm and operating managers were asked to define
their own specific risk prevention commitments according to their actual
circumstances. a second campaign is being rolled out in 2016, led by                                                                2
safety-trained managers and targeting several thousand personnel, including
works managers and supervisors and foremen.

firms which have had an abnormally high accident frequency rate for more
than three years are to be audited during the current financial year so that
specific action plans can be implemented. deployment of the risk prevention
management plan is also to be pursued, through regional action plans.
training sessions providing basic safety knowledge, under the heading
“mastering safety know-how” will be redesigned and reinforced in 2016.

in 2015, the occupational accident frequency rate in the energy division
continued to drop, as in previous years, resulting in an annual figure of 9.09.
the division has set up a highly effective safety supervision system. in the
past eight years, more than 5,000 executives, including directors, managers
and site supervisors have received safety management training — including
260 trained in 2015. the degree of commitment shown by managers is
gauged by audits ordered by general management. accident prevention
targets related to risks posed by electrical work and work at height were set,
bolstering the existing safety measures, which include safety inspections
by managers, 15-minute risk prevention sessions and the analysis of
workplace accidents.

 mined is applied to the estimated profit for the lots sold.

a description of the risks to which the group is exposed
can be found in the “risk factors” chapter of the reference
document.

7.1. group risks committee
the group risks committee has three permanent mem-
bers: the chairman and chief executive officer, the chief
financial officer and the head of internal audit and risks.
members of other departments and independent special-
ists may also attend meetings if need be.
the committee meets at least once a year to review the
main risks and identify any changes to their criticality and
management.

group risks identified include organisational risks (informa-
tion systems, etc.), new business and project monitoring,
human resources, prevention, procurement, the environ-
ment and accounting, management and finance.

the risk mapping process was modified in 2015.

detailed risk mapping is carried out at division level; the
internal audit and risks department then uses this as a basis
to conduct its assignments.
