 opening doors to a world of opportunity

investors, customers and employees today are looking for
companies that offer more than just a product or service.
they’re looking for purpose and value – both for
themselves and their communities. marriott
international’s purpose as a hospitality company is to
open doors to a world of opportunity – wherever one’s
journey may take them. it is our reason for being, our
unifying mission, and the unique value we deliver to
people and communities around the world. for our hotel
guests, we offer an opportunity for rewarding travel
experiences; for our people, personal and professional
growth; for our owners and franchisees, profitable
investments; and for our investors, financial achievement.
for our communities, we offer an opportunity for a better
and more sustainable future in the places where we live
and work.

despite a challenging business environment over the
last several years, marriott continues to make ambitious
strides to benefit our long-term sustainability and the
communities in which we operate. in 2010, we released
our first sustainability report prepared according to the                            arne m. sorenson, president and chief operating officer; (left)

the way we do business

our company
marriott’s “spirit to serve®” our customers, associates, the
environment and communities is an important part of our
company culture and is integrated into how we do
business. our portfolio now encompasses over 3,600
managed and franchised properties across 20 brands in 71
countries and territories spanning six continents. at 2010
year-end, we employed approximately 129,000 associates
and reported sales of nearly $12 billion.

in february 2011, marriott announced plans to divide the
company into two separate, publicly traded companies,
one focused on lodging and the other on timeshare. as a
new company, marriott vacations worldwide
corporation will focus on the timeshare business as the
exclusive developer and operator of vacation ownership
and related products under the marriott brand and the

     program provides access, education and guidance
     throughout the hotel development process, from selecting
     the appropriate brand to opening the hotel. in 2010, we
     had 578 hotels as a part of our diverse ownership initiative
     portfolio.

     multicultural fairs featuring associates dressed in traditional
