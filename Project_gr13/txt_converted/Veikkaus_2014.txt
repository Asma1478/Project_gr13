principles of financial risk management
in its business operations veikkaus is exposed to certain financial risks of a limited scale. the principal financial
risks are interest rate risk and ccr (credit risk). to manage these financial risks, veikkaus has a risk management
policy in place, approved by the board of directors. exchange rate risk and liquidity risk are not significant due to
the nature of veikkaus’ operations.

interest rate risk
short-term financial investments expose veikkaus to an interest rate risk, which is, however, of minor significance.
income and operative cash flows are largely independent of changes in market interest rates.

credit risk
in its investing activities, veikkaus complies with the guidelines approved by the board of directors. according to
these guidelines, investments are made by securing the capital without exchange rate risks and for a maximum of
five years. investment in shares is not permitted under the investment principles.
the credit risk related to receivables from retailers is largely diversified, and therefore does not involve a significant
credit risk.

16. liabilities from employee benefits
pension liabilities
the defined benefit pension schemes include additional pensions that enable some of veikkaus' employees to
retire at an earlier age without losing part of their pension. certain pension schemes were granted to employees
who joined veikkaus before 1985 and somewhat different schemes to employees who joined before 1994.the
commitment given to the insured is recorded under liabilities in the balance sheet, while the insurance company's
proportion of this commitment is presented under assets. pensions and paid-up policies are pension index
adjusted. the costs incurred are borne entirely by veikkaus, because the insurance company has estimated its
compensation at zero. in the insurance arrangement, the assets are calculated using the same discount rate as the
liabilities; consequently, any change in the discount rate will not result in material risk. similarly, an increase in life
expectancy will not result in any material risk because the insurance company bears the majority of the impact of
increase life expectancy. meanwhile veikkaus is fully liable for the increase in pensions; for example, an increase of
0.5% in the pension index would raise the liability by 6.7%, while a decrease of 0.5% would lower the liability by
6.0%.
