 forward-looking statements
 this integrated report contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the united states private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including
 estimates, forecasts, targets and plans. such forward-looking statements do not represent any guarantee by management of future performance.
     in many cases, but not all, we use such words as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “endeavor,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “probability,” “project,” “risk,” “seek,”
 “should,” “strive,” “target” and similar expressions in relation to us or our management to identify forward-looking statements. you can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions
 of strategy, plans or intentions. these statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
     we may not be successful in implementing our business strategies, and management may fail to achieve its targets, for a wide range of possible reasons, including, without limitation:
 increase in allowance for loan losses and incurrence of significant credit-related costs; declines in the value of our securities portfolio; changes in interest rates; foreign currency fluctuations;
 decrease in the market liquidity of our assets; revised assumptions or other changes related to our pension plans; a decline in our deferred tax assets; the effect of financial transactions entered
 into for hedging and other similar purposes; failure to maintain required capital adequacy ratio levels; downgrades in our credit ratings; our ability to avoid reputational harm; our ability to
 implement our medium-term business plan and other strategic initiatives and measures effectively; the effectiveness of our operational, legal and other risk management policies; the effect of
 changes in general economic conditions in japan and elsewhere; and amendments and other changes to the laws and regulations that are applicable to us. further information regarding factors
 that could affect our financial condition and results of operations is included in “item 3.d. key information—risk factors,” and “item 5. operating and financial review and prospects” in our
 most recent form 20-f filed with the u.s. securities and exchange commission (“sec”) and our report on form 6-k furnished to the sec on july 29, 2016, both of which are available in the
 financial information section of our web page at www.mizuho-fg.co.jp/english/ and also at the sec's website at www.sec.gov.
     the contents of this integrated report were prepared prior to the announcement of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

    business domain

    mizuho financial group (”the group”) is composed of mhfg (holding company) and its
    subsidiaries and affiliates and provides banking, trust banking, securities and other
    financial services.
      since april 2016, mizuho has introduced an in-house company structure based on
    customer segments. the aim of this structure is to utilize mizuho’s strengths and com-
    petitive advantage, under a holding company which integrates the banking, trust bank-
    ing and securities functions, to responsively provide highest-quality financial services
    that closely match customer needs.
      two units independent from the in-house companies were established to further
    enhance expertise and support all of the in-house companies.

             global partner” by drawing on all our compre-
             hensive capabilities to offer solutions that

             kosuke nakamura




     as its customers’ “trusted global partner,” mizuho offers a full lineup of
     financial solutions
     the corporate & institutional company was formed and commenced
     operations following the combination of the corporate banking unit
     (large corporations) and the financial institutions & public sector business
     unit. this company is in charge of providing services to large corporations,
     financial institutions, and public-sector entities in japan.
        in the large corporate customer market, based on its strong and
     long-standing relationships with large corporate customers in japan, the
     company offers a full lineup of financial solutions that combine its special-
     ized functions in banking, trust banking and securities to meet customer
     needs for fund-raising and fund-management as well as for formulation
     of corporate management and financial strategies.
        in the financial institutions market, requirements of customers for for-
     mulation of capital policies and the sophistication of asset management
     are rising, and the company offers optimal solutions to meet their needs
     based on collaboration among group companies.
        for public sector entities, the company provides comprehensive finan-
     cial services including supporting for fund-raising through underwriting
     public bonds and performing services as a designated financial institution.
        also, as one of the important issues in the japanese economy is revital-
     izing regional economies, the company is working to transform agricul-
     ture, forestry, and fisheries industries into growth sectors and is actively
     introducing ppp and pfi arrangements* to facilitate financing of airport
     and public facilities projects.

     *ppp, or public private partnership is a scheme that enables collaboration between the
     public and private sectors in projects that offer public services. pfi, or private finance
     initiative, is a typical form of ppp under which private-sector funds and knowhow
     are used in the maintenance and operation of public facilities and the private-sector
     participants in pfi projects take the initiative in supplying public services.

   pepper provides a new kind of hospitality for customers by making small talk about finance
   and giving them guidance. in addition, in may 2016, mizuho took up the next challenge of
   combining pepper with ibm’s watson technology to provide more sophisticated services.

                                                                                                                 welcoming ceremony held for pepper to mhbk

 regarding the next-generation it systems, the design and programming stages have been completed, and start-up tests are in progress. the
 next-generation it system will unify the current three core banking account systems, and this will result in downsizing and streamlining it sys-
 tems. by developing independent components for each business and function, it will be possible to adapt flexibly to the introduction of new
 services and to reduce the development time and costs, and, by structuring cutting-edge core banking systems, we will be able to strengthen
 the infrastructure for providing services to customers and improve the processing speed of our operations. going forward, looking to the
 completion of the system development, we will conduct thorough start-up tests, and, to make the transition to the new system smooth, we
 will specify the steps in the procedure. at the same time, we will conduct thorough training in our front offices, keep customers informed
 with notices. as one of our most important projects, we will take a thoroughgoing approach and work to transit our next-generation it
 systems ahead of our competitors.

risk management structure

commitment to risk management

basic approach
amid the growing diversity and complexity of banking op-           risk management structure
erations, financial institutions are exposed to various risks,
including credit, market operations, information technology,
legal, settlement and other risks. we recognize the conduct-
ing of operations tailored to the risks and managing such
risks as a key issue relating to overall management. in order
to implement our business strategy while maintaining our
financial stability, we maintain comprehensive risk manage-
ment and control measures.
   mhfg maintains basic policies for risk management
established by its board of directors that are applicable to the
entire group. these policies clearly define the kinds of risks
to be managed, set forth the organizational structure and
provide for the human resources training necessary for ap-
propriate levels of risk management. the policies also provide
for audits to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the
risk management structure. in line with these basic policies,
we maintain various measures to strengthen and enhance
the sophistication of our risk management system.


risk management structure
each of our subsidiaries adopts appropriate risk management
measures for its business based on the size and nature of
its risk exposures, while mhfg controls risk management
for the group as a whole. at mhfg, the risk management
committee chaired by the group chief risk officer (group
cro) provides integrated monitoring and management
of the overall risk for the group. the group cro reports
the risk management situation to the board of directors,
the audit committee, the risk committee, the executive
management committee and the president & group ceo,
on a regular basis and as needed. mhfg regularly receives
reports and applications concerning the risk management
situation from our core group companies and gives them ap-
propriate instructions concerning risk management. our core
group companies each maintains its own system for manag-
ing various types of risk, regularly receiving reports on the
status of risk at their respective subsidiaries, and gives them
appropriate instructions concerning risk management.

to certain individual counterparties or corporate groups. the
other type is “chain-reaction default risk,” which arises from

      independent auditors’ report




      the board of directors
      mizuho financial group, inc.

      we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of mizuho financial group, inc., which comprise the
      consolidated balance sheet as of march 31, 2016, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes
      in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory
      information, all expressed in japanese yen.

      management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
      management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance
      with accounting principles generally accepted in japan, and for designing and operating such internal control as management
      determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements that are free from
      material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

      auditors’ responsibility
      our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit
      in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in japan. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
      obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
      an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
      financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
      misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. the purpose of an audit of the consolidated
      financial statements is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control, but in making these risk
      assessments the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
      financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. an audit also includes evaluating
      the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
      evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

      opinion
      in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
      financial position of mizuho financial group, inc. as of march 31, 2016, and their consolidated financial performance and cash
      flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in japan.

      convenience translation
      we have reviewed the translation of these consolidated financial statements into u.s. dollars, presented for the convenience of
      readers, and, in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been properly translated on the basis
      described in note 1.

5. standards of accounting method

(1) credited loans pursuant to trading securities and trading income & expenses
  credited loans held for the purpose of trading are, in line with trading securities, recognized on a trade date basis and
  recorded in other debt purchased on the consolidated balance sheet. other debt purchased related to the relevant
  credited loans is stated at fair value at the consolidated balance sheet date.
    interest received and the gains or losses on the sale of the relevant credited loans during the fiscal year, including
  the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, are
  recognized in other operating income and other operating expenses on the consolidated statement of income.

(2)trading assets & liabilities and trading income & expenses
  trading transactions intended to take advantage of short-term fluctuations and arbitrage opportunities in interest rates,
  currency exchange rates, market prices of securities and related indices are recognized on a trade-date basis and
  recorded in trading assets or trading liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. income or expenses generated on
  the relevant trading transactions are recorded in trading income or trading expenses on the consolidated statement of
  income.
    securities and other monetary claims held for trading purposes are stated at fair value at the consolidated balance
  sheet date. derivative financial products, such as swaps, futures and option transactions, are stated at their fair values,
  assuming that such transactions are terminated and settled at the consolidated balance sheet date.
    trading income and trading expenses include the interest received and paid during the fiscal year, the gains or
  losses resulting from any change in the value of securities and other monetary claims between the beginning and the
  end of the fiscal year, and the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value of financial derivatives between the
  beginning and the end of the fiscal year, assuming they were settled at the end of the fiscal year.

(3) securities
  in accordance with “accounting standard for financial instruments” (the business accounting deliberation council,
  january 22, 1999), mhfg classifies securities, excluding those of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and
  affiliates, into three categories based upon management's intent. these securities are accounted for as follows:
  (i) trading securities are carried at market value and included in trading assets.
  (ii) bonds held to maturity are stated at amortized cost (straight-line method) and determined by the moving average
        method.
  (iii) other securities are securities which are not classified as either trading securities or bonds held to maturity. other
        securities which have readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value with changes in net unrealized gains or
        losses, net of applicable income taxes after excluding gains and losses as a result of the fair-value hedge method,
        included directly in net assets. the fair value of japanese stocks is determined based on the average quoted
        market price over the month preceding the consolidated balance sheet date. the fair value of securities other than
        japanese stocks is determined at the quoted market price if available, or other reasonable value at the consolidated
        balance sheet date (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving-average method). other securities,
        the fair values of which are extremely difficult to determine, are stated at acquisition cost or amortized cost which is
        determined by the moving-average method.
      in addition, investments in affiliates not under the equity method are stated at acquisition cost as determined by the
  moving average-method.
      securities which are held as trust assets in money held in trust accounts are valued in the same way as securities
  above.
  certain securities other than trading securities (excluding securities for which it is deemed to be extremely difficult to
  determine the fair value) are devalued to the fair value, and the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair
  value is treated as a loss for the fiscal year (“impairment (devaluation)”), if the fair value (primarily the closing market
  price at the consolidated balance sheet date) has significantly deteriorated compared with the acquisition cost (including
  amortized cost), and unless it is deemed that there is a possibility of a recovery in the fair value. the amounts of
  impairment (devaluation) were ¥9,161 million ($81,294 thousand) and ¥3,206 million for the fiscal years ended march
  31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.




                                                                                                                            165

financial data of mizuho financial group, inc.
notes to consolidated financial statements




       the criteria for determining whether a security's fair value has “significantly deteriorated” are outlined as follows:
        ・security whose fair value is 50% or less of the acquisition cost
       ・security whose fair value exceeds 50% but is 70% or less of the acquisition cost and the quoted market price
         maintains a certain level or lower

(4) bills discounted
   in accordance with “accounting and auditing treatment relating to adoption of accounting standards for financial
   instruments for banks” (the japanese institute of certified public accountants (“jicpa”) industry audit committee
   report no. 24), bills discounted are accounted for as financing transactions. the banking subsidiaries have rights to sell
   or pledge these bankers' acceptances, commercial bills, documentary bills and foreign exchange bills purchased. the
   face value of these bills amounted to ¥1,304,681 million ($11,577,619 thousand) and ¥1,370,730 million as of march 31,
   2016 and 2015, respectively.

(5) derivative transactions
   derivative transactions are valued at fair value with changes in fair value included in current income. derivatives
   qualifying as hedges are mainly accounted for using either the fair-value hedge method or the deferred method of
   hedge accounting (see (22) hedge accounting).

(6) tangible fixed assets (except for lease assets)
   depreciation of buildings is computed mainly by the straight-line method, and that of others is computed mainly by the
   declining-balance method. the range of useful lives is as follows:
           buildings 3 years to 50 years
           others    2 years to 20 years

(7) intangible fixed assets (except for lease assets)
   amortization of intangible fixed assets is computed by the straight-line method. development costs for internally-used
   software are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives of mainly from five to ten years as determined
   by mhfg and its consolidated subsidiaries.

(8) lease assets
   depreciation of lease assets booked in tangible fixed assets and intangible fixed assets which are concerned with
   finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership is mainly computed by the same method as the one applied to
   fixed assets owned by us.

(9) deferred assets
      bond issuance costs are expensed as incurred.

(10) reserves for possible losses on loans
  reserves for possible losses on loans of major domestic consolidated subsidiaries are maintained in accordance with
  internally established standards for write-offs and reserve provisions:
  • for claims extended to obligors that are legally bankrupt under the bankruptcy law, special liquidation under the
     company law or other similar laws (“bankrupt obligors”), and to obligors that are effectively in similar conditions
     (“substantially bankrupt obligors”), reserves are maintained at the amounts of claims net of direct write-offs
     described below and the expected amounts recoverable from the disposition of collateral and the amounts
     recoverable under guarantees.
  • for claims extended to obligors that are not yet legally or formally bankrupt but are likely to be bankrupt (“intensive
     control obligors”), reserves are maintained at the amounts deemed necessary based on overall solvency analyses of
     the amounts of claims net of expected amounts recoverable from the disposition of collateral and the amounts
     recoverable under guarantees.
  • for claims extended to intensive control obligors and obligors with restructured loans (defined in note 12 below)
     and others, if the exposure to an obligor exceeds a certain specific amount, reserves are provided as follows:
     (i) if future cash flows of the principal and interest can be reasonably estimated, the discounted cash flow method is
          applied, under which the reserve is determined as the difference between the book value of the loan and its
          present value of future cash flows discounted using the contractual interest rate before the loan was classified as
          a restructured loan, and
     (ii) if future cash flows of the principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated, reserves are provided for the
          losses estimated for each individual loan.
  • for claims extended to other obligors, reserves are maintained at rates derived from historical credit loss experience
     and other factors.
  • reserve for possible losses on loans to restructuring countries is maintained in order to cover possible losses
     based on analyses of the political and economic climates of the countries. all claims are assessed by each claim
     origination department in accordance with the internally established “self-assessment standard,” and the results of
     the assessments are verified and examined by the independent examination departments.
     in the case of claims to bankrupt obligors and substantially bankrupt obligors, which are collateralized or
  guaranteed by a third party, the amounts deemed uncollectible (calculated by deducting the anticipated proceeds from
  the sale of collateral pledged against the claims and amounts that are expected to be recovered from guarantors of the
  claims) are written off against the respective claim balances. the total directly written-off amounts were ¥157,807 million
  ($1,400,372 thousand) and ¥227,209 million as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     other consolidated subsidiaries provide the amount necessary to cover the loan losses based upon past experience
  and other factors for general claims and the assessment for each individual loan for other claims.

(11) reserve for possible losses on investments
  reserve for possible losses on investments is maintained to provide against possible losses on investments in
  securities, after taking into consideration the financial condition and other factors concerning the investee company.

(12) reserve for bonus payments
  reserve for bonus payments, which is provided for future bonus payments to employees, is maintained at the amount
  accrued at the end of the fiscal year, based on the estimated future payments.

(13) reserve for variable compensation
  to prepare for the payments of performance payments and stock compensation to be paid as variable compensation
  within compensation for directors and executive officers of mizuho financial group, inc., mizuho bank, ltd., mizuho
  trust & banking co., ltd., and mizuho securities co., ltd., the estimated payment based on the standard amount
  regarding variable compensation of this fiscal year is provided.

(14) reserve for director and corporate auditor retirement benefits
  reserve for director and corporate auditor retirement benefits, which is provided for future retirement benefit
  payments to directors, corporate auditors, and executive officers, is recognized at the amount accrued by the end of the
  respective fiscal year, based on the internally established standards.




                                                                                                                           167

financial data of mizuho financial group, inc.
notes to consolidated financial statements




(15) reserve for possible losses on sales of loans
   reserve for possible losses on sales of loans is provided for possible future losses on sales of loans at the amount
   deemed necessary based on a reasonable estimate of possible future losses.

(16) reserve for contingencies
   reserve for contingencies is maintained to provide against possible losses from contingencies which are not covered
   by other specific reserves. the balance is an estimate of possible future losses considered to require a reserve.

(17) reserve for reimbursement of deposits

  retirement benefits to the period up to the end of this fiscal year. unrecognized actuarial differences are recognized as
  income or expenses from the following fiscal year under the straight-line method over a certain term within the average
  remaining service period of the employees (mainly 10 years) of the respective fiscal years.

  resignation at the end of the term to be retirement benefit obligations in computing net defined benefit liability and
  retirement benefit expenses.

   assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and accounts of overseas branches of domestic consolidated
   banking subsidiaries and a domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiary are translated into japanese yen primarily at
   the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date, with the exception of the investments in affiliates
   not under the equity method, which are translated at historical exchange rates.

   mentioned above, are translated into japanese yen primarily at the exchange rates in effect at the respective balance
   sheet dates.

(22) hedge accounting
  (a) interest rate risk
      the deferred method, the fair-value hedge method or the exceptional accrual method for interest rate swaps are
      applied as hedge accounting methods.
          the portfolio hedge transaction for a large volume of small-value monetary claims and liabilities of domestic
      consolidated banking subsidiaries and some of domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiaries is accounted for by
      the method stipulated in the jicpa industry audit committee report no.24, february 13, 2002.
          the effectiveness of hedging activities for the portfolio hedge transaction for a large volume of small-value
      monetary claims and liabilities is assessed as follows:
      (i) as for hedging activities to offset market fluctuation risks, the effectiveness is assessed by bracketing both the
            hedged instruments, such as deposits and loans, and the hedging instruments, such as interest-rate swaps, in
            the same maturity bucket.
       (ii) as for hedging activities to fix the cash flows, the effectiveness is assessed based on the correlation between the
             base interest rate index of the hedged instrument and that of the hedging instrument.
          the effectiveness of the individual hedge is assessed based on the comparison of the fluctuation in the market or
     of cash flows of the hedged instruments with that of the hedging instruments.
          deferred gains or losses on hedges recorded on the consolidated balance sheet resulted from the application of
     the macro-hedge method based on the “tentative accounting and auditing treatment relating to adoption of
     accounting standards for financial instruments for banks” (jicpa industry audit committee report no.15), under
     which the overall interest rate risks inherent in loans, deposits and other instruments are controlled on a macro-basis
     using derivatives transactions. these deferred hedge gains/losses are amortized as interest income or interest
     expenses over the remaining maturity and average remaining maturity of the respective hedging instruments.
          the unamortized amounts of gross deferred hedge losses on the macro-hedges, before net of applicable income
     taxes, were ¥319 million ($2,835 thousand) and ¥856 million as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the
     unamortized amounts of gross deferred hedge gains on the macro-hedges, before net of applicable income taxes,
     were ¥177 million ($1,573 thousand) and ¥704 million as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
  (b) foreign exchange risk
      domestic consolidated banking subsidiaries and some of domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiaries apply the
      deferred method of hedge accounting to hedge foreign exchange risks associated with various financial assets and
      liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as stipulated in the “accounting and auditing treatment relating to
      adoption of accounting standards for foreign currency transactions for banks” (jicpa industry audit committee
      report no.25, july 29, 2002). the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed by confirming that the amount of the
      foreign currency position of the hedged monetary claims and liabilities is equal to or larger than that of currency-
      swap transactions, exchange swap transactions, and similar transactions designated as the hedging instruments of
      the foreign exchange risk.
          in addition to the above methods, these subsidiaries apply the deferred method or the fair-value hedge method to
     portfolio hedges of the foreign exchange risks associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates denominated
     in foreign currency and other securities denominated in foreign currency (except for bonds) identified as hedged
     items in advance, as long as the amount of foreign currency payables of spot and forward foreign exchange
     contracts exceeds the amount of acquisition cost of the hedged foreign securities denominated in foreign currency.
  (c) inter-company transactions
      inter-company interest rate swaps, currency swaps and similar derivatives among consolidated companies or
      between trading accounts and other accounts, which are designated as hedges, are not eliminated and related gains
      and losses are recognized in the statement of income or deferred under hedge accounting, because these inter-
      company derivatives are executed according to the criteria for appropriate outside third-party cover operations which
      are treated as hedge transactions objectively in accordance with jicpa industry audit committee reports no.24 and
      25.
          as for certain assets and liabilities of mhfg and its consolidated subsidiaries, the deferred method, the fair-value
      hedge method or the exceptional accrual method for interest rate swaps are applied.




                                                                                                                           169

(23) consumption taxes and other
   with respect to mhfg and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, japanese consumption taxes and local consumption
   taxes are excluded from transaction amounts.

(24) amortization method of goodwill and amortization period
  goodwill is amortized over an appropriate period not to exceed 20 years under the straight-line method. the full amount
  of goodwill that has no material impact is expensed as incurred.

(25) scope of cash and cash equivalents on consolidated statement of cash flows
   in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from central banks
   included in “cash and due from banks” on the consolidated balance sheet.

6. change in accounting policies
      application of “accounting standard for business combinations” and others
      mhfg has applied “revised accounting standard for business combinations” (asbj statement no. 21, september 13,
      2013) (hereinafter, the “business combinations accounting standard”), “revised accounting standard for consolidated
      financial statements” (asbj statement no. 22, september 13, 2013) (hereinafter, the “consolidation accounting
      standard”), “revised accounting standard for business divestitures” (asbj statement no. 7, september 13, 2013)
      (hereinafter, the “business divestitures accounting standard” ) and other standards from the consolidated fiscal year
      ended march 31, 2016. accordingly, the accounting methods have been changed to record the difference arising from
      changes in equity in subsidiaries which mhfg continues to control as capital surplus, and to record business
      acquisition costs as expenses for the fiscal year in which incurred. in addition, regarding business combinations
      occurring on or after april 1, 2015, the accounting method has been changed to retroactively reflect adjustments to the
      amount allocated to acquisition costs arising from the finalization of the provisional accounting treatment on the
      consolidated financial statements of the period in which the business combination occurs. furthermore, presentation of
      net income and others has been changed and presentation of minority interests has been changed to non-controlling
      interests. in order to reflect the changes in presentation of financial statements, reclassification was made accordingly
      in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015.
          in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016, cash flow regarding
       acquisition or sale of the stocks of the subsidiaries unaccompanied by changes in the scope of consolidation has been
       classified into cash flow from financing activities. cash flow regarding costs arising from acquisition of the stocks of
       the subsidiaries accompanied by changes in the scope of consolidation or costs arising from acquisition or sale of the
       stocks of the subsidiaries unaccompanied by changes in the scope of consolidation has been classified into cash flow
       from operating activities.
          the business combinations accounting standard and other standards have been applied in accordance with the
       transitional treatment set forth in article 58-2 (3) of the business combinations accounting standard, article 44-5 (3) of
       the consolidation accounting standard and article 57-4 (3) of the business divestitures accounting standard. the
       cumulative effects arising from the retroactive application of these new accounting policies to all the previous fiscal
       years were added to or deducted from capital surplus and retained earnings as of april 1, 2015.
          as a result, goodwill decreased by ¥48,063 million, retained earnings decreased by ¥48,999 million, and capital
       surplus increased by ¥935 million as of april 1, 2015. in addition, ordinary profits and income before income taxes for
       the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016 each increased by ¥3,960 million.
         as a result of reflection of the cumulative effects on the net assets as of april 1, 2015, capital surplus increased by
      ¥935 million and retained earnings decreased by ¥48,999 million as of april 1, 2015 in the consolidated statements of
      changes in net assets.

7. issued but not yet adopted accounting standard and others
    revised implementation guidance on recoverability of deferred tax assets (asbj guidance no.26, march 28,
    2016)
  (i) overview
       this accounting standard comes from guidance on recoverability of deferred tax assets provided in
        “audit guideline for considering recoverability of deferred tax assets” (jicpa audit committee report no. 66)
       and the content of the guidance has been basically taken over and partially revised.

    (ii)    scheduled date of application
           mizuho financial group is scheduled to apply this accounting standard from the beginning of the fiscal year
           starting on april 1, 2016.
    (iii) effect of application of this accounting standard
           the effect of the application of this accounting standard is under consideration.

8. change in presentation of financial statements
   refund of income taxes included within current income taxes for the previous consolidated fiscal year has been
   separately presented from this consolidated fiscal year due to increased materiality.
       in order to reflect the change in presentation of financial statements, reclassification of the previous consolidated
   fiscal year has been made accordingly.
      as a result, current income taxes of ¥260,268 million presented in the consolidated statement of income for the
   previous consolidated fiscal year has been reclassified as current income taxes of ¥260,799 million and refund of
   income taxes of ¥(531) million.

*1 loans to bankrupt obligors represent non-accrual loans to obligors who are legally bankrupt as defined in article 96, paragraph 1, items 3 and 4 of the
  corporate tax law enforcement ordinance (government ordinance no.97, 1965).
*2 non-accrual delinquent loans represent non-accrual loans other than (i) loans to bankrupt obligors and (ii) loans of which payments of interest are
  deferred in order to assist or facilitate the restructuring of obligors in financial difficulties.
*3 loans to bankrupt obligors or non-accrual delinquent loans, both of which are classified as non-accrual, are not included in this category.
*4 restructured loans represent loans on which contracts were amended in favor of obligors (e.g., the reduction of or exemption from stated interest, the
  deferral of interest payments, the extension of maturity dates, or renunciation of claims) in order to assist or facilitate the restructuring of obligors in financial
  difficulties.

commitment line for loans
overdraft protection on current accounts and contracts of the commitment line for loans are contracts by which banking
subsidiaries are bound to extend loans up to the prearranged amount, at the request of customers, unless the customer is
in breach of contract conditions. the unutilized balance of these contracts amounted to ¥88,290,896 million ($783,484,748
thousand) and ¥82,839,928 million as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. of these amounts, ¥68,209,392 million
($605,283,453 thousand) and ¥64,322,076 million as of march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relate to contracts of
which the original contractual maturity is one year or less, or which are unconditionally cancelable at any time.
  since many of these contracts expire without being exercised, the unutilized balance itself does not necessarily affect
future cash flows. a provision is included in many of these contracts that entitles the banking subsidiaries to refuse the
execution of loans, or reduce the maximum amount under contracts when there is a change in the financial situation,
necessity to preserve a claim, or other similar reasons. the banking subsidiaries require collateral such as real estate and
securities when deemed necessary at the time the contracts are entered into. in addition, they periodically monitor
customers’ business conditions in accordance with internally established standards and take necessary measures to
manage credit risks such as amendments to contracts.

(3) the revision of the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to the change in tax rate of the
    corporate tax, etc:

      “act on partial amendment to the income tax act, etc.” (act no. 15, 2016) and “act on partial amendment to the
      local tax act, etc.” (act no. 13, 2016) were enacted on march 29, 2016, and accordingly, the corporate tax rate and
      other rates have been lowered from the fiscal year beginning on or after april 1, 2016.
      due to this change, the effective statutory tax rate used for the calculation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
      liabilities has been revised from the previous rate of 32.26%. the rate of 30.86% has been applied to the temporary
      differences, expected to be either deductible, taxable or expired from the fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2016 through
      the fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2017, while the rate of 30.62% has been applied to the temporary differences,
      expected to be either deductible, taxable, or expired in or after the fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2018.
      in addition, due to the revision of the carry-forward system of the net operating losses, the amount of net operating
      losses that can be deducted has been limited to the equivalent of 60% of taxable income before such deductions in the
      fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2016, while the amount of net operating losses that can be deducted has been limited
      to the equivalent of 55% of taxable income before such deductions in or after the fiscal year beginning on april 1, 2017.
      as a result of the changes in tax rates and the carry-forward system of the losses, deferred tax liabilities decreased
      by ¥21,868 million ($194,056 thousand), net unrealized gains on other securities increased by ¥26,866 million
      ($238,414 thousand), deferred gains or losses on hedges increased by ¥3,409 million ($30,252 thousand),
      remeasurements of defined benefit plans increased by ¥1,090 million ($9,676 thousand), and deferred income
      taxes increased by ¥9,501 million ($84,314 thousand). deferred tax liabilities for revaluation reserve for land
      decreased by ¥3,626 million ($32,181 thousand) and revaluation reserve for land increased by the same amount.



28. revaluation of land

in accordance with the land revaluation law (proclamation no.34 dated march 31, 1998), land used for business
operations of domestic consolidated banking subsidiaries was revalued. the applicable income taxes on the entire excess
of revaluation are included in deferred tax liabilities for revaluation reserve for land under liabilities, and the remainder,
net of applicable income taxes, is stated as revaluation reserve for land included in net assets.
       revaluation date: march 31, 1998
       revaluation method as stated in article 3, paragraph 3 of the above law: land used for business operations was
       revalued by calculating the value on the basis of the valuation by road rating stipulated in article 2, paragraph 4 of
       the enforcement ordinance relating to the land revaluation law (government ordinance no.119 promulgated on
       march 31, 1998) with reasonable adjustments to compensate for sites with long depth and other factors, and also on
       the basis of the appraisal valuation stipulated in paragraph 5.
       the difference at the consolidated balance sheet date between the total fair value of land for business operation
       purposes, which has been revalued in accordance with article 10 of the above-mentioned law, and the total book
       value of the land after such revaluation was ¥131,964 million ($1,171,037 thousand) and ¥147,005 million as of
       march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

41. financial instruments

1. matters relating to the conditions of financial instruments

(1) policy on financial instruments
  mizuho financial group (mhfg), which primarily engages in banking business, incurs financial liabilities such as
  customer deposits and market deposits on the funding side while holding financial assets such as customer loans, stocks
  and bonds on the investment side, and also engages in trading business for certain financial products. some
  consolidated subsidiaries conduct securities business and other financial business.
     for above funding and investment business, mhfg appropriately manages risks of each financial instrument and
  carefully watches term-gaps and other risk factors.

(2) contents and risk of financial products
  the main financial assets of the mizuho group consist of loans to customers and securities such as japanese stocks and
  government bonds. the group holds these securities for the purpose of reserves for deposit payments reserves and as
  investments. these financial assets are subject to various types of risk that may cause the group to incur losses due to
  a decline in, or total loss of, the value of assets, as a result of deterioration in a counterparty’s and/or an issuer’s financial
  position (“credit risk”), or due to a decline in the value of assets caused by fluctuations in interest rates, stock prices and
  foreign exchange rates and so on (“market risk”).
     the main financing source of the mizuho group is a stable source of deposits from its customers in addition to direct
  funding from the financial market. these financing sources are subject to the risk of losses (“liquidity risk”) arising from
  funding difficulties due to market disruption or a deterioration in our financial position that makes it difficult for us to raise
  the necessary funds or that forces us to raise funds at significantly higher interest rates than usual.
     in addition, the mizuho group uses derivative financial products to control the interest rate risk related to the assets
  and liabilities of the group, as part of our asset and liability management (“alm”). the group primarily utilizes the
  portfolio hedge by grouping numerous financial assets and liabilities such as loans and deposits into similar interest risk
  units in accordance with risk management policies. some derivative products like interest rate swaps are used as
  hedging methods for cash-flow hedges or fair value hedges. the group applies hedge accounting to the majority of
  these products, treating them as deferred hedges. the effectiveness of the hedges is assessed periodically by
  regression analysis and other methods to ensure whether the derivative financial products effectively work in order to
  offset the exposure to changes in fair value and variable cash flows from hedged items. it should be noted that the
  mizuho group uses derivative financial products for trading purposes and so on as well.
     as financial services become more complex and diverse, the mizuho group is exposed to various risks, including credit
  risk, liquidity risk and other risks.

(3) risk management for financial products
  (a) commitment to risk management
      we recognize the conducting of operations tailored to the risks and managing such risks as a key issue relating to
      overall management. in order to implement our business strategy while maintaining our financial stability, we
      maintain comprehensive risk management and control measures.
         we maintain basic policies for risk management established by our board of directors that are applicable to the
      entire mizuho group. these policies clearly define the kinds of risks to be managed, set forth the organizational
      structure and provide for the human resources training necessary for appropriate levels of risk management. the
      policies also provide for audits to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the risk management structure. in line
      with these basic policies, we maintain various measures to strengthen and enhance the sophistication of our risk
      management system.
  (b) general concept of risk management
      we classify our risk exposures according to the various kinds of risk, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk
      and operational risk, and manage each type of risk according to its characteristics.
         in addition to managing each type of risk individually, we have established a risk management structure to identify
      and evaluate overall risk and, where necessary, to devise appropriate responses to keep risk within limits that are
      managerially acceptable in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
         more specifically, we allocate risk capital to our principal banking subsidiaries, including their respective
      subsidiaries, and other core group companies to control risk within the limits set for each company. we also control


204

    risk within managerially acceptable limits by working to ensure that the overall risk we hold on a consolidated basis
    does not exceed shareholders’ equity and other measures of financial strength. to ensure the ongoing financial
    health of mizuho financial group, our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies, we regularly
    monitor the manner in which risk capital is being used in order to obtain a proper grasp of the risk profile within this
    framework. reports are also submitted to the board of directors and other committees of each company.
(c) credit risk management
    the board of directors of mizuho financial group determines basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. in
    addition, we have established the risk management committee as one of its business policy committees. this
    committee broadly discusses and coordinates basic policy in connection with credit risk management and matters in
    connection with overall credit portfolio management and credit risk monitoring for the mizuho group. under the
    control of the chief risk officer of mizuho financial group, the risk management division and the credit risk
    management division jointly monitor, analyze and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and
    execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management.
       we have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches in credit risk management. the first
    approach is “credit management,” in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual
    obligor from execution until collection, based on our assessment of the credit quality of the customer. through this
    process, we curb losses in the case of a credit event. the second is “credit portfolio management,” in which we
    utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk. through this process, we identify
    credit risk and respond appropriately.
       we use statistical methods to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a one-
    year risk horizon (“expected loss”) and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval (“credit var”). the
    difference between expected loss and credit var is measured as the credit risk amount (“unexpected loss”). we
    recognize two types of risk arising from allowing unexpected loss to become too large. one type is “credit
    concentration risk,” which stems from granting excessive credit to certain individual counterparties or corporate
    groups. the other type is “chain-reaction default risk,” which arises from granting excessive credit to certain areas,
    industrial sectors and other groupings. we manage these risks appropriately in line with our specific guidelines for
    each.
       the board of directors of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies determines
    key matters pertaining to credit risk in line with basic policies set forth by mizuho financial group. their respective
    business policy committees are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual
    credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors.
       the chief risk officer of each principal banking subsidiary and core group company is responsible for matters
    relating to planning and implementing credit risk management. the credit risk management division of each principal
    banking subsidiary is responsible for planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk
    measuring and monitoring. each credit division determines policies and approves/disapproves individual
    transactions regarding review and management of and collection from customers in accordance with the lines of
    authority set forth by each principal banking subsidiary. in addition, each of our principal banking subsidiaries has
    also established internal audit divisions that are independent of the business divisions in order to ensure appropriate
    credit risk management.
(d) market risk management
    the board of directors of mizuho financial group determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management
    policies. in addition, we have established the risk management committee as one of its business policy committees.
    the committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic asset and liability management policies
    risk planning and market risk management and proposes responses to emergencies such as sudden market
    changes.
       the chief risk officer of mizuho financial group is responsible for matters relating to market risk management
    planning and operations. the risk management division of mizuho financial group is responsible for monitoring
    market risk, reports and analyses, proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans
    relating to market risk management. in addition, the division assesses and manages the overall market risk of the
    mizuho group as a whole and keeps track of the market risk situation of our principal banking subsidiaries and other
    core group companies. the division also submits reports to the president & ceo on a daily basis and to our board
    of directors and the executive management committee of mizuho financial group on a regular basis.
       to manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital allocations. the amount of risk capital
    allocated to market risk corresponds to var and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant positions.



                                                                                                                       205

notes to consolidated financial statements




      for trading and banking activities, we set limits for var and for losses. for banking activities, we set position limits
      based on interest rate sensitivity as needed.
         our principal banking subsidiaries and certain other core group companies have formulated their basic policies in
      line with the basic policies determined by mizuho financial group. their boards of directors determine important
      matters relating to market risk management while their chief executive officers are responsible for controlling
      market risk. based on a common mizuho group risk capital allocation framework, the above-mentioned companies
      manage market risk by setting limits according to the risk capital allocated to market risk by mizuho financial group.
         they have the same market risk management structure as the mizuho financial group, such as their business
      policy committees being responsible for overall discussion and coordination of the market risk management.
         in addition, they have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of their
      front offices, which engage in market transactions, and their back offices, which are responsible for book entries and
      settlements. this system enables them to achieve mutual checks and control over market operations.
         when var is not adequate to control risk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices such as 10
      bpv (basis point value), carry out stress tests and set stop loss limits as needed.

        [definition of banking business]
        the following transactions are categorized as banking business, with trading business and cross-shareholdings
        being categorized separately.
            (1) deposits and loans as well as related funding activities, and hedge against interest rate risk.
            (2) equity (excluding cross-shareholdings), bonds, investment trusts, etc. and hedges against related market
               risk.
        the core deposit of liquid deposits is to be specified and incorporated into the measurement of market risk.

        banking business var used to calculate market risk equivalent is based on the following:
            • variance co-variance model for linear risk and monte-carlo simulation for non-linear risk;
            • var : the total amount of linear risk and non-linear risk;
            • confidence interval: one-tailed 99%;
            • holding period of one month ; and
            • historical observation period of one year.

        for the fiscal years ended march 31,                      2016                     2015                       2016

          [definition of trading business]
              (1) transactions held for the purpose of short-term resale.
              (2) transactions held for the purpose of making a profit from price fluctuations over a short period as well as
                   fixing a profit from arbitrage activities.
              (3) deals that have both aspects of (1) and (2) above.
              (4) deals held for broking business or market making business.
          trading business var used to calculate market risk equivalent is based on the following:
              • variance co-variance model for linear risk and monte-carlo simulation for non-linear risk;
              • var: the total amount of linear risk and non-linear risk;
              • confidence interval: one-tailed 99%;
              • holding period of one trading day; and
              • historical observation period of one year.
     iii. cross-shareholdings
         for cross-shareholdings, we take the same market risk management approach as that for banking and trading
         businesses with the use of var and risk indices.
            the risk index for the cross-shareholdings (sensitivity of the portfolio to a 1% change in the equity index of
         topix) is ¥29.7 billion ($263,991 thousand) and ¥37.4 billion for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2016 and 2015,
         respectively.
     iv. risk management using var
         var is a commonly used market risk management technique with statistical assumptions to measure maximum
         possible loss in the market, which will be incurred to the holding portfolio in a certain period with some probability.
         it should be noted that in general var model has the following shortcomings:
              • var estimates could differ by assumptions of holding period, confidence interval level and approaches for
                 the measurement.
              • var which is calculated based on historical data does not necessarily indicate an accurate future possible
                 maximum loss.
              • var might underestimate the probability of extreme market movements when the market gets inactive as
                 var assumes sales of holding portfolio and hedges in the market during the holding period for the
                 calculation.
              • the use of a 99% confidence level neither takes account of, nor makes any statement about, any losses
                 that might occur beyond this confidence level.
            the variance co-variance model used as the measurement technique of var assumes that change in a market
         movement follows a normal distribution. therefore, the model might underestimate the risk under the
         circumstance that the market is likely to move extremely beyond the assumption. the model might also
         underestimate the risk when the normal correlation assumption between interest rate and share price collapses
         under the circumstances when a rise in the interest rate and a deterioration of share price happen simultaneously.
            we check the validity of the market risk measurement made by var approach periodically by the back-test
         which compares var with actual profit and loss. in addition to var, we make a wide variety of management and
         controls such as risk indices monitoring, implementation of stress tests, loss limit monitoring in order to make strict
         risk management by capturing carefully all risks, including what var approach is not able to cover.
(f) liquidity risk management
     our liquidity risk management structure is generally the same as the market risk management structure described
     above (“item (d) market risk management”). however, the head of the financial control & accounting group of
     mizuho financial group is additionally responsible for matters relating to planning and running cash flow
     management operations, while the financial planning division is responsible for monitoring and adjusting the cash

      flow management situation and for planning and implementing cash flow management. reports on the cash flow
      situation are submitted to the risk management committee, the executive management committee and the
      president & ceo.
         we measure liquidity risk using indices pertaining to cash flow, such as limits on funds raised in the market. limits
      on liquidity risk are discussed and coordinated by the risk management committee, discussed further by the
      executive management committee and determined by the president & ceo. we have established classifications for
      the cash flow conditions affecting the group, ranging from “normal” to “anxious” and “crisis,” and have established
      procedures for dealing with cases which are deemed to fall into the “anxious” or “crisis” categories. in addition, we
      have constructed a system under which we will be able to respond smoothly in the event of emergency situations
      that affect our funding by establishing action plans.

(4) supplementary explanation of matters relating to fair value of financial instruments and others
  fair values of financial instruments include the values based on market prices, and the values deemed as market prices
  obtained by the reasonable estimate when the financial instruments do not have market prices. since certain
  assumptions and others are adopted for calculating such values, they may differ when adopting different assumptions
  and others.

  year has been noted accordingly.

(note 1) calculation method of fair value of financial instruments

assets
(1) cash and due from banks
   for due from banks which have no maturity, since fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the
   book values to be fair values. for due from banks which have maturity, since contractual terms of these items are
   mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values
   to be fair values.
(2) call loans and bills purchased, (3) receivables under resale agreements and (4) guarantee deposits paid under
    securities borrowing transactions
   since contractual terms of these items are mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values of these items
   approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values.
(5) other debt purchased
   fair values of other debt purchased are based on the values deemed as market prices obtained by the reasonable
   estimate such as those obtained from brokers and financial information vendors.
(6)trading assets
   fair values of securities held for trading, such as bonds held for trading, are based on the market prices and others.
(7)money held in trust
   as to securities managed as trust assets in a directed money trust for separate investment with the management of
   securities as its primary purpose, fair values of these items are calculated using the method stated in (8). for other
   money held in trust, since fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair
   values.
     the notes to money held in trust based on holding purpose are stated in “42.fair value of securities and money
   held in trust.”
(8)securities
   fair values of stocks are based on the prices on securities exchanges, and those of bonds and others are based on the
   market prices, valuations obtained from brokers and information vendors and others. fair values of investment trusts are
   based on the disclosed net asset value and others. fair values of private placement bonds are calculated by discounting
   the total amount of principal and interest and others at interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss
   and various risk factors by categories according to the internal ratings and terms.
     fair values of securitized products are based on valuations obtained from brokers and others, and reasonably
   calculated prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management. in deriving reasonably calculated prices
   based on the reasonable estimates of our management mentioned above, we used the discounted cash flow method.
   the price decision variables include default rates, recovery rates, pre-payment rates, and discount rates.
     fair values of floating-rate japanese government bonds, according to our determination that current market prices
   may not reflect the fair value, are based on the reasonably calculated prices as book value. in deriving the reasonably
   calculated prices, we used the discount cash flow method as well as other methods. the price decision variables include
   the yield of 10-year japanese government bonds and the volatilities of interest rate swap options for 10-year japanese
   government bonds as underlying assets.
      the notes to securities based on holding purpose are stated in “42.fair value of securities and money held in
   trust.”
(9)loans and bills discounted
   fair values of loans and bills discounted are calculated by the total amount of principal and interest and others at
   interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss and various risk factors by categories according to the
   types, internal ratings and terms of the loans and bills discounted. in addition, as to claims against bankrupt obligors,
   substantially bankrupt obligors and intensive control obligors, since the estimated amount of bad debts is calculated
   based on the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated amounts that we would be able to collect
   from collateral and guarantees, fair values approximate the amount of debentures and others minus the amount of




212

   reserves for possible losses on loans in the consolidated balance sheet as of the consolidated balance sheet date
   and we thus deem such amount to be fair values.
      of the loans and bills discounted, for those without a fixed maturity due to loan characteristics such as limiting loans
   to within the value of pledged assets, we deem book values to be fair values since fair values are expected to
   approximate book values based on the estimated loan periods, interest rates and other conditions.

liabilities
(1)deposits (2) negotiable certificates of deposit
   for demand deposits, we deem the payment amounts required on the consolidated balance sheet date (i.e., book
   values) to be fair values. in addition, fair values of fixed deposits and negotiable certificates of deposits are calculated by
   classifying them based on their terms and by discounting the future cash flows. the discount rates used in such
   calculations are the interest rates. since fair values of those whose deposit terms are short (i.e., within six months)
   approximate book values, we mainly deem the book values to be fair values.
(3)call money and bills sold, (4) payables under repurchase agreements and (5) guarantee deposits received under
   securities lending transactions
   since contractual terms of these financial instruments are mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values
   approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values.
(6)trading liabilities
   fair values of securities sold, not yet purchased in trading liabilities are based on the market prices and others.
(7)borrowed money
   fair values of borrowed money are calculated mainly by discounting the total amount of the principal and interest of
   such borrowed money classified by certain period at the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar loans.
(8)bonds and notes
   fair values of bonds and notes issued by mhfg and its consolidated subsidiaries are based on the market prices for
   bonds and notes which have market prices, and calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest by
   the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar bonds and notes for those which do not have market prices.
(9)due to trust accounts
   due to trust accounts of consolidated trust banking subsidiaries is used for transactions in which consolidated trust
   banking subsidiaries manage fund entrusted to them in bank accounts of consolidated trust banking subsidiaries. as the
   purpose is considered to approximate demand deposit, we deem the book values to be fair values.

derivative transactions
  derivative transactions include interest rate-related transactions (futures, options, swaps and others), currency-related
  transactions (futures, options, swaps and others), bond-related transactions (futures, futures options and others), and
  are based on the prices on securities exchanges, discounted value of future cash flows, option pricing models and
  others.

notes: 1. primarily the deferred method is applied under “accounting and auditing treatment relating to adoption of
          accounting standards for financial instruments for banks” (jicpa industry audit committee report no. 24,
          february 13, 2002).
       2. since derivative transactions qualifying for the exceptional accrual method are treated as a unit of loans and
          borrowings, hedged items, those fair values are included in fair values of such loans and borrowings in “41.
          financial instruments.”

44. segment information

segment information by management approach

1. summary of reportable segment

we engage in banking, trust banking, securities and other businesses through consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. as
these subsidiaries and affiliates are in different industries and regulatory environments, we disclose business segment
information based on the relevant principal consolidated subsidiaries such as mhbk, mhtb and mhsc for investors to
measure the present and future cash flows properly.

operating segments of mhbk are aggregated based on the type of customer characteristics and are aggregated into the
following seven reportable segments: personal banking; retail banking; corporate banking (large corporations);
corporate banking; financial institutions & public sector business; international banking; and trading and others.


2. calculating method of gross profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts), net
   business profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts, before reversal of
   (provision for) general reserve for losses on loans), and the amount of assets by reportable
   segment

the following information of reportable segment is based on internal management reporting.
  gross profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts) is the total amount of interest income, fiduciary
income, fee and commission income, trading income, and other operating income.
  net business profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts, before reversal of (provision for) general
reserve for losses on loans) is the amount of which general administrative expenses (excluding non-recurring expenses)
and others (equity in income from investments in affiliates and certain other consolidation adjustments) are deducted from
gross profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts).
  asset information by segment is not prepared on the grounds that management does not use asset information of each
segment for the purpose of asset allocation or performance evaluation.
  gross profits (excluding the amounts of credit costs of trust accounts) relating to transactions between segments
is based on the current market price.




                                                                                                                        235

             the basel framework, based on the "international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards: a
             revised framework" issued by the basel committee on banking supervision, requires the disclosure of capital adequacy
             information to ensure the enhanced effectiveness of market discipline. our disclosure is made under the "matters
             separately prescribed by the commissioner of the financial services agency regarding capital adequacy conditions,
             etc. pursuant to article 19-2, paragraph 1, item 5, subitem (d), etc. of the ordinance for enforcement of the banking law
             (ministry of finance ordinance no. 10 of 1982)" (the fsa notice no. 7 of 2014, etc.).
              with respect to the calculation of capital adequacy ratio, we have applied the international standard and adopted (a) the
             advanced internal ratings-based approach as a method to calculate the amount of credit risk weighted assets and (b) the
             advanced measurement approach as a method to calculate the amount equivalent to the operational risk.

              notes: 1. the above figures are calculated based on international standard applied on a consolidated basis under the fsa notice no. 20.
                     2. in calculating the consolidated capital adequacy ratio, we underwent an examination following the procedures agreed with ernst & young shinnihon llc, on the basis of
                        "treatment in implementing examination by agreed-upon procedures for calculating capital adequacy ratio" (industry committee practical guideline no. 30 of the japanese
                        institute of certified public accountants). note that this is not a part of the accounting audit performed on our consolidated financial statements. this consists of an
                        examination under agreed-upon procedures performed by ernst & young shinnihon llc on a portion of the internal control structure concerning the calculation of the
                        capital adequacy ratio and a report of the results to us. as such, they do not represent an opinion regarding the capital adequacy ratio itself nor the internal controls related
                        to the calculation of the capital adequacy ratio.

             ■ risk-based capital

             (3) summary of approach to assessing capital adequacy

             in order to ensure that risk-based capital is sufficiently maintained in light of the risk held by us, we regularly conduct the
             following assessment of capital adequacy in addition to adopting a suitable and effective capital adequacy monitoring
             structure.

             maintaining a sufficient bis capital ratio

             we confirm our maintenance of a high level of financial soundness by conducting regular evaluations to examine whether
             our risk-based capital is adequate in qualitative as well as quantitative terms, in light of our business plans and strategic
             targets to match the increase in risk-weighted assets acquired for growth, in addition to maintaining our capital above the
             minimum requirements of common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio and capital buffer ratio.

             balancing risk and capital

             on the basis of the framework for allocating risk capital, after obtaining the clearest possible grasp of the group’s overall
             risk exposure, we endeavor to control risk so as to keep it within the range of our business capacity by means of allocating
             capital that corresponds to the amount of risk to the principal banking subsidiaries, etc., within the bounds of our capital,
             and we conduct regular assessments to ensure that a sufficient level of capital is maintained for our risk profile. when
             making these assessments, we calculate the potential losses arising from assumed stress events and risk volumes, which
             we assess whether they balance with the group’s capital. stress events are based on risk scenarios that are formulated
             based on the current economic condition and the economic outlook, etc. and from scenarios such as the occurrence of
             historical stress events. in addition, we examine whether an appropriate return on risk is maintained in the assessments.

             ○ summary of credit risk management

              see pages 118 to 121 for a summary of our credit risk management policies and procedures.
              we apply the advanced internal ratings-based approach to calculate credit risk-weighted assets under basel
              framework. with regard to some business units or asset classes that are deemed to be immaterial for
              purposes of calculating credit risk-weighted assets, we apply the standardized approach.
              we use our estimates of pd (probability of default) and lgd (loss given default) in calculating credit risk-
              weighted assets. in accordance with regulations, we estimate pd by using long-term averages of actual
              defaults, to which conservative adjustments are made, based on internal data, and make adjustments to lgd
              taking into account recessionary periods. we regularly perform verifications of pd and lgd through back
              testing and other methods. we also utilize these estimates for measuring credit risks for internal use,
              allocating risk capital and other purposes.


             ○ status of portfolios to which the standardized approach is applied

             eligible external credit assessment institutions used for determining the risk weight for portfolios to which the standardized
             approach is applied are rating and investment information, inc. (r&i) in japan and standard & poor’s ratings services
             (s&p) overseas.
             we apply a risk weight of 100% for all of our corporate exposure.

             (6) credit risk exposure, etc.

             we exclude regarded-method exposure and securitization exposure from the amount of credit risk exposure.
             the outstanding balance is based on exposure at default.
             no significant difference exists between period-end credit risk position and the average credit risk position during the fiscal
             years ended march 31, 2015 and 2016.

                    losses on loans (for claims against special attention obligors or below), etc., as well as tax-qualified direct write-offs, losses from sales of non-performing loans, losses from
                    debt forgiveness and losses from debt-equity swaps during the relevant period. equity exposure under the pd/lgd approach is not included in the amount of actual losses.


                    <analysis>
                                 the total amount of actual losses was decreased by ¥116.2 billion from the previous period to ¥17.4 billion due to significant decerase of losses from corporate
                                 exposure.

             ■ methods for credit risk mitigation

             (7) risk management regarding credit risk mitigation

              we obtain collateral and guarantees as a means of securing credit. in obtaining the collateral and guarantees, we
              evaluate the value of the collateral, guarantee performance capability of guarantor and legal enforceability, and we also
              conduct periodical subsequent re-evaluations. furthermore, we monitor the state of concentration of collateral type and
              concentration of credit risks in individual companies, including indirect credit exposure such as guarantees.
              when calculating the credit risk weighted assets for capital adequacy ratio regulations, the effect of credit risk mitigation
              through financial collateral (mainly deposits and securities), other collateral (mainly real estate) and guarantees by
              "sovereign, banks or corporations above a certain credit rating" is reflected.
              for derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions, in cases in which a bilateral netting contract is valid in light of
              the legal system of the relevant jurisdiction, we take its effect into consideration.

             (9) management of counterparty risk in derivatives transactions and long-settlement transactions

             in managing the risk pertaining to counterparty risk in derivatives transactions and long-settlement transactions, we
             generally allocate risk capital together with loans, etc. as to derivatives transactions with financial institutions, etc., we
             periodically, where necessary, deliver and receive collateral to and from the counterparty based on the replacement cost
             to mitigate credit risk (collateralized derivatives transactions). in conducting such transactions, there is a risk in which we
             may be required to provide additional collateral in cases where our credit profile deteriorates. we calculate reserves for
             derivatives transactions by multiplying the same reserve ratio that we use for loans, etc., against the replacement cost.

             ■ securitization exposure

             we classify transactions as securitization exposure based on two characteristics, "non-recourse" and "senior/subordinated
             structure," pursuant to the definitions set forth in the fsa notice no. 20, etc.; provided that the transactions do not include
             those which fall within specialized lending exposure.



             (11) summary of securitization exposure and its risk management

             we are associated with securitization transactions from various purposes and positions through our banking book and
             trading book. quantitative information related to (a) to (c) below is disclosed in "(13) quantitative disclosure items for
             securitization exposure," in accordance with the definitions set forth in the fsa notice no. 20. securitization exposures
             are separately disclosed for calculation of credit risk-weighted assets and market risk equivalent amounts.

             ○the role of our securitization transactions

             (a) securitization of our assets ("securitization as originator")
             for the purposes of mitigating credit risk and credit concentration risk, controlling economic capital and responding to the
             needs of our investors, etc., we engage in securitization transactions the underlying assets of which include mortgage
             loans and loans to our corporate customers. when conducting a securitization as an originator, we consider such
             transaction from various aspects, including the effects of reduction of economic capital and improvement of return on risk
             as well as the practical effects of risk transfers, and make a comprehensive judgment on structure and appropriateness of
             transaction.

             (b) securitization program (abcp/abl) sponsor
             as a means of supporting our customers in their securitization of their account receivables and notes receivables, etc., we
             retain securitization exposure by providing asset-backed loans (abls, which are on-balance-sheet transactions), and
             providing asset-backed commercial paper (abcp) backup lines (off-balance-sheet transactions), as sponsor to special
             purpose companies (in the form of cayman islands corporations, etc.). in such cases, in addition to gaining firm
             understanding of the actual risk profile through due diligence from the viewpoint of investors, we assign internal ratings
             and make evaluations by assessing such transactions and carefully managing the exposure together with other direct loan
             assets.

             (c) investment in alternative credit risk assets ("securitization transactions as investor")
             we hold securitization products, such as abs, cmbs, rmbs, and cdo, and resecuritization products, the underlying
             assets of which are mainly rmbs and cdo, etc., for the purpose of investing in alternative credit risk assets that are
             different from conventional credit risk assets in order to diversify our investment portfolio. the risk management
             committee, etc. set limits on the amount of investment for securitization transactions as investor, and we maintain a
             stringent structure for management of such transactions. in addition, we implement stress tests based on scenarios under
             the market liquidity depletion and sharp price declines.

             in addition, we undertake various securitization program arrangements such as abl, abcp and trust schemes, etc., as a
             means of financing for our customers. we endeavor to understand the actual risk profile, including the underlying assets,
             and to disclose appropriately the risks and terms of the program to the customers who invest in the product.
             furthermore, we actively act as servicer for securitization transactions, offer settlement account facilities (servicer cash
             advance) and provide interest rate swaps to securitization conduits.

             none of our affiliated entities hold securitization products in which we are involved as originators or sponsors.

             ○ overview of risk characteristics in securitization and monitoring system

             in addition to price fluctuation and market liquidity risks, securitization and resecuritization products are exposed to risks
             related to default, recovery and granularity of underlying asset portfolio.




             310




summary of securitization exposure and its risk management

             the structure of these products also contains risks related to the originators, the administrators, trustees and managers of
             the underlying assets.

             to address these risks, we also analyze the structure in terms of the underlying assets and credit events. we monitor the
             ability, quality and operating performance of originators and managers in charge of controlling the underlying assets as
             well as covenant information and credit status of the parties related to the program.
             in addition, for resecuritization products, we pay attention to the underlying assets of the underlying securitization products.

             we also assign internal ratings to all products and review the rating at least once a year. if there is a change in the credit
             situations, we will review the internal rating as appropriate. as mentioned above, we have established a system to
             comprehensively understand the risk characteristics of securitization exposures and manage these exposures.

             we conduct credit risk measurements on all credit transactions, including securitization transactions. furthermore, we
             carry out periodic monitoring on investment amount and performance on securitization transactions and report the
             situations to our risk management committee, etc.

             ○status of response to basel framework

             in calculating credit risk-weighted assets of securitization exposure under the internal ratings-based approach, we apply
             the ratings-based approach ("rba") if the asset has a rating obtained from eligible external credit assessment institutions
             and apply the supervisory formula approach ("sf") in other cases pursuant to the fsa notice no. 20. we apply a risk
             weight of 1,250% under basel iii when neither rba nor sf can be applied.

             in addition, in calculating credit risk-weighted assets of securitization exposure under the standardized approach, we
             calculate based on risk weight according to ratings by eligible external credit assessment institutions and weighted
             average risk weight of underlying assets.

             in terms of securitization exposure in our trading book that is subject to market risk regulations, we adopt the standardized
             measurement method and calculate market risk equivalent amounts in connection with the specific risks of securitization
             products based on risk weights according to ratings assigned by eligible external credit assessment institutions pursuant to
             the fsa notice no. 20.

             as for the eligible external credit assessment institutions, we refer to rating and investment information, inc. (r&i), japan
             credit rating agency, ltd. (jcr), moody's investors service inc. (moody's), standard & poor's (s&p) and fitch ratings,
             ltd. in determining securitization exposure risk weight (we do not separately designate eligible external credit assessment
             institutions for each type of securitization exposure).

             (12) accounting policies for securitization transactions

             the point at which financial assets and liabilities relating to securitization transactions begin or cease to be recognized,
             their evaluation and accounting treatment are pursuant to "accounting standards relating to financial products"
             (business accounting standards no. 10), etc., and we applied (a) valuations obtained from brokers and others or (b)
             reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management as fair value, unless it is deemed to
             be extremely difficult to determine the fair value. in deriving reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable
             estimates of our management, we used the discounted cash flow method, and the price decision variables include default
             rates, recovery rates, pre-payment rates and discount rates.

             furthermore, we apply appropriate accounting treatment on compound financial products based on "report on auditing
             securitized instruments", announced by the japanese institute of certified public accountants on march 26, 2008.




                                                                                                                                          311

              notes: 1. items that refer to "during the fiscal year" show amounts accumulated during the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 and 2016.
                     2. securitization exposure that is acquired in securitization of customer’s claims other than as sponsor (in the form of asset-backed securities, trust beneficiary rights and other
                        transferable instruments) is categorized as securitization exposure as investor.
                     3. the amount of default exposure is the amount of the underlying assets recognized as default in the calculation of capital adequacy ratio.
                     4. estimated loss amount related to underlying assets is based on the amount of the underlying assets as of the relevant date and the following parameters that are used in
                        the calculation of capital adequacy ratio:
                         ･ parameters used in the calculation of required capital for an underlying asset when applying the supervisory formula (e.g., pd); and
                         ･ with respect to underlying assets classified as securitization exposure, the conservative application of risk weights used in the ratings-based approach.
                     5. classification based on type of underlying assets is conducted according to the principal underlying asset type for each transaction. transactions that are difficult to classify
                        are included under "others."
                     6. "credit cards" include shopping credit receivables, card loans, etc.

               with regard to subsidiaries and related companies in which we invest, we manage their risks on a consolidated basis,
               and manage them appropriately in accordance with their management classification.
               in addition, securities, a part of equity exposure, are valued as follows: japanese stocks with quoted market prices are
               valued based on the average quoted market price over the month preceding the consolidated balance sheet date; other
               securities which have readily determinable fair values are valued at the quoted market price if available, or otherwise
               based on their reasonable value at the consolidated balance sheet date (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by
               the moving average method); and other securities the fair values of which are extremely difficult to determine are stated
               at acquisition cost or amortized cost and determined by the moving average method.

             our consolidated lcr does not lead to any issues since it surpasses not only the minimum standard required under the liquidity
             regulation, but also the final regulatory standard (100%), with no significant change.
             lcr disclosed herein does not differ much from the level we expected beforehand, and we do not expect our consolidated lcr in
             the future to deviate significantly from the current level.
             there are no significant changes in the composition, such as currency composition or type composition, and geographic
             distribution of the hqla allowed to be included in the calculation.
             in addition, there is no significant currency mismatch which might affect our funding conditions between total amount of the hqla
             allowed to be included in the calculation and net cash outflow regarding significant currencies.

               (2) decisions on compensation of "subject employees, etc."
                   matters relating to executive officers as defined in the internal regulations of mhfg and directors and executive
                   officers of mhbk, mhtb and mhsc are as set out in (1) decisions on compensation of subject directors and
                   corporate auditors.
                   with regard to the compensation of corporate auditors of mhbk, mhtb and mhsc, it is determined pursuant to
                   consultation among corporate auditors, including outside corporate auditors, and set within the scope of the total
                   amount of compensation of corporate auditors resolved at ordinary general meetings of a shareholder.
                   the compensation of subject employees, etc., is decided and paid in accordance with the salary and bonus system
                   established by mhfg and the major consolidated subsidiaries. such system is designed and put into writing by the
                   human resources departments of mhfg and the major consolidated subsidiaries which are independent of
                   departments furthering business. in terms of the compensation of overseas employees, each overseas office or
                   operation determines its own compensation policy based on local laws and regulations as well as employment
                   relationships.

             3. decisions on compensation of employees in risk management departments, compliance departments and internal audit
                departments
                the compensation of employees in risk management departments, compliance departments and internal audit
                departments is decided in accordance with the salary and bonus system, and specific payment amounts are
                conclusively determined in accordance with employee performance evaluations made by the relevant department and
                the human resources department, independent from departments furthering business. each employee of the risk
                management departments, the compliance departments and the internal audit departments sets their own items for
                evaluation in the employee performance evaluations, subject to the approval of their superiors. the degree to which the
                items are fulfilled is evaluated taking into account the degree of the employee's contribution to risk-management,
                compliance and internal audit.

               compensation committee.

                         standard amount for each position. a system shall be adopted which enables a certain amount of deferred
                         payments of the performance payments over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount
                         depending on performance of the company and such officer.

                         and increase the incentive to enhance corporate value. the payment thereof shall reflect each officer’s
                         performance in addition to the standard amount for each position. a system shall be adopted which enables the
                         entire amount of deferred payments of the performance-based stock compensation over three years, as well as a
                         decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount depending on performance, etc., of the company and such officer.

                         each officer, a system which enables certain amount or a portion of deferred payments and non-monetary
                         payments such as stock, as well as a decrease or forfeiture (clawback) of the deferred amount depending on the
                         performance, etc., of the company and such personnel.

                         payments of the stock compensation over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount
                         depending on performance, etc., of the company.
