(2) differences between "global aperam" and the sum of the different regions and segments (next page) are due to all operations other than those
that are part of the stainless & electrical steel, services & solutions and alloys & specialties operating segments, together with inter segment
eliminations and/or non­operational items that are not segmented.
(3) operating costs include r&d costs of usd 18m for aperam group.
(4) payments to providers of capital = net cash interest and dividends paid to capital providers during the year, in line with amount of interest paid
(net) of usd 10m and dividends paid of usd 97m stated in the cash flow statement of the 2016 annual report. in 2014 and 2015, payments to
providers of capital only related to net cash interests as there was no dividend paid.

strategy and performance


sustainability strategy
our sustainability strategy is a key lever towards realising our business ambitions
without ever compromising our values.
aperam places a strong emphasis on governance with a majority of independent
directors and board committees comprised exclusively of independent directors.
aperam is committed to adopting the best governance standards and is
continuously monitoring best practices to make adjustments when necessary. our
high ethical standards are visible in our strict governance strengthened by a
structured compliance program.
we are very proud that our sustainability strategy and our continuous efforts in this
area have been recognised by esg analysts with improved ratings and better
rankings in benchmarks.
aperam has put in place a clear organisation with respect to sustainability as
described below at the level of its board of directors and leadership team.

environment (our planet)
as an energy­intensive industry (iron & steel industry accounts for 6.7% of the
global co2 emissions according to the international energy agency), we consider
environmental consciousness as a duty to the public­at­large and a trigger to our
sustainable profitability.
as a consequence, we have started on a journey to reach our ambitious objectives
in terms of energy reduction, greenhouse gas emissions, water intake and dust
emissions:
     ✓ 10% target reduction in energy intensity consumption (2012 baseline)
     ✓ 35% target cut in co2 intensity by 2020 (2007 baseline)
     ✓ 5% target cut in water withdrawals by 2020 (2015 baseline)
     ✓ 12% target decrease in intensity of ducted dust emissions (2015 baseline)

the site is on an island in the centre of a lake, surrounded by open parkland and in view of wormsley house and the opera
pavilion. it offers 360 degree views from around the estate. the pavilion is designed and located to maximise panoramic views
outwards and across the landscape. the pavilion is a lightweight, factory­made product, but in contrast to its nearby relative (the
‘temporary’ opera pavilion), the island pavilion and bridge are permanent structures, fabricated using high quality durable
materials and finishes – stainless steel as opposed to galvanised steel.
matt uginox top stainless steel was selected for construction. it was picked for its bead­blasted effect and reputation for being a
long lasting, maintenance­free material ­ a sharp contrast to the highly polished stainless steel finish of the permanent sculpture.

of our business and of our employment. on that date, thousands of steel employees and their employers from at least 17
european member states gathered in brussels to march in protest at damaging dumping of steel products from china, and to
protest against the premature granting of market economy status (mes) to china.

for this action, many of our usual stakeholders, employees of all ranks, unions and communities and european competitors
joined our trade associations to fight together for the same cause and for the benefit of all.

                                           addressing third­party risk: our external agent survey
                                           in 2016, to address what is called the ‘third­party risk’, aperam launched a
                                           first exercise to assess our risk level regarding the external agents used to
                                           support our own commercial forces.based on an internal audit of all external
                                           agents conducted by our combined assurance department, the survey
                                           collected data relating to these agents (markets served, ownership,
                                           compliance issues like gift policy, etc.) directly from the agent themselves
                                           and from their aperam counterpart in charge of monitoring the relationship.
                                           thus, the initiative not only led to more focused action plans for the years to
                                           come, but also raised awareness across our sales staff, educating them on
                                           red flags and triggering an increase in vigilance.
                                           in addition to the 16­questions dispatched to our 98 agents, the cover letter
                                           also provided links to aperam’s policies (code of conduct, anti­
