viability statement
in accordance with the uk corporate governance code, the directors
have assessed the viability of the group. this assessment has been
based upon the group’s three year strategic plan (the”plan”) and has
taken into account the current position of the group, the principal risks
and uncertainties as detailed on pages 22 to 24 above of the strategic
report and the group’s prospects.

in making their assessment the directors considered:
• the group’s current balance sheet, its strong track record of
   generating operational cash flows and returns to shareholders
   and stress testing of the key trading assumptions within the
   group’s plan;
• the potential impact of one or more of the principal risks set out on
   pages 22 to 24 occurring in the period on the group’s business
   model, future trading expectations and liquidity; and
• the likely degree and effectiveness of possible mitigating actions in
   relation to the principal risks.

the stress testing undertaken included the flexing of a number of key
assumptions within the three year plan, namely future revenue growth,
including both like-for-like revenues and revenues from the new store
openings, gross margins, operating costs, the impact of interest rates
and working capital management, which may be impacted by one or
more of the principal risks to the group. a number of challenging but
plausible scenarios which aggregated these individual assumptions
were reviewed by the board.

based on the assessment referred to above, the directors confirm they
have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three
years to 30 march 2019.

going concern statement
as a discount retailer, the group is well placed to withstand volatility
within the economic environment. the group’s forecasts and
projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading
performance, show that the group will trade within its current banking
facilities. after making enquiries, the directors are confident that the
group has adequate resources to continue its successful growth.
accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.

                                            dear shareholder,

                                            effectiveness. the scope of internal audit work is agreed with
                                            management and the audit & risk committee and the committee

during the year, grant thornton lux audit sa acted as the group’s
auditors and the audit partners responsible were hugues wangen and
carl williams.

grant thornton were paid £399k during the year, all of which except £9k
was in respect of audit services.

in agreeing what non-audit work can be done by the external auditors,
the committee is mindful of the attitude investors now have to the
auditors performing non-audit services and of the new guidance in this
area which is operative for accounting periods beginning on or after
16th june 2016. going forward, the committee will ensure that fees for
non-audit services do not exceed 70% of aggregate audit fees
measured over a three year period commencing on 27 march 2016.

given the decision to appoint new auditors, the committee did not
perform a review of the performance of grant thornton in the year.

internal audit
the head of internal audit has a direct reporting line to the committee.
this was the first full year that the group has had an internal audit
function. during the year, internal audit undertook a programme of
work which was discussed and agreed with both management and the
committee and which was designed to address both risk management
and areas of potential financial loss. internal audit has also established
procedures within the business to ensure that new risks are identified,
evaluated and managed and that necessary changes are made to the
risk register.

during the year the committee received reports from the internal audit
function in relation to:
• it systems and processes
• stock management processes and controls;
• regulation and compliance, including updates on fraud risk,
   anti-money laundering and whistleblowing;
• supplier screening processes operated by the group’s associated
   sourcing company, multilines international company limited;
• a review of the business processes and control in relation to rents
   and business rates;
• the processes and controls in relation to capital expenditure
   associated with the new store opening program;
• payroll processes and controls;
• the group’s treasury activities; and
• compliance with the modern slavery act.

in relation to each of the areas above, internal audit made
recommendations for improvement, the vast majority of which were
agreed by management and either have been or are being
implemented.

the committee has evaluated the performance of internal audit during
the year and concluded that significant progress has been made.
internal audit is viewed as a function which has a comprehensive
strategic plan developed in collaboration with the committee, provides
constructive challenge to management and consistently demonstrates
a realistic and commercial view of the business.

salary
as reported last year, the executive directors’ salaries were increased from the start of the 2015/16 financial year.

as referred to in last year’s report, the ceo’s salary was set at a level considered to be broadly reflective of a median position after allowing for a
5% discount to reflect the relatively lower cost of living in the north west versus some other parts of the uk. the cfo’s salary was set at circa. 20%
below the median level.

the comparator group of retailers used in the benchmarking exercise at the time of setting the ceo and cfo base salaries and overall
remuneration packages for 2015/16 included the following ftse 350 retailers (being both the ftse general retailers sector and the ftse food and
drug retailers index constituents): ao world, booker, debenhams, dignity, dunelm, greggs, halfords, home retail group, inchcape, j sainsbury,
jd sports fashion, kingfisher, marks & spencer, morrison supermarkets, n brown, next, ocado, pets at home, poundland, saga, sports direct,
ssp, supergroup, tesco and wh smith.

the table below shows base salaries for 2016/17:
director                                                                 base salary

simon arora (ceo)                                                        £589,375
paul mcdonald (cfo)                                                      £297,250


the executive directors received a 2.5% increase in their base salaries with effect from the beginning of the 2016/17 financial year, which is in line
with the average salary increase to uk colleagues of 2.5% at the end of 2015/16.

the executive directors will next be eligible for a salary review from the beginning of the 2017/18 financial year.

     report on the consolidated financial statements
     we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of b&m european value retail s.a. and its subsidiaries (the “group”),
     which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 26 march 2016 and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
     consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of
     significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

     board of directors’ responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
     the board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with
     international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union, and for such internal control as the board of directors determines
     is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
     or error.

     responsibility of the réviseur d’entreprises agréé
     our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance
     with international standards on auditing as adopted for luxembourg by the “commission de surveillance du secteur financier”. those standards
     require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
     financial statements are free from material misstatement.

     an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
     the procedures selected depend on the judgement of the “réviseur d’entreprises agréé”, including the assessment of the risks of material
     misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the “réviseur
     d’entreprises agréé” considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in
     order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
     of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
     accounting estimates made by the board of directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

     we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

     opinion
     in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the group as of 26 march
     2016, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with international
     financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union.

     the consolidated financial statements and includes the information required by the law with respect to the corporate governance statement.

notes to the consolidated financial statements


1 general information and basis of preparation
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards issued by the
international accounting standards board (iasb) as adopted by the european union.

the group’s trade is general retail, with trading taking place in the uk and germany. the group has been listed on the london stock exchange
since june 2014.

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets
and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. the measurement basis and principal accounting policies of the group are set out below
and have been applied consistently throughout the consolidated financial statements.

the consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000), except when
otherwise indicated.

the consolidated financial statements cover the 52 week period from 29 march 2015 to 26 march 2016. this is a different period to the parent
company stand alone accounts (from 1 april 2015 to 31 march 2016).

this exception is permitted under article 330 (2) of the luxembourg company law of 10th august 1915 as amended as the management believe that:

• the consolidated financial statements are more informative when they cover the same period of account as used by the main operating entity,
  b&m retail ltd; and
• that it would be unduly onerous to rephrase the year end in this subsidiary to match that of the parent company.

we finally note that the year end for b&m retail ltd, in any year, will not be more than six days prior to the parent company year end.

b&m european value retail s.a. is the head of the group and there is no consolidation that takes place above the level of this company.

the principal accounting policies of the group are set out below.

restatements
at 26 march 2016, the level of imported goods in transit was £58.2m. following a detailed review of the terms and conditions under which these
goods were shipped they have been recognised within inventory at the period end reflecting that the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred to the group at the point of shipment and not at the uk port as previously concluded.

the level of imported goods in transit has increased significantly in recent years and as a consequence of recognising these in inventory at the year
end, it has been necessary to revise the recognition of imported goods in transit in previous periods also. these changes have no impact on the
statements of comprehensive income or on net equity in the current period or in any of the earlier periods affected. the restatements are simply
reclassifications within working capital.

in accordance with ias 8, the 2015 statement of financial position has been restated to reclassify payments on account with suppliers to inventories
and to increase trade creditors and inventories to recognise the respective period end positions.

the reclassifications result in:

• decreases in deposits on account with suppliers of £29.7m in 2015 and £24.6m in 2014, including those held by related parties (£15.9m, £10.8m
  respectively);
• increases in trade creditors of £17.5m in 2015 and £8.5m in 2014;
• increases in inventory of £47.2m in 2015 and £33.1m in 2014.

further information is contained in the relevant notes on inventory (14), receivables (15), payables (17) and related parties (26).

reconstruction, refinancing and listing of the group
on 19 may 2014, b&m european value retail s.a. (the “company”) was incorporated. on 17 june 2014 the company acquired the entire issued
share capital of b&m european value retail 1 s.à r.l. group (the “business”) via a share for share exchange with the shareholders of the business.
following the share for share exchange, the company became the ultimate legal parent of the group.

the share for share transaction is deemed outside the scope of ifrs 3 (revised 2008) and as such is not considered a business combination as
prior to the transaction the company was not considered a business under the definition of ifrs 3 appendix a and the application guidance in ifrs
3 b7-b12 due to the company being essentially a shell company that had no processes or capability for outputs (ifrs 3 b7).

the share for share transaction has been accounted for as a group reconstruction (following the principles of merger accounting). as such comparative
information has been presented on a pro-forma basis as though the group had been in existence throughout the current and prior periods.

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     reconstruction, refinancing and listing of the group continued
     accordingly;

     • the assets and liabilities of the business and its subsidiaries are recognised in the financial information at the pre-combination carrying
       amounts, without restatement to fair value.
     • the retained losses and other equity balances recognised in the financial information reflect the retained losses and other equity balances of
       the business recorded before the share for share exchange.
     • the equity structure, however, reflects the equity structure of the company, including those balances which arose due to the equity instruments
       issued under the share for share exchange.
     • the resulting difference has been recognised as a component of equity, being the merger accounting reserve.
     • because, immediately prior to the reconstruction, the equity balances in the business were held as debt, this debt has remained within the
       restated balance sheet as a liability and has been reclassed upon redemption which occurred as part of the share for share exchange. the net
       effect of this is a decrease in the merger reserve on the date of the reconstruction.

     immediately after the reconstruction, on the same date, the group listed on the london stock exchange via an ipo which valued the company at
     £2.7bn and raised £75.0m cash less £19.7m of fees (which were expensed to profit and loss in the period) for the group itself.

     as part of this process a refinancing also took place, with terms agreed on new banking facilities until june 2019 and june 2020. the refinancing
     incurred £7.3m of fees, which are being amortised over the length of the term. £28.8m of previously unamortised fees, relating to the refinancing
     that took place in march 2013, were written off to profit and loss.

     overall the key steps in the processes were:

     1. b&m european value retail s.a. was incorporated with 972.2 million ordinary shares of 10p each.

     2. these were exchanged for the preferred equity certificates, preference shares and ordinary share capital of b&m european value retail 1 s.à r.l
        – the previous group parent.

     3. the group reconstruction resulted in the group’s share capital, preferred equity certificates of £556.1m, with accrued interest of £87.8m, and
        preference share balances being replaced by the £97.2m share capital, and £2,527.8m of share premium – being the technical valuation of the
        contribution in kind made by the prior owners via their instruments held in b&m evr 1 s.à r.l.

     4. this resulted in the recognition of a merger reserve of £1,979.1m.

     5. no cash was exchanged as part of the above steps.

     6. a further 27.8million ordinary shares of 10p each were released as part of the ipo. these were sold at £2.70 each, leading to the receipt of
        £75million and the recognition of £72.2m of share premium.

     basis of consolidation
     the group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings together with the group’s
     share of the net assets and results of associated undertakings for the period from 29 march 2015 to 26 march 2016. acquisitions of subsidiaries are
     dealt with by the acquisition method of accounting. the results of companies acquired are included in the consolidated statement of
     comprehensive income from the acquisition date.

     control is achieved when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect
     those returns through its power over the investee.

     specifically, the group controls an investee if and only if the group has:

     • power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee),
     • exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and,
     • the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.

     when the group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in
     assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

     • the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee,
     • rights arising from other contractual arrangements, and,
     • the group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.

     the group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three
     elements of control. consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the group loses

                                                                                                                                                             63




control of the subsidiary. assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the
statement of comprehensive income from the date the group gains control until the date the group ceases to control the subsidiary, excluding the
situations as outlined in the basis of preparation.

going concern
viability and going concern statements have been made in the principle risks and uncertainties section of this annual report. on the basis of these, the
directors have determined that it is appropriate to continue to use the going concern basis for production of these consolidated financial statements.

turnover
revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured,
regardless of when the payment is being made. revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.

revenue is the total amount receivable by the group for goods supplied, in the ordinary course of business excluding vat and trade discounts,
returns and relevant vouchers and offers. store retail turnover is recognised at the initial point of sale of goods to customers, when the risks and
rewards of the ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer.

other administrative expenses
administrative expenses contain all running costs of the business, except those relating to inventory (which are expensed through cost of sales),
tax, interest and other comprehensive income.

elements which are unusual and significant may be separated onto a separate line item.

goodwill
goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.

after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the relevant cash-generating units (cgus) that are expected to
benefit from the combination.

goodwill is tested for impairment at each year end and at any time where there is any indication that goodwill may be impaired. internally
generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.

segment reporting
operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. the chief
operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors of the group. the board is responsible for assessing the performance of
the business for the purpose of making decisions about resources to be allocated.

business combinations
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
consideration transferred, measured at the acquisition date fair value. acquisition-related costs are expensed depending on their nature with
costs of raising finance amortised over the term of the relevant element of finance provided and the remainder expensed when incurred.

after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units or group of cash-
generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned
to those units.

brands
brands acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently reviewed at least annually for
impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. where the carrying value
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly,
and charged to administration expenses.

brands are considered to have an indefinite life on the basis that they form part of the cash generating units within the company which will
continue in operation indefinitely, with no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows.

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     intangible assets
     intangible assets acquired separately, including computer software, are measured on initial recognition at cost comprising the purchase price and
     any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.

     following initial recognition, assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. amortisation begins
     when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows:

     computer software acquired        –   4 years

     property, plant and equipment
     property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

     cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs. unless significant or incurred as part of a refit programme, subsequent expenditure
     will usually be treated as repairs or maintenance and expensed to profit and loss.

     subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that
     future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. the carrying amount of
     the replaced part is derecognised.

     freehold land is not depreciated. for all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost,
     less residual value of the assets, over their estimated useful lives as follows.

     depreciation
     depreciation is provided on all other items of property, plant and equipment and the effect is to write off the carrying value of items by equal
     instalments over their expected useful economic lives. it is applied at the following rates.

     leasehold buildings               –   life of lease
     freehold buildings                –   2 – 4% straight line
     plant, fixtures and equipment     –   10% – 25% straight line
     fixtures, fittings and vehicles   –   20% – 25% straight line

     residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

     an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or
     disposal. any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
     amount of the asset) is included in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.

     investments in associates
     associates are those entities over which the group has significant influence but which are neither subsidiaries nor interests in joint ventures.
     investments in associates are recognised initially at cost and subsequently accounted for using the equity method. however any goodwill or fair
     value adjustment attributable to the share in the associate is included in the amount recognised as investment in associates.

     all subsequent changes to the share of interest in the equity of the associate are recognised in the group’s carrying amount of the investment.
     changes resulting from the profit or loss generated by the associate are reported in “share of profits of associates” in the consolidated income
     statement and therefore affect net results of the group. these changes include subsequent depreciation, amortisation and impairment of the fair
     value adjustments of assets and liabilities.

     items that have been recognised directly in the associate’s other comprehensive income are recognised in the consolidated other comprehensive
     income of the group. however, when the group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any
     unsecured receivables, the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the
     associate. if the associate subsequently reports profits, the investor resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits
     equals the share of losses not recognised.

     unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the associates.
     unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. amounts reported in the
     consolidated financial statements of associates have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted
     by the group.

                                                                                                                                                            65




impairment of non-financial assets
the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. if any indication exists, or when annual
impairment testing for an asset is required (for goodwill or indefinite life assets), the group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.

indications of impairment might include (for goodwill and the brand assets, for instance) a significant impairment to the like for like sales of
established stores, sustained negative publicity or a drop off in visits to our website and social media accounts.

an asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cgu’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. it is determined for an individual
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. where the carrying
amount of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cgu.

the group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecasts which are prepared separately for each of the group’s cgu’s to
which the individual assets are allocated. these budgets and forecast calculations cover a period of five years. for longer periods, a long-term
growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.

impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the income statement in those expense
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

for assets excluding goodwill and acquired brands with indefinite lives, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any
indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. if such indication exists, the group estimates
the asset’s or cgu’s recoverable amount.

a previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. the reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable
amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset in prior years. such reversal is recognised in the income statement, except for impairment of goodwill which is not reversed.

leases
the determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date. the
arrangement is assessed for whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangement
conveys a right to use the asset or assets even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.

the economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears substantially all the risks and rewards related to the
ownership of the leased asset. the related asset is recognised at the time of inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower,
the present value of the minimum lease payments plus incidental payments, if any, to be borne by the lessee. a corresponding amount is
recognised as a finance leasing liability.

the interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to profit and loss
over the period of the lease.

a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. however, if there is no reasonable certainty that the group will obtain ownership by
the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.

all other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on
a straight line basis over the lease term. lease incentives are spread over the term of the lease.

onerous leases
the group carries a property provision which is recognised on specific sites within the group’s leasehold property portfolio where an exit can be
reasonably expected to occur, and a lease is considered onerous.

a lease is considered onerous when the economic benefits of occupying the leased properties are less than the obligations payable under the lease.

the amount held covers any costs expected to accrue before the end of the contract, netted against any income, as well as a portion related to any
dilapidation expense which may arise.

inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. net
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell.

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     1 general information and basis of preparation continued
     share options
     the group operates share option schemes, with the first such scheme commencing in august 2014.

     the schemes have been accounted for under the provisions of ifrs 2, and accordingly have been fair valued on their inception date using
     appropriate methodology (the black scholes and monte carlo models).

     a cost is recorded through profit and loss in respect of the number of options outstanding and the fair value of those options. a corresponding
     credit is made to the retained earnings reserve and the effect of this can be seen in the statement of changes in equity.

     taxation
     current income tax
     current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
     authorities. the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in
     the countries where the group operates and generates taxable income. tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it
     relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
     income or directly in equity, respectively.

     deferred tax
     deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
     amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

     • when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
       combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
     • in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, when the
       timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the
       foreseeable future.

     deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the
     extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused
     tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

     • when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
       transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
     • in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred
       tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable
       profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

     the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient
     taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at
     each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to
     be recovered.

     deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is
     settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

     financial assets
     initial recognition and measurement
     the classification of financial instruments is determined at initial recognition. the group has the following types of financial assets: trade and other
     receivables and cash which are classified within the ias 39 definition of loans and receivables and derivative contracts which are classified within
     the ias 39 definition of fair value through profit and loss. all financial assets are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual
     provisions of the instrument. all financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs other than for financial assets carried at
     fair value through profit or loss.

     the group does not have any held-to-maturity or available-for-sale financial assets.

     subsequent measurement
     the subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below:

     loans and receivables
     loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. after initial
     measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (eir), less impairment.
     amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir.
     the eir amortisation and the losses arising from impairment are recognised in profit and loss.

                                                                                                                                                                    67




financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as
hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by ias 39. financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of
financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss.

derecognition
a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the asset have expired and the entity has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an
obligation to pay the received cash flows in full and either (a) the entity has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the
entity has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

impairment of financial assets
the group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more
events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (an incurred ‘loss event’) and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future
cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

financial liabilities
initial recognition and measurement
financial liabilities within the scope of ias 39 are classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities. the
entity determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value.

financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial derivatives held for trading. financial liabilities are classified as held-for-
trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. this category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the
group. gains or losses on liabilities held-for-trading are recognised in profit and loss.

other financial liabilities
after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings, trade and other payables and other liabilities are subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are
derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate method (eir) amortisation process.

amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir.
the eir amortisation is included in finance costs.

derecognition
a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.

fair value of financial instruments
the fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets at each reporting date is determined by reference to mark-to-market
valuations obtained from the relevant bank (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without any deduction for transaction costs.

derivative financial instruments
the group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, fuel swaps and interest rate swaps to reduce its foreign
currency risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on
which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair
value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, less bank overdrafts.

equity
equity comprises the following:

• “share capital” represents the nominal value of equity shares;
• “share premium” represents the excess of the consideration made for the shares, over and above the nominal valuation of those shares;
• “legal reserve” representing the statutory reserve required by luxembourg law as an apportionment of profit within each luxembourg
  company (up to 10% of the standalone share capital);
• “merger reserve” representing the reserve created during the reorganisation of the group in 2014;
• “retained earnings reserve” represents retained profits;
• “put/call option reserve” representing the initial valuation of the put/call option held by the group over the non-controlling interest of j.a. woll
  handels gmbh (jawoll);
• “foreign exchange reserve’’ represents the cumulative differences arising in retranslation of the subsidiaries results;
• “non-controlling interest” representing the portion of the equity which belongs to the non-controlling interest in the group’s subsidiaries.

     foreign currency translation
     these consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling.

     the following group companies have a functional currency of pounds sterling;

     •   b&m european value retail s.a.
     •   b&m european value retail 1 s.à r.l. (lux holdco)
     •   b&m european value retail holdco 1 ltd (uk holdco 1)
     •   b&m european value retail holdco 2 ltd (uk holdco 2)
     •   b&m european value retail holdco 3 ltd (uk holdco 3)
     •   b&m european value retail holdco 4 ltd (uk holdco 4)
     •   ev retail ltd
     •   b&m retail ltd
     •   meltore ltd
     •   opus homewares ltd

     the following group companies have a functional currency of the euro;

     •   b&m european value retail 2 s.à r.l. (sbr europe)
     •   b&m european value retail germany gmbh (germany holdco)
     •   j.a. woll handels gmbh (jawoll)
     •   jawoll vertriebs gmbh
     •   bestflora gmbh.

     the group companies whose functional currency is the euro have been consolidated into the group via retranslation of their accounts in line with
     ias 21 effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. the assets and liabilities are translated into pounds sterling at the year end exchange rate.
     the revenues and expenses are translated into pounds sterling at the average monthly exchange rate during the period. any resulting foreign
     exchange difference is cumulatively recorded in the foreign exchange reserve with the annual effect being charged/credited to other
     comprehensive income.

     transactions entered into by the company in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (the
     “functional currency”) are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur. foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated
     at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are
     recognised immediately in profit or loss.

     pension costs
     the group operates a defined contribution scheme and contributions are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

     provisions
     provisions are recognised when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of a past event and where it is probable that an
     outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. provisions
     are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.

     critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
     the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of
     causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. the group
     based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial information was prepared. existing circumstances and
     assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the group.
     such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

     impairment of non-financial assets
     impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value
     less costs to sell and its value in use.

     the fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at arm’s length for similar assets
     or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. the value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow
     model. the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include restructuring activities that the group is not yet
     committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the performance of the cgu being tested.

     the recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows
     and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cgus,
     including a sensitivity analysis, are disclosed and further explained in note 12.

                                                                                                                                                                69




investments in associates
multi-lines international company ltd (multi-lines), which is 50% owned by the group, has been considered by management to be an associate
rather than a subsidiary or a joint venture. under ifrs 10 control is determined by:

• power over the investee.
• exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee.
• the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns.

although 50% owned,
• multi-lines have their own independent management who operate without direct oversight of b&m group management on a day to day basis.
• b&m group does not have the right to appoint directors nor do we have a casting vote.

therefore the level of power over the business is considered to be more in keeping with that of an associate than a joint-venture, and hence it has
been treated as such within these consolidated financial statements.

put/call options on jawoll non-controlling interest
the purchase agreement for jawoll included call and put options over the shares not purchased by the group, representing 20% of jawoll. the
options are arranged such that it is considered likely that either the call or put option will be taken at the exercise date in 2019.

the exercise price of the options contain a variable element and as such the risk and rewards of the options are considered to remain with the
non-controlling interest. the purchase of the non-controlling interest will be recognised upon exercise of one of the options.

a financial liability has been recognised carried at amortised cost to represent the expected exercise price, with the corresponding debit entry to
the put/call option reserve. management have estimated the future measurement inputs in arriving at this value, using knowledge of current
performance, expected growth and planned strategy. any subsequent movements in the liability will be recognised in profit or loss.

standards and interpretations applied and not yet applied by the group
new and amended standards and interpretations adopted by the group
ifric 21, “levies”, sets out the accounting for an obligation to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of ias 37, “provisions”. the interpretation
addresses what the obligating event is that gives rise to pay a levy and when a liability should be recognised. the adoption of ifric 21 does not
have a significant impact for the group.

annual improvements 2011–2013. the amendments include changes from the 2011–13 cycle of the annual improvements project that affects four
standards: ifrs 1, “first time adoption”, ifrs 3 “business combination”, ifrs 13, “fair value measurement” and ias 40, “investment property”. the
application of these amendments had no significant impact for the group.

annual improvements 2010–2012. these amendments include changes from the 2010–12 cycle of the annual improvements project, that affect several
standards: ifrs 2, “share-based payment”, ifrs 3, “business combinations”, ifrs 8, “operating segments”, ifrs 13, “fair value measurement”, ias 16,
“property, plant and equipment”, ias 38, “intangible assets”, ias 37, “provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”, and ias 39, “financial
instruments – recognition and measurement”. the application of these amendments had no significant impact for the group.

ias 19 revised, “defined benefit plans: employee contributions” – effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 july 2014. the application of
this amendment had no significant impact for the group.

standards and amendments to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the group
the following new standards and amendments have been published but are not effective for the group’s accounting period beginning on 29 march
2015. all these standards and amendments have not yet been endorsed by the european union.

“disclosure initiative (amendments to ias 1)” – applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016 to encourage companies to
apply professional judgement in determining the information to disclose in their financial statements;

amendments to ias 16, “property, plant and equipment” and ias 38, ”intangible assets” on depreciation and amortisation – effective from
1 january 2016. iasb has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because
revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits
embodied in the asset. the iasb has also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the
consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. however, past the headline is a rebuttable presumption, and
revenue‑based amortisation is permitted when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the
intangible asset are highly correlated;

amendment to ias 27, “separate financial statements”, on equity method on separate financial statements – applicable for reporting periods
beginning on or after 1 january 2016;

     amendment to ifrs 11, “joint arrangements” on acquisition of an interest in a joint operation – applicable for reporting periods beginning on or
     after 1 january 2016;

     annual improvements 2012–2014 – applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016;

     ifrs 9, “financial instruments” – applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. the iasb has published the complete
     version of ifrs 9 which replaces ias 39. this final version includes requirements on the classification and measurement of financial assets and
     liabilities; it also includes an expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used today and redefine the guidance
     regarding the hedge accounting;

     ifrs 14, “regulatory deferral accounts” – applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016;

     ifrs 15, “revenue from contracts with customers” applies to all contracts with customers except those that are financial instruments, leases or
     insurance contracts and introduces a five-step process that the group will have to follow. the new standard goes beyond just “commercial effect”,
     “fair value” and “risk and rewards” and will also result in a significant increase in the volume of disclosures related to revenue. ifrs 15 will be
     applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018.

     ifrs 16 “leases” provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term
     is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance. the standard is effective
     for annual periods beginning on or after january 1st, 2019, subject to eu adoption. the group is yet to assess the impact of ifrs 16.

                                                                                                                                                                     71




2 segmental information
ifrs 8 (“operating segments”) requires the group’s segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about the components of the group
that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources across each reporting segment.

for management purposes, the group is organised into two reportable segments, being the uk retail segment and the german retail segment
(since acquisition of jawoll on 30 april 2014).

the chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors who monitor the operating results of the retail segments for the
purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.

the average euro rate for translation purposes was €1.3677/£ during the year, with the year end rate being €1.2670/£ (2015: €1.2741/£ and
€1.3670/£, respectively).

adjusting items are exceptional and non-trading items considered by the directors to not be incurred in the usual underlying running of the trade
of the group. the directors consider the adjusted figures to be a more accurate reflection of the underlying business performance of the group and
believe that this measure provides additional useful information for investors on the group’s performance, as well as being consistent with how
business performance is monitored internally.

adjusting items include expenses relating to new acquisitions, special projects and restructuring expenses (such as ipo, refinancing, maintaining
ownership structures), pre-opening new store costs, provisions for onerous leases, regulatory investigations or fines, dilapidation provisions,
compulsory purchase order income, foreign exchange gains/(losses), fair value gains/(losses) on derivatives, other comprehensive income items,
unwinding interest on items not directly related to the trade of the business, impairment on non-financial assets, profit/(loss) on fixed assets
disposal and the estimated tax effect of these items.

adjusted ebitda and related measures are not a measurement of performance or liquidity under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or
as a substitute for measures of profit, or as an indicator of the group’s operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as
determined in accordance with ifrs.

10 earnings per share
basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the financial period attributable to ordinary equity holders of
the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding at each period end.

as the group undertook a group reconstruction in june 2014, the number of shares in the prior period has been adjusted to match the
post-restructuring position such that the figures remain comparable.

diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on
conversion of any dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated on the same basis except using the adjusted profit or loss attributable to the equity
holders of the parent.

there are share option schemes in place which has a dilutive effect on both periods presented.

the following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

impairment review of goodwill and brand assets
during the year management have reviewed the impairment test methodology and the following changes have been made;

• before applying the perpetuity, they now use a five year forecast rather than a ten year forecast in order to have a more accurate forecast over
  this shorter period.
• to more accurately reflect the cashflows received, they now use a mid-year discount factor instead of a year end discount factor.

the prior year sensitivities, included below, have been restated on this basis and show that the changes made have no material impact on the
calculation of the recoverable amount and there remains no requirement to impair the goodwill or brand assets.

assets arising upon the acquisition of b&m european value retail 2 s.à r.l (sbr europe)
a goodwill asset of £807,496k and a brand asset of £93,700k arose as a result of the business combination undertaken as at 6 march 2013, the
acquisition of b&m european value retail 2 s.à r.l by the group.

the brand intangible asset was identified with indefinite life. this was the only identifiable intangible asset recognised that was considered to be
likely to have a value above a set materiality threshold. the indefinite life was considered appropriate because of several factors, chief amongst
which was that the growth potential of the b&m business was considered by management to be a long-term phenomenon.

the goodwill and brand have been allocated to two groups of cash generating units (cgu’s), being the two fascia’s that the group operates within
its retail segment (bargain stores and home stores).

the allocation split is as follows:
                                                                                                                   bargain stores   home stores        total

     the group performs impairment tests at each period end. the impairment test involves assessing the net present value (npv) of the expected cash
     flows in relation to the stores within each cgu according to a number of assumptions (more detail on which follows below) to calculate the value in
     use (viu) for the group of cgu’s. the results of the impairment tests identified that each viu was significantly in excess of the carrying value of
     assets within each cgu at the period end dates and date of initial recognition. no other indicators of impairment were noted.

     the key assumptions used were:
     (i) the group’s cost of capital, calculated according to a weighted cost of capital model with appropriate assumptions made regarding the inputs
           to the model.
     (ii) the inflation rate, which has been based upon the consumer price index for the uk.
     (iii) the like for like sales growth within each shop, a prudent estimate made by management.

     the values for the assumptions were:
                                                                                                                                    26 march      28 march

     inflation rate                                                                                                                  0.50%         0.00%

     these assumptions are held for five years in the forecast and then a perpetuity is performed over the year five figures, effectively assuming no
     further like for like growth, or inflation after that point.

     in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the assumptions, it was calculated that a cgu would first require impairment if (all other assumptions
     being held equal);
     (i) the group’s cost of capital was 23.8% (2015: 26.5%)
     (ii) the inflation rate was 33.1% (2015: 14.6%)
     (iii) the like for like sales suffered a contraction of 9.8% (2015: 7.6%) per annum.

     the interest rate used in calculating the group’s cost of capital as used in the impairment test has been determined to be a reasonable rate to use
     in terms of the rates prevalent in the market at the date of the impairment test.

     assets arising upon the acquisition of j.a. woll handels gmbh and their subsidiaries (jawoll)
     a goodwill asset of €37,952k and brand assets of €5,950k arose as a result of the business combination undertaken as at 30 april 2014, the
     acquisition of j.a. woll handels gmbh and their subsidiaries (jawoll) by the group (see note 28).

     at the acquisition date this was translated to £31,258k for the goodwill and £4,901k for the brand assets. however as the functional currency of
     jawoll is the euro, all impairment calculations have been calculated in euros and therefore it is that currency we shall refer to in the
     following discussion.

     the brand intangible assets were recognised as having indefinite life and were the only identifiable intangible assets recognised that were
     considered to be likely to have a value above a set materiality threshold. the indefinite life was considered appropriate because of several factors,
     chief amongst which was that the growth potential of the jawoll business was considered by management to be a long-term phenomenon.

     the goodwill and brand have been allocated to two groups of cash generating units (cgu’s), being the two fascia’s that the group operates within
     its retail segment (jawoll and hafu) in the following proportions:
                                                                                                                          jawoll         hafu         total

the group has performed impairment tests as at the period end dates and at the acquisition date, which was during the prior year. the
impairment test involves assessing the net present value (npv) of the expected cash flows in relation to the stores within each cgu according to a
number of assumptions (more detail on which follows below) to calculate the value in use (viu) for the group of cgu’s. the results of the
impairment tests identified that each viu was significantly in excess of the carrying value of assets within each cgu at the period end dates and
date of initial recognition. no other indicators of impairment were noted.

the key assumptions used were:
(i) the group’s cost of capital, is as per above.
(ii) the inflation rate, which has been based upon the consumer price index for germany
(iii) the like for like sales growth within each shop, a prudent estimate made by management.

these assumptions are held for five years in the forecast and then a perpetuity is performed over the year five figures, effectively assuming no
further like for like growth, or inflation after that point.

in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the assumptions, it was calculated that an impairment would first require impairment if (all other
assumptions being held equal);
(i) the group’s cost of capital was 85.3% (2015: 39.0%, 2014: 31.3%).
(ii) the inflation rate was 19.8% (2015: 5.3%, 2014: 5.3%).
(iii) the like for like sales suffered a contraction of 12.3% (2015: 2.2%, 2014: 0.8%).

the interest rate used in calculating the group’s cost of capital as used in the impairment test has been determined to be a reasonable rate to use
in terms of the rates prevalent in the market at the date of the impairment test.

     on the acquisition of the sbr europe group on 6 march 2013, the property, plant and equipment was restated such that their net book value
     equalled their cost. initially an estimation technique was used to perform this task, due to the number of assets on the fixed asset register, but the
     value was calculated exactly before the 28 march 2015 year end. the resulting differences in cost and accumulated depreciation, which have no
     impact on net book value, have been included in the adjustment line related to the prior year.

     the carrying value of assets held under finance lease and hire purchase contracts at 26 march 2016 was £4,584k (2015: £5,029k), total depreciation
     charged on these assets during the period was £780k (2015 : £751k). the assets held under hire purchase contracts are pledged as security for the
     related finance lease and hire purchase liabilities.

     under the terms of the loan facility in place at 26 march 2015, a fixed charge existed over £4.6m (2015: £6.2m) of the net book value of land &
     buildings, £0.4m (2015: £1.1m) of the net book value of motor vehicles and £41.9m (2015: £50.7m) of the net book value of the plant, fixtures and
     equipment. a floating charge was held over all the other assets.

     included within land and buildings is land with a cost of £2.1m (2015 : £1.8m) which is not depreciated.

the 2015 inventory balance has been restated from £238.9m to £286.1m to reflect the agreed shipping terms in place with certain overseas
suppliers. this restatement reflects the reclassification of certain prepayments to overseas suppliers of £23.7m and the recognition of an increase
to trade creditors of £23.5m. the 2014 figures were restated from £170.4m to £203.5m.

included in the amount above for the period ended 26 march 2016 was a net gain of £0.1m related to inventory provisions (2015: £0.8m, 2014:
£1.2m net loss). in the period to 26 march 2016 £1,349m (2015: £1,080m, 2014: £902m) was recognised as an expense for inventories.

trade receivables are stated initially at their fair value and then at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts. the carrying amount is determined by the directors to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.

the 2015 deposits on account and related party receivable balances have been restated from £22.3m to £8.6m and £18.9m to £2.9m respectively
as a result of a reclassification to inventories. this adjustment has been made to reflect the agreed shipping terms in place with certain overseas
suppliers. the 2014 deposits on account and related party receivable balance are also disclosed and have been restated from £13.8m and £13.6m
to £nil and £2.9m respectively.

the following table sets out an analysis of provisions for impairment of trade and other receivables:

trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on terms of 30 days or less.

there were no significant balances held at this year end. at the prior year end a significant balance was held with multi-lines international
company ltd of £2.8m (2014: £2.9m). multi-lines is a supplier with whom the group carries a deposit, they are also an associate of the group and
due to this and the long trading history between the companies, including no history of issues regarding recovery of the deposit balance, the
management do not believe this balance to be at risk.

the put/call options over the non-controlling interest in jawoll arose as part of the acquisition of the entity. the valuation here reflects the initial
valuation unwound to the year end date, and exchanged at the year end foreign exchange rate. the option matures in 2019 and the carrying value
has been discounted to present value.

the other financial liabilities through profit or loss reflect the fair value of those foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and fuel
swaps that are not designated as hedge relationships but are nevertheless intended to reduce the level of risk for expected sales and purchases.

     fair value hierarchy
     the group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:

     • level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
     • level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly
       or indirectly.
     • level 3: techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

     as at the reporting dates, the group held the following financial instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet:
                                                                                                                total      level 1      level 2     level 3

     the put/call option was valued with reference to the sale and purchase agreement underpinning the acquisition, and the key variable in
     determining the fair value of the option, the forecast ebitda of jawoll as prepared by management.

     the other instruments have been valued by the issuing bank, using a mark to market method. the bank has used various inputs to compute the
     valuations and these include inter alia the relevant maturity date and strike rates, the current exchange rate, fuel prices and libor levels.

the property provision relates to the expected future costs on specific leasehold properties. this is inclusive of onerous leases and dilapidations on
these properties. the timing in relation to utilisation is dependent upon the individual lease terms.

the other provisions principally relate to disputes concerning insurance liability claims. a prudent amount has been set aside for each claim as per
legal advice received by the group. these claims are individually non-significant and average £7.5k per claim (£8.3k in 2015).

     23 commitments
     operating leases
     the vast majority of the group’s operating lease commitments relate to the property comprising its store network. at the year-end over 90% of
     these leases expire in the next 15 years (2015: >95%) the leases are separately negotiated and no subgroup is considered to be individually
     significant nor to contain individually significant terms. the group was not subject to contingent rent agreements at the year end date. the
     following table sets out the total future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, taking account of lease premiums.

     25 financial risk management
     the group uses various financial instruments, including bank loans, related party loans, finance company loans, cash, equity investment,
     derivatives and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.

     the main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are market risk, currency risk, cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
     the directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.

     the existence of these financial instruments exposes the group to a number of financial risks, which are described in more detail below. in order to
     manage the group’s exposure to those risks, in particular the group’s exposure to currency risk, the group enters into forward foreign currency
     contracts. no transactions in derivatives are undertaken of a speculative nature. the group does not apply hedge accounting as outlined under
     ias 39.

     market risk
     market risk encompasses three types of risk, being currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk. commodity price risk is not
     considered material to the business as the group is able to pass on pricing changes to its customers.

     despite the impact of price risk not being considered material, the group engages in a swap contract over the cost of fuel in order to minimise the
     impact of any volatility.

     the sensitivity to these contracts for a reasonable change in the year end fuel price is as follows:
                                                                                                                                          26 march      28 march
                                                                                                                            change in         2016          2015

                                                                                                                                -5%           (64)          (50)


     this has been calculated by taking the spot price of fuel at the year end, applying the change indicated in the table, and projecting this over the life
     of the contract assuming all other variables remain equal.

     the group’s policies for managing fair value interest rate risk are considered along with those for managing cash flow interest rate risk and are set
     out in the subsection entitled “interest rate risk” below.

     currency risk
     the group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk arising from exchange rate fluctuation on its purchases from
     overseas suppliers.

     in relation to translation risk, this is not considered material to the business as amounts owed in foreign currency are short term of up to 30 days
     and are of a relatively modest nature. transaction exposures, including those associated with forecast transactions, are hedged when known,
     principally using forward currency contracts. whilst the aim is to achieve an economic hedge, the group does not adopt an accounting policy of
     hedge accounting for this financial information.

     all of the group’s sales are to customers in the uk and germany and there is no currency exposure in this respect. a proportion of the group’s
     purchases are priced in us dollars and the group generally uses forward currency contracts to minimise the risk associated with that exposure.

     foreign currency sensitivity
     the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in us dollar period end exchange rates with all other variables
     held constant.

     the impact on the group’s profit before tax is largely due to changes in the fair value of the fx options.

these calculations have been performed. by taking the year end translation rate used on the accounts and applying the change noted above. the
balance sheet valuations are then directly calculated. the valuation of the foreign exchange derivatives are projected based upon the spot rate
changing and all other variables being held equal.

interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the risk of variability of the group cash flows due to changes in the interest rate. the group is exposed to changes in interest
rates as all of the group’s bank borrowings are subject to a floating rate based on libor.

the group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from long-term borrowings. borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest
rate risk. the group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material, however the group uses interest rate swaps to
minimise the impact.

at year end, if libor interest rates had been 50 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the effect upon calculated pre-tax
profit for the year would have been:
                                                                                                                     basis point    26 march     28 march

as at                                                                                                                 decrease         £’000        £’000

effect on profit before tax                                                                                               +50          (499)        1,429
                                                                                                                          -50           499        (1,429)


this sensitivity has been calculated by changing the interest rate for each interest payment and accrual made by the group over the period, by the
amount specified in the table above, and then calculating the difference that would have been required.

it also includes the effect on the year end valuation of the interest rate swap contract, where the percentage change in libor indicated above has
been applied to the year end spot rate and this has then been projected over the remaining life of the contracts with the assumption that all other
variables are held equal.

credit risk
credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
the group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade receivables. the credit risk associated with cash is limited as the main counterparty is a
uk clearing bank with a high credit rating (a long term and a-1 short term (standard & poor), unchanged from the prior year). the principal credit
risk arises therefore from the group’s trade receivables.

credit risk is further limited by the fact that the vast majority of sales transactions are made through the store registers, direct from the customer at
the point of purchase, leading to a low trade receivables balance.

in order to manage credit risk, the directors set limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit references.
credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history. provisions against bad
debts are made where appropriate.

     liquidity risk
     any impact on available cash and therefore the liquidity of the group could have a material effect on the business as a result.

     the group’s borrowings are subject to quarterly banking covenants against which the group has had significant headroom to date with no
     anticipated issues based upon forecasts made. short term flexibility is achieved via the group’s rolling credit facility. the following table shows the

27 non-controlling interest
non-controlling interest balances are valued on acquisition as a proportion of the fair value of net assets to which the non-controlling interest
relates. post acquisition the non-controlling interest is valued as the original value plus/minus the profit/loss owed to the non-controlling interest
and minus any dividend paid to the non-controlling interest.

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued


     28 business combinations
     in the prior year the group completed the acquisition of j.a. woll handels gmbh (jawoll) through b&m european value retail germany gmbh
     (germany holdco). jawoll is a discount retailer incorporated within germany.

     the acquisition has been accounted for via the acquisition method of accounting. the group purchased 80% of the share capital for a cash
     consideration of €80,182k, funded by the group’s existing banking facilities.

     the purchase agreement also included call and put options over the remaining 20% exercisable in 2019. per the discussion in note 1, the risks and
     rewards of the exercise price remain with the non-controlling interest, and therefore the non-controlling interest is recognised below. the put/call
     options have then been recognised on acquisition as a liability based upon the discounted estimated price of the options, with the corresponding
     debit recognised in the put/call option reserve.

     the valuation of the put/call option on the purchase date was £13,855k.

     the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of jawoll on the date of the acquisition were valued via a ppa exercise with each material
     area addressed independently. the non-controlling interest was calculated at 20% of the fair value of assets to which the non-controlling interest
     was held.

     the fair values held by jawoll on the date of acquisition were as follows:
                                                                                                                                                      £’000

none of the receivables recognised were considered irrecoverable at the acquisition date.

fees of £827k were incurred during the acquisition. these were expensed through the profit and loss in the prior period.

included in the creditors balance is a liability of £5.7m relating to a profit & loss transfer agreement (“plta”). as part of the acquisition jawoll group
performed a necessary reorganisation in order to separate the businesses to be acquired and those not to be acquired. this resulted in a profit &
loss transfer agreement claim which jawoll agreed to meet on behalf of those subsidiaries to which it applied.

this was therefore expensed on the pre-acquisition profit & loss account, but at the date of the acquisition the liability had not been settled. this
resulted in the liability being present on the acquisition balance sheet, as well as a higher than usual cash balance.

the liability was settled shortly after acquisition, and appears within the prior year cashflow statement at a different value due to being translated
at the period average rate instead of the acquisition date rate at which it is included above.

the goodwill largely relates to the growth potential of the business with smaller elements representing the workforce and current location of the
stores. none of the elements which make up goodwill can, or are not material enough to, be recognised as a separate intangible asset.

the effect the acquisition has had on the p&l can be seen in the segmental note (note 2) as the germany retail segment comprises the whole of
jawoll. had the company been bought at the start of the year it would have contributed an estimated extra £14.4m to revenue and £2.1m to
operating profit (figures under german gaap).

29 capital management
for the purpose of the group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders
of the parent. the primary objective of the group’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value.

in order to achieve this overall objective, the group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants
attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. breaches in meeting the financial covenants
would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. there have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing
loans and borrowing in the current or prior period.

the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the
financial covenants.

to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue
new shares.

the group uses the following definition of net debt:

external interest bearing loans and borrowings less cash and short-term deposits.

the interest bearing loans figure used is the gross amount of cash borrowed at that time, as opposed to the carrying value under the amortised
cost method.

board of directors’ responsibility for the annual accounts
the board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these annual accounts in accordance with luxembourg legal and
regulatory requirements relating to the preparation of the annual accounts, and for such internal control as the board of directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

responsibility of the réviseur d’entreprises agréé
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these annual accounts based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with international

comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the annual accounts are free from
material misstatement.

an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the annual accounts. the procedures
selected depend on the réviseur d’entreprises agréé’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the annual
accounts, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risks assessments, the réviseur d’entreprises agréé considers internal control relevant to
the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the annual accounts in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the board of directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the annual accounts.

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our audit opinion.

opinion
in our opinion, the annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial position of b&m european value retail s.a. as of 31 march 2016, and of
the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements relating to the preparation

102                         b&m european value retail s.a. annual report and accounts 2016




      notes to the annual accounts
      for the financial year ended march 31, 2016




      note 1 - general information
      b&m european value retail s.a., hereinafter the “company”, was incorporated on may 19, 2014 as a “société anonyme” for an unlimited period. the
      company is organised under the laws of luxembourg, in particular the law of august 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended.

      the registered office of the company is established in luxembourg city and is registered at the trade and companies register in luxembourg
      under the number b 187 275.

      on may 29, 2014, the registered office of the company was moved from 9, allée scheffer, l-2520 luxembourg to 16, avenue pasteur, l-2310
      luxembourg.

      the company’s financial year starts on 1st april and ends on march 31 of each year.

      the main purpose of the company is to act as an investment holding company and to coordinate the business of any corporate bodies in which
      the company is for the time being directly or indirectly interested and to acquire (whether by original subscription, tender, purchase, exchange or
      otherwise) the whole or any part of the stock, shares, debentures, debenture stocks, bonds and other securities issued or guaranteed by any
      person and any other asset of any kind and to hold the same as investments, and to sell, exchange and dispose of the same.

      the company also prepares consolidated financial statements, which are published according to the provisions of the luxembourg law.

      the company is listed on the london stock exchange under the ticker symbol “bme”.

      note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies
      basis of preparation
      these annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with luxembourg legal and regulatory requirements under the historical cost
      convention. accounting policies and valuation rules are, besides the ones laid down by the law of december 19, 2002, as amended by the law of
      december 10, 2010 and july 30, 2013 (the “law”), determined and applied by the directors of the company (the “board of directors”).

      the preparation of annual accounts requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. it also requires management to exercise its
      judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. changes in assumptions may have a significant impact on the annual accounts in
      the period in which the assumptions changed. management believes that the underlying assumptions are appropriate and that the annual
      accounts therefore present the financial position and results fairly.

      the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year. estimates and
      judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are
      believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

      significant accounting policies
      the main valuation rules applied by the company are the following:

      foreign currency translation
      the company maintains its accounting records in pounds sterling (gbp) and the balance sheet and the profit and loss accounts are expressed in
      this currency.

      transactions expressed in currencies other than gbp are translated into gbp at the exchange rate effective at the time of the transaction.

      long term non-monetary assets expressed in currencies other than gbp are translated into gbp at the exchange rate effective at the time of the
      transaction. at the balance sheet date, these assets remain converted using the exchange rate at the time of the transaction (the “historical
      exchange rate”).

      cash at bank is translated at the exchange rate effective at the balance sheet date. exchange losses and gains are recorded in the profit and loss
      account of the year.

      in accordance with prudence principles found within generally accepted accounting principles in luxembourg (“luxgaap”), other assets are
      translated separately, at the lower of the value converted using the historical exchange rate and the value converted using the exchange rate at
      the balance sheet date. conversely, other liabilities are translated separately, at the higher of the value converted using the historical exchange
      rate and the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. consequently, both realised and unrealised exchange losses are recorded in the profit and
      loss account while exchange gains are recorded in the profit and loss account when realised only.

      where there is an economic link between an asset and a liability, these are valued in total according to the method described above and the net
      unrealised losses are recorded in the profit and loss account while the net unrealised gains are not recognised.

      shares in affiliated holdings are valued at purchase price including the expenses incidental thereto. in the case of durable depreciation in value
      according to the opinion of the board of directors, value adjustments are made in respect of financial fixed assets, so that they are valued at the
      lower figure to be attributed to them at the balance sheet date. these value adjustments are not continued if the reasons for which the value
      adjustments were made have ceased to apply.

                                                                                                                                                                    103




note 2 - summary of significant accounting policies continued
debtors
debtors are valued at their nominal value. they are subject to value adjustments where their recovery is compromised. these value adjustments
are not continued if the reasons for which the value adjustments were made have ceased to apply.

debts
debts are stated as their nominal value. where the amount repayable on account is greater than the amount received, the difference is shown in
the profit and loss account when the debt is issued.

debts are recorded under subordinated debts when their status is subordinated to unsecured debts.

current tax provisions
provisions for taxation corresponding to the tax liability estimated by the company for the financial years for which the tax return has not yet been
filed are recorded under the caption “tax debts”. the advance payments are shown in the assets of the balance sheet under the caption “other
debtors”, if applicable.

volatility (see below), the expected life (3 years for the ltip 2014, 5 years for the ltip 2015, 6.5years for the csop) and the risk free rate of interest,
using the bank of england zero coupon yield over the expected life.

in accordance with luxembourg gaap, as none of the option holders have vested their rights as at the balance sheet date, all related amounts are
reported as off balance sheet commitments.

the volatility assumption used the historic volatility of a group of comparable companies. this resulted in a 25% assumption for all the 2014
awards, 24% for the 2015 eps award and 30% for the 2015 tsr award.
