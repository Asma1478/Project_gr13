              letter of the chairwoman
              and the chief executive officer




              the sustainability report that we are presenting provides further information about the positive results
              achieved by the terna group in 2016 in terms of sustainability and displayed in the group’s integrated
              report. in line with the last years, the contents of this letter are similar to those which introduce the
              financial statements, in the belief that performance in sustainability, as well as in operations and financial
              and economic aspects is central for stakeholders in understanding and evaluating terna’s progress and
              prospects.

              we are proud to present you solid results for 2016, confirming that terna is well on track to achieve 2017-
              2021 strategic plan targets.

              as you know, the electricity market is changing rapidly driven by new challenges such as decarbonisation,
              market efficiency and security of supply, which have been included into specific targets by the european
              commission to ensure that europe will have secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy.

              terna, thanks to its positioning at the heart of the italian electricity market, can play a strategic role,
              facilitating the energy transition towards a more efficient and cleaner energy production and guarantying
              security of supply at the lowest price for families and enterprises.

              we have planned €4bn of investments in the next five years on the national electricity grid to enable this
              energy transition with an annual average increase of 30% vs the old plan. the new capex plan has been
              developed according to the new cost-benefit analysis (cba 2.0) which includes significant environmental
              and social kpis thus granting higher sharing of value creation with relevant stakeholders.
              as a consequence, our regulated asset base (rab) will continue to show a positive trend, with 2% annual
              growth, reaching €15.6bn in 2021.

              innovation will be crucial on this path and is becoming more and more significant within our business
              plan targets. our commitment is taking up this challenge through the adoption of a model based on
              partnerships with start-ups & small enterprises, academy & research centres, and our suppliers.

              we aim to turn these new market trends into strategic initiatives with a strong commitment to a sustainable
              approach and always leveraging on our core competencies and talents.

                                                                        letter of the chairwoman and the chief executive officer   11



we are also enhancing our commitment to non-regulated activities, where the annual ebitda contribution
will increase by 40% on average vs the old plan, for a cumulated target of €350mn in 5 years.

with regard to dividends, the policy presented in the previous plan has been confirmed and extended
to the broader 2017-2021 period, with an annual 3% dividend growth, in line with the expected earnings’
evolution.

those targets are based on solid results, as the past growth trend was confirmed also in 2016.
indeed revenues were up by 1% year on year - at €2.1bn and ebitda and group net income increased
reaching €1,545mn and €633mn respectively.
thanks to the strong cash flow generation, net debt decreased vs last year, and is now just below 8€bn.
this is the first net debt reduction year-on-year since the ipo.

financial performance is well supported by esg results, which are strategic for our business model.
in 2016, terna further improved its environmental and social performance. most notably, the leakage rate
of the greenhouse gas sf6 dropped to an unprecedented 0.39%, contributing to a 7.2% reduction in the
group’s direct co2 emissions. grid development made it possible to remove 290 km of old lines (904 km
since 2010) with positive effects on land use and improved visual impact. investment in human capital is
well represented by the level of employee training, which increased to 61 hours per capita (56 in 2015), well
above the average for ftse mib listed companies. as for integrity in business conduct, terna has become
the first italian company to be iso37001 certified for its sound anticorruption practices.

we are perfectly aware of the impacts of our decisions on communities. with its pivotal role in the
electricity system, terna has to guarantee quality of service for final consumers at the lowest price. our
commitment is to reach this objective while improving our environmental and social performance as well,
in line with our participation in the un global compact. we communicate with all stakeholders, such as
national authorities, municipalities, unions and associations, in order to align the interests of the company
to social needs. this is essential to drive long-term sustainable value creation for shareholders as well as
growth and prosperity for all stakeholders.

20   2016 sustainability report




     results and objectives

     the results obtained by the terna group in 2016, which are described in this report, are based on the
     guidelines of the strategic plan, the multi-year planning document that is approved by the board of
     directors every year and presented to analysts as part of a dedicated event. the strategic plan has been
     supported by additional tools, including the sustainability plan and the three-year innovation, research
     and development plan, which was published for the first time in 2015 and extended in 2016 (for details
     see the relevant box on page 117).
     sustainability is the common denominator that represents a crucial driver, especially for medium and
     long-term objectives.
     the sustainability plan contains the terna group’s biannual objectives on environmental, social and
     relational issues concerning stakeholders.
     the plan identifies the relevant activities in order to systematise business growth from a sustainability
     perspective, with the aim of:

         •    ensuring a gradual and continuous long-term improvement of terna group sustainability
              performance to integrate and support the business objectives set forth in its strategic plan
         •    protecting and consolidating the reputational capital of the group, with specific reference to
              investors attentive to aspects of sustainability and, more generally speaking, in line with model 231
              and italian law 262

     the sustainability plan 2015–2016 also invokes the main objectives stated in other documents, particularly
     the plan of engagement, which collects the initiatives to be achieved in order to structure awareness of
     stakeholders’ opinions and expectations, assess the fulfilment thereof and maintain an appropriate level
     of dialogue (see page 62).
     the 2015–2016 sustainability plan is divided into four sections: main objectives, supporting projects
     (annual activities that respond to specific purposes, for example, improvements that emerged from
     examining sustainability rating agencies’ questionnaires), improved reporting and internal awareness
     raising.
     in relation to the targets of the sustainability plan for 2016, the following results were achieved:

         •    the review of the materiality matrix, the creation of the first annual monitoring of the state of relations
              with stakeholders
         •    the identification of kpis that are in line with the materiality analysis, already used in this report and in
              the integrated report. some of these kpis will also form the foundation of the new sustainability plan
         •    the creation of a cycle of four seminars for senior managers and a selection of terna junior
              executives on the main problems concerning social (inequality) and environmental sustainability
              (climate change, loss of biodiversity)
         •    the creation of the next energy project with the cariplo fondazione, as part of the cariplo
              factor, which uses innovation topics to support youth employability and entrepreneurship

     in addition to these main results, we also note the definition and adoption of the guidelines and operating
     instructions:

         •    “recommendations for the energy efficiency of terna buildings” (lg029)
         •    “organisation of occupational health and safety within terna group activities abroad” (lg055)
         •    “selection of projects and methods of implementation” for the installation of artificial nesting boxes
              as part of biodiversity protection activities (io106sr)

     lastly, active participation in the international integrated reporting council business network continued,
     to consolidate and refine the experience gained in preparing the integrated report.
     the table below shows the degree of achievement of the objectives published in the 2015 sustainability
     report.

     sustainability indices

     terna’s constant commitment to improving its esg (environmental, social and governance) performance
     shows in its sustainability ratings as reported by specialist companies, its inclusion in the main international
     stock exchange sustainability indexes and the appreciation of socially responsible investors.
     during the course of 2016, terna’s membership of all the main international, quoted sustainability indices
     was confirmed.
     in january 2017 robecosam, the international rating agency that conducts assessments annually to
     determine the composition of the dow jones sustainability index, published its “sustainability yearbook
     2017”, which listed terna amongst its silver class, due to its score that was close to the industry leader
     in the electric utilities sector.
     the evaluation obtained from sustainability ratings offers important indications on areas of improvement
     and strengths, which are particularly important as they are the result of comparative analysis conducted
     by independent agencies.

     structure of the report

     the arrangement of the 2016 report – although in compliance with gri-g4 guidelines – departs from
     previous editions to adopt a thematic layout that is more coherent with the one used in the integrated
     report, inspired by the framework implemented by the iirc in 2013.
     the first chapter, “2016 report - summary” acts more and more like an executive summary of the entire
     report and, as such, contains the highlights, significant events and results and objectives of the year in
     order to offer a clear and comprehensive view of the year in question in just a few pages.
     the “terna company profile”, in line with the “integrated report”, has been enhanced with elements
     from the electricity context and introduces large cross-cutting issues for the entire group. in addition to
     sustainability, it also includes innovation, governance, risk management, protection of the law, corruption
     prevention and, lastly, the supply chain.
     the content of the “relations with stakeholders” chapter has been extended with respect to previous
     reports. for each individual category of stakeholder the economic components that characterise the
     relationship are highlighted, next to a description of the most relevant activities that year. this was
     previously given in a separate chapter (“economic responsibility”) which has been removed.
     the report includes five chapters dedicated to the “electricity service”, the “environment” and
     “personnel”. in order to make the report easier to read, the information regarding the gri-g4 indicators
     is signalled by the related code in the margin of the text, next to the relevant passages or next to the title
     if the entire section is considered relevant.
     as in the 2015 edition, environmental data (consumption of electricity, natural gas, water and fuel) and
     social statistics (injuries) regarding the tamini group are published separately. the data are shown in the
     “key indicator tables” on page 209.
     the report concludes with an “annex” section that includes the “key indicator tables” with a summary
     of the gri-g4 indicators supplemented by additional indicators, the “gri content index” with two tables
     including the gri-g4 indicators and the global compact indicators in the first and the sdg’s targets and
     gri-g4 indicators in the second, as well as the “methodological note”; for the meaning of technical terms
     specific to the electricity industry, see the glossary on the website www.terna.it on the “tools” page using

     reading approaches

     this year, once again, the interests of the various terna stakeholders regarding the passages in the report that
     concern them most directly has guided some editorial choices, the most important information being found in the
     information boxes and comparisons. sections, or in some cases, entire chapters dedicated to stakeholder issues
     permit an alternative layout compared to the normal division of the report. in particular, we note:

     corporate governance system
     terna’s corporate governance system aims to create value for its shareholders. this objective is pursued
     while being aware of the social and environmental importance of the activities carried out by the group
     and the subsequent requirement to adequately consider all the interests involved when performing said
     activities.
     in this regard, the most authoritative reference concerning sustainability is the code of ethics.
     the governance system is essentially in line with the principles found in the corporate governance code1,2
     of listed companies which terna has adopted, with the recommendations drawn up by consob on the
     subject and, more generally, with international best practices that the company adheres to.

industry context

in recent years the energy industry has seen a significant paradigm shift in the entire electricity system
with a sharp penetration of non-programmable renewable sources (nprs) combined with fragmentation
of production points. the following sections focus on electricity demand and production in italy. to get an
overall view of the international electricity context, see the 2016 integrated report.

     demand for electricity in italy
     in 2016, the demand for electrical energy in italy was 310,251 million kwh (provisional data), reporting a
     fall of 2.1% in comparison with 2015, which, conversely, ended with an increase compared to 2014. the
     electricity demand recorded this year takes us back to the same level as 2014.
     temperatures were slightly higher than 2015 during the winter months and lower during the summer
     months of that year, leading to an overall reduction in demand. with regard to the 2016 calendar, the two
     fewer working days were almost compensated for by the extra day provided by the leap year.
     production from renewable sources covered 34% of national requirements.

electricity transmission

although the end users of the electricity service are not direct customers of terna, but rather are
companies that distribute and sell electricity, the essential role it performs in the electricity system makes
terna ethically responsible for the service with regard to italian society. in terna’s view, business and
sustainability matters are closely linked, which is substantiated by the adoption of a responsible approach
to management of the ntg.
the main business of the terna group is the transmission and dispatching of electricity in italy (regulated
activities), playing the role of the italian tso (transmission system operator), in a monopoly position
through government concession.
the italian electricity system consists of four stages: producing, transmitting, distributing and selling
electricity.




(3) renewable production can be defined as total production from wind, solar, geothermoelectric, biomass (included in the table under thermal
    production) and hydroelectric power net of pumping plant production.

     terna is responsible for transmitting, or rather managing the electricity system by:

         •    operating the high-voltage grid
         •    maintaining infrastructure
         •    planning grid development
         •    constructing the grid

                                                                                           terna company profile   39



the management of electricity transmission is divided into the activities listed below.




 grid operation              the dispatching activity is performed by the “national dispatching”
 and dispatching             department at terna rete italia and entails ensuring the balance between
                             input and output at all times, i.e. between the supply and consumption
                             of energy. the complexity of this activity has increased over time, also
                             due to the major development of renewable sources, which has made
                             greater flexibility in managing dispatching resources necessary, particularly
                             in situations where the supply of renewables is very high and the need
                             for energy low. preparation for real-time operation includes planning
                             unavailability (of the grid and of production plants) with different time
                             horizons, forecasting national electricity demand, comparing demand for
                             consistency with the production plan determined as the result of the free
                             energy market (electricity market and contracts outside of the electricity
                             market), acquisition of resources for dispatching and checks on the power
                             transits for all the grid lines.
                             during the real-time control stage, the national control centre, which
                             coordinates other centres around the country, monitors the system and
                             dispatches electricity, intervening, by communicating commands to
                             producers and remote-control centres, in order to vary grid supply and
                             distribution. to avoid the risk of grid degeneration and prolonged power
                             outages, it may also intervene in an emergency to reduce the demand.
                             terna also manages the dispatching services market (dsm) through which
                             it acquires resources for the dispatching services. for details, please see
                             page 99, “service quality and continuity”.


 maintaining                 the maintenance of the power lines, of substations and storage systems
 infrastructure              is carried out by terna rete italia through three area offices structured into
                             eight operational transmission areas, which employ more than 55% of the
                             group’s human resources. technological oversight of the maintenance and
                             renewal criteria and standards for assets is carried out by the engineering
                             and asset management department. for details, please see page 111,
                             “plant maintenance”.


 grid                        analysing electricity flows in the grid and producing supply and demand
 development                 projections allow terna to identify the critical points and, consequently,
 planning                    schedule the new work to be carried out in order to ensure that the
                             system is adequate, including in the medium (+5 years) and long-term
                             (+10 years) in terms of: meeting demand, safety of operations, reducing
                             congestion, and improving service quality and continuity. the growth of
                             electricity production from renewable sources makes it indispensable to
                             have all the existing regulatory resources available (including exchanges
                             with other countries) together with generation control tools. grid planning
                             must be consistent with the aim of maximising the integration of renewable
                             sources in safe conditions. new work to be carried out is detailed in the ntg
                             development plan, which is presented annually to the ministry of economic
                             development for approval. terna follows its complex authorisation process.

     other activities

     the service and electricity system security objectives established for terna by the government concession
     are integrated with financial performance objectives and are reflected in operating efficiency and new
     opportunities for growth.
     the management of the electricity transmission by way of a monopoly in italy makes revenue growth
     possible only through the timely implementation of investments planned for in the development plan and
     the optimisation of operational efficiency and capital structure.
     in line with the guidelines of the strategic plan, the group is pursuing new business opportunities in italy
     and abroad. the group’s regulated activities abroad are focused within chile, peru, colombia, panama,
     uruguay and brazil, countries which have been selected for their political stability, credit standing and
     positive rates of economic growth.
     the best growth opportunities predominately arise from the diversification of activities (nra- non-
     regulated activities) initiated in italy and abroad that focus on:

         •    initiatives abroad (epc, technical assistance, boot, concessions)
         •    private interconnectors
         •    transformers - tamini group
         •    services for third parties in the italian market (third-party plant management, telecommunications
              and engineering)

                     specifically, the commissioned plants have become operational in chile
                     (two substations and a 220 kv line), as well as other origination activities
                     in the area.
                     terna participated in tenders for transmission infrastructure in the balkans
                     and in eastern europe (kosovo, ukraine, slovakia, and moldavia).
                     in september, terna won a tender in uruguay to create a 213 km 500 kv
                     electrical line from melo to tacuarembo, and two other lines connecting with
                     the pre-existing transmission system totalling 10.5 km. the total value of the
                     contract, calculated on a thirty-year basis, is estimated at us$ 230 million.
                     in december terna signed the agreement with the uruguay company, ute,
                     and the company difebal was incorporated to manage the administrative,
                     accountant and study activities prior to the commencement of works, which
                     are scheduled for the first half of 2017. terna’s role will consist in designing
                     the line and overseeing the project management of the construction, which
                     will be assigned to third parties.
                     technical assistance activities for authorities and local operators in kenya
                     and turkey were also consolidated, and are still in progress.
                     through its subsidiary terna plus, in february 2017 terna signed an
                     agreement with planova, a brazilian company that constructs civil works
                     and infrastructure, aimed at the acquisition of two concessions to operate a
                     total of around 500 km of electricity infrastructure in brazil.
                     the two concessions, which will last for thirty years, will involve the
                     construction of 158 km of new lines in the state of rio grande do sul and
                     350 km in the state of mato grosso. the total value of the contract is around
                     $ 180 million.
                     lastly, the business relationship with several industry partners was developed
                     through partnerships and targeted agreements. the memorandum of
                     understanding with eni, which aims to develop sustainable energy systems
                     and support renewable energy production is of particular importance. the
                     agreement concerns a wide range of potential collaborations, including
                     the study of electricity systems, more specifically those associated with
                     gas to power development opportunities, access to energy initiatives, the
                     planning and construction of renewable energy plants and their connection
                     and integration with the electricity network, smart grid solutions, energy
                     storage projects, research and development activities and energy projects
                     with reduced environmental impact.

      activities 2016


      private                     in order to support the development of a single electricity market by
      interconnectors             expanding the infrastructure for interconnection with other countries, a
                                  community law was introduced which laid down guidelines for the creation of
                                  interconnections with other countries by subjects other than grid operators.
                                  italian legislation transposed the european indications in law 99/2009,
                                  which assigned terna the task of carrying out public tenders to select
                                  the subjects willing to finance specific interconnections, in exchange for
                                  the benefits deriving from the allocation of transfer capacity for a pre-
                                  established number of years.
                                  five interconnectors are planned in total with the borders of france,
                                  switzerland, montenegro, austria and slovenia, two of which are at an
                                  advanced construction stage.
                                  among the interconnections which may be financed by the selected
                                  subjects, the one regarding the italy-france border is the one in the
                                  most advanced stage of development, followed by the italy-montenegro
                                  interconnection. for details see page 112.


      tamini                      in 2016, tamini entered the pst sector (phase shifting transformer – equipment
                                  to control energy flows on the high-voltage and very-high-voltage grid) at a
                                  european level, delivering the pst units generated at its legnano plant to the
                                  czech republic.
                                  again at the legnano facility, the approval test was carried out successfully on
                                  the 500 mva transformer with transformation ratio 400/220 kv for esb; this is
                                  the largest transformer installed in ireland, for dimensions and weight.
                                  sales of transformers in 2016 fell compared to the previous year (-20%).
                                  at the end of august work began on reclaiming and making safe the melegnano
                                  facility, which will therefore remain out of operation for the duration of the work.

                             substations, power lines and renewable production substations.




 terna - rfi agreement to develop renewable energy projects

   in november, terna and rete ferroviaria italiana signed a letter of intent with the aim of working
   together to identify and carry out initiatives of shared interest relative to renewables in italy. in
   particular, the agreement foresees the development of a joint project to create photovoltaic plants
   that will power rfi’s electricity consumption with clean energy.
   based on the agreement, areas will be identified on which photovoltaic plants can be constructed for
   up to a maximum of 200 mw. this will guarantee rete ferroviaria italiana clean energy production
   of up to 300 gwh per year.
   the project being examined by terna and rfi could be the first large operation in the photovoltaic
   energy sector in italy to be carried out in a situation of “grid parity”, meaning with no government
   incentives and, in contrast with the past, without additional charges falling to households and
   businesses.




strategic plan

on 20 february 2017, terna approved the strategic plan for the 2017–2021 period, which provides for
acceleration of investments on the ntg (national transmission grid) to facilitate the energy transition in
progress. in particular, the reference scenario of the electrical sector in italy and in europe, characterised
by the continual growth of non-programmable renewable production sources and at the same time by
the gradual decommissioning of traditional generation plants, makes appropriate development of the
electricity grids necessary. this has led to undertaking strategic initiatives aimed at:

   •   encouraging the integration of renewable sources and improving the security of the system
   •   expanding interconnections to reduce local congestions
   •   using cutting-edge technologies, with ever-increasing attention to environmental and sustainability
       aspects

in addition, the 2017–2021 strategic plan includes consolidation in non-regulated activities of an industrial
approach, positioning terna increasingly as an energy solution provider, and an international strategy that
goes to support growth and value creation over the long term.
maintaining a solid capital structure thanks to robust cash generation will contribute, finally, to sustaining
an attractive dividend policy.

44   2016 sustainability report




      2017–2021 strategic plan – main targets

      regulated                   over the next 5 years the terna group plans investments of approximately
      activities                  € 4 billion, approximately 30% more than in the previous strategic
                                  plan. among the main electrical infrastructures being constructed are
                                  the interconnections with montenegro and france, which should both
                                  be operational by 2019. the new sacoi3 (sardinia, corsica and italy
                                  connection) project and the italy-austria interconnection will be launched
                                  over the course of the plan. in addition, several projects are planned with
                                  the aim of increasing the exchange capacity between the various zones of
                                  the italian electricity market. the value of the regulated assets (rab) will
                                  reach approximately € 15.6 billion in 2021, with an annual average growth
                                  rate (cagr) of approximately 2%.


      non-regulated               the plan provides for the development of services for third parties
      activities                  (epc, tlc, o&m); and the creation of the interconnectors, which will be
                                  financed with third-party resources. in addition, after the acquisition of the
                                  high-voltage electricity grid of ferrovie dello stato, the group signed an
                                  agreement with rete ferroviaria italiana (rfi) aimed at creating and selling
                                  photovoltaic plants for power of up to a maximum of 200 mw to rfi, without
                                  additional expense for households and businesses.
                                  it is expected that these activities will contribute to the group’s ebitda for
                                  approximately € 350 million accumulated over the period of the plan, with
                                  an annual average approximately 40% more compared to the previous plan.


      international               in line with the past year, the 2017–2021 strategic plan provides for a capital
      development                 commitment of up to approximately € 250 million for regulated activities
                                  abroad. these initiatives will be selected through assessment processes
                                  that can guarantee a low risk profile and an optimisation of the industrial
                                  role played by terna and may also be developed as part of a partnership.
                                  we can note the tender awarded for the construction of more than 200 km
                                  of power lines in uruguay (investment of approximately € 70 million) and
                                  the agreement for the acquisition of concessions for the construction and
                                  operation of two power lines in brazil, for a total length of more than 500 km
                                  (investment of approximately € 180 million).


      consolidated                the plan foresees an increase in the group’s revenue to approximately € 2.3
      results                     billion and in ebitda to approximately € 1.7 billion in 2021, with annual average
                                  growth of approximately 2% for both indicators starting from 2016, and an
                                  improvement in net profit, with annual average growth of approximately 3%.
                                  these results will guarantee a free cash flow of around € 2 billion over the
                                  course of the plan, which will provide the flexibility necessary to support an
                                  attractive dividends policy. terna’s financial structure will remain solid and
                                  the net payables/rab ratio will remain below 60%.


      dividends policy            with reference to the dividend policy the assumptions of the previous plan
                                  were confirmed and extended to the longer period 2017–2021, with annual
                                  growth in the dividend of approximately 3% aligned with the expected
                                  evolution of profit and of the main equity parameters. this policy reflects an
                                  overall payout that, during the plan period, will remain below 70%.

                                                                                               terna company profile   45




sustainability, innovation, risk management and integrity

this section covers some aspects concerned with conducting the business of terna, distinguished by a
transversal approach that affects and influences all group activities. it regards sustainability, the subject
of this entire report, yet in this instance some more significant themes and values are discussed, as
well as innovation, which has become a driver for business development in recent years and in 2016
especially, and also regards the application of the best and most advanced technology for transmission
grid management, risk management and integrity, which is particularly significant in preventing corruption.
the section concludes with reference to two focus areas – human rights and supply chain sustainability
– which distinguish terna’s approach to stakeholder relations in general and to suppliers in particular.




terna’s sustainability values and themes

terna’s main business is the provision of a service which is indispensable for the operation of the entire
italian electricity system and to ensure electricity for everyone. commitment to this service is therefore
also our main reference point, even when approaching sustainability matters. this has been confirmed by
the results of the materiality analysis, which was revised in 2016, and is described in the methodological
note on page 170.
this analysis revealed relevant aspects, including:

   •   alignment of corporate governance with best practices
   •   careful risk management, respect for economic – financial objectives and operating performance
       (continuity, quality, transmission service costs)
   •   good stakeholder management, especially concerning local stakeholders
   •   integrity in conducting business
   •   issues related to the environment, visual impact on the landscape in particular
   •   issues relative to human resources, such as the development of personnel and worker health and
       safety

the relevance of the aforementioned issues is a result of their correlation with terna’s capacity to create
value in the medium-to-long term.
the construction and development of relationships of trust with stakeholders, useful in creating value
for the company and for the stakeholders, is a fundamental theme of sustainability in terna, enshrined in
its code of ethics. this leads to concern upstream of the possible environmental and social impacts of
terna’s activities and advocates taking all necessary measures to prevent and minimise such impacts.
for terna, respect for the environment and for local communities is a rule of conduct which can trigger a
virtuous cycle: it allows biodiversity and the richness of the landscape and local culture to be preserved,
and facilitates acceptance and creation of new infrastructure, generating financial benefits for shareholders
and for society, which can enjoy a more secure, more efficient and less costly service. focus on the
community is also demonstrated by the creation of initiatives of social, humanitarian and cultural value,
which serve as a concrete sign of participation in the growth of civil society.
for stakeholders, investment in this attention translates into the social and relational capital growth
necessary for the sustainability of the terna business model. more generally, investment in intangible
capital is another central theme in terna’s sustainability approach and is also critical to its ability to create
value in the long run. in particular, the role of human capital is important to terna.
renewing specific technical skills of human resources, which are often rare or unique in the electricity
industry, constitutes an important part of terna’s sustainability approach. another element, which is just
as important, is occupational safety. this is especially relevant due to the fact that many operational tasks
are associated with particular risks, such as work high above ground and maintenance work on live lines.

     46   2016 sustainability report




          terna’s sustainability policies and management systems make reference to the code of ethics4, approved
          by the board of directors on 21 december 2006, which requires the company to provide evidence in the
          sustainability report each year of the implementation of sustainability policies and the objectives and
          results achieved.
g4-hr4    the reference in the code of ethics to the principles of global compact, the united nations’ multi-stakeholder
          network, was substantiated in 2009 with terna’s formal adherence, which thereby further strengthened its
g4-hr5    commitment to the ten principles on human rights, labour, the environment and the prevention of corruption.
          in recent years the transition towards a decarbonised economy has become a reference of increasing
g4-hr6    importance, both in terms of terna’s sustainability policies and initiatives and its strategic orientation.
          the international decisions of the cop 21 in paris and the subsequent cop 22 in marrakesh, combined
          with european directives and guidelines, have led to even greater focus on renewable sources in terna’s
          programmes.
          these programmes only partly concern controlling its greenhouse gas emissions, while business
          opportunities are of much greater significance: grid development investments meet a need to aid energy
          transition by strengthening transmission capacity and interconnections with foreign countries and
          research and innovation are also focused on identifying sustainable smart solutions that can be proposed
          to non-regulated activity customers.
          other community guidelines, such as those related to the development of a circular economy, may offer
          opportunities if they are transformed into operational methods that are recognised by the regulator.
          both the strategic plan (see page 43), the grid development plan (page 105) and the innovation plan (see

          terna’s sustainability policies and themes are managed in accordance with a structured governance
          system, which includes:

              •    the audit, risk and corporate governance committee, made up of independent members of
                   the board of directors tasked with supporting the board of directors when making evaluations and
                   decisions concerning the internal audit and risk management system (iarms). it performs periodic
                   checks to ensure the adequacy of the system relative to the company’s characteristics and risk
                   profile. since january 2016 the duties of the committee have also included the sustainability plan
                   and policies, the examination of the sustainability report and the monitoring of sustainability indices
              •    the sustainability steering committee, the members of which are the chairwoman of terna s.p.a.
                   – to whom the board of directors on 27 may 2014 gave, in addition to institutional duties, the role
                   of promoting and advising on csr – the ceos of terna rete italia s.p.a. and terna plus s.r.l.;
                   and a number of directors who share the responsibility for determining strategic guidelines and
                   sustainability objectives for the terna group, and for monitoring their progress and implementation.
                   the group’s csr manager is the secretary of the steering committee, which also decides on
                   the group’s sustainability plan, to support and add to the strategic plan. it supervises company
                   activities related to sustainability
              •    the corporate social responsibility unit within the external relations and csr department,
                   which, in collaboration with all departments and with reference to best practices, helps define
                   the company’s sustainability objectives from an ethical, social, environmental and sustainability-
                   governance viewpoint, and communicate the objectives and results of corporate social
                   responsibility. moreover, the unit constantly monitors the risks connected with sustainability, which
                   entail potential negative repercussions for the company’s reputation and its intangible value, by
                   analysing the ratings of the main agencies (such as robecosam, vigeo and eiris), which regularly
                   assess sustainability
              •    the sustainability team, a permanent working group that guarantees application of the guidelines
                   and achievement of the objectives defined by the sustainability steering committee, and serves as
                   the “drive belt” between the steering committee and the various company departments responsible
                   for implementing its decisions

          (4) the code of ethics is published in the “investor relations” and “sustainability” sections of terna’s website under “corporate governance”.

                                                                                                                        terna company profile   47



activities concerning quality, the environment, occupational safety, energy, anti-corruption activities and
security of information – crucial in terna’s vision of sustainability – are coordinated and guided in the
integrated management system for quality, environment, occupational safety, energy management, anti-
corruption, information security and quality of test laboratories and calibration, which has the following
certifications: iso 9001:2015, iso 14001:2004, iso 50001:2011, iso 37001:2016, iso 27001:2013, iso
17025:2005 and bs ohsas 18001:2007.
the integrated system covers 100% of terna’s activities in italy and abroad5, except the tamini group,
which is controlled by terna plus. however, in 2015 the tamini group initiated a process of environmental
certification of its production sites.

     innovation

     the great changes that are occurring in the sector are redesigning electricity networks and require
     significant technological upgrades to support environmental policies and increase the efficiency of
     the system as a whole. with a view to addressing the challenge of innovation, terna created, within
     its new strategy and development division, a structure that focuses on researching sustainable and
     innovative solutions for the energy market. in the five-year innovation, research and development plan,
     environmental sustainability is a fundamental driver for:

         •    reducing the impact of company assets on the environment and measuring terna’s environmental
              footprint by conducting analysis (for example, life cycle assessment on cables and conductors)
              and assessing alternative tools (for example, product environmental declarations and ecolabels),
              capitalising on the results in terms of social legitimacy and experience that can be used to develop
              new business
         •    consolidating the grid to support the move to greater use of renewables and more efficient and
              rational consumption
         •    anticipate and correct the impact of climate changes on grid assets, so as to its best future
              developments

     more detailed information on research projects that are already under way is given in the “electricity
     service” section on page 120.




     risk management

     over the last decade terna has developed an interpretation and adaptation of risk management theory,
     inspired by international best practice, to represent, describe and analyse risk scenarios that could damage
     or threaten the attainment of company objectives. recognising the risk, measuring it and, above all, studying
     the appropriate sustainable actions for containing it, in the various forms in which it can arise for critical
     infrastructure of national and european importance such as that managed by terna, are group priorities.
     the monitoring and effective treatment of corporate risks have been implemented through the adoption
     of general organisational measures and specific safeguards.
     from an organisational perspective, for some time now the group has been structured in such a way so
     as to guarantee the widespread management and monitoring of activities and their related risks, as well
     as a clear assignment of roles and responsibilities.
     the terna board of directors appoints the head of the internal audit department, who is responsible for
     checking that the internal audit and risk management system (iarms) is functional, operational and
     adequate. the audit and risk, corporate governance and sustainability committee is present within
     the bod, which supports top management in making evaluations and decisions concerning iarms. this
     committee gives its opinion on the chief risk officer (cro) appointment by the director in charge of the
     iarms. the cro, whose duties and responsibilities are governed by a specific company policy, supports
     top management in the effective management of the risk management process at a group level, draws
     up policies for the analysis, management and control of all business risks and coordinates all subjects
     involved in iarms, in order to maximise their efficiency and reduce any overlapping of activities.
     in line with this arrangement, the risk management department of the security and services division
     is tasked with implementing the risk management policies and guidelines drawn up by the cro and
     pursues the goal of continuous improvement and value creation. to this end, it adopts the enterprise
     risk management (erm) approach, suitably tailored to terna, which integrates and systematises risk
     management with structural tools and prevention measures and makes use of a governance, risk and
     compliance it tool (egrc), which provides an integrated view of risk management results. for more
     details on the managed risks and related safeguards, please refer to the integrated report.

                                                                                             terna company profile   49



the risk analysis conducted by terna showed that the group is exposed not to common price- and market-
related risks (or is so only to a limited extent in regard to non-regulated activities), but to a regulatory
and legislative risk. this is also due to the fact that electricity transmission is the core business of terna,
which is regulated primarily through government concession and by the provisions established by the
regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water (aeegsi), which include the definition of remuneration
of the terna service and of the corresponding tariff system.
the regulatory risk derives from potential changes in the parameters used to determine regulated revenue
(in 2016 amounting to around 90.0% of total group revenue), particularly following the multi-year review of
the regulatory framework, as occurred last year. the normative risk is related to possible changes in italian
and european tax laws, as well as those related to environmental themes, in relation to environmental,
energy and social (work and contract) matters.
risk analysis not only places particular attention on short-term risks, but also emerging medium-
long-term risks. assessing the impact of the electricity system on climate change is an issue that is
addressed by operational risk management, but which also affects the company’s strategic risks. to
this end, terna participates, together with other energy infrastructure operators, in recognising and
analysing the governance methods of the risks associated with climate change, run by the fondazione
eni enrico mattei, in order to share strategies and processes and establish possible synergies between
companies. furthermore, in recent years there has been a growing opposition to the construction of
terna infrastructures which, at times, actually threatens the attainment of strategic and/or regulatory
objectives. in order to counter this phenomenon, on the one hand a permanent safeguarding body, the
risk observatory was created to monitor critical environmental, political and social issues. on the other,
meetings with local communities and authorities were established, which aim to define shared design
solutions and gain agreement to works from stakeholders within the local community.
finally, terna constantly monitors risks associated with aspects of sustainability which may have a
negative impact on its reputation and its intangible value, including through ratings analyses by the main
agencies which periodically conduct sustainability assessments (such as robecosam, vigeo and eiris).




integrity, respecting the law and preventing corruption                                                               g4-so8

legality and honesty are two of the general principles on which the code of ethics and the conduct of the
company’s business are based.


penalties
respect for norms is the foundation on which any voluntary improvement initiative must be based.
the management policies and systems that terna uses to ensure compliance with norms and rules are
described in this report with reference to the various issues in question. in this paragraph, we focus on
summary indicators, represented by administrative or judicial sanction or significant penalty proceedings
to which terna has been subjected. considering the structure of the indications contained in the gri-g4
guidelines, compliance with the law by terna is illustrated by the following points:

   •   no significant definitive administrative or judicial proceedings were recorded in 2016 or in the two           g4-en29
       years prior that imposed on terna fines or obligations to “do/not do” (e.g. prohibitions), or that
       criminally convicted its employees
   •   in particular, the accounting records show that no fines exceeding € 10,000 regarding the                      g4-pr9
       environment were received in 2016
   •   there are no pending judicial proceedings against terna related to bribery, anti-trust, monopolistic           g4-so5
       practices, nor were there any sentences condemning terna in relation to the same issues in 2016
                                                                                                                      g4-so7
       or the previous two years
   •   there are no pending criminal proceedings for injuries caused to third parties by terna’s assets

     50   2016 sustainability report




              •    no injuries were suffered by employees of contractors during work entrusted by terna to the latter,
                   which gave rise to definitive judicial proceedings, sentencing terna to compensate for damages, or
                   resulting in criminal convictions of terna’s employees
              •    no fines relative to cases of harassment or occupational injuries for employees or former employees
                   were applied in 2016 or the previous two years for which definitive responsibility was assigned to
                   terna



          preventing corruption
          terna’s strategy in this regard focuses on three major areas: organisational model 231, fraud management
          and staff training.
          the safeguards and systems in the company have enabled the attribution since 2013 of legality ratings to
          the parent company, with maximum points awarded by the italian competition authority (ica).
g4-so5    in 2016, there was no pending litigation, nor were any penal cases concluded in regards to corruption.
          since 2014 terna has been associated with transparency international, the largest worldwide organisation
          concerned with preventing and combating corruption (see also page 54 and page 82).
          as part of the initiatives promoted by the association, in early 2016 the terna group joined the business
          integrity forum (bif) together with 11 other major italian companies already active on issues of integrity
          and transparency and committed to supporting the fight against corruption in business practices by
          collaborating with the network on joint projects of cultural dissemination, communication and the adoption
          of counteraction tools.
          in october 2016 terna renewed “open, transparent works”, the web space launched the previous year
          (see: terna’s “open, transparent works” on-line, 2015 sustainability report, page 35), making it accessible
          on any device. currently the site contains over 10,000 pieces of information concerning 176 open works
          and the 353 companies that are working on them. in january 2017 terna became the first italian business
          to obtain the 37001 certification for its anti-corruption management system, which covers the parent
          company and all subsidiaries (see the box bellow).



            anti-corruption: the terna group, the first in italy to obtain the iso
            37001 certification

             the terna group is the first in italy to certify its anti-corruption management system in accordance
             with the new international regulation iso 37001:2016 - anti-bribery management systems, published
             in october 2015 by iso (the international standard organisation) to support organisations to fight
             corruption and promote ethics in their economic activities.
g4-so3       the requirements of safety, quality, social responsibility and sustainability were verified by the imq
             certifying body, the most important italian organisation for auditing and assessing the conformity
             and certification of products and company management and quality systems.
             the terna anti-corruption management model guarantees behaviour based on principles of
             fairness, transparency and integrity and is an additional element in the strategic integrated security
             project based on the implementation and synergic management of tools, such as risk-sharing with
             institutional partners and the police, the creation of transparent communication tools, the promotion
             of respect for the law and prevention on crucial issues, such as corruption, undeclared employment,
             unpaid contributions and the risk of criminal infiltration into the economic fabric, procurement and
             subcontracts.

                                                                                         terna company profile   51



organisational model 231
in 2002, terna’s board of directors resolved to adopt an organisational and management model which
met the requirements of legislative decree no. 231 of 8 june 2001, in order to ensure correctness and
transparency in carrying out company business and activities in order to protect its position and image
and the expectations of its stakeholders.
the current model is divided into 11 parts, 1 general and 10 special, which cover a series of topics in
addition to the original one on corruption prevention, as well as the compliance regulation. the task of
keeping the model up to date is assigned to the project coordination and model 231 monitoring unit,
within the corporate affairs division.
numerous training initiatives were carried out in 2016, which are covered in the “employee awareness”
section. further information on terna’s organisational model and those of the group’s other companies is
available in the “investor relations” section under “corporate governance” on terna’s homepage http://
www.terna.it.



fraud management
in its focus on corporate fraud, terna adopts a constituent element of its approach to business management.
an effective approach against fraud has three primary goals: prevention, detection and reaction.
terna has sought to protect its reputation and image by adopting a fraud management structure in
order to ensure that corporate assets (tangible and intangible resources, direct and upstream benefits)
are protected with regard to all illegal events that could compromise them, through activity aimed at
preventing and managing corporate fraud.
in order to identify potential internal vulnerabilities and then act to remove them, terna has developed a
reference methodological model based on the systematic analysis of preconditions that can be associated
with fraudulent events, identifying “critical areas” in which fraudulent phenomena are more likely and

this is accompanied by a constant monitoring of its internal regulations and their application, in order to

all new employees attend training courses which aim in part to ensure awareness and dissemination of
the rules on conduct and procedures established to prevent crime at all levels of the company within their
objectives. these courses also train and inform personnel about the areas at risk of criminal activity and        g4-hr2
about potential crime in relation to the work carried out.
a structured and multi-year training plan was drafted in 2016 on the issues regarding organisational
model 231 and combating corruption.
part of the plan has been carried out. specifically, a classroom-based course that involved 40 employees
of the tamini group and two editions of a workshop on combating corruption, transparency and market
abuse, which involved around 120 employees. an on-line training programme was also initiated at the end
of 2016 on organisational model 231.
for the two-year period 2017-2018, the plan envisages classroom-based courses aimed at specific target
audiences, which will involve senior managers, junior executives, white-collar workers and a selection of
blue-collar workers.

g4-hr1    respect for human rights
g4-hr3
          the terna group operates in italy, where the legal framework and the level of civil development largely
g4-hr5    guarantee respect for human rights, freedom of association and collective bargaining, thus making it
          non-critical for a company to take particular action on these issues with the implementation of specific
g4-hr8    management policies.
          since december 2009, terna has been part of the global compact, adopting its principles as a formal
g4-hr9
          point of reference, after already having cited them since 2006 in its code of ethics. in 2014 and 2016 the
          audit unit carried out two surveys to gauge the employees’ perception on the application of human rights
          within the company and towards suppliers. the survey investigated observance of the principles of the
          global compact by the group companies, following the indications of the united nations ruggie report
          in regard to human rights (see also page 52 of the 2014 sustainability report).
          notwithstanding the above, terna has set itself the objective of verifying the lack of any critical issues
          through systematic due diligence that, on the one hand, takes all company activities as its reference point
          and the stakeholders with rights on the other, with particular regard to the most vulnerable groups, in line
          with the guidelines of the united nations’ ruggie report.
          the managerial responsibility for human rights rests, above all, with the human resource and organisation,
          procurement and contracts, and security and services departments for guaranteeing respect for
          human rights, and workers’ protection in contracted and subcontracted activities (see the “supply chain
          sustainability” section on page 53), and the audit unit for ensuring that terna’s code of ethics is correctly
          applied. the corporate social responsibility unit, finally, tracks changes in external references (e.g.
          international conventions).



            terna, the best italian company in terms of human rights

             in february 2017 the french ratings and sustainability research agency vigeo-eiris released the
             results of its new research on the actions of corporations relative to human rights.
             in “the human rights responsibilities of business in a changing world” study, conducted on over
             3,000 companies in 35 countries and across 38 sectors, terna ranked 14th overall, the top italian
             company within the group of the best 30 worldwide.
             vigeo-eiris considered how companies integrated respect for human rights into their policies,
             operating practices and the transparency of communications outlining results achieved. assessment
             of these aspects provides a snapshot of the extent to which companies have effectively implemented
             the indications in the “un guiding principles of business and human rights”, applying the three
             basic items indicated in the guidelines to human rights management: protect, respect, remedy. terna
             was awarded 75 points in the french agency’s analysis, above all thanks to excellent performance
             in the areas of labour rights and non-discrimination and integration of social factors in supply chain
             management.

the predominance of national and local suppliers is a consequence of the specific nature of the business,
and in particular of the need to perform fast maintenance work on plants to ensure the utmost security
of the electrical system. suppliers located in geographical proximity to the plants also guarantee more
competitive transport costs for heavy and bulky supplies, contributing in this way also to reducing the
related environmental impact.
with a view to expanding the supplier portfolio, the market is continuously scouted; this implies rigorous
meetings with both italian and overseas potential suppliers.
in the various stages of the procurement cycle, terna analyses the suppliers’ characteristics as regards
legality, technical and organisational capacity, and environmental sustainability and social responsibility
issues. as far as the latter are concerned, monitoring to guarantee correctness is based on various tools,
which create more stringent conditions when the product categories are more significant for terna or
owing to the potential social and environmental impact of the suppliers’ businesses.
all suppliers are required to commit contractually to behave in compliance with the provisions of terna’s
code of ethics and model 231; sanctions are imposed for any misconduct. although a preponderant
proportion of suppliers are italian, in the other cases the supplier is always subject to screening in relation
to country of origin. in cases of countries at risk as regards respect for human rights or corruption, specific
further investigations are carried out.
for procurement that regards the performance of activities linked to terna’s core business (instrumental
contracts), and which mainly comprise supplies of electrical materials and equipment, work contracts, and
services in the sectors of electricity transmission, telecommunications and information technology, the
legal regulations provided for in the contracts code apply. numerous requirements for contractualisation
involve environmental and social aspects (human rights, working conditions): among these, for example,
checks on regular payment of contributions, no breaches of workplace safety laws and no environmental
crimes. the integrity pact, validated in its most recent form in 2014 by transparency international, entails
commitments in relation to integrity and combating corruption. finally, for certain sectors, specific social
and environmental requirements are introduced at the qualification stage.


(6) the amount indicates refers to that ordered during the year. ordered means the sum of amounts entrusted through all contracts (labour,
    supplies and services) signed during the course of the year.

     safety and working conditions) and the environmental aspects (significant environmental impacts in the
     supply chain, in use by terna, and at the end of the useful life stage). this activity entails particular
     attention at the qualification stage and in finalising the technical specifications, and the commitment to
     adopt particular precautions in the case of sectors not subject to qualification. finally, additional specific

 the new public contracts code comes into force

   in april 2016 the italian government, by way of implementation of european directive 23/24/25 of 2014,
   declared the new public contracts code that introduced important changes related to sustainability
   and the environment.
   in december 2016, terna, in accordance with the new principles provided for by the code, issued its
   new regulation on procurement, which is valid for the whole group.
   specifically, sustainability elements were introduced, such as qualitative measurement parameters in
   tender drafting according to the criteria of the most economically advantageous offer, applying them to
   both economic operators and the supplies offered. the following in particular were added:

      •   sustainability requirements (for example, functional and aesthetic aspects)
      •   accessibility for people with disabilities
      •   certifications on the health and safety of workers (oshas 18001)
      •   social and environmental features
      •   reduction of energy consumption and environmental resources used in the work or product
      •   possession of a european union environmental quality brand (eu ecolabel) related to the
          goods or services covered by the contract, in an amount equal or greater than 30% of the
          supply or services value of the same contract
      •   offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions related to the company’s activities, calculated in
          accordance with the methods established based on recommendation no. 2013/179/eu of the
          commission dated 9 april 2013, concerning the use of common methodologies to measure
          and communicate environmental performance throughout the life cycle of products and
          organisations

   for tenders based solely on price, the economic value of the tender must also consider economic
   components related to use and maintenance costs, taking into consideration energy and natural
   resource consumption, polluting emissions and external costs for mitigating the costs of climate
   change referring to the entire life cycle of the work, good or service, with the strategic objective of
   a more efficient utilisation of resources and circular economy that promotes the environment and
   employment.
   lastly, terna has created a training module for all the group’s buyers (more than 50 people), aimed
   at presenting all the changes introduced by the new code and highlighting those that deal with
   sustainability.




assessment of esg criteria in qualifying suppliers
most of the product categories that are most significant for the core business from a technical and
economic point of view are subject to qualification. only companies with the requisites of legislative
compliance in line with that of the contracts code, and of technical and organisational quality and financial
solidity are admitted to the relevant register.
in areas at greater risk from the point of view of sustainability, an adequate level of environmental
management and the ability to protect worker health and safety are also required. they are both
represented by documented corporate procedures that outline the significant elements in accordance
with the uni en iso 14001 and bs ohsas 18001 international standards.
of all the qualified suppliers, 80% have acquired or are acquiring bs ohsas 18001:2007 safety
certification, and 81% possess or are acquiring iso 14001:2004 environmental certification.

g4-hr4       assessing esg risks in foreign supplies
g4-hr5       within the context of procurement activities, country risk is understood as the possibility of suffering
             damage on the occurrence of circumstances or events which can be linked to the economic, social
g4-hr6
             and political context of the country in which the supplier normally operates. it is a much lower risk than
             that associated with environmental and health and safety matters and is currently negligible given the
             prevalence of domestic suppliers, but it could assume greater significance as the procurement markets
             expand and, more generally, because of terna’s foreign expansion strategy. to analyse and assess the
             most significant risk factors, which relate to the macro-areas of economic and political governance of the
             various countries, and to observance of the human rights established at the international level, objective
             elements are used, including ratification of the un and ilo conventions, combined with the assessments
             expressed by the main international non-governmental organisations and by the most important ratings
             agencies working in the fields in question. these assessments are updated regularly and therefore
             constitute a source of constant monitoring of the effective evolution of the situation. these assessments
             are combined with reporting of the restrictive measures issued by the italian and european authorities,
             which entail limitations on the free circulation of goods (trade embargoes) or rules of conduct in the case
             of transactions with countries offering tax advantages (tax havens).



             monitoring of safety, the environment and human rights at contractors’ sites
             the increase in workers employed by contractors and subcontractors in 2016 is linked to the increase in
             the number of construction sites.

             (1) the data take into account the term of construction contracts and the variations in the workforce required, and relate to various types
                 of terna work contracts, from large construction sites to cutting vegetation under power lines. the days worked and the fte units are
                 estimated on the basis of the average daily presences at the largest construction sites and the amounts paid for contracted work on smaller
                 sites. no further information is available on the types of contracts used by contractors.


             considering the significant use of external labour on terna’s construction sites, work contracts are
             subject to stricter rules regarding not only qualification, but also management, particularly with reference
             to occupational safety. the costs of eliminating or limiting the risks of interference are excluded from the
             downward price competition for awarding the contract.

                                                                                           terna company profile   57



during the qualification process, terna requires that documented procedures for protecting the health and
safety of workers be presented. for companies in categories considered most significant with regard to
safety and the environment, an in-depth investigation of the management practices adopted is envisaged
by means of a detailed questionnaire.
for contractor employees terna requires additional certifications:                                                      eu18

   •   that they understand italian
   •   that all workers on overhead power line construction sites (mainly blue-collar) have examined
       and have been appropriately instructed on the use of personal protective equipment, the risks
       established in the construction-site safety plan (csp) and the operating safety plan (osp)
       prepared by terna, and the environmental-protection measures as established in the relevant
       operating procedure “management of the environmental aspects during plant construction”, which
       is attached to each contract
   •   attendance at training courses, lasting between 24 and 32 hours for several specific roles (e.g.
       workers installing and maintaining overhead lines, workers cutting vegetation, site foremen, team
       leaders and safety managers)
   •   appointment of a safety, prevention and protection manager (rspp), a construction-site safety
       representative, a crisis manager and substitute, and an assigned doctor
   •   a request in contracts drawn up with contractors to provide injury rates for the year

the actual training of personnel is verified through a web platform – the qualified company personnel
project.
to reduce to a minimum the risk of violations of human and labour rights to the detriment of contractor
employees, in addition to the specific instrumental-contract documentation, terna also requires a copy
of an insurance policy covering damages to third parties, personal injuries and damage to property,
including the contractor’s, for the entire duration of the work and in an amount appropriate to the type of
work performed, as well as a periodical copy of the payment of social-security and other contributions.



activities in 2016
in line with previous years, in 2016, 17 construction sites for building lines and substations entrusted to
contractors were checked across the country, with additional controls beyond those required by law. the
construction sites were chosen on the basis of the duration of the work and the complexity of the activities
to be undertaken. during the inspections not only aspects closely associated with workplace safety were
analysed, but also those associated with environmental protection, such as water and waste management
and interference with the surrounding environment.
in regards to integrated environmental-safety security and the continuous safety improvement plan, the
“near miss: safety and environment” project continued to be extended with the aim of identifying and
analysing all unusual events, near misses and environmental accidents that occurred during working
activities and that, although they had the potential to do so, did not harm people or the environment.
in 2016 the activities of the “inter-company environmental, health and safety forum” continued, in
which the leading italian operators of network plants and infrastructure take part. the aim is to facilitate
discussions, identify the best safety practices, discuss interpretations of laws and create a virtuous
path of continuous improvement on the subjects of health, safety and the environment. in particular, two
technical workshops on worker management abroad and site safety were organised.
lastly, terna contributed to the dissemination - through the supplier portal on the website www.terna.it
- of a few governance tools (code of ethics, whistle blowing and the integrity pact) amongst small- and
medium-sized suppliers, which they may choose to adopt. the project offers the option of downloading
a governance kit for free from the websites of the member companies.
it the kit is used, the companies must only provide proof on their websites and promote the training of their
employees and the information to their suppliers.

     this is a cultural initiative that promotes and disseminates integrity and anti-corruption tools whereby a
     few large companies, including terna, provide their small suppliers with certain pre-set policies, without
     requiring their mandatory use, but rather as an ideal sharing of best practice.



     equal opportunities and transparency in contractual relationships
     access to tender procedures is guaranteed for all suitable companies according to the principle of
     equal opportunities, and is governed by the “regulation on procurement”. the regulation represents the
     corporate reference document for terna’s procurement activity and was prepared on the basis of the
     contracts code (legislative decree 50/2016) which, in turn, transposes the eu legislation on the subject.
     another essential tool for guaranteeing transparency in procurement is the “procurement portal”, the
     section of the institutional website based on criteria of simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency, through
     which it is possible to find out about competitive tenders and take part in on-line tenders, as well as to
     complete the qualification procedure for access to the register, moving towards paperless management.
     in 2016, approximately 1,300 requests for on-line assistance were received from suppliers, all of which
     were resolved in the times provided for in the corporate procedures.

     (1) atypical contracts include: sponsorships and donations, payments to public bodies, category associations and mandatory contracts for
         terna plus. in previous years the amount of atypical contracts was within the mandatory category.




     continual improvement and auditing tools
     a supplier list was created in 2016, an integrated system of data collection and screening of information
     on selected suppliers within market areas not subject to qualification, aimed at defining lists of questions
     to be used to identify competitors in procedures to award work for contracts below european significance
     thresholds.
     the new application is an important development in our relationship with suppliers. the integration
     with the tender platform allows for simplification, transparency and interactivity aspects to be further
     developed and, alongside the qualification portal - on which the selection process for core compartments
     takes place - it helps to guarantee greater monitoring of suppliers.
     dialogue with suppliers remains the most important tool to guide their growth, from the point of view of
     ethics, environmental sustainability and social responsibility.
     in regards to qualified suppliers, the existence of the supplier’s esg requisites is verified over the three
     years for which the qualification is valid through constant checks, which during 2016 translated into 743
     audits. if conduct is found to no longer be in line with the qualification requirements, the supplier may be
     warned or suspended temporarily from the register and, in the most serious cases, removed altogether.

                                                                                            terna company profile   59

the auditing system within the company also provides for other checks, according to the activities
performed by the suppliers and the type of risks assessed as predominant in a certain segment:

   •    constant checks, ex ante, of requests for awarding consultancy services, professional appointments
        and it services, and of procedures for awarding contracts to predetermined suppliers
   •    on-site checks at suppliers who are qualified/or seeking qualification during the year. in particular,
        in 2016 91% of these inspections were concentrated on companies that belong to the relevant
        segments from an esg point of view
   •    inspections at construction sites of lines and substations managed by contractors, to check safety
        and environmental aspects

     relations with stakeholders


     relational capital: our approach

     a relationship of mutual trust between terna and its stakeholders is essential in order to achieve the
     group’s strategic objectives. the relevant criteria and means to achieve this are described in the specific
     “stakeholders management model” guideline, which was drafted in 2015 and is in line with the aa1000
     stakeholder engagement standard (ses) developed by accountability7.
     the model consists of a few basic parts that are regularly updated:

         •    stakeholder map
         •    the ranking of importance of stakeholders, which reflects the dependence and influence each of
              them hold with terna
         •    the matrix of optimal relationship procedures that guides terna’s approach to stakeholder
              engagement
         •    the monitoring system that specifically implements engagement activities and allows for
              stakeholders’ opinions and expectations and their degree of satisfaction in relation to terna to be
              canvassed

     each year a specific engagement programme identifies the actions to be carried out, both in terms
     of bringing actual relationship procedures in line with optimal ones and regularly listening to the most
     influential stakeholders.
     the first annual monitoring was conducted in 2016. this task involved all company departments and
     included several direct stakeholder engagement initiatives, such as the survey of non-regulated business
     customers.
     overall, the stakeholders’ management model is a set of tools designed to provide terna with a way of
     measuring the evolution of its relational capital, in order to prevent the risk of terna not becoming aware of
     possible problems in good time and to create value through the participatory contribution of stakeholders.
     the categories of stakeholders identified within the map and the main activities that distinguished their
     relationship with terna in 2016 are described below.




     (7) the 2011 version of the aa1000ses standard was taken into account when drafting the model, because the most recent update to the
         standard was published in november 2015, when the guideline had already been adopted.

                                                                 relations with stakeholders   63

              people in the organisation

              these are the internal stakeholders who make up the company and who make the business possible by
              carrying out their job.
              personnel play a crucial role, both as a group and as individuals, in relation to their position in the
              organisation and, in turn, they are also affected by terna’s business from an economic perspective, as
              well as in terms of personal and professional well-being and development. this category also includes
              employee representatives and terna’s own supervisory bodies.
              when interacting with this category of stakeholders, the company uses the following engagement tools:
              direct surveys or on a sampling basis, internal communication initiatives and focus groups on specific
              issues. specifically, in may 2016 it was conducted via a questionnaire. the biannual survey on the training
              effectiveness involved all employee managers and coordinators with the aim of gathering brief feedback
              on the quality of the training provided between 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. as with previous editions,
              the subjects investigated concerned – in order – the utilisation of the training by the respondent, the
              training taken by colleagues and the overall perception of the role played by training within the company.
              the survey, to which 61% of the managers involved responded, confirmed the positive assessment for all
              of the investigated subjects: 91% assessed the training provided directly as very effective/effective; the
              figure rises to 94% for the training provided to colleagues. lastly, 95% of respondents gave a high/good
              level to the results achieved by colleagues in terms of skill development and consolidation.
              personnel management policies, human resource management and all aspects concerning their health
              and safety are discussed in the relative “personnel” section on page 154.
              terna employees accounted for 23.7% of total value added in 2016. a breakdown of the value added
              during the year is available in the “key indicator tables” on page 197.



              industrial relations
              all terna employees8 are covered by the collective labour agreement adopted by companies in the
              electricity industry.
g4-la8        the national collective employment contract (ccnl) provides for the establishment of a bilateral body
              – at the electricity industry level – on “health, safety and the environment”, to make proposals, verify,
              monitor and coordinate training on environmental and safety matters.
g4-la5        employee involvement in matters of health, safety and the environment is currently regulated by law and
              by collective bargaining, which provide for the election of employee health, safety and environment
              representatives (esers) by all the employees, thus representing 100% of the workforce.
              the relations between terna and the trade unions at the company level are governed by the “protocol
              on the industrial relations system”, which defines a system of relations divided into contract negotiation,
              discussions, consultation and advance and/or periodic information exchange.
g4-la4        trade union involvement in organisational changes is one of the central aspects of industrial relations: it
              is regulated both by legal provisions, industry-wide contracts and company agreements. in accordance
              with the union agreements in effect at terna, in the event of significant organisational changes, preliminary
              discussions with the unions must take place, to be concluded within three months. in these discussions,
              the company should make available the documentation necessary to ensure a complete overview of the
              organisational project, enabling observations and proposals to be formulated.
              the rate of unionisation of terna employees in 2016 was equal to 50.2%, up slightly compared to the
              previous year; union membership is concentrated in the biggest groups.
              during the three-year period 2014-2016, negotiations with industry trade unions resulted in the signing of
              58 written agreements.
              in 2016, industrial relations work specifically involved industry-wide participation in negotiations for the
              renewal of the national collective employment contract (ccnl) which expired at 31 december 2015.




              (8) employees of the subsidiary terna crna gora d.o.o., operating in montenegro, are covered by an individual secondment contract. for any

                  the national collective bargaining agreement for the metalworkers sector applies to tamini group employees.

regulation of strikes within the electricity service                                                                 g4-hr4

relations with trade unions in the industry also give rise to the regulation of indispensable services that
must be performed, in the event of a strike, to ensure service continuity. at terna, the national trade
union agreement signed in february 2013 is applied. as workers responsible for ntg transmission and
operating activities, the following shift workers are exempt from strikes:

   •   operators responsible for real-time control of the national electricity system, remote control of
       transmission plants, verifying production plans and procuring the production resources necessary
       for dispatching
   •   workers with the task of checking, coordinating and operating the computer systems, auxiliary
       services and infrastructure governing the dispatching of electricity nationwide
   •   security operations centre workers

as for personnel on call, the agreement establishes that, although they have the right to suspend normal
performance during the strike, they are obliged to be on call throughout the duration of said strike.




electricity service operators

these are the parties that represent the various activities connected to the electricity service and with
whom terna maintains relations that are severely regulated and marked by mutual impact and influence
on many levels. these stakeholders also have potential influence on regulatory authorities and public
decision-makers.
terna maintains relations with grid users and electricity industry operators through various communication
channels. these relations are largely defined by the regulations that govern the processes of development
and management of the electricity grid. terna has also developed additional channels, such as the portals
my terna (the platform through which terna manages contracted dispatching users, with an associated
dedicated call centre) and gaudì.
in addition to the information below, please see the section on “regulators of licensed activities”, which
deals with the public consultation process on the development plan managed by the aeegsi that takes
the form of an engagement activity between terna and sector operators.



consultation committee
the committee is a technical body, chaired by a terna representative, that constitutes the permanent base
for consultation with companies involved in the electricity industry and includes representatives from the
various user categories, namely: distributors, producers (from both conventional and renewable sources),
large industrial customers, wholesalers, and consumers. the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and
water and the ministry of economic development participate as observers.
the committee has an advisory role regarding the general criteria for the development of the grid and
interconnections and amendments and additions to the grid code that become necessary based on
operational experience acquired or following on from changes to the legal or regulatory framework.
the committee may also advocate changes to current rules and may play a conciliatory role to facilitate
the resolution of any disputes resulting from the application of the rules of the grid code.
in 2016, the committee was involved in the consultation process for the update and revision of the grid
code with regard to rules for dispatching, the unavailability protocol and the procedure for the connection
of plants to the ntg.
the committee was also provided with precise information concerning the progress of the activities
referred to in previous development plans and the possible development of system scenarios and lines
for developing the 2017 development plan. in 2016 the consultation committee met twice.

     the gaudì portal
     gaudì is the unique plants data management system for the electricity generated by terna at a national
     level, pursuant to the resolution of the aeegsi arg/elt 124/10, in order to streamline the flow of information
     and simplify the processes that affect companies in the electricity generation sector.
     all production plants within italy are identified within gaudì, no matter their size or fuel source (conventional,
     renewable, cogeneration, etc.).
     the system uses a unique code at national level to identify the production plants and individual units
     contained therein in order to facilitate the alignment of databases managed by institutional and systemic
     organisations within the sector (aeegsi, terna, gse, distributors) and provide feedback concerning the
     stored data. the gaudì also monitors the plant qualification process in the market. the development
     stage of each production plant can be followed, from the authorisation phase to connection to the grid
     and when it comes into commercial operation.
     for regulatory reasons, the functions of gaudì have been extended over time and, consequently, new
     modules have been developed on the platform: the gedi (distributed generation) and the sspc (simple
     production and consumption services), the single form (for managing the simplified connection process)
     and new functions that not only allow for plants to be activated, but for all the operations related to the
     entire life-cycle of the plant to be managed.
     specifically, during 2016 functions were developed that allow the transfer and application of connection
     requests and the decommissioning and conservation of plants to be managed via gaudì.
     the aforementioned functions were put into operation following on from two workshops with distributors.

participation in industry associations
another opportunity for interaction and discussion in order to contribute to the general improvement of
the electricity industry and its regulations and technical standards is provided by terna’s presence in the
main national and international industry associations.

during 2016 terna strengthened its presence within industry associations that are focused on the
mediterranean basin in particular. it also formed association relationships with organisations concerned
with wider areas in order to monitor the socio-political and economic contexts in which it develops its
business. lastly, at a bilateral level, terna and the french tso, rte, implemented the memorandum of
understanding that was signed in 2015 concerning the mutual collaboration in grid development and non-
regulated activities, technological innovation and research.

relations with consumer associations
it continued its efforts to build and manage local consensus through the “terna information campaign
– consumer associations” project with codici, lega consumatori, unc, mdc, assoutenti, adoc and
movimento consumatori. the campaign aims to achieve maximum information-sharing with the localities
affected by the implementation of planned infrastructure in order to increase awareness of the usefulness
and benefits of the new infrastructure. the project was implemented by focusing on the activities in the
campania region for the montecorvino-benevento work with one-to-one meetings and courses with key
stakeholders. one of the latest proposals included creating a campania region observatory to implement
the supply of information and company responses to a particular work, with activities that are increasingly
attentive to dialogue needs.



economic relations with electricity service operators
terna, in providing the various public services entrusted to it under concession, comes into contact with
different categories of entity that may be summarised thus:

   •   dispatching users, i.e. parties (manufacturers, wholesalers or customers) to whom terna supplies
       dispatching services
   •   manufacturers and customers to whom terna supplies the ntg connection service
   •   distribution companies in close proximity to the transmission grid, to whom terna delivers energy
       needed to meet customer demand

terna has economic relations also with a further category of entity: represented by interruptible customers,
i.e. customers willing to undergo sudden suspension of electricity supply of their plants.
via the dispatching service, terna guarantees that dispatching service users have access and use of the
national electricity system, also performing all the activities necessary at any time to ensure a balance
between the consumption and production of electricity. to do this, terna buys resources on a market in
which it is the only operator: the so-called dispatching services market (msd).
on this market, terna buys and sells electricity and other essential services such as the reserve, with the
purpose of ensuring a moment-by-moment balance of the system. in 2016 the economic items related to
the msd amounted to about € 1.7 billion.
terna also has the task of attributing to each dispatching service user the costs that the latter has
generated for the system due to the imbalances caused, i.e. the difference between how much the user
programmed and how much they imputted/withdrew from the grid. such differences between the final
programmes of operators (both producers and consumers) and their actual behaviour attract the invoicing
of imbalance charges.
most of the interactions with electricity operators are managed through the myterna portal, a platform
created to optimise the commercial relationship with counterparts. this portal is the main access channel
for services dedicated to operators, including management of the database for requests for connection
to the ntg; stipulation of withdrawal contracts; management of contacts; and viewing of the main data
for each operator.
in 2016, terna procured resources for interruptibility and instant-load-reduction services, which aim to
secure the functioning of the national electricity system in the event that resources procured on the
market were found to be insufficient. in 2016, there were 286 assignees of the interruptibility and instant-
load-reduction service for about 3,566 mw of power and the related economic liability amounted to about
€ 0.3 billion on an annual basis.

                 been updated, which reported only the number of counterparties with which the economic regulation of the fees for imbalances was
                 made.




           suppliers

           these are the parties whose products, services and skills terna uses to support (directly or indirectly) the
           execution and development of its own business activity. in their relationship with terna, they are affected
           economically and, simultaneously, exert operational or strategic influence, depending on their relevance
           to the supply business. this category also includes the trade associations representing the interests of
           similar groups of suppliers.
           in 2016, total spending to procure services, supplies and labour amounted to over € 529 million, distributed
           among 1,818 suppliers with whom contracts applied during the year.
           the usual point of contact for terna and its suppliers is the “procurement portal”, the section of the
           corporate website where it is possible to learn about tenders, participate in online tenders, and go through
           the qualification process for inclusion on the supplier register.
           in 2014, terna adopted the electronic platform for managing contract tenders. this tool ensures that the
           tender procedures are done digitally and that all the documentation produced is also digital.
           the procurement department also maintains direct contact with suppliers to manage contractual
           relations and improve the company’s knowledge of specific problems with groups of suppliers. to that
           end, meetings are periodically organised with specialist companies or industrial associations to inform
           them about any updates to the requirements, or points of attention related to the ethical conduct to be
           followed in relations with terna.
           terna presents and discusses its main investment projects and relative procurement plans with the
           electromechanical companies in the energy industry (mostly members of confindustria anie) and
           organises meetings on specific issues with particular reference to safety. the important action programme
           requires an even greater effort on the part of suppliers, who are required to act not merely as simple
           contractors but as real technological partners. terna plays an active role in key meetings with suppliers
           such as industry meetings, expos and conferences.
           in order to expand its portfolio of suppliers, terna continuously engages in “procurement marketing”
           by market scouting, benchmarking and monitoring the performance of suppliers. this involves constant
           meetings with both italian and overseas supplier firms.
           for details on the supplier qualification and evaluation process, as well as the monitoring of safety, the
           environment and human rights at sites, see the “supply chain sustainability” section on page 53.
           terna, finally, promotes the settlement of any disputes that arise with suppliers.

                                                                                         relations with stakeholders   71

regulators of licensed activities

these are the italian and eu public bodies and institutions to which the law confers regulatory, guidance
and control powers over terna as the party licensed for the transmission and dispatching of electricity.
in performing its activities, terna maintains continuous relationships with these organisations in order to
develop, update and implement that which is provided for by sector law and regulations, also playing an
advisory and technical support role for both italian and eu institutions.



main activities in 2016
20 january 2016 – following on from the launch of the public consultation process of the scheme of the
2015 national transmission grid development plan (dp)9, terna presented the findings of the comments
received at a public meeting in milan at aeegsi headquarters. the consultation on the 2015 dp scheme
was officially completed on 31 january 2016. the outcome of the consultation (comments on 11 issues
received from 5 separate operators/trade associations and the relative analysis and evaluation conducted
by terna) was published on the aeegsi website.
28 april 2016 – the aeegsi began the public consultation process of the scheme of the 2016 national
transmission grid development plan (dp)10. on 15 june 2016, during the consultation, terna organised
a public presentation of the 2016 dp scheme at the authority’s offices, to the benefit of interested
representatives of the electricity system, such as operators and consumers and their associations. at the
end of the consultation (30 june 2016), terna analysed and evaluated the comments received (concerning
14 issues from comments received by 7 separate operators/trade associations). the outcome of the
consultation was published by the aeegsi on its website.
4 november 2016 – with recommendation/2016/i/eel, the aeegsi submitted the findings of the 2015
dp and 2016 dp consultations and authorised the approval of the same by the ministry of economic
development.



regulated revenue
the regulated revenue from transmission and dispatching activities amounts to around 90.0% of terna's
total revenue and is determined on the basis of the regulations of the regulatory authority for electricity,
gas and water (aeegsi).

      the three main types of costs recognised

      to cover                    the regulated asset base (rab) which represents invested regulatory
      capital                     capital, is revalued annually in accordance with istat data on the change
      remuneration                in the deflator of gross fixed investments and is updated on the basis of
      (rab)                       investment and disposal trends.
                                  the rate of remuneration of the rab, known as the weighted average
                                  cost of capital (wacc), is defined by the authority. as of 2016, the

      approximately 50% of        three-years. the pwacc sets the basic wacc parameter levels applied

                                  2016-2018 the wacc for the transmission service is set at 5.3% and an
                                  update is provided for, valid for the second three years (2019-2021), to take
                                  into account the change in specific parameters (e.g. risk-free rate, bonus
                                  for market risk, β parameter).
                                  with regard to incentivised investments, resolution 654/2015/r/eel
                                  confirmed the effects of the incentive regulations from prior regulatory
                                  periods for all investments that came into effect at 31 december 2015 and
                                  provided for a new “transitional incentive” mechanism for the 2016–2019
                                  period. under this mechanism, the authority is expected to approve a
                                  list of “o-npr1” development works (not included in the i3 investments
                                  approved by resolution 40/13) and a list of “i-npr1” development projects
                                  (previously included in the i3 investments) and to recognise a 1% increase
                                  in the wacc for 12 years subject to certain conditions set out in annex a
                                  to resolution 654/2015/r/eel. for the works that make up the i-npr1s and
                                  for o-npr1 development works, the above resolution also provides for
                                  the possibility of applying an additional output-based bonus.
                                  additionally, as of 2016, with reference solely to remuneration of invested
                                  capital, the delay with which the tariff remunerates investments was
                                  reduced (the time-lag): the tariffs for the year “n” include the remuneration
                                  of investment capital up to year “n-1” and the recognition of depreciation of
                                  investments up to year “n-2”. the 1% extra remuneration to offset the time
                                  lag, from the fifth regulatory period, is therefore limited to investments in the
                                  period 2012-2014, and abolished in relation to investments in subsequent
                                  years.
                                  for 2017, the revenue recognised was set by the authority – for the first
                                  time – approving a tariff proposal presented by terna and prepared on

 represented                  2014) supplemented by residual portions – temporarily left to terna – of the
 approximately 18% of         extra-efficiency achieved in the two previous regulatory periods. the value
 the costs awarded to         obtained is revalued annually on the basis of inflation and reduced by an

                              users of the extra-efficiency achieved.




pass-through items
with regard to dispatching operations, terna manages cost and revenue items connected to the
transactions, completed with electricity market operators, to buy and sell the energy: these are the “pass
through” items, i.e. those which do not influence the profitability of the terna group, as revenue is equal
to cost.
these items include payments such as the capacity payment which terna collects from withdrawal
dispatching users and passes on to the producers who make the capacity available on the market. it also
includes the payment that terna collects from the withdrawal dispatching users and passes on to the
operators which supply the load interruption service.
a significant proportion of pass-through items consists of uplift, a tariff component which includes various
system costs, including covering the net expenses incurred to procure resources on the dispatching
service market (dsm).
in 2016, pass-through revenue and costs for the terna group totalled € 5,598.5 million.



2016 incentive schemes
the current regulatory framework includes bonus and penalty incentive schemes aimed at encouraging
service improvement, both in terms of technical reliability and cost. as is implicit in incentive mechanisms,
upon reaching objectives, the benefit to service users will be a multiple of the incentive paid. the incentive
schemes within the regulatory framework provided for the 2016-2019 period can be summarised into two
types:

   •   the transmission service quality: non-tariff incentive scheme
   •   the selective promotion of significant strategic investments: tariff incentive schemes (as described
       above: extra wacc potential and output based incentive potential)

the bonuses/penalties connected to achievement of the objectives established in the incentive schemes
are included in the total regulated revenue.

     customers (non-regulated activities)

     these are the parties who purchase the services offered by terna in non-regulated sectors. they have
     an economic influence because they differentiate the company’s revenue (financial influence) and are
     affected by terna’s activity in relation to the service provided.
     in keeping with the features of the sectors in which it operates, terna has developed a range of distinctive
     competencies that it intends to harness, within italy and abroad, to develop its portfolio of services and
     solutions in the non-regulated field.
     in italy in particular, the parties that terna focuses its offer on are typically energy-intensive companies
     that are directly connected to the national transmission grid, with whom consolidated and long-lasting
     relationships have been established over the years. conversely, abroad, terna proposes solutions
     based on its “core business”, directly interfacing with institutional bodies, such as regulatory authorities,
     governmental entities and other tsos.
     in addition to this, terna also offers tlc services to sector operators, thus utilising its infrastructure
     to the fullest, also with a view to implementing its ultra-broadband plan, which is crucial for the digital
     development of italy.
     in line with the initial phase that characterises the development of non-regulated activities, the canvassing
     of stakeholder expectations and satisfaction is being defined for this category of stakeholders, referred to
     in the company through the new business development department and by terna plus.
     in 2016, revenue from terna customers in the non-regulated sector amounted to € 186.6 million.



       terna presents its energy solutions to clients and commercial partners

        in november, the terna “campus” training centre hosted “energy solutions provider”, the first event
        for customers and commercial partners presenting the group’s new role in non-regulated activities
        (nra).
        to the 60 companies present, which came from all over italy, terna outlined the new business
        opportunities intrinsic to its expertise, its in-depth understanding of the energy scene and the timely
        monitoring of the changes that animate it, which can give partners the competitive advantage of
        predicting the crucial business trends of tomorrow.
        terna presented its offer with a focus on projects concerning the construction or renewal of
        transmission infrastructures; on grid construction and management in countries experiencing
        economic growth; on technical consultancy services for public, private and institutional customers;
        and storage systems and smart solutions.
        the day was marked by much interaction and continued with working panels on specific subjects
        and concluded with a customer expectations and satisfaction questionnaire being compiled.




     business partners

     for terna, the relationship with these stakeholders represents a chance to promote its regulated business
     or develop new non-regulated business activities. they have operational or strategic influence, depending
     on how relevant the partnership is for the business. they, in turn, are influenced by terna in economic and/
     or operational terms.
     the tools available for solidifying these relationships include partnership agreements, protocols, meetings
     for specific projects and structured collaborations.
     during 2016 terna signed important agreements and memorandum of understandings for non-regulated
     activities with leading italian and foreign innovation-oriented companies.

                                                                                          relations with stakeholders   75



specifically, in may 2016 a three-year collaboration agreement was signed with tesla motors to develop
cutting-edge projects on the integration between electric cars and the transmission grid.
the second half of 2016 saw cooperation agreements formed with rfi and eni to identify and implement
initiatives of common interest related to projects that aim to develop sustainable energy systems and
support renewable energy production.
lastly – with reference to the smart island project, which includes interventions for the integration of
renewable generation plants with advanced systems to manage the electricity grid on the smaller islands
– in 2016 collaboration agreements were signed with the municipality of pantelleria and vento di venezia,
a company that is pursuing the requalification of the island of certosa in partnership with the municipality
of venice.



 terna-guardia di finanza agreement on “grid security”

   terna strengthens its commitment to promoting legality, security and environmental protection via a
   new agreement with the italian finance police, which reinforces and extends the agreement signed
   in 2009, introducing “grid security”, a joint programme based on new integrated security solutions.
   the agreement – signed by terna ceo, matteo del fante and general commander of the guardia
   di finanza, giorgio toschi, in the presence of chairwoman catia bastioli and the director of the
   corporate affairs division, giuseppe lasco – involves the use of innovative software able to correlate
   and process thousands of pieces of data related to tenders, procedures to award work, employee
   training, management of production materials and the processing of waste.
   with “grid security”, the prevention of the risk of criminal infiltration into the economic fabric and
   legality in the creation of electrical infrastructures is further strengthened.
   in addition to sharing the data collected in its 10 individual databases with the italian finance police
   (gdf), terna also created the “gdf terna construction sites: contracts and subcontract” portal,
   a tool to be used exclusively by the finance police, which allows departments of the corps to
   access information flows that are of the utmost importance for acquiring information on investigated
   activities within italy.
   the agreement also includes the launch of training courses by the italian finance police to consolidate
   the awareness and competencies of terna employees in all areas of the fight against corruption.

terna has adopted a policy which provides for the payment of dividends twice a year. the 2016 dividend
advance payment was € 0.0721 (payment on 23/11/2016), while the balance proposed by the board
of directors to the shareholders' meeting on 27/4/20017 was € 0.1339. further information on share
performance and dividend trends can be found on the site (www.terna.it/default/home/investor_
relations.aspx).
in 2016 the return on risk capital was € 414,058,352, 29.9% of the value added. a breakdown of the value
added during the year is available in the “key indicator tables” on page 197.




lenders

these are the parties (generally banks and institutional investors) that help to procure the debt capital
required by the company through their business activities or their relevant institutional role. terna
maintains a continuous relationship with these parties through many opportunities for discussion (around
100 throughout the year) concerning issues of potential business interest, including possible financing
strategies.
in addition, terna meets with s&p’s, fitch and moody’s every year, the rating agencies that assess terna’s
credit rating, especially in occasion of the industrial plan presentation. other opportunities for discussion
with these agencies are also provided for during the year, in order to share the calculation of the ratios that
the company’s financial profile evaluation is based on.
in 2016 borrowed capital remuneration was € 105,508,004 amounting to 7.6% of value added. a breakdown
of the value added during the year is available in the “key indicator tables” on page 197.




public decision-makers and authorities

these are the public institutions that hold legislative, control and authorisation powers generally, and for
the construction of infrastructural works in particular. they have influence over terna and interact with the
company to carry out their institutional duties. this category also includes organisations that influence
public decision-makers and thus terna, albeit indirectly (e.g. international organisations).



participation in industry associations
another opportunity for interaction and discussion in order to contribute to the general improvement of
the electricity industry and its regulations and technical standards is provided by terna’s participation in
the work of entso-e and institutions.

      entso-e                     since its inception, terna has taken on a coordinating role within entso-e,
                                  the european association of grid operators committed to the process of
                                  integrating and coordinating electricity grids being implemented under the
                                  third eu energy package. terna’s chief executive officer has been the
                                  entso-e vice president since 2015. for details concerning terna’s activity
                                  within the entso-e in 2016, see the specific box on page 114.


      european                    during the year, terna consolidated its relationships with european
      institutions                institutions (european commission, parliament foremost), contributing to
                                  defining italy’s position in relation to the issues that were of interest to
                                  terna.
                                  in the context of the “clean energy for all europeans” package, the following
                                  are of note: the legislative proposals on “market design”, the revision of
                                  the directive on renewable sources and the security of procurements,
                                  the interconnection targets for 2020 (10%) and 2030 (15%) and the new
                                  european neighbourhood policy.
                                  priority was also given to preparing the list of projects of common interest
                                  (pci) for the electricity and gas sectors and the area of smart grids, in
                                  implementing eu regulation no. 347/2013, with the aim of ensuring that
                                  terna projects are eligible for the funding provided by the cef programme
                                  (connecting europe facility).
                                  the third list of pci – the evolution of the second list adopted at 18
                                  november 2015 – is being defined by the european commission. as far
                                  as italy is concerned, the 2015 list contains the following projects: the
                                  italy-france piossasco grande ile (savoia–piedmont) interconnection,
                                  the italy-switzerland (airolo–baggio) interconnection, the italy–austria
                                  (veneto-lienz) interconnection, the italy–montenegro (villanova-lastva)
                                  interconnection and the italy–slovenia (salgareda-divaca) interconnection.
                                  furthermore, the “smart grid greenme” project between france and
                                  italy and the italy–austria (somplago wulmak) and the italy–switzerland
                                  (verderio sils) merchant interconnections were considered to be projects
                                  of common interest.
                                  with reference to the energy corridors in which italy lies (“north–south
                                  electricity interconnections in western europe” – nsi west electricity
                                  corridor and “north-south electricity interconnections in central-eastern
                                  and southern-eastern europe” – nsi east electricity corridor), terna is
                                  progressing the activities for its projects to be inserted in the third pci list,
                                  expected for 2017, where development of the grid and interconnections
                                  with other countries should be confirmed.
                                  in this regard, the cooperation framework initiated by the european
                                  commission at the start of 2016 with entso-e is extremely important to
                                  ensure the right synergies between the preparation of the development
                                  plan for the european electricity grid published in 2016 (2016 tyndp)
                                  which identifies the priority development requirements for the european
                                  transmission system and the drafting of a third list of projects of common
                                  interest.

                                                                                        relations with stakeholders   79



main activities 2016
the ministry of economic development (med) is terna’s main point of contact for activities covered by
the licence.
at october 2016, terna registered with the transparency register, established at the med on the initiative
of the same in order to guarantee the transparency and traceability of meetings at its offices.
registering on the register entails adherence and compliance with the behavioural rules provided for by
the code of conduct published by the ministry of economic development.
in reference to parliament, in addition to institutional relations and information activities, as part of the
hearings held in june 2016 a memorandum on the european parliament and council regulation proposal
was submitted to the chamber of deputies regarding measures aimed at guaranteeing the security of gas
supply.
during the year, also through associations, terna took part in consultations on issues of environmental
interest, on the reform of the contracts code and on the reform of the public administration with particular
attention on proposals aimed at improving the efficiency of administrative procedures.




media and opinion-makers

these are stakeholders who hold a mediation role between terna and other stakeholders.
the media indirectly influences the public in general, as well as public decision-makers and authorities.
it can directly impact terna’s reputation or indirectly affect the operational and business environment, as
well as energy policy decisions.
the relationship formats adopted by terna include: communication activities during company, industry
and development events, security and sustainability activities, as well as the presentation and distribution
of the sustainability report and the strategic plan, the organisation of information sessions across italy,
dedicated email boxes and social network profiles.
in 2016 media communication work accompanied the transition that is taking place in the energy sector,
mainly aiming to support the importance of electrical infrastructures as an enabling factor in the change
that is under way. terna has contacts with over 300 media professionals within italy and abroad. this
crucial transition phase is also cultural and has resulted in the modification of communication activities,
which are now increasingly focused on interventions of greater relevance and across a broader range of
media (tv, radio, print and web). moreover, it has made a different approach necessary, supported by
the planning and preparation of increasingly accurate content and in-depth analysis, which led to the
publication of 522 stories and articles focused on terna, ad hoc videos and articles/interviews dedicated
to top management. 116 press releases were issued in italy (+41% v 2015) and 79 regional memos;
54 presentations and speeches were prepared for top management and 78 events were created and
managed (including corporate and territorial events, national and international workshops, stands and
internal events), 29 of which received media coverage. overall, terna has totalled over 17,000 releases
across traditional media (newspapers, magazines, radio and tv) and online media, due to over 3,000
instances of direct contact by the press office with the press.
the corporate site www.terna.it has totalled over 3,800,000 page views and 1,700,000 visits (+40%
compared to 2015) and was ranked within webranking italia’s top ten of 100 of the largest listed companies.
in 2016, a new homepage for the site was published online which, having undergone a visual overhaul,
doubled the communication space for the various stakeholders and became an important information hub
that enhances the company in its unique position as transmission system operator.
the presence and involvement of stakeholders on the company’s social channels rose sharply, with
significant employee engagement. at the end of 2016 the facebook profile had 7,238 fans (+40% compared
to 2015), twitter 3,020 followers (+56%) and linkedin 25,400 followers (+ 33%).

       ipsos “in-press” 2016 survey

        terna’s external communication in 2016 was analysed by the ipsos in-press survey, qualitative-
        quantitative press research that aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of the communication strategies
        of the main italian companies and their relations with the media. the survey was conducted on the
        basis of 92 telephone interviews with journalists from 60 publications (national and local), 20 news
        agencies, 4 news broadcasts and 8 communication companies.
        a very positive image of terna emerges from the analysis, conducted on 41 companies, which
        stands out from the infrastructural companies as a solid and efficient company with a clear vision
        for the future and high-level management.
        the press office was also assessed as being extremely positive: indeed, it achieved the best result
        in the infrastructural sector and was amongst the top three in the energy industry. terna is the top
        company in the infrastructural sector in terms of speed and precision when providing information to
        the press and for availability and openness towards journalists, as well as being one of the best in
        terms of the competence and professionalism of its press office. these are all relevant aspects for
        the press, which recognises - thanks to the transparency and continual flow of communication with
        the press office team - terna’s new work approach with initiatives that focus on the sustainability
        and sharing of projects with local communities and the surrounding area, as well as protection of the
        law, workers and the growth of its resources.



     during 2016 terna signed an agreement with ensiel - the consortium of italian universities operating in
     the area of energy and power systems (consorzio interuniversitario nazionale per energia e sistemi elettrici)
     - to identify and conduct scientific research into electricity transmission and management, involving the
     associated universities. thanks to this collaboration with ensiel, terna has also joined the work panel
     promoted by enea - the italian national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic
     development (agenzia nazionale per le nuove tecnologie, l’energia e lo sviluppo economico sostenibile) in
     order to take part in the tender for new technological clusters published in august 2016 by miur (ministry
     of education).

                                                                                      relations with stakeholders   81



participation in associations
a further opportunity for dialogue and comparison is provided by terna’s membership in international
and national corporate social responsibility associations, in order to spread a sustainability culture, and
to promote its experience with a view to sharing best practices. in particular, terna actively supports the
following organisations:

                             programme (2011-2013), terna is now part of the business network, which
                             works with various companies and organisations at the global level to
                             exchange experiences and best practices.

       terna with legambiente, wwf and greenpeace for the environmental
       sustainability of the ntg

        terna’s commitment to increasingly improving the environmental sustainability of the national
        transmission grid starting with its development plan has been strengthened with the signing of the
        new memorandum of understandings with legambiente, wwf and greenpeace.
        terna and the environmental associations will collaborate fully: at the strategic level when drafting
        the national electricity grid development plan, at a structural level in preparing the strategic
        environmental assessment and at an implementation level when consulting with the community to
        identify the most compatible location choices.
        more specifically, when drafting the terna development plan, legambiente, wwf and greenpeace
        will contribute to the assessment of future energy scenarios in relation to national and european
        environmental targets for the energy scenario in 2030 and 2050, in italy and europe, in line with the
        agreements signed in paris in december 2015 (cop21).
        within the strategic environmental assessment (sea), the expected contribution concerns
        analysing the socio-environmental context of areas affected by the interventions provided for in the
        development plan and identifying the environmental corridors related to the works to be carried out.
        lastly, in regards to the design of the works and dialogue with the community, the organisations
        will cooperate in identifying the route feasibility bands for the sections of the electricity lines and
        the environmental content for consultation with local authorities, so as to minimise interference
        with priority natural areas, and mitigate the impact arising from development work disrupting or
        bordering on priority natural areas and implementing environmental rehabilitation measures.

                                                                                          relations with stakeholders   83



local communities                                                                                                        g4-so1


these include various kinds of stakeholders affected by terna’s activity in the community during all stages
of the business, from development to grid maintenance. the identified parties include subjects that are
directly or indirectly impacted, as well as subjects with the power to influence local opinion-makers,
politics and decisions.
terna’s approach to local areas, which is especially important when new lines are being constructed,
consists of a voluntary process of prior engagement with local institutions (regional and local administrations,
park authorities, etc.) and, in the last few years, the citizens of local communities directly affected by the
work. this process involves the sharing of ntg development needs with local institutions, a willingness
to listen to stakeholder opinions and the search for a shared solution regarding the positioning of new
infrastructure or the reorganisation of existing structures.
in this way, the conditions are created in which to develop and “build” the grid together, thus making it
more sustainable and acceptable.
terna's engagement with local areas envisages a voluntary pre-authorisation procedure illustrated in
detail in the section on consultation, on pages 84.
during 2016, terna held a total of 181 meetings with local administrations, involving around 270 bodies.
terna has also held 7 public events, described in the box below, involving more than 200 citizens and has
strengthened its commitment to communication in local areas.


 “terna meets” local citizens

   consistent with the approach it took to discussion and sharing with local areas, terna developed a
   new stakeholder engagement tool for citizens. drawing from a european regulation (347/2013) on the
   interoperability of trans-european energy networks, terna chose to engage the citizens who live in
   the areas which are destined to be the sites of the main ntg development works.
   before beginning the authorisation procedure for its works, terna organises public meetings, referred
   to as “terna meets” in order to meet the local communities and explain the need to develop the grid
   which necessitated the work, explaining the implementation methods, as well as alternatives that
   had been identified and, above all, making itself available to receive comments and clarification
   requests. thus terna extended the direct engagement approach that it had already adopted with
   public administrations to individual citizens. the details of the “terna meets” held throughout the
   year can be found in the table below.

           a responsible approach to grid development: consultation

g4-en27    since 2002 terna has chosen to voluntarily bring discussions with local stakeholders forward to the
           project planning stage (for power lines and electrical substations) within its development plan to improve
           the quality of the relationship with public administrations which, in this way, are involved in sharing the
           electricity grid development needs and can work alongside terna to find sustainable solutions which
           accommodate those needs.
           the aim of this method is the optimal localisation of new installations: terna and the public authorities
           find shared solutions, in terms of local corridors, based on area criteria (known as “erpa criteria”) and
           ratified in specific agreements. through constant discussion with local stakeholders, considerations
           concerning the environment and the local area are thereby integrated into the electricity grid planning
           process.
           this approach preceding involvement which would subsequently be outlined by the strategic
           environmental assessment (sea), subject to an ec directive (2001/42/ec), which was transposed into
           italian law only many years later (in 2007 with italian legislative decree 152/2006) and with much less
           detailed implications at the level of relations with local institutions. further information on sea is available
           in the “electric system” section of the website.
           in addition to dialogue with local institutions, in 2015 terna increasingly made use of another mode of
           dialogue and discussion with citizens directly affected by the move to new infrastructures: “terna meets”,
           public meetings during which the company describes the requirements for developing the grid that led to
           the need for work, explaining the implementation methods, as well as alternatives that had been identified
           and, above all, gathering comments and clarification requests and providing immediate feedback.




           area criteria
           agreement on location criteria is the instrument used for selecting local corridors with least impact.
           these criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser degree of suitability of an area to host new electrical
           infrastructure.
           terna and the regions have agreed on a system of criteria (erpa), based on four classes, to be adopted
           when locating new electrical works:

               •    exclusion: areas in which all construction is excluded. currently, the exclusion criterion includes
                    areas recognised by law as areas of absolute exclusion (such as airports and military zones) and
                    areas which are not directly excluded by law but which are constrained by a priori agreements
                    between terna and the entities involved
               •    repulsion: areas that can be considered only in the absence of more environmentally compatible
                    alternatives
               •    problematic: areas in which passing is problematic for an objective reason associated with
                    specific features of the area and documented by the authorities involved, which therefore require
                    further analysis
               •    attraction: areas with good landscape compatibility and areas that already host line infrastructure
                    such as energy corridors, in which it would be more sustainable to position a new line with respect
                    to new areas that do not have any line infrastructure

           the support of gis (geographic information system) technology is fundamental when searching for
           sustainable locations (corridors) for ntg development projects. this technology allows comprehensive
           consideration of all information relating to the different types of land use and protection obligations
           (territorial, naturalistic, cultural, landscape, etc.), in order identify possible locations which are the most
           compatible with the area concerned.

                                                                                           relations with stakeholders   85



landowners affected by ntg development                                                                                        eu22

the construction of new power lines involves the use of between approximately 30 and 250 square meters                    g4-so2
of land – usually agricultural – for each pylon.
although terna is authorised by law to use an expropriation procedure (italian law no. 1775 of 1933 and
presidential decree 327/2001, the “consolidated law on expropriations”) to obtain land, terna prefers
solutions based on mutual consent, paying one-off compensation for the right of way of the line through
private property. the pursuit of a consensual solution only fails in a minority of cases, making coercive
measures necessary.

when terna constructs a substation which occupies much more land, terna normally purchases the
necessary land.



management of opposition to the construction of new electricity infrastructure
terna considers respect for the environment and for the territory an integral part of grid planning and makes
every effort to act in agreement with the local citizens and institutions. however, new infrastructure-creation
projects often provoke adverse reactions attributable to the nimby (not in my backyard) syndrome. in
these cases, terna is willing to examine the situation and find alternative solutions, including ones which
are technically more complex than those originally identified, provided that they are compatible with the
general interest of the electricity service in terms of security, efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
searching for agreed solutions requires difficult discussions and can be a drawn-out process. the results
are normally positive, but local opposition may persist throughout. please note, in particular, the following
cases from 2016:

   •   rationalisation in the middle piave valley. the project was authorised in february 2011 and is
       now in the environmental-impact assessment phase. some municipalities, including belluno and
       soverzene, were opposed to the route identified by terna. in response to this opposition from local
       bodies, terna proposed an alternative project in august 2015.
       in 2016, dialogue continued with local bodies and the local area, also due to the organisation of
       four meetings with citizens, two in auronzo di cadore (in november 2016 and january 2017) and
       two in cortina d’ampezzo (in november 2016 and in january 2017).
   •   rearrangement of the 380 and 132 kv grid in the lucca area. the project was authorised in
       january 2014 for the construction of a new electrical substation, a new line and the demolition of
       other obsolete plants. initially coordinated with the municipalities involved, the project was later
       rejected by them as a result of protests by the local population. terna then prepared four alternative
       solutions and presented them to the local population during an open day held on 28 january 2016
       at nozzano castello, near lucca.

86   2016 sustainability report




              in 2016, dialogue continued with the bodies involved: we are awaiting the decision of the mattm
              (ministry of the environment and protection of land and sea) concerning the proposed locations
              presented by terna.
         •    italy – switzerland interconnector. the project was authorised in 2012. from the very beginning
              the work was marked by several committees opposed to its construction, which organised
              various demonstrations and events. in response to these terna planned two open days: the first
              in magenta, (the town where an electricity substation connected to the main work will be built)
              in october 2015, the second in settimo milanese at the end of 2015, where terna presented
              citizens with two alternative proposals. in january 2016, terna met with the wwf, legambiente
              and fai and – separately – the parco agricolo sud milano (the south milan agricultural park), the
              municipality of settimo and the region in order to present the possible alternative locations for the
              settimo milanese electrical substation. in 2016, following on from many requests for amendments
              to the project, technical meetings were held for participatory planning with the municipalities of the
              piedmont region and, following on from the shared agreements with the same, in december 2016
              the updated documentation was submitted to the mattm.
         •    italy-france interconnection. the project was authorised in 2011. the project is encountering
              opposition from the notav movement that is active in the val di susa and difficulty in conducting
              geological surveys, which were completed with the help of digos. note that there is also strong
              opposition on the french side with violent demonstrations and blocking of sites occurring. at
              16 december 2016, a meeting was organised in the municipality of trana with the citizens of val
              sangone.
         •    sorgente – rizziconi. when the construction sites opened (2011), protests – the work of local
              committees – broke out in the messina area against the new power line under construction, despite
              the fact that the route was fully authorised, thanks in no small part to the two years of technical and
              environmental studies and intense consultation and dialogue with local communities, which lead to
              over 100 meetings being held starting in 2004. from february to july 2015, the prosecutor’s office
              of messina sequestered pylon no. 40 in the municipality of saponara, for presumed breach of the
              provincial landscape protection plan, which was approved after landscape authorisation for the
              work. from january to march 2016, the same prosecutor’s office of messina sequestered pylon
              no. 45 in the municipality of villafranca, which was also released. the power line lawfully entered
              into operation in may 2016 (see page 106).
         •    lucana power line. the work was authorised by the basilicata region in march 2013 and
              released to terna in july 2014. terna obtained an insubstantial variant in october 2016 to resolve
              interference encountered with wind generators, photovoltaic plants and a water tank. the site was
              opened in november 2016 and it was only after this that objections were received from the citizens
              of the municipalities involved and a protest committee was established. in december 2016, terna
              organised an open day at the municipality of oppido lucano to discuss with the local community.




     the wider community

     this represents the end users of the electrical service. meeting their expectations concerning the electrical
     service is an important area of commitment for terna. these are the stakeholders who are impacted as
     users of the electrical service and who do not have the opportunity to influence as individuals. future users
     of the service are also included within this category, as they will be impacted in the long-term by terna’s
     current activities.
     in 2016, the research and market analysis company doxa carried out the "doxa reputation italy 2016"
     survey, relative to the reputation of 150 brands operating in italy. in the energy&utilities sector, terna was
     ranked second in terms of reputation. the company has an extremely positive image: it is first place relative
     to solidity and staff competence, and is also recognised for the important role it performs in the country's
     economy and the positive influence it has on the social context in which it operates.

                                                                                                                          relations with stakeholders      87



the cost of transmission on the end user’s bill
based on the data released by aeegsi, it can be estimated tat the weight of the transmission service cost
on a typical domestic user's11 electricity bill is equal to around 4%12.
from a european commission study relative to 2015 data13, it appears that - in both the residential and
industrial segments - "network costs"14 sustained by italian consumers are in line with the european
average. in particular, in relation to only the transmission segment, the italian tariffs were the lowest with
respect to some of the countries best representing the sample analysed, as shown in the charts presented
below (terna analysis).

economic effects for the wider community                                                                                                                    g4-ec8

terna ensures that a service of general interest which generates economic returns and contributes to the
country’s economic growth is provided over time.
the company’s grid development work is of particular importance. developing interconnections
with bordering countries makes it possible to import electricity at more competitive prices compared to
domestic production, as well as to have an additional power reserve and guarantee greater competition
within the energy markets. reducing grid congestion improves the use of generation resources in order
to meet demand and makes it possible to use the most competitive plants, with positive effects on
competition within the generation sector and on end prices.
in accordance with the legal and regulatory framework, all of terna’s investments in grid development are
examined from a technical and economic perspective, by comparing the estimated cost of the work with
the related benefits in terms of the reduction of the overall system expense, in order to maximise the cost/
benefit ratio. consequently, every euro invested by terna on average generates multiple savings for the
users of the grid which are ultimately passed on to the end consumer. it is therefore significant that terna’s
investment (most of which is to develop the grid) has increased greatly over the last few years.

          the above table shows the terna group’s total investments in 2016, equal to € 854.3 million, of which €
          798.5 million are related to investments in regulated activities, i.e. remunerated by the aeegsi.
          in 2016 public administration remuneration amounted to € 320,643,092. a breakdown of the value added
          during the year is available in the “key indicator tables” on page 197.
          relative to the public grants received, we note that with reference to projects financed by the ministry
          of economic development, following the definitive decree and on the basis of expenses recognised and
          allowable for the loan, € 4,179,007.81 was returned to the ministry in 2016.
          additionally, the european commission agreed to provide a contribution to terna s.p.a. for the completion
          of the “sorgente-rizziconi” connection project, in an amount not to exceed 21.79% of the allowable cost
          and in any case for an amount not to exceed € 110,000,000, for which during 2016 the parent company

g4-ec1    community initiatives
g4-ec7    in keeping with the desire to contribute to italy’s civil growth beyond its infrastructural role, terna again in
          2016 confirmed its support for social, cultural and environmental initiatives.
          terna’s corporate giving work consists mainly in providing financial support to projects with social goals
          and – preferably – in organising terna’s own initiatives for the benefit of the community. in addition,
          corporate assets which are no longer useful in the production cycle are donated and support is provided
          in the form of working time devoted to various initiatives by terna’s employees. in particular, this includes
          paid hours used for volunteering or in social projects organised directly by terna, which in 2016 included
          the next energy programme. each single corporate giving request is managed in keeping with the
          group’s “corporate giving policy” and assessed by a specific commission made up of the security and
          services, external relations and csr, and human resource and organisation directors.
g4-so6    in all cases, as established by terna’s code of ethics, contributions are never made to political parties or
          their representatives.
          as outlined in the “participation in associations” section above, terna is a member of the london
          benchmarking group (lbg) and has adopted an lbg model – developing a customised variation of it – for
          defining, classifying and booking company charitable initiatives. the model is oriented to accounting for
          what is done by companies through initiatives that generate real external benefits; such initiatives may
          involve contributions in cash (gifts, portion of sponsorships that translates into a real benefit, membership
          of associations that promote csr), in kind (e.g. transfer of corporate property at the end of its useful
          life) and working time. accounting for contributions requires, in some cases, recourse to non-accounting
          criteria and is therefore subject to interpretation. however, it also has the advantage of correlating the
          costs and benefits of the charitable initiatives in a coherent manner, meaning that corporate giving can be
          strategically planned and rationally managed.

                                                                                                                     relations with stakeholders   89



a significant part of the model consists in measuring the benefits, inspired by measurement criteria of the
real impact on the final beneficiaries. impact measurement is assigned to external parties for the most
important projects.
in order to provide comprehensive information, we note that in 2016 expenses accounted for as donations
and sponsorships amounted to € 246,100 and € 921,000 respectively.
the following table shows the aggregate community initiatives, classified according to the lbg model,
carried out by terna in 2016.

     support for environmental causes was not included in this table because, as a rule, it is associated with
     the construction of new lines and was therefore classified under environmental expenses (please see the

next energy: the terna initiative for youth employability and entrepre-
neurship

terna has created next energy in partnership with the fondazione cariplo, an initiative that aims
to promote the development of young talent and support innovative projects for the development of
the electricity system.
the strongly innovation-orientated initiative is divided into two distinct pathways. the first is reserved
for 15 engineering graduates, preferably from the electrical engineering field, and the second for 10
teams of young researchers who have a business idea to be developed.
graduates were offered a paid internship lasting six months (october 2016 – march 2017) within the
terna departments responsible for innovation activities. the fondazione cariplo, in keeping with the
mission of its cariplo factory, managed the incubation and acceleration experience of the selected
10 teams through its technical partner, polihub, – the milan polytechnic facility that focuses on start-
up acceleration. this also lasted six months.
the two next energy pathways began at the same time in october 2016 and met regularly with
a view to sharing relative skills and experiences. terna in any case guaranteed a meeting with its
technical departments, to create an open innovation initiative.
the selection of participants took place through two calls, which could be accessed for around
two months on the dedicated website www.nextenergyprogram.it. approximately 200 applications
were received and examined by two separate assessment committees, which – respectively –
selected 15 graduated for the internships and 17 teams of innovators for the “innovation days”
that took place in late september 2016. at the end of this event, the panel, made up equally by
representatives from terna, the fondazione cariplo and polihub, chose the best 10 candidates to
begin the entrepreneurial empowerment course.
for the innovator pathway, the next energy call includes a second assessment, by the end of
april 2017, conducted by the panel in order to award the best 3 candidates with vouchers to be spent
on services in the go-to-market, totalling € 50,000, € 30,000 and € 20,000 respectively.




terna for young people: the launch of the “school-work” project

the terna “school-work” project began in february 2017 at the istituto tecnico galileo galilei in
bolzano. this is one of the 12 schools selected, for a total of 240 students across the whole of
italy, that will be involved in a training course built jointly by teachers and company experts for
professional and soft skills.
this project, implemented by the good school law (italian law 107/15), aims to encourage young
people’s transition to the world of work, fostering a virtuous cycle of exchange between the company
and the external world and supporting their ability to interact at a global level through knowledge
networks.
specifically, the course will involve the fourth years of the schools selected and will be divided
into two modules. the first, the “integrated course on the electricity system and green jobs”,
will take place thanks to the contribution of skills from terna technicians working in the area,
amounting to around 50 hours of lessons (from mid-february to mid-may 2017) on the electricity
system, occupational safety and innovation. the second module, “summer camp”, will be held in
collaboration with elis and will include a selection of students from each school. the objective is
to provide in-depth learning on technical issues that are also inherent to soft skills by developing
project work, workshops and team work aimed also at orientating the future professional choices
of the students.

92   2016 sustainability report




       terna is to take electricity to the peruvian region of ancash

        terna is renewing its social commitment to the poorest and most inaccessible regions in the world
        and has undertaken to create a power line in peru to allow the parish of chacas and the ngo
        operazione mato grosso to significantly increase the availability of electricity, in order to benefit
        development projects within local communities.
        this is terna’s second social initiative in south america: indeed, in 2011 the company completed
        a power line of approximately 37 km, at an altitude of 4,000 metres, in kami, bolivia to transport
        hydroelectric energy that was otherwise unusable.
        this new initiative, formalised in november 2016 with the signing of an agreement with the parish
        of chacas and the ngo operazione mato grosso, provides for the creation of a working group
        made up of terna technicians and external volunteers to design and construct a 16 km power line
        between pomabamba and huari by the end of 2017. terna will see to implementing the technical
        project, following on from authorisation procedures for the work, to construct - also through its
        subsidiary companies that operate in the area - the infrastructure from the power station to the point
        of connection with the line and manage the maintenance for a period of 12 years starting from when
        the line effectively becomes operational.




     inquiries, litigation and penalties


     preliminary inquiries of the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water
     at no time in 2016 did the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water (hereinafter: authority) begin
     any formal preliminary enquiries of potential interest for terna.
     however, with reference to previous years, we note the fact-finding enquiry in relation to interruptions
     in the electrical service that occurred on 6 february 2015 and on the following days in vast areas of the
     emilia-romagna and lombardy regions, which was launched with resolution 96/2015/e/eel. this enquiry
     was closed with resolution 644/2015/e/eel, through which the authority approved the “final report”
     and provided for certain stipulations regarding some distribution companies involved in the fact-finding
     enquiry.
     the authority ordered the closure of the enquiry with resolution 413/2015/e/eel “closure of the fact-
     finding enquiry related to provision of the electricity measurement service” which aimed to verify the
     application of the authority’s provisions concerning electricity measurement, launched with resolution
     475/2013/e/eel”. we also note the following procedures which are still pending.

     resolution 450/2013/e/eel of 11 october 2013 – determination of electricity price trends in sicily during
     the maintenance period on the sicily-mainland interconnection in october 2013.
     with this provision, the authority extended the fact-finding investigation launched in 2012 (resolution
     401/2012/r/eel) on critical issues in managing the electricity system to include sardinia as well as sicily.
     this has been done in order to acquire further information on management of the sicilian electrical system
     and the conduct of operators. the deadline for conclusion of both investigations has been extended to 31
     march 2014. the closure measure of this fact-finding enquiry has not been implemented.

     resolution 256/2014/e/com at 6 june 2014 – launch of a fact-finding enquiry on investments of regulated
     companies
     with this provision the authority enabled the launch of a fact-finding enquiry on regulated-business
     investment, intended to verify the correctness of the information disclosed to the authority and to provide

                                                                                         relations with stakeholders   93



useful elements for the evaluation of the appropriateness and consistency of investments in relation
to the industry context. within the framework of this survey, the authority intends to prioritise further
investigation into the information submitted to determine electricity distribution reference tariffs.
with resolution 412/2015/e/eel of 6 august 2015 the authority also extended the fact-finding inquiry
on investments of regulated companies to the costs of grid plants for connection made by electricity
producers.
lastly, following the evidence which emerged from the fact-finding enquiry, a series of disciplinary
proceedings for violating disclosure obligations relating to tariff regulation of electricity distribution were
launched and the enquiry into the investments declared by certain electricity distribution companies was
concluded.



environmental litigation
environmental litigation originates from the installation and operation of electricity plants, and primarily
involves damages which could derive from exposure to electrical and magnetic fields generated by power
lines. the parent company and the subsidiary terna rete italia s.r.l. are involved in various civil and
administrative lawsuits requesting the transfer or change in operations of allegedly harmful power lines,
despite their being installed in full compliance with the applicable legislation (italian law no. 36 of 22
february 2001 and the prime minister’s decree of 8 july 2003). only a very small number of cases include
claims for damages for harm to health caused by electromagnetic fields.
only in a few cases have adverse judgements been issued against the parent company. these have been
appealed and the appeals are still pending, and adverse rulings are considered unlikely.



litigation concerning licensed activities
given that it has been the licensee for transmission and dispatching activities since 1 november 2005, the
parent company is party to a number of cases appealing aeegsi, med and/or terna measures relating
to activities operated under the license. only in cases in which the plaintiffs not only claim defects in the
measures, but also allege that terna violated the rules established by such authorities, or in cases in
which the measure had an impact on terna, has the company appeared in court. within the scope of this
litigation, although a number of cases have seen the aeegsi resolutions struck down in the first and/
or second-level court, together with, where applicable, the consequent measures adopted by terna, it is
felt that there is little risk of adverse outcomes for terna, since the matters generally regard pass-through
items. this position is supported by the information provided by the external legal counsel representing
the company in the cases involved. as the licensee for transmission and dispatching activities, the
measures taken by the parent company terna when applying the resolutions adopted by the authority
are sometimes the subject of challenges. in appropriate circumstances, the economic costs of such
challenges may be borne by the authority.



other litigation
in addition, a number of cases relating to urban planning and environmental issues connected with
constructing and operating certain transmission lines are pending. the possible effects of any unfavourable
outcome to these cases are unpredictable and, accordingly, have not been considered when determining
the “provisions for disputes and other contingencies”.
in a limited number of cases, the possibility of an adverse outcome cannot be entirely ruled out. the possible
consequences could, in addition to the award of damages, include, inter alia, the costs of modifying lines
and the temporary suspension of their use. examination of the above legal disputes, having regard for the

      94   2016 sustainability report




           information provided by the external legal consultants, suggests that the likelihood of adverse outcomes is
           remote, with the exception of a number of proceedings for which, considering their status, it is not possible
           at the moment to carry out reliable assessments of their outcome.
           more details on the different categories of dispute are shown in the indicator tables on page 197.

           for terna, management of relations with the main stakeholders also involves the preparation of dedicated
g4-hr12    communication channels to gather information requests, suggestions, notifications and complaints of
           various types.
g4-so11
           the easiest and most accessible tool is e-mail, with a number of issue-specific addresses (e.g. info@
           terna.it, csr@terna.it, etc.). promotion of this tool is done through the institutional site www.terna.it and, in
           the case of employees, also through the intranet.
           on the homepage menu, through the “contacts” section, a number of questions guide users who want
           to contact terna. this page also gives the certified e-mail accounts for all communication that requires
           this feature.
           for electricity operators and suppliers, terna has three separate portals (gaudì, myterna and the
           procurement portal), as well as a dedicated call centre, which can be reached through a toll-free number
           (800-999333).
           from the website homepage it is also possible to access terna’s social media profiles on facebook,
           twitter and linkedin particularly, which represent a growing opportunity for interaction for the company.
           in 2016 the facebook profile totalled 3,886,230 views and 41,981 interactions (clicks, shares and likes), an
           increase of 81% and 24% compared to 2015; twitter 179,164 views (+39%) and 1,205 interactions (+10%);
           linkedin 1,418,631 views (+132%) and 12,881 interactions (+194%).
           during the year, the facebook page private mailbox folder received 45% more messages (photos
           sent, support requests for cv submissions, suggestions and notifications, information requests and
           collaboration proposals) with a private response rate by terna of 85.4%.
           these tools are also supported by dedicated reporting tools and mechanisms for ethical and environmental
           issues (see the sections below).


           code of ethics clarifications and reporting violations
           terna employees who require clarifications or want to report an issue can contact the ethics committee
           or the audit unit. these structures are also responsible for handling any reports of violations of the
           code by external stakeholders. contact information (addresses, e-mail, and telephone numbers) can
           be found and are kept up to date on the intranet and website. specifically: comitato.etico@terna.it and
           audit.codiceetico@terna.it.
           the ethics committee was created to offer a specific channel for both external and internal stakeholders
           to be used for communications on the code of ethics. this body consists of three members, appointed by
           the chief executive officer, who have the task of:

               •    responding to requests for clarifications regarding the code of ethics
               •    receiving and examining reports of violations
               •    deciding whether to open an investigation regarding the report and providing a response

           on the other hand, the audit unit is terna’s internal audit unit, and is responsible for investigating any
           reports of violations of the code of ethics. reports collected by the ethics committee and the audit unit
           are published on page 196.
           in september 2016, terna published the guideline, valid across all group companies, that defines the
           “whistleblowing policy” for reporting and handling any irregularities of which an employee, consultant,

                                                                                       relations with stakeholders   95



contractor or someone with no direct links to the company (the whistleblower) has become aware of when
performing their own work within the company itself or in other circumstances. by adopting this policy
terna is responding to the instructions given in the corporate governance code for listed companies on
the borsa italiana of the a.n.a.c. and the national anti-corruption plan.
this policy strengthens the internal control tools that terna uses to define the conduct guidelines to be
complied with when conducting its business and to set out the rules that oversee the pursuit of the same.


environmental reports and complaints
in line with the iso 14001 environmental management system, terna monitors and classifies complaints
received regarding significant environmental issues.
any written communication from stakeholders can be presented to a group office or organisational unit
with the aim of reporting that an activity carried out by terna is causing or has caused damage. it is filed
by the office and managed by the relevant operating unit.
complaints received are classified on the basis of the relevant environmental aspects – defined by the
environmental analysis – using the following categories: waste, noise, biodiversity, landscape, electrical
and magnetic fields, lighting, vegetation control, and other.
once again this year, the majority of reports concerned electrical lines and referred to noise emitted
during operation, electromagnetic field measurement requests and the cutting of vegetation along power
line corridors.
terna responds as soon as possible and, in any case, within 30 days of receiving the request, or within
60 days if the size and complexity of the request make it impossible to resolve within the first 30 days.
in this case, terna informs the requesting party of the extension in a timely manner, indicating the reasons
behind it. details of reports received and managed during the last three-year period are published on
page 196.

     continuity and security of the electricity service: our
     approach

     terna’s core business is the provision of electricity transmission and dispatching services in italy. these
     services are in the general interest of society and performed on the basis of a government concession
     which assigns terna the role of national electricity transmission system operator (tso).
     to ensure this service, terna makes use of the capital infrastructure made up of the high-voltage and very-
     high-voltage national transmission grid, the group's main asset.
     the service performed by terna is indispensable for the operation of the entire electricity system and for
     ensuring electricity for everyone. this entails a responsibility towards the entire country, both in terms
     of the everyday operation of the transmission grid and in its medium and long-term operation, which is
     reflected in management objectives.
     these are therefore connected first and foremost to compliance with regulations and meeting the specific
     targets set by the industry regulatory authority (the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water -
     aeegsi). targets of particular relevance include:

         •    service continuity measurements. terna’s performance in this area in recent years has been in line
              with the targets set
         •    grid-development and security goals, set out in the:
              1. security plan for the electricity system in order to plan the investments needed to improve
                  elements which have an impact on the security of the electricity system
              2. development plan, approved every year by the ministry of economic development, which
                  sets forth the construction of new electricity lines and substations necessary to ensure that
                  the country's electricity demands are met, for which the integration of a growing quantity of
                  production from non-programmable renewable sources has taken on particular importance.
                  terna also selects development projects on the condition that the overall financial benefits to
                  the electricity system outweigh the costs

     since 2017, terna has also been called upon to draft a resilience plan, which aims to identify the work
     needed to increase the transmission system capacity in order to guarantee performance for its safe
     operation, even in extreme weather connected to climate change, particularly where sleeves of ice form
     on the lines. the first edition of the plan is currently being drafted.
     terna, as operator of the electricity system, has the task of management of producer registers,
     management of data on inputs and withdrawals for the determination of economic items and preparation
     of italian statistics in the electricity sector. this entails knowledge of confidential sector-operator data,
     and especially those pertaining to electricity producers. terna protects this confidential data using the
     best practices possible to avoid information in its possession being accessed or communicated to
     unauthorised third parties.

                                                                                                             electricity service   99

                                                                                                                                        eu29

each stage of the electricity system – generation, transmission, and distribution – contributes to the
result of ensuring the availability of electricity for society, guaranteeing adequate quality standards and a
number of outages that remain below pre-set thresholds.
terna monitors the continuity of the service provided through different indices, some of which are defined
by the aeegsi (resolution 250/04) and by the terna grid code. the portions of the ntg monitored are
those owned by terna s.p.a. and, from 2012, also those controlled by terna rete italia s.r.l..

these indices are significant for the system as they monitor the frequency and impact of events that have
occurred on the electricity grid attributable to faults or to external factors, such as meteorological events.
over the four-year observation period, no significant variations were recorded, testament to the good
service quality achieved.
we must point out that, at the moment of publication of this report, the figures for the rens indicator for
the year 2016 are not available while awaiting the totals released by the aeegsi.
it must be stressed, finally, that the rens index is relevant for the purposes of the impact on regulated
revenue. in fact, the aeegsi has regulated the quality of the service provided by terna using an incentive/
penalty scheme set out by resolution arg/elt 197/11. it is applicable to the 2012-2015 regulatory period
and relates to the regulated energy not supplied (rens) index referring separately to the grid owned by
terna s.p.a. and that owned by the subsidiary terna rete italia s.r.l. with effect from 2016, the service
quality supplied by terna is regulated by resolution 653/15/r/eel, which applies to the 2016-2023
regulatory period. this resolution assumes one index only, the ntg rens, which includes both the grid
owned by terna s.p.a., as well as the grid of the subsidiary terna rete italia s.r.l. resolution 38/2016/r/
eel recently clarified that the portion of the grid acquired from the fsi group is excluded from the bonus/

the security plan for the electricity system

the security plan for the electricity system, prepared annually by terna and approved by the ministry
of economic development, is the four-year programme of initiatives aimed at preventing and reducing the
consequences of a disservice on the electricity system.
the initiatives aimed at the security of the electricity system involve activities linked to:

   •   operating the grid, strengthening the preventative scheduling of dispatching resources,
       coordinating the management of systems interconnected with neighbouring tsos, improving
       control capacity in real time, arranging defence plans, defining system restarting strategies after
       blackouts and improving the reliability of telecommunication infrastructure to support the defence
       of the electricity grid
   •   physical integrity of the grid, monitoring and protecting the most critical electrical substations
       and guaranteeing the information security of the infrastructures against intrusion attempts,
       unauthorised access and possible cyber attacks

the current structure of the security plan envisages eight different areas for scheduling, control, regulation
and protection, restarting and monitoring of the electricity system, and an area for the secure and optimal
management of renewable sources.
these intervention areas were confirmed in the fourteenth edition of the security plan (2017 security plan),
which covers all the activities carried out during 2016 and those planned for the 2017-2020 period in order
to guarantee the security of the electricity grid.
more specifically, the 2017 plan confirms the needs that emerged in previous years, with particular reference to:

   •   the installation of appropriate equipment to compensate for reactive power focused on
       managing system security, especially in southern italy, within the expected scenarios for the
       operation of the electricity system
   •   the installation of devices to guarantee the security of the electricity system in the case of
       weather events (snow, ice, salt pollution) and the adoption of technological solutions capable of
       preventing the event occurring and allowing the service to recover faster than the provisions set
       forth in resolution 563/15/eel/r concerning resilience
   •   strengthening of telecommunications infrastructure in order to reach electrical substations
       with optical fibre. to this end, an action plan was drawn up which aims to make high-performance
       and reliable connectivity possible at terna-owned plants for services such as remote management,
       remote control, remote protection and monitoring
   •   strengthening physical security systems aimed at creating a centralised, integrated platform for
       managing physical security events at the main electrical substations and supporting it systems

in 2016 investments made in relation to projects provided for in the security plan amounted to
approximately € 45 million.
the fourteenth edition of the security plan for the years 2017-2020 provides for investments of
around € 330 million over the next four-year period.

      information security and cyber security

      the risks that weigh upon the advanced technologies that make up a company's cyber-environment are
      ever greater and continuously evolving, especially if functional to critical infrastructure activities (as in
      the case of terna). in addition to traditional threats to ict projects and those inherent to the plant setting
      (natural or artificial threats), the number, the degree of danger and trends linked to cyber-threats have
      increased sharply, originating in cyberspace and strengthened by the digitalisation process taking place
      in every organisation.
      as interconnections between computers and new communication technologies are increasing, the cyber
      risk is a permanent fixture among the most relevant risks that affect highly-innovative companies.
      for some time now terna has adopted an "information security governance" model based on a
      regulatory framework of policies and procedures, combined with an operating programme coordinated
      by information risk management (irm), under the direction and coordination of the group's ciso (chief
      information security officer), which has allowed us to identify the top cyber risks. the programme takes
      into account all the risk factors to which group ict ecosystem is exposed (organisational, technical and
      technological, physical/environmental, cyber, etc.), including compliance with laws on data processing
      and the fight against cyber crime, and its aim is to counteract their impacts (interruptions to grids or it
      services critical to electricity system operation and/or with potential damage to the ntg, confidentiality
      loss, theft or tampering with sensitive, strategic and confidential information relating to the electricity
      market and/or on third parties held by terna).
      lastly, through the security operation centre (soc), a structured process is implemented which aims
      to quickly identify and contain security incidents, minimising information loss and working to restore any
      involved services. in addition, the soc has responsibility for measuring the risk to which company assets
      and the information contained in them are exposed.

g4-ec7     grid development

           the transmission grid must evolve consistently with developments in the generation and consumption of
           electricity, which grow at uneven rates in different areas of italy and change the flows of electricity in the
           system, thereby causing congestion in the existing grid.
           in recent years the need to integrate a considerable proportion of non-programmable renewable sources
           (nprs) has taken on particular importance.
           in response to these needs, terna prepares a national transmission grid development plan (hereinafter
           dp) every year containing the grid development projects envisaged for the next ten years and the progress
           made on development works planned in previous years.
           every dp is assessed and approved by the ministry of economic development, subject to public
           consultation18, as well as by the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water, and is also subjected
           to evaluation by the grid user consultation committee.
           furthermore, the plan is also subject to the strategic environmental assessment (sea)19 process carried
           out by the ministry of the environment and protection of land and sea in collaboration with the ministry
           for cultural heritage with the purpose of integrating environmental considerations into the process of
           preparing the plan, thus guaranteeing environmental sustainability.

2017 development plan

the 2017 development plan has many new features compared to previous editions, in keeping with the
evolution of the energy context which is distinguished, firstly, by new climate targets arising from the
signing of the paris agreements (cop21) and, secondly, by the altered regulatory context provided for
by the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water (aeegsi), which revised the regulation based
on an output-based system aimed at measuring the benefits obtained from development projects and
identifying more efficient solutions overall, at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact.
the 2017 dp foresees investments totalling € 7.8 billion, thanks to which efficiencies will be achieved for
the electricity system, as well as benefits, such as:

    •    reduction of energy losses of approximately 830 billion kilowatt-hours per year
    •    reduction of congestions for an amount of more than 3,000 mw
    •    greater overall foreign exchange capacity, estimated at more than 5,000 mw
    •    greater power capacity generated by renewable sources of around 4,500 mw

with regard to the benefits in terms of a reduction in co2 emissions, refer to the dedicated paragraph on
page 144.
in 2016, the aeegsi approved new provisions on the methods of drafting the ten-year national transmission
grid development plan20, starting from that of 2017, also requiring terna to consistently update chapter 2 of
the grid code and to prepare a new annex containing the new cost-benefit analysis methodology. when
preparing the 2017 dp, terna:

    •    applied the requirements on the subject of completeness and transparency of information and
         cost-benefit analysis methodology in order to promote the planning of investments according to
         criteria of selectivity and greater usefulness for the electricity system
    •    applied the minimum requisites of the cost-benefit analysis methodology for all grid development
         operations with an investment cost equal to or greater than € 25 million and, in terms of subsequent
         plans, at least for all development operations with an investment cost equal to or greater than € 15
         million, the new cost-benefit analysis provides for an important alignment with criteria and methods
         applied in the entso-e setting, introducing analysis across a greater number of scenarios as well
         as, for the first time, environmental and social benefit indicators
    •    every two years draws up its forecasts on the electricity system development scenarios over a
         period of time of not less than twenty years
    •    stated that it would submit a disclosure on the investment expenditure expected for each of the
         next five years to the authority by 30 april 2017 of each year




main development work in progress

each year, grid development work takes the shape of numerous projects at different stages of the
implementation cycle.

      completed work
      in 2016, terna increased its transformation capacity by about 1,441 mva of power and put
      approximately 94 km of new high-voltage and very-high-voltage lines into operation. for details
      on work which has been completed concerning both projects of primary interest and plants needed to
      implement collection and the use of production from renewable sources in the south of italy, consult the
      development plan summary available in the “electricity service” section of the website www.terna.it.



        in operation, the "sorgente-rizziconi" electricity line, the electrical
        bridge beneath the messina strait

         with the "sorgente-rizziconi" line becoming operational in may 2016, terna strengthened the
         connection between sicily and the italian peninsula, and consequently europe, via the italian high-
         voltage electricity system.
         by also removing the last existing "bottleneck" in the area, terna actually created the conditions
         to remove the price spread between sicily and the rest of italy and made better use of sicilian
         renewable production, above all wind and photovoltaic power, totalling more than 700 mw.
         the project was inaugurated by the italian prime minister, matteo renzi, and attended by president
         of the calabria region, gerardo mario oliverio, aeegsi (regulatory authority for electricity, gas
         and water) chairman, guido bortoni and terna ceo, matteo del fante. it spans a total of 105 km,
         including 38 km of undersea cable – the longest 380 kv alternating current cable in the world – with
         a maximum depth of 376 m and a transfer capacity of up to 1,100 mw.
         the total investment, partly funded by the european union as part of the european energy
         programme for recovery (eepr), exceeded € 700 million and will guarantee savings for the wider
         community of around € 600 million each year.
         the project also positively impacts the environment as it will lead to 700,000 tonnes less co2 in the
         atmosphere and, visually, will free up over 200 hectares thanks to the removal of 114 km of obsolete
         lines. the new 60 km of overhead lines were constructed using single-stem pylons, which are much
         less invasive than the traditional truncated pyramidal pylons.




      progress on construction sites
      the major works that began in 2016, and which are still in progress, aim to reduce grid congestion, connect
      new power plants (particularly those based on renewable sources) and make the national transmission
      grid more reliable, with a greater emphasis on the environment and safety. for details on the status of
      these works, please consult the website www.terna.it.

connecting new plants

terna has an obligation to connect all potential users that request connection to the grid21 based on criteria
that allow for continuity and security in operating the grid to which the new user plant is to be added.
specifically, terna is responsible for connection to the national transmission grid (ntg) at high-voltage
and very-high-voltage for plants with a power of 10 mw or more.
the technical, procedural and economic terms and conditions for supplying the ntg connection
service are regulated by provisions issued by the regulatory authority for electricity, gas and water
(aeegsi). these resolutions are implemented in the grid code, which describes the transparent and non-
discriminatory rules for grid access and its technical regulations.
connection requests managed by terna, which correspond to more than 2,000 active connection requests,
amount to a capacity of over 100 gw. these requests have accumulated over the years, and while terna
has already implemented the actions for which it is responsible during the respective phases of the
connection process, the requests have not yet been completed for various reasons (e.g. authorisations
not yet requested or not yet obtained).
the trend in connection requests has been almost constant over the last three years.
in regard to plants from renewable energy sources (res), there are 1,358 active connection requests,
with a solution on the ntg, for a capacity of 58,381 mw.
the figure below, which summarises these requests by source and geographical distribution, shows:

    •    wind energy takes prime position among renewable sources on the ntg, in view of the continuous
         decline in connection requests from photovoltaic sources
    •    there were more requests for the connection of generation plants from renewable energy in
         southern italy and the islands, which are more favourable in terms of the availability of primary
         sources

plant maintenance

plant maintenance is essential to guarantee service quality and continuity. the main activities carried out
in 2016 on electrical substations and lines are listed below. we can note the new forms of overhead line
monitoring making great use of helicopters.


 maintaining infrastructure

 plant monitoring                •   22,200 periodical technical and surveillance checks on substations
 and inspection                      at different voltage levels
                                 •   inspections with visual checks on around 72,800 km of circuits,
                                     approximately 31,900 km of which were carried out by helicopter
                                     (visual + infra-red), with a total average frequency of around 1.2
                                     inspections per year for each power line
                                 •   instrumental checks on 35,900 km, conducted both from the
                                     ground and using thermal imaging cameras to identify hot spots,
                                     daycor uv cameras to pinpoint the corona effect on insulators
                                     and conductors and climbing pylons with llw (live-line working)
                                     techniques, as well as by helicopters using specific flights with
                                     infra-red detection (with terna staff on board) and lidar surveying
                                     technology to ascertain interferences, with particular reference to
                                     those created by trees


 ordinary                    terna identifies the action to be taken on the basis of indications of
 maintenance                 deterioration coming from the integrated remote-management system, the
                             online sensors and the results obtained from the plant monitoring process,
                             using maintenance and business intelligence (mbi), the expert system
                             which optimises maintenance activities, active since 2005.


 tree cutting                the correct operation of the lines requires continual monitoring of
                             vegetation growth to prevent it getting too close to the energy conductors
 g4-en12                     and causing possible short circuits and line interruption. in 2016, vegetation
                             was cut along approximately 15,400 km of power lines.


 activity with               approximately 1,800 monitoring checks and 1,000 line maintenance
 live-line working           actions with live-line working were carried out.
 (llw)                       these actions, performed with the line in operation, increase the availability
                             of the plants and contribute to improving service quality and continuity.


 extraordinary               in 2016, terna reconstructed 9 km of overhead lines and 8km of underground
 maintenance                 cables, and replaced approximately 2,000 km of energy and guard wires.

      the development of other activities


      progress of private interconnector projects
      italian law 99/2009 ("provisions for the development and internationalisation of businesses, including
      energy companies") introduced the possibility for so-called energy-intensive private companies - that
      is those with high energy consumption (power >10 mw) - to finance interconnecting electricity lines
      constructed by terna. in this way companies can purchase energy abroad at more competitive costs than
      those found in italy.




       project                     2016 progress


       italy - france              the new “italy-france” direct current interconnection, between the nodes of
       interconnector              piossasco and grande ile, will make the french electricity border the most
                                   important for italy, significantly increasing the cross-border interconnection
                                   capacity. 190 km long, the power line will be the longest underground line in
                                   the world with very low impacts on the environment and the territory.
                                   the laying of around 15 km of cables began in march 2016 to connect
                                   the substations of piossasco and avigliana. in regard to the piossasco
                                   substation, geological surveys and basic engineering studies were carried
                                   out and site preparation works were completed.
                                   in july 2016, the ministry of economic development issued the “decree of
                                   exemption for the private line of the interconnection power line” in favour of
                                   the subsidiary, piemonte savoia s.r.l. (pi.sa.). the document was sent to
                                   the european commission for the necessary approval. currently, pi.sa. is
                                   waiting to receive the notification from the med concerning the conclusion
                                   of the extension process.
                                   in august 2016 the competent ministries authorised the alternative location
                                   for the approximately 26 km section of the italy – france electricity connection
                                   between bussoleno and salbertrand.


       italy - montenegro          the project includes the construction of a direct current connection, part
       interconnector              undersea cable and part underground cable, between the substations of
                                   villanova (it) and lastva (me), for a total distance of around 445 km.
                                   the connection is a great opportunity for the italian electricity system with a
                                   view to the developing the interconnection between italy and the balkans. the
                                   connection, for which construction is already under way, includes technical
                                   engineering solutions aimed at substantially reducing environmental impact.
                                   in december the aeegsi issued a positive opinion to the ministry of economic
                                   development for the ten-year exemption concession for the company monita.
                                   with regard to the progress of the project, on the italian side the main buildings
                                   of cepagatti (pe) substation have been built and production on the principle
                                   electromechanical works has been completed. on the montenegro side, civil
                                   engineering works for the kotor substation are under way. at december 2016,
                                   the second cable laying campaign, starting from kotor, was completed.

                                                                                                electricity service   113



authorised interconnector projects
terna has authorised three additional private interconnector projects, which are described below.




 project                     2016 progress


 italy - austria             the italy - austria interconnector (reschenpass project), for which
 interconnector              authorisation procedures are in progress, includes the construction
                             of a new, 220 kv alternating current interconnection line between the
                             substations of nauders (at) and glorenza (it) with an approximately 25 km
                             stretch of underground cables and the necessary adjustment actions on
                             the internal grid. the project will provide an increase in the cross-border
                             interconnection capacity between italy and austria, in accordance with
                             italian law 99/09.


 italy - switzerland         the project includes the development of new transmission lines between
 interconnector              italy and switzerland, partly alternating current and partly direct current.
                             with regard to the first type, a 380 kv connection will be constructed
                             between airolo all’acqua (ch) and the new pallanzeno (it) substation, to
                             which a direct current system will be connected that runs to the 380 kv
                             node in baggio, totalling over 160 km in distance. the project is currently
                             awaiting authorisation in italy and will allow for a significant increase in the
                             interconnection capacity between italy and switzerland to be achieved, in
                             accordance with italian law 99/09.


 italy – slovenia            in order to increase the interconnection capacity between italy and slovenia,
 interconnector              the construction of a new direct current line, to be made partly with undersea
                             cable, between the substations of salgareda (it) and divaca/bericevo (sl) is
                             planned, as well as a few adjustment works on the internal grid in italy and
                             slovenia. the project is currently awaiting authorisation in italy.

         entso-e is the european network of transmission system operators for electricity that is working
         to implement the third eu energy package. it includes 42 transmission system operators from 35
         countries in europe (iceland, macedonia, montenegro, norway, serbia, switzerland and turkey - as
         an observer member - are also members, in addition to 28 eu countries).
         terna ceo matteo del fante has been entso-e deputy chairman since june 2015, with a two-year
         mandate.
         entso-e is based in brussels and acts as the body for obligatory cooperation of all grid operators at
         european level in synergy with the european commission and acer, the agency for the cooperation
         of energy regulators. the main duties of the entso-e include:
             • preparing european network codes
             • adopting the ten-year european network development plan (tyndp)
             • formulating adequacy scenarios, research and development plans and recommendations
                for the technical coordination of transmission systems belonging to countries outside the eu
             • supporting the assimilation of new members into the association and pursuing the extension
                of the european synchronous system
         terna participates in entso-e activities, which are divided into five macro themes (market,
         system operation, system development, research and development, legal and regulatory) and
         coordinated by the general assembly, the association's decision-making body, and the entso-e
         board, with a commitment of more than 80 employees.

                                                                                               electricity service   115




european network codes
the entso-e prepares the european network codes via a consultation process with the reference
stakeholders, which are adopted by the european commission via a supra-national and binding
legislative act: the eu delegated regulations.
to date entso-e has prepared the following european network codes:
    • network code on capacity allocation and congestion management (nc cacm) for
        allocating capacity and managing congestion in the day-ahead and intraday markets
    • system operation guideline - so gl currently pending publication in the official journal of
        the european union, it defines the guidelines for maintaining operational security, frequency
        quality and the efficient use of the interconnected electricity system
    • network code on emergency and restoration – nc e&r concerning emergencies and the
        restoration of the electricity service
    • network code on requirements for generators – nc rfg detailing the requisites for
        connection generation plants. the code became a european regulation in may 2016
    • demand connection code – dcc, adopted as eu regulation no. 2016/1388 i, it sets out the
        requirements for connecting distribution and consumption plants to the grid
    • network code on hvdc connections – nc hvdc, adopted as eu regulation no. 2016/1447,
        it sets out the requirements for connecting high-voltage direct current systems (hvdc) and
        direct current generation systems to the grid
    • electricity balancing guideline – eb gl, it establishes the detailed balancing guidelines for
        electricity. it is currently awaiting approval from the member state committee
    • network code on forward capacity allocation – nc fca, adopted as eu regulation
        2016/1719, it sets out the legislation concerning interzonal capacity allocation in future markets


market transparency and integrity
entso-e manages a centralised platform for the publication of essential data for the electricity
market, implementing eu regulation 543/2013.
lastly, in implementing eu regulation 1227/2009 on integrity and transparency in the electricity
market, entso-e is collaborating with acer in order to construct a european monitoring platform,
aris (acer remit information system), which will be used to identify any potential manipulation of
the electricity markets.


ten-year european network development plan
entso-e defines the non-binding ten-year european network development plan (tyndp) every
two years, in order to plan investment needs for grid development and interconnections in line with
national development plans and taking account of european guidelines for trans-european energy
networks.
the most recent version of the european plan was published in december 2016 (2016 tyndp).
the 2016 tyndp confirms the need to invest € 150 billion to implement the projects included
within it, which are required to reach european energy and interconnection capacity targets. these
investments result in an increase of € 1-2/mwh in the consumer's bill.
the entso-e plan is fundamental in selecting the pci projects to be included in the next european
union list, expected in the autumn of 2017.

      intellectual capital and innovation

      the current phase of energy transition towards more sustainable solutions has a major effect in terms of
      new development opportunities, including on group intellectual capital.
      the consolidated activities of research and the planning of company assets, also implemented by
      interacting with suppliers, as well as conducting timely surveys and analysis on operational experience
      and international benchmarks, have been overtaken by the need to identify optimal solutions and address
      innovation by meeting the growing environmental sustainability needs of the entire electricity system.
      this new scenario is leading to a good portion of production capacity being shifted to renewable energy
      plants.
      in response to this macro trend, the electricity system is adopting a new management approach, though
      targeted experimentation, that is increasingly intelligent and flexible, both at a grid level, thanks to the use
      of efficient and innovative technologies (smart grids, storage systems), as well as at the electricity market
      level, with an unprecedented revolution that will bring about the integration of distributed generation
      resources, storage and demand within the services market in the short term, and the integration of
      national markets at a european level.
      the electricity scenario will gradually have to guarantee increasing integrability and interoperability
      between the electricity grid and other networks (transport, gas, water, etc.) so as to make the italian-
      system and the european-system increasingly cost-effective and eco-sustainable.
      this development will create new opportunities for growth and business for terna, which will hinge on a
      strong upgrade in intellectual capital. in 2016, the group has strongly accelerated the process, both from
      an organisation perspective, as well as a strategic one, which is covered in the paragraphs below.



        codrongianos, european innovation hub

         the terna technological hub was inaugurated in codrongianos (ss), with the italian prime minister
         in attendance, a flagship centre for innovation.
         the site is home to the terna storage lab, the first international energy storage systems project to
         support and protect electricity grids. this is a highly-innovative experimental project, created by
         terna and developed in accordance with the aeegsi, to maximise the exploitation of power from
         renewable sources and to improve the robustness of the high-voltage and very-high-voltage systems.
         with around 12 tested technologies in total across all of its storage sites, terna is in possession of
         the most extensive expertise concerning grid scale energy storage worldwide. in codrongianos,
         where 8 are being tested, terna has already completed the installation and commissioning of the
         first 7.9 mw of storage systems, as provided for by the company in its defence plan for the electricity
         grid. 8 suppliers contributed to this initial project phase: the italian company, fiamm, as well as
         samsung, byd, saft, general electric, toshiba, siemens and gildemeister.
         the codrongianos site also hosts terna's first two synchronous condensers, which have been
         specifically designed to improve the management of renewable sources. these are large machines
         (320 tonnes each) that are connected to the grid and allow for the stability and security of the
         electricity grid in the region to be improved. the development of renewable sources - which are
         intermittent by nature, and thus non-programmable, and create power surges - is of increasing
         interest to the local electricity grid: this can cause difficulty when managing them and regulating
         voltage, especially within poorly connected grids that are not very extensive (as is the case with
         sardinia). the condensers are a viable solution for dealing with these problems: their task involves
         guaranteeing greater regulation capacity and improved operational flexibility, and thus increasing
         grid capability, preventing power surges and, simultaneously, small energy losses, thereby avoiding
         the occurrence of critical situations. in addition to terna, many european and american utility
         companies use this kind of technology to stabilise the electricity grid.

                                                                                                   electricity service   117



programmes and projects for innovation

in line with the rapid evolution of the electricity scenario and the objectives contained within the strategic
plan, the strategy and development department was enhanced further and, in march 2016, it became
the second division within the group (strategy and development division) tasked with analysing the
development of the electricity system, assessing impacts and opportunities for the group, developing
international business and non-regulated activities within italy, coordinating the group's regulated and
non-regulated activities, drafting the development plan of the ntg and the security plan for the national
electricity system, as well as managing relationships with domestic regulatory bodies and authorities.
this new organisational division has also been assigned the task of centralising and coordinating the
innovation of the group in order to guarantee the initiatives' full compliance with the strategic guidelines
of the company's strategic plan.
it was on this basis that the 2017-2021 innovation plan was drafted, with the objective of guiding and
overseeing innovation within the company through the identification of strategic guidelines, project
monitoring and the management of support tools, as described in the box below.



 2017-2021 innovation plan

   the new edition of the innovation plan includes initiatives on the main research and development
   themes, which focus on core activities (now addressed with new perspectives and approaches) and
   decidedly innovative sectors.
   the initiatives are all defined within an innovation framework that is divided into six clusters,
   characterised by the centralised management of the tools to promote and accelerate corporate
   innovation.

       smart island                terna's commitment to the smart island initiatives continued. these were
                                   begun in june 2015 with the agreement to modernise the electricity grid of
                                   the island of giglio. the smart islands projects include the integration of
                                   renewable generation, energy storage systems, electrical vehicles and hi-
                                   tech solutions for managing active demand on the smaller islands.
                                   specifically, in may 2016 a memorandum of understanding was signed
                                   between terna plus s.r.l., the municipality of pantelleria and s.med.e. (the
                                   company that produces and distributes electricity on the island) with the aim
                                   of constructing renewable generation plants and energy storage systems,
                                   increasing energy efficiency, reducing co2 emissions, actively managing
                                   electricity demand and introducing a mobility system with electrical vehicles
                                   and charging stations, thus making the island an example of sustainability
                                   and cutting-edge technology.
                                   in august 2016 terna plus signed an agreement with vento di venezia,
                                   a company that is pursuing the requalification of the island of certosa in
                                   partnership with the municipality of venice, with the objective of making the
                                   island of certosa a smart energy lab. the three-year project is part of a
                                   bigger programme that aims for the environmental and economic recovery,
                                   from a social perspective, of 24 hectares of land on the island of certosa.
                                   intense corporate activity and frequent contact with principle stakeholders
                                   also continued, which allowed for terna's market share to be consolidated.

with next energy terna is opening up to the ideas of 10 teams of inno-
vators

launched in may 2016 with the opening of the online call for applications, next energy, the
programme created by terna and the fondazione cariplo to promote the development of young talent
and support innovative projects for the development of the electricity system (see the specific box on
page 91), is terna's first real "open innovation" initiative.
the programme includes two distinct parts: the first involves a 6-month training course at the company
for 15 engineering graduates, while the second is dedicated to teams of innovators, for whom an
entrepreneurial empowerment course has been designed, also lasting 6 months, overseen by polihub,
the incubator of the milan polytechnic.
the 10 innovative ideas were selected by the next energy panel, chaired by terna chairwoman
catia bastioli, at the end of the "innovation days", the first acceleration session provided to the teams
selected by the project's assessment committee, which was held at the end of september at the
cariplo factory, the physical location of fondazione cariplo, so as to create an environment of open
innovation.
these are the projects that gained access to the acceleration phase:

in april 2017, the panel will examine the progress of the teams and choose 3 winners, who will be
awarded a voucher valuing € 50, 30 and 20 thousand respectively, to be spent on services in the go-
to-market. if an innovative project proves to be of particular interest to terna, the next energy call
includes a pre-emption right that can be exercised within 6 months from the end of the initiative, for
economic exploitation or use, also through the acquisition of property rights, depending on the terms
and conditions to be agreed with the team that owns the project.

      natural capital: our approach

      terna recognises the importance of the right balance between energy requirements and protecting the
      environment and local communities. in carrying out its business, it therefore seeks appropriate solutions to
      ensure italy has the electricity it needs in the most reliable, economical and environmentally sustainable way.
      in terms of impacts on the planet’s natural capital, the most significant impact of terna’s work is a result
      not so much of using natural resources or of emitting pollutants, but rather of soil occupation due to the
      physical presence of power lines and electrical substations, and their interaction with the surrounding
      natural and urban environment.
      the most significant environmental aspects of terna’s work are thus:

          •    soil occupation with the consequent visual impact of substations and lines on the landscape
          •    electric and magnetic fields
          •    the interference of lines with biodiversity, with particular regard to birdlife
          •    greenhouse gas emissions
          •    special waste and its management

      terna has established an environmental policy which describes its commitment to practices which limit
      and reduce its environmental impact, even beyond the limits imposed by law, whenever this does not
      compromise the other general interests that it is obliged to protect. among terna’s main environmental
      commitments, the following should be noted:

          •    in the planning of grid development investments, listening to the needs expressed by stakeholders
               (in particular, local institutions and environmentalist associations) and seeking agreement on
               solutions, through a process of voluntary prior consultation with local institutions (see pages
               84 and 128)
          •    in the construction, management and maintenance of the grid, adopting procedures in accordance,
               where possible, with reducing the environmental impact. terna has adopted an iso 14001:2004
               certified environmental management system which covers 100% of the national transmission
               grid (substations and lines) and offices; since 2013, the environmental management system of
               the company terna crna gora has also been iso 14001:2004 certified (see page 47)
          •    with regard to electromagnetic fields, strict compliance with regulations and close monitoring of
               the development of scientific studies, as well as a contribution to the correct presentation and
               understanding of the phenomenon (see page 131)
          •    with regard to biodiversity, the commitment to limit the impact of the grid – particularly on birdlife
               – with mitigation activities to be identified and finalised, including programmes agreed upon with
               environmental associations (see pages 83 and 132)
          •    with regard to climate change and energy efficiency, a recognition of the importance of the problem
               and a commitment to take action, as far as is operationally possible, to reduce the emission of
               greenhouse gases. specifically, terna’s commitment to energy efficiency was consolidated in 2015
               with the iso 50001:2008 certification of its energy management system (see page 145)
          •    in relations with suppliers, the requirement to gradually adapt to the environmental standards
               adopted by terna (also see page 55)

                                                                                                    environment   127



in organisational terms, these aspects are overseen by several departments, responsible for specific
aspects, which are coordinated by the sustainability steering committee.
this chapter outlines the important environmental aspects related to grid development and the
management of a few specific impacts, such as magnetic and electrical fields, biodiversity, power
consumption, emissions, the use of resources and waste.                                                            g4-en24
in 2016, as in the previous two years, no spills of contaminating liquids were recorded. two significant
accidents occurred to machinery at electrical substations which, however, did not cause any environmental
damage.

the construction of new lines responds to the technical needs of the electricity system – such
as removing congestion and eliminating risks of overload – and to increasing energy production and
consumption, which accompanies the economic growth of specific areas or of the entire country. terna
adds the required new projects to the grid development plan which involves a complex authorisation
process every year.
while grid development caters to society’s general interest, the environmental impact of the construction
of new power lines is instead concentrated on the area affected by the line route. in addition, the population
density of many parts of italy and the artistic-cultural value and landscape of many other parts make
planning more complex and construction more difficult.
as regards existing lines, on the other hand, the need to intervene is usually due to the fact that many of
these lines were built some decades ago. the gradual urbanisation of rural areas and the adoption of new
legal regulations, modifying parameters already in force regarding the interaction between power lines
and the land, mean that changes to portions of the existing grid become necessary.
the environmental actions preceding the coming into operation of grid development investments are
described below.



planning
from the grid development and adjustment planning stage, terna has made use of assessments based on
digital thematic maps, mostly from official sources (regions, river basin authorities, the company audit
system), organised across an extensive database that is constantly updated. interventions with which
terna can reduce the impact of power lines on the environment can be attributed to two categories:

   •   rationalisation: complex work which involves several grid components at the same time,
       consisting of replacing some plants with better systems, eliminating the parts of the grid which
       are of negligible use following new constructions, or adding new grid elements to avoid having to
       upgrade saturated lines.
       given the significance that visual impact on the landscape holds within terna’s environmental
       impacts, the physical removal of power lines is one of the most important effects terna’s business
       has on the environment, also in terms of use of terrain.
       in 2016, 290 km of lines were demolished. this was an exceptional amount, due to the removal of
       over 200 km of obsolete power lines in valtellina, the result of activities begun in previous years.
       net of this removal, demolition involved around 80 km, in line with previous years (around 100 km/
       year). in the 2010-2016 period, 903.8 km of lines were demolished.
       demolitions are defined as overhead lines that have been physically removed (or replaced by cable
       lines) and do not include declassified or enhanced lines.

          •     reclassification, that is converting existing power lines to a higher voltage by installing new
                conductors and pylons in place of the existing ones. this can involve replacing old pylons with
                larger ones, which therefore take up more space. reclassification, compared with constructing a
                new line, has the advantage of generally using pre-existing infrastructural corridors, avoiding
                taking over new land.



      consultation
      since 2002 terna has voluntarily brought forward discussions with local communities to the project
      planning stage of its development plan. the dialogue with local institutions at the consultation stage
      and the strategic environmental assessment (sea) procedure of the development plan and the public
      initiatives for citizens of the local communities that are directly affected by the move to new infrastructures,
      offer indications for mitigating the environmental impact at the design stage (see also page 84).



      design
      the search for the route for the construction of a power line is the most delicate design stage because
      it is the choice of route that can mitigate or affect interferences with the surrounding landscape and
      community.
      therefore, terna researches design solutions that minimise, as far as is possible, soil consumption,
      interference with areas of environmental, natural, landscape and archaeological value, whether urbanised
      or urban development areas, and the sacrifice required by the properties involved. this is with the
      exception of where a route is needed to enable the regular operation and maintenance of the power
      line. during the design stage terna considers problems related to vegetation cutting right from the initial
      stages, adopting methods and tools that aim to reduce interference to a minimum:

          •     optimising the height of pylons and their locations
          •     studying site plans with the aim of using existing roads or routes, reducing the creation of new
                routes, especially in wooded or protected areas

                                                                                                  environment   129



the drafting of the environmental impact study provides detailed indications on the various components
that assist designers in transforming the route into an optimised project.
great attention is paid to minimising visual impact which, where it is not mitigable using precise, suitable
location choices and/or taking advantage of morphology, can make use of the following actions:

   •   choosing pylons with a reduced visual impact. in recent years terna has expanded the available
       alternatives, also turning to new “single-stem” pylons with a low environmental impact (occupying
       10 square metres of ground surface compared to the 150 square metres for truncated pyramidal
       pylons) and to internationally renowned architects to design new pylons that blend in better
       with the landscape. the indication for using these types of pylons are mainly endorsed by park
       authorities or landscape superintendencies. for the construction of new electrical substations,
       similar considerations apply

   •   use of underground cables which eliminates or reduces the visual impact typical of overhead
       stretches of power lines, which are negatively perceived, especially in built-up areas. however,
       burying cables, although appreciated and requested by local institutions, is problematic from a
       technical and economic point of view: underground lines are less reliable over time than overhead
       lines and require more time for repairs in the event of a malfunction. for this reason, they often do
       not ensure adequate security for the electricity system or service continuity. in addition, buried
       cables cause a greater impact in the construction stage – for example, in terms of road traffic – and
       much higher construction costs (from five to ten times the cost of an overhead line).

             construction
             terna manages the environmental impacts of its construction sites via the "management of the environmental
             aspects during plant construction" operating guidelines, in line with the group’s environmental policy and
             current legislations, adopted in february 2016.
             the main changes introduced include:

                 •    the environmental officer, a role which is tasked with overseeing the environmental requirements
                      (contained in the eia decrees and the opinions of environmental bodies) and respecting legal
                      obligations, also in reference to the activities conducted by contractors
                 •    environmental monitoring of the indicators provided by iso 14001, (conducted under the
                      supervision of site assistants) concerning complaints/reports, environmental accidents, waste and
                      the consumption of energy and natural resources

             particular attention has been paid to identifying construction site areas and access routes, which are
             located, where compatible with the technical and planning needs, in areas of less naturalistic value.
eu13         when the project is complete, terna provides for the restoration of the sites involved back to their
             original state. where such areas include natural or semi-natural habitats, specific actions are carried
             out in addition to normal recovery work, which are based on naturalistic engineering techniques that
             aim to create environments that are suitable for plant and/or animal species or communities (habitat
             reconstruction), living native plants that do not require watering or special fertilisation; materials, even
             inert, infrastructures and other measures aiming to create favourable living conditions for animal species
             (https://www.aipin.it/).
             terna’s environmental policies, which are applied also at construction sites, were formulated according
             to the provisions of the applicable environmental laws and the prescriptions of the iso 14001 standard.
             these include aspects such as preventive measures against contaminating aquifers, limiting damage
             to vegetation, managing accidents, minimising air and noise emissions and vehicle use, and correctly
             managing waste and excavated land (see page 149). these aspects are voluntarily improved with additional
             precautionary principles. internal audit campaigns on construction sites allow for any deviations from the
             company’s environmental policies to be monitored.
             additional operating guidelines were adopted in october 2016 that aim to ensure compliance with the
             requirements.



             requirements
             requirements, usually technical and/or environmental in nature, are indicated by the authorising body
             and, in conjunction with national, regional and local legislation, constitute a "binding regulation" for the
             proposing party for the executive planning and construction of the work itself.
             in most cases they accentuate or better define the mitigations proposed in the environmental impact study
             or impose new ones on the advice of specialised bodies (superintendencies, river basin authorities, park
             authorities, etc.).
             such mitigation, once constructed, will further lower the effect of the impacts estimated in the study (the
             "monitoring plan"), which is drafted for all terna works that undergo an environmental impact assessment.
             the requirements can also be compensatory. when a residual impact is not considered to be sufficiently
             mitigated, the competent authority assesses an intervention, in a different location to the plant, with
             environmental balance value, which would benefit the area, for example, the reconstruction of a vegetation
             habitat or the restoration of an architectural-cultural property, etc.

                                                                                                     environment   131



mitigation and compensation                                                                                         g4-en13
in compliance with the requirements expressed during the authorisation procedure and/or on a voluntarily
basis, terna adopts mitigation measures to reduce the impact, and/or improve integration into the
environment, of the electrical structures.
in particular, terna creates systems to hide its own electrical substations from places frequented by
tourists or those of landscape-environmental interest; redevelops assets with cultural importance; during
the design phase prefers to locate lines where they take advantage of natural morphology and makes
use of naturalistic engineering techniques for restoration after demolitions, reconstructing habitats and
stabilising slopes or embankments.
if the mitigation measures are not sufficient to reduce the interference to insignificant levels, environmental
offsetting measures are adopted, that is environmental regeneration or habitat reconstruction work on
areas close to the power line such as balancing out the trees cut along the lines in the projects by planting
individual trees of the same species over equivalent areas.
throughout 2016, 3 vegetation redevelopment projects were carried out and 3 executive designs were
completed. 5 projects are being constructed in 2017, which also includes executive projects made in
previous years.




monitoring and supervision of electromagnetic fields

protecting the public from exposure to electromagnetic fields is precisely defined by law: the relative
legislation (prime minister’s decree of 8 july 2003) establishes:

   •   exposure limits: in case of exposure to electric and magnetic fields at a frequency of 50 hz
       generated by power lines, the limit is 100 microteslas for magnetic induction and 5 kv/m for the
       electric field, understood as effective values
   •   caution values: as a precautionary measure protecting against the possible long-term effects
       of exposure to magnetic fields generated at the grid frequency (50 hz), in children’s play areas,
       residential areas, school sites, and places where people stay for at least four hours a day, the
       caution value for magnetic induction is 10 microteslas, understood as the median value over 24
       hours under normal operating conditions
   •   quality objectives: in planning new power lines near sensitive areas as above, and in planning new
       settlements and areas in the vicinity of lines and installations already present, the quality objective
       is set at 3 microteslas for the value of magnetic induction, understood as the median value over
       24 hours under normal operating conditions. this is in order to gradually minimise exposure to
       electric and magnetic fields generated by power lines operating at a frequency of 50 hz. to ensure
       that quality objectives are met, in agreement with the regional environmental protection agencies,
       monitoring plans with electric and magnetic field measurements can be provided for new power
       lines, both in the pre- and post-construction stages

the values of the three parameters, and in particular the "caution value" (10 microteslas) and the quality
objective (3 microteslas) show that the italian legislator has adopted the precautionary approach expressed
by article 15 of the rio principles. these parameters are amongst the lowest in europe. in order to comply
with the law, terna must adopt the same principle in its work.
terna performs inspections on its own lines to guarantee compliance with the limits provided for by
current legislation and researches innovative technological solutions to mitigate magnetic fields. in the
event of any reports and requests by responsible bodies and administrations, terna provides the data
needed to assess the effective exposure to electric and magnetic fields generated by its plants.
finally, with the objective of providing accurate but easily comprehensible information on the subject,
terna has provided a further explanation of electromagnetic fields (emfs) on the “sustainability” section
of its corporate website www.terna.it.

 eu13         safeguarding biodiversity
g4-en27
              the relationship between the terna grid and the surrounding natural environment and, consequently, its
g4-en12       impact on biodiversity can assume different features.
              in the grid construction stage, the impact on biodiversity is associated with site work: opening up
g4-en13       routes so as to be able to erect pylons, excavate and remove residual materials.
              in this phase, the potential disturbances at the site areas and any access routes are temporary and
              reversible.
              in the operating stage of existing lines, the potential impact on biodiversity is twofold. on the one
              hand, the line route may contribute to increasing biodiversity and protecting certain species because
              the pylons and their bases constitute “islands” of concentrated biodiversity, sparing areas of land from
              intensive farming. on the other hand, the lines potentially have negative effects on biodiversity, in particular
              on birds and in protected areas or areas of particular natural interest.
              the main tool used to identify critical line sections is a comprehensive regional database, populated
              with data from the regions and ministries: the geographic information system (gis), which allows for
              integrated analysis of all layers of information for various types of land use and protection constraints
              (regional, naturalistic, cultural, landscape, etc.). using this tool, terna has put together an inventory of all
              possible interference between its lines and areas with protected or high levels of biodiversity, which
              is found in the table below.

              on this basis, potential threats deriving from the risk of collision concerning bird species included in the
              "iucn red list" were explored.




              electrical lines and birdlife

              the presence of lines may cause potentially negative effects for birdlife.
              while the risk of electrocution affects low- and medium-voltage lines, and therefore does not affect terna
              plants, high-voltage lines are associated with the risk of collision.
              to minimise this risk, for stretches of line where birds frequently cross, special devices known as
              “dissuaders” have been installed. due to their high visibility and the noise they make when the wind
              hits them, they make electricity lines more easily perceptible to birds in flight.
              over the years terna has initiated research and scientific studies to investigate this issue and identify
              increasingly effective solutions (for example, see the 2010 sustainability report, page 116, “terna-lipu
              agreement: study on the interaction between birdlife and the national electricity transmission grid”).
              the first italian study dedicate to the issue of collisions23, and based on the results of the terna-lipu
              agreement, it shows a low risk of collision.

tools for preventing the risk of collision
during 2016, terna, in collaboration with cesi and the "charles darwin" biology and biotechnology
department at "la sapienza" university in rome, developed avival, a tool based on gis (geographic
information system) designed to help assess the suitability of a territory to host a power line. the tool
considers the modelled distribution of all bird species across the area of interest, the presence of protected
areas, the susceptibility of the species to the presence of the line and the influence of environmental
factors on the potential collision risk.
an additional tool is provided by the prior monitoring of the passages of migratory birdlife. as part of
the preparatory activities for the construction of the “sorgente-rizziconi” electrical line (see page 106),
terna has created a three-year monitoring project, using radar, over the messina strait, which, to date,
has allowed for over 50,000 passages to be recorded, broken down by number and altitude for birds of
prey and passerines, which has not shown any collision phenomenon. terna presented this experience,
which constitutes an international best practice, at the international “radar aero-ecology: applications
and perspectives” conference promoted by enram (the european network for the radar surveillance of
animal movement), which was held in rome on the 23-24 february 2017.
lastly, in january 2016 experimentation began involving a section of the "villanova-gissi" power line
and using avimon, a device that detects impacts of birdlife with power line guard wires. during the
two highest periods of bird traffic (pre-reproduction and post-reproduction), no collisions were detected,
confirming the results of previous on-site monitoring.



identification and monitoring of bird species included on the "iucn red list"                                                                         g4-en14

as part of its birdlife protection initiatives, terna has conducted a study to identify the protected species
included on the "iucn red list", which may be affected by its infrastructures.
the iucn red list is the largest existing database at an international level concerning the conservation
status of thousands of plant and animal species, which are catalogued on the basis of their risk of extinction.
when conducting its analysis, terna specifically considered the presence of bird species belonging to the
"iucn red list" and "natura 2000"24 sites, protected areas with high levels of biodiversity (approximately
3,000 between spas and sci).
the study selected the natura 2000 areas affected by terna’s lines, thereby verifying the protected species
that had chosen said areas as their habitat, including those contained on the red list and classified as
vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered and extinct in the wild25. these species are a conservation
priority, as without targeted interventions aimed at neutralising the threats in their regard and increasing their
populations in some cases, their extinction is a real possibility. the analysis showed that terna’s electrical
infrastructures could interfere with the habitats of the following 8 species.

(24) natura 2000 is the main tool in the european union’s policy on the conservation of biodiversity. it is an ecological network that is spread
     across the entire european union, established in accordance with the “habitats” directive no. 92/43/eec to guarantee the long-term
     maintenance of natural habitats and plant and animal life that are at risk or are rare, throughout the european union. the natura 2000
     network is made up of sites of community importance (sci), identified by member states in accordance with that which is established in
     the habitat directive, which were subsequently designated as special areas of conservation (sacs) and also includes special protection
     areas (spas) that were established pursuant to the 2009/147/ec “birds” directive concerning the conservation of wild bird species.
(25) there are 11 risk categories, ranging from extinct (ex), which is applied to species for which there is definitive proof that the last member
     has died, to the least concern (lc) category, which is adopted for species that are not at risk of extinction in the short or medium term.
     between the categories of extinction and least concern lie the endangered categories, which identify the species that are at an increasing
     risk of extinction in the short or medium term: vu - vulnerable, en - endangered, cr - critically endangered and ew - extinct in the wild.

      in regards to the species that belong to the bat (chiroptera) family, their biology excludes the risk of collision
      with fixed structures. the results from a field research project conducted by terna have demonstrated the
      absence of line interference on the bats’ movements, which fly through the spaces below power lines and
      even nest in the bat boxes installed on the pylons.
      after checking scientific publications and targeted consultation, no particular issues with the bird species
      became apparent, with the exception of the "corn crake", a species found in the alpine area between
      friuli-venezia giulia and lombardy, which has a potential collision risk.



      alternative uses of electrical lines
      terna has been creating projects aimed at finding alternative uses for electrical lines in partnership with
      environmental associations for some time. the most important was carried out in collaboration with
      ornis italica and is called "nests on pylons". it consists of placing nesting boxes and conducting annual
      monitoring of the species occupying the nests and the outcome of their nesting season. the project
      includes many species, such as the kestrel, peregrine falcon, horned owl, common cuckoo, european
      roller, bat and stork. launched in 2015, the gis survey (localisation using geographic coordinates) of the
      installed nests is still in progress, with 266 already recorded.

climate change and energy efficiency

terna transmits electricity and has no production activities which, in the electricity industry – and
among all business activities in general – are those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions:
therefore, terna is not subject to emission-reduction obligations according to the kyoto targets, nor to
emission-trading schemes of any kind, but it has still chosen to commit itself voluntarily to containing
emissions. in this light, terna responded to the urging of the international cdp organisation (originally
“carbon disclosure project”) and adhered to the international “cdp road to paris”26 initiative, subscribing
to three commitments (emission data transparency, elimination from the supply chain of procurement
leading to deforestation, and public support for the objective of reducing greenhouse gases). as well as
monitoring and programmes to contain its emissions, the investments included in the grid development
plan of terna lead to significant reductions in co2 emissions in the overall electricity system.




(26) “cdp road to paris” was the initiative promoted by cdp in july 2014 ahead of cop 21 (paris, december 2015).

g4-ec2     climate change risks and opportunities

           in line with the interest of stakeholders to assess the possible impact of climate change on terna’s
           business, risks connected with certain overarching trends can be assessed, specifically those risks that
           are derived from regulatory/legislative frameworks, physical risks and other risks connected to the role
           and activities of terna.




            regulatory risks


            reduction                   terna is not involved in the generation of electricity and therefore is not
            of emissions                subject to any obligation to reduce emissions or to any emission-trading
            (emission trading/          schemes. accordingly, any fiscal or regulatory measures (e.g. carbon tax
            carbon tax)                 or emission-reduction targets) do not concern terna and have no direct
                                        consequences on its business and financial performance.


            changes in                  research into greater efficiency has already reduced the elasticity of
            consumption                 energy demand to the growth of gdp. the consequences for terna are
            and generation              very few: the current regulatory framework significantly limits the risk
            systems intended            of repercussions on terna income from a below-trend growth in energy
            to reduce energy            demand.
            consumption

            physical risks associated with environmental conditions


            extreme weather             extreme weather conditions may also make it difficult for terna to balance
            conditions (water           electricity input/withdrawal on the transmission grid. to address these
            shortage, extreme           risks, terna is carrying out research initiatives in two directions. the first
            heat, ice)                  is oriented towards increasing knowledge of the potential consequences
                                        of extreme weather scenarios – in line with the ipcc (intergovernmental
                                        panel on climate change) data – on grid infrastructure and on transmission
                                        operations, so as to increase the resilience of the system; the second is
                                        aimed at developing technological solutions for securing the service in
                                        specific adverse weather conditions (see page 122).


            other risks


            development of              this poses various operational and technological challenges for terna in
            the production              relation to the need to resolve grid congestion problems and for efficient
            of electricity              and safe management of non-programmable production. for example,
            from renewable              intermittent wind production makes dispatching more difficult.
            sources

            reputational                as the probability of critical situations due to extreme weather events
                                        increases, which can result in widespread disruption, terna’s exposure to
                                        reputation problems increases, both relative to public authorities and the
                                        general public.

                                                                                                  environment   137



climate change has encouraged the legislative framework to evolve in a way that favours renewable
sources and has led to a merging of guidelines also at an international level, clearly seen during the
climate conference of december 2015 in paris (cop21).
terna strategic guidelines are coherent with international guidelines, particularly when it comes to
decarbonisation and the transition to energy production using renewable sources. the main opportunities
that climate change indirectly opens up for terna regard both regulated activities and new market
opportunities: grid development investments meet a need to aid energy transition by strengthening
transmission capacity and interconnections with foreign countries and research and innovation are also
focused on identifying sustainable smart solutions that can be proposed to non-regulated activity
customers.
for example, terna is installing storage devices (batteries) which may actually encourage the use of
renewable sources, while resolving grid regulation problems (see page 101). in addition, in 2016, terna
signed an agreement with rfi for the development of plants producing renewable sources (see page 43).
lastly, we note terna’s participation together with other energy infrastructure managers in a project to
identify and analyse methods of governing climate change risks, requested and managed by the eni
enrico mattei foundation, in order to share strategies and procedures and develop synergies between
the companies.




energy consumption                                                                                               g4-en3

the transmission of electricity requires direct consumption of energy only for a few activities that support     g4-en5
the service, in particular:

   •   fuel for company operating vehicles, helicopters and vehicles used for line inspections, repairs,
       and other activities mainly connected with the maintenance of lines and substations (see the "plant
       maintenance" paragraph on page 111)
   •   diesel for emergency generators, which are used only in cases where electricity is lacking. it is
       estimated that across italy generators were used for a total of 6,124 hours (consumption of 0.3 gj
       per hour)
   •   heating oil and natural gas for heating offices

the indirect consumption of energy consists of the electricity used to run substations and operating plants
(approximately 80% of the total) and in offices and workshops. the figure for office consumption is 130,791
gj, which, as a ratio to terna’s total employees (net of blue-collar workers), corresponds to per capita
consumption of 53.5 gj per year, up compared to the figure for 2015 (50.5 gj). the energy efficiency
management system implemented will enable an improvement in this efficiency indicator in the medium
term (see the relevant section on page 145).

sf6 leakage

thanks to its chemical and physical properties, the gas sf6 (sulphur hexafluoride) is used as insulation in
certain electrical devices such as switches, current transformers and armoured systems. part of the gas
present in the devices is dispersed into the atmosphere owing to defective seals, faults and sometimes
also during operations to restore pressure. sf6 gas has an extremely powerful greenhouse effect, equal
to 23,500 times that of co227.
sf6 leaks are the main source of direct greenhouse-gas emissions by terna. in the last five-year
period, the quantity of sf6 present in the terna group’s plants increased by 172 tonnes (+47%): this is
a trend – common to many transmission operators – associated with the higher insulating properties of
the gas and with the smaller size of substations built with equipment containing sf6, compared to more
traditional solutions.
in 2016, thanks to programmes to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks (shown in the relevant paragraph
on page 144) and the absence of significant accidents, leaks fell in absolute terms (kg) by 7.5%
compared to the previous year. the impact of leakage on total installed amounts – the most important
kpi for the containment measures adopted – in 2016 was 0.39%, the lowest figure since measurement
began (0.44 in 2015, 0.55%28 in 2014).

             sf6 leaks: comparative data

              sf6 gas is used by electricity transmission operators because of its excellent electrical insulation
              properties. on account of its specific nature of use, only other tso panels were compared.
              the indicator compared was the proportion of leaks to the total quantity of gas installed in substation
              equipment. in 2016, terna recorded a proportion of leaks of 0.39%. for 2015, the year to which the
              comparison refers, sf6 leaks were equal to 0.44%.
              in the comparison with other transmission operators, for the year 2015 terna showed a slightly
              below-average proportion of sf6 leaks compared to the panel average, both in terms of the simple
              average (0.50%) and the weighted average (0.70%), i.e. calculated as the ratio between the sum of
              leakages and the sum of quantity installed across all tsos.

g4-en15    direct and indirect co2 emissions
g4-en16
           direct greenhouse-gas emissions connected with terna’s work are mainly caused by sf6 leaks (87% of
           total direct emissions in 2016), which fell by 7.5%, resulting in a decrease of 7.2% in total direct emissions.
           indirect emissions have, instead, increased by 6% reflecting a diverse conversion factor relative to previous
           years, more than an actual increase in consumption. we note that, for technical reasons, the energy
           consumed by terna cannot be traced to a supply contract. this makes it impossible for terna to reduce
           indirect emissions by selecting supplies from renewable sources, and the need to use a conversion factor
           based on the average for italian electricity production.

(1) the conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 (sulphur hexafluoride) and refrigerant gas leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is
    calculated this year using the parameters indicated in the ipcc fifth assessment report (ar5) and greenhouse gas protocol (ghg)
    initiative. this led to a change in the equivalent tonnes of sf6 and refrigerant gas and total direct emissions compared to that which was
    previously published.
(2) until 2014, data on refrigerant gas leaks was only collected for r22. since 2015, data collection was added for r407c and r410a. in 2016
    there were no r22 leaks.
(3) the terna helicopter fleet has been operational since 2015.
(4) indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the total italian electricity
    production for 2016. the reference for the division of the production mix is the “monthly report on the electricity system” with the results
    for december 2016, available on the website www.terna.it.



the carbon intensity value can be found below, which is the ratio between direct and indirect emissions
of co2 equivalents (amounting to 136,707 tonnes in 2016) and an important metric for the company’s

the reduction in the figure for the three-year period (-9.7%) is attributable to a total reduction in group
emissions (-5.0%) on the one hand, and to an increase in revenue from the same period (+5.3% compared
to 2014) on the other.

        co2 emissions: comparative data

         the figures used for comparison as regards the emission of co2 are composed of the figures related
         to direct and indirect emissions (scopes 1 and 2).
         the unit of measurement used for the comparison is the co2 equivalent, expressed in thousands
         of tonnes, where co2 equivalent means the total contribution of the greenhouse gases to the
         greenhouse effect.
         the analysis was done by comparing terna’s emission values with those of three corporate panels:
         companies listed on the ftse mib, the electric utilities on the dow jones sustainability world
         index, and the tsos(1).
         in the absence of normalisation factors valid for all sectors, it was deemed of interest to present the
         company data on co2 emissions in absolute terms – despite the poor comparability. such figures,
         which vary greatly in magnitude from one case to another, at least provide an indication of the extent
         of greenhouse gas emissions – and therefore of the practical need to contain and mitigate them from
         the point of view of sustainability – in the various sectors and companies.
         for 2016, co2 emissions attributed to terna’s activities amounted to 136.5 thousand tonnes. on the
         other hand, for 2015 (the year with which a comparison can be made) emissions were measured at
         137.1 thousand tonnes of co2.
         when compared with all three panels, terna is significantly below the average for 2015. the data
         confirms the evidence for the previous three-year period.

in addition to the emissions corresponding to electricity consumption, terna’s most significant indirect
emissions are related to grid losses. for the indicators relative to emissions produced by staff air miles,
see page 201.



grid losses                                                                                                          eu12

grid losses are defined as the difference between energy input by producers (including imported energy)
and final consumption; the losses relevant for terna are those associated with the transmission grid. the
figure presented in the table below is based on the direct measurement of energy inputted and withdrawn
from the transmission grid (approximately 7,500 metres), to which corrective technical coefficients are
applied in cases in which the measuring point does not coincide with the boundaries of the transmission
grid. terna is responsible for measuring the energy input into the ntg, while for the energy withdrawn, on
the basis of specific agreements, terna may read the measurements remotely, which however remain the
responsibility of the distributor companies. this entails a margin of error concerning the correctness of
the measurements of electricity withdrawn which, moreover, has tended to reduce over the years, thanks
to cross-checks and the gradual resolution of discrepancies with the distributors’ data.
in order to reduce the margin of error and the risk of interpreting the effect of measurement errors and
related corrections as real trends, starting from 2012 it was decided to use the simple moving average of
losses with a three-year window (2012-2014 for the year 2014; 2013-2015 for the year 2015; 2014-2016 for
2016) as the annual figure.

terna can only contribute to determining the amount of losses, which are not completely under its control.
dispatching – needed to ensure the constant balance between injections and withdrawals, and to avoid
grid-security and service-disruption problems – takes place according to regulated criteria within the
scope of production set-up determined by the energy market, and cannot be conditioned by terna so as
to minimise losses.
grid development, however, with equal production set-ups, would lead to greater efficiency and thus a
reduction in losses; however, the real impact of grid development on losses cannot be predetermined, nor
is it under the control of the grid operator, since it depends on the evolution of production capacity and
the demand and supply of electricity on a local basis.
the co2 emissions associated with grid losses amounted to 1,733,251 tonnes for the year 2016 (1,700,916
in 2015 and 1,646,235 in 2014). the trend differs from the losses measured in gwh due to modifications in
the conversion factor for transforming energy into equivalent co2 emissions, which – in turn – is affected
by the changes in the production mix of the italian generation system.

g4-en19    initiatives to reduce emissions

           terna focuses its attention on a number of voluntary action programmes aimed at reducing its main
           sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, which consist, in particular, of:

               •    a programme to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks: terna has launched several initiatives such
                    as identifying leaks promptly by means of online monitoring systems and seeking technological
                    solutions which improve the sealing of equipment and components
               •    a programme for energy-efficient buildings
               •    feasibility studies for energy conservation initiatives in electrical substations



           limiting sf6 leakage
           terna works to keep sf6 leaks under control, limit and, where possible, reduce their percentage as a
           ratio to the total gas used. in fact, if leaks in absolute terms increase owing to the greater use of gas, a
           reduction in the proportion of leaks would, precisely for this reason, have a significant impact in terms of
           emissions avoided.
           the identification of a reduction target is affected by several elements of uncertainty:

               •    the growth of awareness of and attention to the issue has been reflected in an improvement in
                    measuring leaks, entailing – precisely in the years when limiting activity began (2009–2010) – worse
                    performance, in all probability only apparent
               •    the occurrence of faults with significant gas leaks – the probability of which is growing given the
                    increasing use of sf6 gas in equipment at large substations – can alter the trend considerably
               •    while on the one hand installing equipment with better sealing performance tends to reduce the
                    proportion of leaks, on the other the ageing of equipment already installed could entail an increase
                    in leaks

           net of exceptional faults and any effect deriving from the ageing of the equipment in operation, it is
           estimated that installing new devices with better seals (such as more highly reliable transformers), which
           began in 2009 and continued in the years 2010-2012, may determine a reduction in the proportion of
           leaks of approximately 0.1% over the period of five years of the installation campaign. on the basis of this
           estimate, and again net of the factors mentioned, we expected the proportion of leaks to be placed around
           0.6%, considering that the average proportion in the 2007-2008 period was 0.7% (net of exceptional
           faults). therefore, the effective proportion recorded (0.39% in 2016) represents a better result than the
           expected target, which, however, given the average proportion recorded by european tsos (0.70%, see
           the "comparative data" box on page 140), remains a terna objective up to and including 2018.

           company fleet
           the company’s operating vehicles are used throughout italy to carry out line inspections generally to
           reach plants and sites.
           the fleet of vehicles used by terna is made up of:

               •    3 helicopters acquired in 2015 for scheduled and occasional inspections of terna power lines
               •    a car fleet, which was renewed during 2016, made up of over 90% of cars fitted with euro 6 and
                    euro 5 engines (for more information on the vehicles and the impacts connected to the company
                    fleet, see the table in the indicators tables on page 201)

energy management system

in line with its sustainable business approach, terna promotes energy efficiency and saving.
in 2012 the company launched the “energy consumed for own use management system” project
to provide the group with a corporate management system that complies with the uni cei en iso
50001:2011 standard.
to achieve the objective of uni cei en iso 50001:2011 certification for terna s.p.a., terna rete italia s.p.a.,
terna plus s.r.l. and terna crna gora, obtained in december 2015, and comply with the commitments
established by italian legislative decree 102/2014 and the guidelines issued by the med, which obliged
large companies to carry out, again by 2015, a series of energy audits on a significant sample of company
sites, the following were carried out:

   •   initial energy analysis
   •   energy analyses at relevant sites (rome, milan, florence, naples, palermo, cagliari, rome campus
       and the security operation centre-soc, rome)
   •   energy analysis of the terna gora headquarters
   •   energy analysis of the terna gora construction site
   •   energy analyses of 18 electrical substations (the three largest in rondissone, dugale and north
       rome)
   •   the ginestra site for non-conventional storage systems
   •   the physical-chemical laboratory in rome and the genzano di lucania construction site

the energy analyses were conducted in compliance with current legislation (italian legislative decree
102/2014) and the use and consumption of all energy carriers (electricity, diesel oil for generators, natural
gas, heating oil and car fuel) were examined, on account of the fact that they are relevant aspects for the
group.
real-time energy consumption sensors were installed, which power an energy dashboard for 9 important
offices: the rome headquarters, milan, padua, florence, palermo, cagliari, rome campus and the rome
security operation centre (soc).
during 2016 the "uni cei en iso 50001:2011 energy management systems – requirements and guidelines
for use and uni cei en 16247 energy diagnosis" course was given to around 60 people, including energy
officers and assessors. in addition, to increase energy-saving awareness within the company, a poster
campaign was carried out, which was linked to an email address in order to gather suggestions.
in july 2016, a positive result followed on from an audit by the certifying body in order to maintain the
certification.



energy efficiency in substations and offices                                                                        g4-en6
at terna the development of energy efficiency programmes relative to the use of electricity in substations
and offices is experimental at this stage, as electricity consumption falls within the "own transmission
use" category which, in accordance with the provisions of the sector authority, are not included within
terna’s operating expenses.
in offices, the main sources of energy consumption are related to lighting, air-conditioning, heating and
the use of computers and printers.
the renovation and new construction of terna sites should be noted first and foremost, which – on
the basis of a multi-year programme – tend to raise the energy class of group owned properties, thereby
accompanying construction with an improvement in energy efficiency standards.
during 2016, the construction of the new turin office and the remodelling of the palermo offices contributed
to improving the energy class of terna’s main buildings, in line with the objective to bring these buildings to
70% (expressed as a % of total cubage in the offices considered) in classes a, b or c by 2020 (45% in 2015).
we also note initiatives launched in previous years which concern the reduction in these consumption
sources and for which we can measure the obtained benefits:

146   2016 sustainability report




          •    trading-in computers and printers: the new models enable savings in average energy consumption of
               around 13.3% and a consequent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. the reduction achieved in
               2016 adds to those already recorded in 2012 for a total of 242 tonnes of co2 emissions
          •    the replacement of heating oil boilers with two heat pumps and a series of geothermal probes at the
               offices of the friuli-venezia giulia plants unit. the investment initiated in 2014 has a payback period
               of 5 years and has allowed for a reduction in costs and consumption related to heating oil. this has
               led to a reduction in co2 emissions into the atmosphere amounting to a total of 150 tonnes of co2

      among the initiatives begun in 2016 we note the switch to led bulbs in the pero offices (milan) and the
      installation of innovative light towers (with led technology) in the basiliano electrical substation (udine).
      the benefits for these projects in terms of carbon dioxide reduction will be quantified at the end of 2017.




      the development plan and reduction of co2 emissions from
      the electricity system

      the construction of the new lines and substations provided for by the development plan will have positive
      effects not only in terms of service security and the final cost of electricity, but also in terms of reduced
      emissions from the electricity system. the effects, achievable upon completion of the plan, can be
      attributed to three categories:

          •    reduction of grid losses
          •    improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
          •    connection of plants using renewable energy

      overall, the reduction in co2 emissions could reach approximately 13 million tonnes a year.



      reduction of grid losses
      grid losses depend, among other things, on the distance the electricity travels on the transmission grid.
      in the simplest terms, the further the point of consumption (of withdrawal from the ntg) from the point
      of production (of delivery into the ntg), the greater the losses for the same consumption. in addition, for
      the same distance, the losses are greater on a lower-voltage line. development work that improves the
      grid mesh structure brings withdrawal and consumption points closer: all other conditions being equal,
      the result is a reduction in grid losses. the same result is produced by upgrading a stretch of the grid, for
      example when a 400 kv line replaces one at 150 kv over the same route. the entry into service of the main
      development interventions provided for in the 2017 development plan will lead to a reduction in energy
      losses on the grid estimated at being around 830 gwh/year. assuming that the reduction of these losses
      is equivalent to a reduction in production from combustible sources, it is possible to quantify a decrease
      in co2 emissions of somewhere between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes every year.

                                                                                                                         environment    147



improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
one of the main purposes of developing the electricity transmission grid is to overcome the transport
limits between “electricity zones”. the existence of these limits imposes a number of restrictions on the
possibility of production by more efficient generation units, namely units which pollute less in terms of co2
emissions, and at the same time makes production by obsolete substations necessary for grid security.
the work envisaged in the development plan, together with the expansion of interconnection with other
countries, would enable a more efficient production mix, with a larger proportion of production by plants
with higher yields. the same final consumption quantity would thus be fulfilled with a smaller quantity of
fuel: the benefits are quantifiable as a reduction in co2 emissions of up to around 7,246,757 tonnes a year.



connection of plants using renewable energy
the main contribution to the reduction of co2 emissions comes from connecting production plants using
renewable sources considered among the projects in the 2017 development plan. the production of
energy from renewable sources has represented an energy potential that has seen strong growth in recent
years. specifically, wind and photovoltaic generation plants have increased substantially, especially in
italy’s southern regions and islands.
one of terna’s main tasks is to plan ntg upgrading in order to encourage production of electricity from
renewable energy sources. the aim is to try to overcome any grid and operating limitations that could
impact renewable-energy input into the grid, which is entitled to dispatching priority.
the development solutions planned in response to these critical areas include both action to strengthen
sections of the primary grid, which make it possible to indirectly reduce the limits on the operation of
nprs production, and action to locally expand the sub-transmission grids to which the nprs generation
is directly connected (see the relevant section on pages 108-110). besides this work, nprs collection
stations on the primary 400 kv grid are planned, which will make it possible to limit the construction
of new 150 kv power lines which would otherwise be needed. the works included by terna in the 2017
development plan will release about 4,350 mw of power from renewable sources, thus obtaining a
reduction of co2 emissions amounting to around 5,600,000 tco2/year.



reduction of co2 emissions in 2016
in 2016, the benefits in terms of reduction of co2 emissions were mainly due to the installation of new
“zero-emission” production units.
the provisional figure for power installed from renewable sources in 2016 is presented below.

 total                                                                                                                    28,950

from the 2016 provisional figures, it can be seen that in 2016 the gross production using wind and
photovoltaic energy increased by approximately 2,730 gwh; this figure corresponds to a reduction of
approximately 1.52 million tonnes of co229.

           resource use and waste management

           the provision of the transmission service requires the construction and maintenance of a large endowment
           of capital assets: power lines (pylons, conductors, insulators), transformer substations (transformers,
           switches, other substation equipment), and control systems are the main components.
g4-en8     the use of materials is related, in particular, to constructing new electricity and ict infrastructure.
           water is not used in the electricity transmission and dispatching production cycle. normally, the water
           used – for hygienic use, to clean offices and for cooling systems – comes from connections to the water
           mains for civil use (water consumption is shown in the key indicator tables on page 202).
           the production and direct waste management primarily concerns the maintenance of electricity
           infrastructure.




g4-en1     resources

           terna does not use raw materials but purchases finished products such as electrical equipment, conductors,
           devices and other elements which are used to develop and maintain the national transmission grid. an
           estimate of the materials contained in the primary products purchased by terna is shown in the following
           table, where the quantities have been estimated considering the average material contents of the various
           products purchased by terna in the years referred to. information is not currently available on the use of
           recycled material by the suppliers of the materials and equipment used.

most of terna’s waste is recovered to be sent for production recycling. only some residues are sent to the
waste-disposal sites and therefore have an environmental impact.
93% of waste was recovered in 2016 (92% in 2015 and 81% in 2014).
such waste derives mainly from maintenance and modernisation works to the electricity infrastructure,
activities which depend on technical considerations regarding the security and efficiency of the system,
which therefore may change significantly from year to year.
actual recycling depends on the materials which make up the waste: some materials can easily be
separated and consequently reused (for example the iron parts of pylons); however, in some cases, it is
impossible or too costly to separate the parts, especially for equipment purchased some years ago.
for these reasons, the annual changes in the percentage of waste recycled must not be interpreted
as representing a trend.

(1) this includes only the special waste from the production process, not that produced by service activities (urban waste). this does not
    include waste relative to sewage and waste deriving from septic tanks, coming from substations not connected to the sewer network.
    the amount of sewage and septic tanks amounted to 789 tonnes in 2016, 680 tonnes in 2015 and 383 tonnes in 2014. in 2014, waste
    identified as “other emulsions” (amounting to 857 tonnes) produced during an accident that occurred in an operating area was also
    excluded.
(2) they consist of uncontaminated metal waste, deriving from the decommissioning of transformers, electrical equipment and machines (for
    example, generators) no longer in use, with a recovery percentage that averages 100%.
(2) waste sent for disposal may differ from the simple difference between waste produced and recovered, owing to the temporary storage of
    waste.



the main hazardous special waste produced by terna’s operating activities consists of:

    •    metal waste which derives from the decommissioning of transformers, electrical equipment
         and machinery no longer used and contaminated by hazardous substances, more than 95% of
         which is recycled on average, after treatment by third parties
    •    batteries (lead and nickel), which, in the event of a blackout, enable emergency generators to
         be turned on to keep the energy transportation and transformation service operating during
         emergencies, 100% of which are recycled
    •    dielectric oils for the insulation of transformers replaced following the regular checks carried out
         for transformer maintenance, and which constitute hazardous waste with a recovery rate of 85%

     150   2016 sustainability report




           waste sent for disposal consists mainly of materials used in the maintenance and cleaning of plants
           (mud, oil emulsions and rags containing oils and solvents) and insulating materials containing asbestos
           for which no kind of recycling is available.




g4-en31    costs for the environment

           terna’s commitment to the environment is reflected in the costs incurred for environmental reasons, both
           as investment and as operating expenses. environmental costs were shown separately on the basis of
           the definitions presented below, by aggregating information deducible from the company’s general and
           management accounting. such definitions and the methodology described below have been taken from
           the operating guidelines of the terna group.




           recording methods

           environmental costs are identified firstly on the basis of the definitions available, in particular those of
           the istat (the italian national institute of statistics), eurostat and the gri as well as on the european
           commission’s recommendation on the recognition, measurement and disclosure of environmental
           issues in annual accounts and annual reports (recommendation 2001/453/ec). on the basis of this
           recommendation the term “environmental expenditure” includes the cost of steps taken by an organisation
           or on its behalf by others, to prevent, reduce or repair damage to the environment which results from its
           operating activities.
           secondly, the aforesaid definitions were applied to the environmental aspects considered significant (for
           example, the noise of substations, electromagnetic fields, etc.) in the company’s iso 14001-certified
           environmental management system to identify, in the main corporate processes, terna’s operating and
           investment activities of environmental significance.
           many of terna’s activities described in this report entail environmental expenses. however, several
           limitations were introduced in determining the reporting boundary:

               •    exclusion of integrated costs, i.e. regarding activities whose purpose is not exclusively environmental
                    (for example, the use of pylons with innovative features also from the point of view of environmental
                    integration) because of the subjectivity of accounting for only environmental components
               •    exclusion of the additional costs connected with the consideration of restrictions or requests for
                    safeguarding the environment during planning and designing new lines (detours and burials)

           other conditions were that the costs had to be:

               •    significant
               •    consistent with the annual reporting of accounts (operating costs and investment clearly
                    distinguished)
               •    directly recognisable on the basis of the existing corporate accounting system

           this last condition fulfils the need to minimise recourse to estimates based on non-accounting analyses.

                                                                                                                                       environment      151



investment and operating costs

the table below best shows the investments and operating costs incurred by terna for the environment
(see the relevant information box for more details on the accounting method used).
these costs exclude expenses regarding internal resources and consider only expenses for external
purchases. an exception is the “environmental activities – existing plants” item, which includes the costs
of internal personnel.
in accordance with the method adopted and the footnotes to the table, it should be noted that the
environmental costs shown are a subset of the total environmental costs actually incurred, as defined
above.

(1) environmental offsets: these are amounts for offsetting the works set out in the grid development plan, as determined by special
    agreements entered into with local institutions.
(2) environmental-impact studies: these relate to plants provided for in the grid development plan that are at the construction stage or in
    the process of being authorised by the competent administrations.
(3) environmental activities - new plants: the amount shown is based on an estimate. on the basis of an analysis of several large
    investment projects, it turned out that at least 1% of the total expenses of the project regard environmental items, usually determined by
    obligations (for example, masking with trees, barriers against noise, installation of dissuaders for birdlife, environmental monitoring, analysis
    of excavated earth and rocks). therefore, a value of 1% of investment costs for projects with similar features was considered.
(4) environmental activities - existing plants: the expenses for upgrading existing plants in accordance with environmental provisions and
    new regulations (for example noise and visual/landscape aspects).
(5) demolitions: the costs for the definitive dismantling of lines as part of rationalisation projects. in 2016, we also note two demolition
    projects involving 176 km on the grossotto-lovero (sondrio) and milano stazzona (como) power lines, the activity, performed directly by
    the engineering unit from the milan operating area, is not added to the item in the table as the methodology determined in 2010 does not
    include projects carried out directly by the operating areas (which are normally of little significance). this project cost around € 700,000. in
    2017, the possibility of amending the methodology to insert other similar cases in the future will be evaluated.
(6) costs for environmental activities: cutting trees, cutting grass, waste management and demolitions/dismantling for small amounts not
    included in investments. these cost items, which can be determined directly from the industrial accounting, do not exhaust the year’s total
    environmental costs, but represent the majority of them.

           human capital: our approach

           human resources are an essential part of corporate business but they are also individuals who should
           be valued and whose rights should be respected. terna’s approach to relations with its collaborators is
           characterised by:

               •    concern for safety and the prevention of injuries to ensure the physical integrity of employees
               •    the design of management and development systems to improve performance and develop
                    individual skills
               •    investment in training, ensuring the growth of the company and its employees
               •    remuneration and welfare policies aimed at aligning individual performance with the company’s
                    goals and providing economic security for employees and their families
               •    a well-organised system of industrial relations based on trade-union involvement in numerous
                    aspects of company life (see also pages 64-65);
               •    listening to employees by using staff surveys (see also page 64)

           staff policies are established by the human resource and organisation department, while staff
           management is entrusted to the relevant department heads as well as the hr department. workplace
           health and safety issues are the responsibility of the security and services department. both departments
           are part of the parent company’s corporate affairs division.

the total turnover rate on termination (1.5%) was in line with the trend of the previous years, with the
exception of 2015, which was affected by the generational turnover project implemented by the group
during that year.
retirement is the main reason for employees leaving. the leaving rate for spontaneous resignations has
remained very low despite having increased compared to the previous two years (0.60% in 2016; 0.35%
in 2015; 0.32% in 2014). the increase in leaving rate for employees under 30 years of age (1.9%) affected
this rise, a group which expanded greatly due to the aforementioned generational turnover project.
in 2016, terna made use of 54 temporary workers (compared with 37 in 2015 and 54 in 2014), employees
of agencies that provide a temporary employment service to terna.

the generational turnover project launched in 2015 led to an increase in the educational qualifications of
the corporate population. in 2016, 92% of employees had a degree or high school diploma. the average
length of service was 17.5 years.

    156   2016 sustainability report




          management of generational turnover

          the company concluded the initiative in 2015, which was launched in the last quarter of 2014 and aimed
          at bringing forward generational turnover through incentives for the voluntary retirement of employees
          close to pension age. terna has therefore implemented staff rationalisation and reorganised corporate
          procedures with the aim of rebalancing the professional and demographic composition of the workforce.
          the redundancy and retirement initiatives were countered by intensive personnel selection and hiring
          initiatives, which lead to generational turnover in the workforce of the terna group. for further details,
          please see the 2015 sustainability report on pages 125–126.
          some time ago, the terna group began a series of initiatives to better manage generational turnover. the
          most significant include the transmission of knowledge and experience, which are often exclusive, by
          increasing use of training courses taught by in-house teaching staff and professional development projects
          aimed at creating and transmitting technical and managerial skills, enabling adequate performance of
          critical roles. the increase in the number of training hours given in 2016 also reflects training reserved for
          new hires in 2015.
          the summary table of potential personnel leaving for the 2017-2021 and 2017-2026 periods respectively
          is given below:

 staff turnover: comparative data

  terna’s “staff turnover rate” is defined as the ratio of employees leaving during the year against the
  number of employees as at 31 december of the previous year.
  as the staff turnover rate is an indirect indicator of the internal company climate affecting all divisions,
  the figures for the transmission companies (tso panel) and those of the large companies listed on
  the italian stock exchange (ftse mib) were taken into account, as well as those for companies in the
  electric utilities sector included in the dow jones world sustainability index.
  in 2016 terna’s turnover rate was 1.5%, in line with the trend recorded up until 2015. in 2015, the year
  for which comparative data is available, terna’s turnover rate was impacted by the implementation
  of the generational turnover programme, amounting to 13.8%. net of incentivised redundancies, the
  turnover rate would have been 1%.
  considering the average rates recorded in the comparison group, which are in line with those of
  previous years, it emerges that the terna turnover rate before 2015 and – in 2015 –, net of the
  generational turnover programme, was well below the average of all the panels considered.


                                                                 turnover rate (%) – 2015

the hr process


research and selection

the personnel recruited from the external labour market are graduates – in particular engineers – and
qualified people with diplomas from professional institutes, most with an electrical specialisation. once
employed, the new recruits expand their knowledge and the necessary specific skills through dedicated
introductory training courses.
the preferred recruitment channel for candidates is the “working at terna” section of the company website.
the process of looking for and selecting personnel is managed by the human resources and organisation
department, which also oversees relations with schools, universities and employment agencies in order to
support the process of finding new staff and create a virtuous circle of exchange between the company and
the outside world. from this perspective the company has entered into agreements with the leading italian
universities and business schools, funding the creation of specialised master’s courses.
terna’s business in 2016 can be summarised by the following figures: it provided financial support for 4
master’s courses, 89 hours of teaching by terna employees in external courses, participated in 8 career
days, received 543 university or master students for visits at its plants and launched 33 traineeships,
internships and work projects.

g4-la9     training

           training at terna continuously embraces all aspects of professional life. it is aimed at creating value for
           our people through increasing and diversifying their skills and employability, and creating value for the
           company through the development of human capital in line with the company mission and the business
           strategy. “campus - esperienze in rete” (grid experiences) is the umbrella scheme for all the training,
           which is provided via a training scheme that is based on the transfer of specialist know-how entrusted
           to the most experienced staff (faculty) and on external collaborations (with universities and business
           schools) to ensure multiple teaching inputs. in 2016:

               •    203,066 hours of training were provided (+6% compared to 2015), 99% of which took place in the
                    classroom (99.8% in 2015)
               •    99% of employees have attended at least one training course (97% in 2015)
               •    61 hours of training per capita (56 in 2015, +9%)

           moreover, 117,000 hours were carried out – which were not considered in previous data – as an on-the-job
           complement to the training of newly-hired operators and multi-skilled staff.
           the 61 hours of training per capita provided by terna are comparable with the average per capita hours
           of the 40 companies on the ftse-mib that gravitated around 30 in recent years (30.2 in 2015, latest figure
           available).


             training for employees: comparative data

              the comparison of staff-training performance uses the per capita hours of training provided by
              companies as a reference.
              since per capita training does not depend on the size of the company or on the sector in which
              companies operate, figures for the companies on all three panels were examined.
              in 2016, terna provided 61 hours of training for each employee, up compared to 2015 (56).
              compared to the other companies on 2015 data, terna comes in above the average value for all
              three panels: tso, electric utilities for the dow jones sustainability index and companies on the
              ftse mib; terna achieved the highest figure for the latter panel.
              particularly, with reference to the 2011-2015 period, terna provided an average of 45 hours of per
              capita training each year, compared to the 31 of the ftse-mib panel. please note that terna data
              does not include on the job training hours.

developing human capital

the new terna group professional system was implemented in 2016 to support human resource
development activities aimed at ensuring that positions are effectively covered and guarantee an adequate
succession planning process. this system promotes:

   •   professions (that is “professional families”), identified according to the main core-business
       corporate processes and staff
   •   macro-roles (“duties”), that are transversal to the organisation, identified on the basis of the type
       and complexity of the contribution, broken down according to the level of seniority

the professional system represents the framework on which hr strategies and policies are introduced,
and comprises an integrated management and development system that makes it possible, inter alia, to:

   •   respond effectively and promptly to developments in business and the organisation, making the
       “duties” independent of the organisational structure
   •   oversee and develop corporate know-how
   •   optimise the mobility process for resources

during the year a skills assessment project was launched within the context of the aforementioned                 g4-la11
framework in order to gain in-depth knowledge concerning human capital and initiate an optimisation
process.
this project involved around 160 managerial staff and around 170 professionals from all company
departments and analysed the skills required to meet the group’s strategic objectives. the project’s
outcomes will allow for targeted development strategies to be defined through job rotation and training
initiatives which will be tailored to each individual professional group.
a new assessment and performance appraisal model will be an integral part of this system.
measurement of performance is also related to payment of the variable parts of the remuneration. various
tools are used to do so, according to the type of corporate figures involved and the time horizon of the
results to which they refer:
     • long-term incentive plan, linked to multi-year corporate objectives, for senior managers who
         hold the most important positions in terms of achieving strategic objectives
     • mbo (management by objectives) for company management, which links the amount of individual
         bonuses to the degree of achievement of both company and individual targets, some of which
         coincide with the sustainability plan or are related to terna’s environmental and social commitments
         (e.g. occupational safety index)

in order to encourage productivity, terna also signed an agreement with the trade unions governing
a corporate-result bonus assigned to blue- and white-collar workers, which takes account of general
company trends and specific work-related employee targets.

           corporate welfare

           as in other large electricity companies, the treatment of employees at terna (pay, working hours, holiday,
           and other aspects of employment) is substantially better than the italian average.
           benefits are available for all employees including part-time workers and those with apprenticeship
           contracts, specifically:


g4-la2         •    supplementary health care
               •    supplementary pensions (voluntary participation)
               •    insurance for non-occupational injuries
               •    recreational associations
               •    more favourable maternity-leave conditions than those provided for by law
               •    subsidised loans for purchasing a home, as well as for serious family needs
               •    cafeteria service or meal coupons

           terna’s employees (excluding senior managers who have access to a different fund) are automatically
           signed up to the fisde supplementary health-care fund for employees of the gruppo enel.
           the fisde pays part of the cost of medical treatment of illnesses not only for its employee members, but
           also for their dependants.

           terna offers its employees a defined-contribution supplementary pension scheme on a voluntary basis.
           senior managers may participate in the fondenel pension fund (http://fondenel.previnet.it) which envisages
           contributions both from the senior manager and the company. other employees (blue-collar workers, white-
           collar workers, and junior executives) may sign up for the fopen pension fund (www.fondopensionefopen.it).
           in addition to the pension plans, the employees of the italian companies receive other defined-benefit
           payments.
           specifically, during their working life, all employees receive a contractual “loyalty bonus” when they reach
           their 25th and 35th year of employment at the company. while, upon terminating their employment, they
           receive the benefits due to all employees (termination benefits), senior managers hired or appointed up to
           28 february 1999 (allowance in lieu of notice), and blue- and white-collar workers and junior executives
           hired up to 24 july 2001 (additional months’ pay).

           funds is available in the annual financial report.

italian law regulates maternity and parental leave, providing for a general coverage, with respect to which
terna offers more favourable conditions, in application both of the national collective labour agreement
(ccnl) for the electricity industry and of company agreements. the most important measures are:

   •     five months of paid maternity leave, awarded to the mother and distributed before and after the
         birth. terna guarantees 100% of normal pay compared with the 80% provided for by law
   •     six further months of maternity leave paid at 30%. terna increases this to 45% and 40% respectively
         in the first and second month of use. the leave may be taken also by the father, within a maximum
         limit of ten months for the sum of both parents’ leave. if not used in the first years of the child’s life,
         the leave can also be used later, up to the age of twelve years, but will be unpaid
   •     unpaid leave (paid only in the case of serious disability), without limits on use, in the case of illness
         of children within their third year
   •     three days a month, or two hours a day, of leave to care for children or other family members (paid
         in the case of serious disability)
   •     extraordinary leave of two years in the case of serious disability of children or other close relations

the table below shows the number of employees who made use of parental leave for at least 29 days.

with respect to all the employees who made use of parental leave over the three-year period, one person
did not return to work and another was no longer at the company 12 months after their return.




internal communication

internal communication has a fundamental role in facilitating the exchange of information, creating
integration, promoting teamwork and improving processes. to this end, terna uses two macro-categories
of instruments: publications (print and on-line) and events (both social and those dedicated to employees).
below are the main initiatives for 2016.

      health & safety and correct working practices

      working in safety, without putting health at risk is a fundamental worker’s right and terna invests greatly
      in ensuring this is respected with regard to its staff.
      safety is part of the global corporate culture, and those who play a key role in operations are encouraged
      to be involved in paying close attention to these issues and how to improve on them.
      this applies more generally to respect for human and workers’ rights: the company undertakes to ensure
      that such rights are also guaranteed for those working for contractors.


      ensuring employee safety

      terna’s commitment to safety should be seen in the context of existing legislative provisions. the italian
      legislation on safety, (legislative decree 81/2008 “consolidated law on occupational health and safety”)
      is among the most stringent in europe and obliges companies to carry out a detailed assessment of the
      risks for workers’ health and safety. terna specifically focuses on analysing the risks deriving from the
      interference of the work of contractors and subcontractors, for all operations that make up the working
      process at construction sites. terna’s approach to safety at work hinges on a system of instruments that
      apply to all company processes, specifically:

                                                                                                 personnel   163




clear safety          the importance of protecting people from physical harm is affirmed
policy guidelines     in terna’s code of ethics. the company’s occupational safety policy
                      specifies the guidelines in the code of ethics, for example with an explicit
                      commitment to promoting accident prevention for all employees, including
                      contractors.


certified             the system covers 100% of company activities and is integrated with the
management            quality and environment system. it is based on scrupulous risk assessment,

                      of the risks deriving from corporate activities.

                      for verifying the application of regulations, is also present (employee safety
                      representatives, see indicator la6).
                      in regard to activities conducted on contract, terna carries out inspections
                      on its construction sites in order to verify the proper application of accident
                      prevention rules by the responsible security professionals and the contractors.

                      organised informative meetings. in 2016, more than 48,000 hours of training
                      were devoted to health and safety, of which over 60% were aimed at the
                      company’s blue-collar workers (further training indicators are available on
                      pages 158 and 206).
                      the equipment present in the viverone (biella) training centre makes it
                      possible, in particular, to carry out training on safety for climbing pylons
                      (through use of life-size training pylons) and for live-line work in a controlled
                      environment.

            applied research             a specific organisational unit of the engineering department tests safety
                                         materials and devices, measuring their reliability through resistance trials
                                         in extreme conditions (see also page 122).

                                         project was extended with the aim of identifying and analysing all unusual
                                         events, near misses and environmental accidents that occurred during
                                         working activities and that, although they had the potential to do so, did
                                         not harm people or the environment.
                                         this project is an extremely important tool for prevention activities as
                                         it allows for corrective and improvement strategies and actions to be
                                         prepared which are necessary to prevent the recurrence of potentially
                                         damaging events in the future.
                                         significant targeted training and guidance concerning the introduction of

                                         awareness and promote the culture of reporting unusual events and foster
                                         the transition from a passive approach to safety, consisting exclusively of
                                         regulations, procedures and technical rules, to an active approach, which
                                         sees the human element at the centre of the safety system.




             terna wins the “companies safety prize”

              terna has won the 4th edition of the “companies safety prize” awarded by confindustria and inail
              with patronage of the president of the republic and the technical collaboration of apqi (associazione
              premio qualità italia - italy quality prize association) and accredia (the italian accreditation body)
              for highlighting and sharing a business culture based on health and safety.
              this award, which was assigned after an in-depth examination of the policies and management
              structures of candidate companies, including direct interviews, is a clear recognition of terna’s
              leadership in using increasingly innovative solutions to protect worker health and safety, which are
              considered to be among the main indicators of a company culture that values safety as a strategic
              tool for maintaining and increasing its competitive advantage.

g4-la7
           as in previous years, in 2016 there were no fatal or grave occupational injuries suffered by the group’s
           employees. also with reference to fatal or grave injuries in years prior to the reporting period, there were
           no cases in which company liability was definitively determined. the total number of injuries was 28.
           both the injury frequency rate and the lost-day rate showed a reduction compared to the average for the
           previous three-year period. the absentee rate confirmed the downward trend (for more details on safety
           information and injury rates divided by type, see the key indicator tables on page 208).

 (*) as required by gri protocols, the definitions adopted are those provided for by the international labour organization (ilo). to facilitate
     comparison with other sources, the following notes show the figures of the same indicators calculated with alternative formulae. it was
     not considered necessary to further break down the data by region, because terna operates only in italy.
     injury rate. this is the number of injuries with at least one day’s abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during
     the year and multiplied by 200,000 (corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees). to facilitate comparison with
     other sources, this indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1,000,000 instead of 200,000 (consequently obtaining
     an injury rate five times that of the ilo). with this calculation method, the injury rate came out at 5.0 in 2016, 4.2 in 2015, and 6.3 in
     2014.
     lost-day rate. this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year, multiplied by 200,000.
     days not worked are calendar days, counted from when the injury occurred. to facilitate comparison with other sources, this indicator
     was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1,000. with this calculation method, the lost-day rate came out at 0.16 in 2016, 0.2
     in 2015, and 0.2 in 2014.
     absentee rate. this is the number of days of absence owing to illness, strikes and injuries out of the number of days worked in the
     same period, multiplied by 200,000. to facilitate comparison with other sources, this indicator was also calculated as a percentage of
     days worked. with this calculation method, the absentee rate came out at 3.4 in 2016, 3.6 in 2015, and 3.6 in 2014.
     occupational disease rate. this is the total number of cases of occupational disease divided by the hours worked in the year,
     multiplied by 200,000.
 (1) to calculate the lost-day rate, the days not worked related to injuries occurring in 2016 were considered together with any continued
     absence related to injuries occurring during the previous years, following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence.
 (2) the reasons for absence considered do not include maternity leave, marriage leave, study leave, leave for trade union activities, other
     cases of paid leave, and suspensions.
 (3) in 2016, as in previous years, no cases of work-related illness for terna employees was ascertained. no hours of absence were
     ascribable to occupational disease because the type of activities carried out by terna does not entail any work associated – on the
     basis of the official legal tables – with the possible onset of occupational diseases. terna’s occupational disease rate must therefore be
     considered to be always zero.

g4-la12    diversity and equal opportunities
g4-la13
           terna adopts systems for selecting, developing and paying personnel that recognise and reward merit.
           all forms of discrimination, beginning with the selection and hiring process, are explicitly forbidden by the
           group’s code of ethics.
           a large majority of employees are men because of the traditional scarcity of female labour supply in more
           technical occupations. however, the presence of women is increasing, partly as a result of the general
           trend in the labour market which has seen a greater participation of women.
           the percentage of female employees at terna in italy was 9.0% at the end of 2005 (the year in which terna
           gained operating autonomy) and has grown continually to reach 11.7% at the end of 2016. 20.2% of all
           new employees, net of blue-collar workers, are women (16.2% in 2015).
           the main indicators chosen by terna to monitor the equal treatment of men and women show that the
           management and development systems adopted do not disadvantage women. in particular, we note that
           the percentage of women managers relative to total managers (17.3%) is again in 2016 higher than the ratio
           of women to all employees, net of blue-collar workers (16.6%). remuneration figures also show limited
           gaps between white-collar workers and junior executives, with wider gaps for senior managers where,
           however, fewer individuals are considered and the differences in salary are therefore more influenced by
           individual figures.

methodological note


170   2016 sustainability report




      methodological note

      the sustainability report as at 31 december 2016 (hereinafter “sustainability report 2016”) of the
      terna group was prepared according to the gri-g4 guidelines and the g4 “sector disclosure-electric
      utilities” update issued in 2013 by gri - global reporting initiative. as in the last few years, the report
      was approved by terna s.p.a.’s board of directors and subjected to specific auditing procedures. the
      assurance report, prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers, is provided as an annex.
      the gri-g4 guidelines were applied according to the “core” option.
      the process of preparing the document involved identifying the significant aspects to report (see the
      “materiality” paragraph below) and presenting the performance achieved by the group in relation to such
      aspects and the sustainability targets.
      the period of observation is the year 2016; all data refer to the financial year ending on 31 december 2016.
      at the descriptive level, the significant changes occurring up to 28 february 2017 have also been indicated.
      in compliance with the principles outlined by the international integrated reporting council (iirc), terna
      has published, with reference to 2016, the integrated report coinciding with the report on operations
      in the annual financial report, which also refers to many of the subjects covered in this sustainability
      report. the discussion of the aforementioned topics is the same in both reports, except where further
      detail is required pursuant, for example, to specific requirements in the gri guidelines. the sustainability
      issues included in the integrated report were chosen based on materiality considerations.


      materiality

      in 2013, terna conducted a materiality analysis in line with the gri-g4 standard, resulting in the matrix
      that offers a compact assessment of significance from the point of view of group management and
      stakeholders. this matrix was updated in 2014 and then maintained in 2015.
      based on changes to the company, new tools activated by terna to manage stakeholders and growing
      external emphasis on the issue (e.g. amendments made to the requirements for certain iso certifications),
      in 2016 terna decided it was appropriate to fully revise the analysis. the revision process began with
      updating the thematic tree, completed through the analysis of internal and external sources of data,
      making it possible to identify and detail significant issues at the current time.
      in addition to a comprehensive review of the terminological description of the issues, one of the most
      important changes was the addition of “strategic approach to stakeholder management” as a transversal
      aspect, which arose following the growing attention paid to this concept, on both a national and
      international scale.
      after the thematic tree was updated, 22 interviews were carried out with management from all company
      departments to discuss relationships with stakeholders in general, and more specifically the relative
      significance of the issues to be placed on the materiality matrix.
      in regard to the updating of the “relevance for terna” dimension, the interview concentrated on the
      importance attributed by management to the themes, considering how they are reflected in internal rules,
      procedures, policies and guidelines, targets and allocated resources, as well as actual projects and
      activities. this relevance actually conveyed the level of commitment already established by the group and
      structured in relation to each theme.
      the updating of the “relevance for stakeholders” dimension began with the information held by the
      departments related to the requests and opinions of stakeholders for which they are responsible,
      information that can be derived from many sources:

          •    direct, targeted and structured engagement initiatives (e.g. climate surveys, customer satisfaction
               surveys, focus groups)
          •    opinions expressed by stakeholders during the course of their relationship with terna (e.g. e-mail
               exchanges, meeting minutes, alignment meetings)
          •    opinions expressed independently by stakeholders and passively acknowledged by terna (e.g.
               press and web reviews, position papers, press releases)
          •    evaluations made on opinions gained over time in relation to stakeholders

                                                                                                                                                                methodological note   171



 the materiality matrix summarises corporate and stakeholder perspectives, allowing for:

                                        •    “material” themes to be identified, namely those most important for terna and of the greatest
                                             interest to stakeholders
                                        •    the degree of alignment or misalignment between stakeholder perspectives and terna’s perspective
                                             on each theme

 on the matrix, issues of greater importance are farther away from the origin, on both axes.

 in reviewing the materiality matrix, the single g4 aspects have been considered in constructing the
 thematic tree. it was therefore not deemed necessary to provide proof of the materiality of the same
 aspects with dedicated thematic matrices, as done for previous publications of the sustainability report.

172   2016 sustainability report




      scope and indicators

      the data and information in the 2016 sustainability report refer to the terna group, that is to say the scope
      which includes terna s.p.a. and the companies that were consolidated in the consolidated financial
      statements for the year ending 31 december 2016. the tamini group companies are the exception -
      unless explicitly indicated otherwise. compared to the group’s scope at 31 december 2016, the data in
      this report covers 95.1% of the group’s revenue.
      certain environmental and social indicators are available for the tamini group, which are shown in the key
      indicator tables.
      in accordance with the principle of materiality, the data included in the sustainability report include all
      the companies with a significant impact on sustainability (i.e. by size or rather the number of employees;
      or by potential impact on the environment and society or rather the number of operations/activities which
      took place during the year), over which terna s.p.a. exercises control, directly or indirectly, that is to say
      for which it has the power to determine the financial and operational policies. there are no relations with
      joint-ventures, other subsidiaries or leased businesses that could significantly influence the boundary or
      the comparability of the environmental and social data.
      the scope of environmental data for the terna group for 2016 does not include the impact of former rfi
      electrical substations acquired at the end of 2015. during 2016, in fact, these assets were managed via a
      contract stipulated with the previous owners and only at the end of the year were some of the substations
      integrated into the management scope of the terna group. from 2017, it will be possible to identify/
      estimate environmental data for substations progressively integrated into the scope of the terna group.
      throughout 2016, overseas activities did not involve any operations managed directly by the group
      that were of significant external impact. for this reason, such activities have not been included in the
      calculation of the indicators published in this report. data for montenegrin subsidiary terna crna gora
      d.o.o. is included within the scope of sustainability indicators however, except where explicitly indicated
      otherwise.
      the data were calculated precisely on the basis of the entries in the general accounting and terna’s other
      information systems. in the case of estimates in determining the indicators, the procedure followed is
      stated.
      all the gri indicators published are listed below in the gri-g4 content index, which also includes any
      limitations relative to the requirements.

                                                                                             methodological note   173



comparative analysis of sustainability performance

convinced that a comparison of environmental, social and governance performance is of interest, not only
to the company itself, but also to its stakeholders, certain comparisons between terna’s results and those
of other companies are included in the 2016 sustainability report, as was the case in previous years. the
comparative sustainability indicators regard the following themes: co2 emissions, sf6 leakage incidence
rate, hours of training per capita provided to employees and the turnover rate on termination of personnel.
listed below are the main criteria adopted in the analysis, as an introduction to the reading and
interpretation of the comparisons of individual indicators in the report:

   •   three panels of companies were identified: the first was composed of the european transmission
       system operators and the major non-european operators in terms of kilometres of lines managed;
       the second, multi-sectoral in nature, is made up of large italian companies (the 40 listed companies
       of the ftse mib at 13/09/2016); the third formed by the best international performers in the “electric
       utilities - elc” sector (identified by the robecosam sustainability rating agency and included in the
       dow jones sustainability world index of september 2016). the aim of the three panels it to ensure,
       also in relation to the type of indicator under examination, a comparison between companies with
       the same operating characteristics, an italian comparison and a comparison with top international
       performers in the same sector; among the companies in the three panels, consideration has been
       given to those who publicise information that is useful for making comparisons on their website
       with the sustainability report (even if this has not been drafted according to gri guidelines) or via
       other documentation (hse report, financial report, etc.). this led to a reduction in the sample
       compared to the number of companies in the starting panel: the comparative analysis entails
       reference to 2015 data, since the comparisons were drafted when the 2016 reports were still being
       prepared, as was the case for terna.

it must be noted that, despite the exclusion of data which were explicitly not consistent, in numerous
cases doubts remain as to the actual comparability between companies, especially in instances where
significant discrepancies exist between the declared data of some companies and the average value of
the reference group.
in the co2 emissions comparison, the data are expressed as physical quantities in absolute terms
and therefore show very different levels depending on the type of production activity and the size of
the company. in this case, the comparison provides information on the varying significance of the
environmental aspects being considered for the individual companies, but does not fulfil the task of
making the performance comparable.

the united nations sustainable development goals
(sdgs)

approved in september 2015 by the 193 member states of the united nations, the 17 sustainable
development goals (sdgs) form the core of the 2030 agenda, the global plan intended to eliminate
poverty and promote economic prosperity, social development and environmental protection within the
next 15 years.
compared to the 8 millennium development goals (mdgs) contained in the previous agenda published
in 2000, and which concluded in 2015, this new universal pact summarises the “5p” formula - people,
planet, prosperity, peace and partnership - the major priorities of mankind: to eliminate the main causes of
poverty and focus on lasting development for all via a sustainable route that is able to integrate economic,
social and environmental aspects and to identify new opportunities for growth at the same time.
it is important to note that, unlike for the mdgs, the countries that adhered to the sdgs are required to
formulate national support strategies. therefore companies can also measure themselves against national
targets, with which they can compare their undertakings. to that effect, an additional important change
in regards to the past is constituted by global compact’s active role in urging companies to accept the
common challenge presented by the sdgs, thereby combining the capacity for identifying new business
opportunities with responsible practices.
the 17 sdgs are divided into 169 sub-objectives that touch on many sustainability issues (see
“transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development”30). the following table shows
the relationship between the issues and the gri indicators published within this report, which is the
result of the adoption of the “sdg compass” guide prepared by gri, un global compact and the world
business council for sustainable development (wbcsd)31.

key indicator tables


192   2016 sustainability report




      key indicator tables

      the following tables present the indicators provided for by the g4 “sustainability reporting guidelines”,
      together with additional indicators which terna believes it is important to publish in order to show its
      corporate social responsibility performance. some data already presented in the body of the report are
      also shown for completeness.

      for each indicator, the tables show:
         • the unit of measure
         • the figures for 2016, 2015 and 2014
         • if significant, the absolute change between 2016 and 2015
         • if significant, the percentage change between 2016 and 2015. it is possible that this change does
             not correspond to that calculable from the tabulated figures which are generally rounded to one
             decimal place

      data are usually calculated as of 31 december and flow indicators regard the entire year.
      to facilitate reading the indicators, the following table shows the units of measure in which they are
      expressed. see also the table of acronyms found after the indicators.

(1) value-added is a measurement of the income of a company, and that of a whole economy, during a given period (usually one year).
    in corporate accounting terms, value added is calculated by subtracting costs incurred for procuring intermediary goods and services
    necessary for production from the value of production itself (revenue associated with goods and services produced during the year). these
    costs do not include labour costs, which are instead part of the value the company adds, through its activities, to intermediary goods and
    services. the difference between sales revenue from the final product and the cost of raw materials (and support services) is value added.
    other than the cost of labour, value added also includes profits and the share of income allocated to paying interest on debts or taxes.
(2) the amounts relative to the creation and distribution of the value added are taken from the consolidated financial statements, which were
    prepared according to the international accounting standards ifrs/ias. specifically, the terna group has used the ifrs/ias international
    accounting standards since 2005.
(3) return on capital for 2016 refers to the advance distributed in november 2016 (€ 144.9 million) and to the balance proposed to the meeting
    of the bod in the session on 15 march 2017 (€ 269.1 million).

(1) the 2015 figure was recalculated with the final data from the same year, for this reason it is different from the one given in the 2015
    sustainability report. the data on power supplied for 2016 should be considered as provisional.
(2) the asa indicator measures ntg service availability. calculated as the ratio between the sum of energy not supplied to users connected
    to the ntg (ens) and the energy put into the grid. as of the date of drafting this document, the 2016 values have not yet been totalled or
    approved by the aeegsi.
(3) average number of short and long blackouts. calculated as the ratio between number of users directly connected to the ntg involved in
    the outages and number of users of the ntg. as of the date of drafting this report, the 2016 values are not yet available.
(4) average duration of electricity system (ntg) power outage in a year. calculated as a ratio between energy not supplied in a given period
    (ens figure) and average power absorbed by the electricity system during the considered period. the 2016 values are not available at the
    time of publishing this report.
(5) the index also includes energy not supplied to directly connected users as a result of events regarding other connection grids that are not
    part of the ntg and a figure for energy not supplied owing to events of force majeure or significant incidents (“significant incident” is taken
    to mean any blackout with net energy not supplied of more than 250 mwh. the figure that impacts on the rens index is the percentage
    that decreases, as the energy not supplied for the single incident identified increases). the lower the level of the indicator, the better the
    service performance. at the time of publication, the totals for the rens indicator for 2016 had not yet been released by aeegsi.

           (1) in 2014, the impact from leakage included an event that occurred in a substation which resulted in the loss of 784.1 kg of sf6, equivalent
               to 26% of the total losses recorded.
           (2) the conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 (sulphur hexafluoride) and refrigerant gas leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is
               calculated this year using the parameters indicated in the ipcc fifth assessment report (ar5) and greenhouse gas protocol (ghg)
               initiative. this led to a change in the equivalent tonnes of sf6 and refrigerant gas and total direct emissions compared to that which
               was previously published. until 2014, data on refrigerant gas leaks was only collected for r22. data collection for r407c and r410a
               began in 2015 (it is estimated that the percentage of coverage for the total data is equal to 85%). in 2015 there were no r22 leaks.
               indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the total italian electricity
               production for 2015. the reference for the division of the production mix is the “monthly report on the electricity system” with the results
               for december 2015, available on the website www.terna.it.
           (3) the terna helicopter fleet has been operational since 2015.

(2) in order to evaluate co2 deriving from the air travel of employees, the conversion factors indicated by the greenhouse gas protocol
    initiative have been used.
(3) the table shows the vehicles in the terna fleet which, in the period in question, filled up at least once as recorded on the fuel card. only
    operating vehicles are considered. for information on the consumption of the company fleet, see the following fuel consumption tables.
(4) the figure is calculated on the basis of the values provided by car manufacturers in logbooks and on the mileage estimates of said vehicles.
    the value expressed in the table represents 68.2% of the company fleet for 2015 (in 2014, it referred to 66.2% of the fleet and, in 2013,
    62.7%).

(1) this includes only the special waste from the production process, not that produced by service activities (urban waste). this does not
    include waste relative to sewage and waste deriving from septic tanks, coming from substations not connected to the sewer network.
    the amount of sewage and septic tanks amounted to 789 tonnes in 2016, 680 tonnes in 2015 and 383 tonnes in 2014. in 2014, waste
    identified as “other emulsions” (amounting to 857 tonnes) produced during an accident that occurred in an operating area was also
    excluded.

(1) “per employee” includes all company employees, including executives.
(2) the figures regard the incentives paid to all employees, including executives. fringe benefits are excluded.
(3) this figure regards the number of non-contractual absences during the year (illness, accident, leave of absence, strike, unpaid absence).
(4) this is the number of days of absence owing to illness, strikes and injuries out of the number of days worked in the same period, multiplied
    by 200,000. to facilitate comparison with other sources, this indicator was also calculated as a percentage of days worked. with this
    calculation method, the absentee rate came out at 3.4 in 2016, 3.6 in 2015, and 3.6 in 2014. the reasons for absence considered do not
    include maternity leave, marriage leave, study leave, leave for trade union activities, other cases of paid leave, and suspensions.
(5) the duration of employment takes into account previous employment, in the case of employees joining terna following acquisitions of
    business units.

           (1) the outflows (inflows) for women and men show the ratio of employees divided by gender who left (joined) in the year to total employees
               divided by gender at 31 december of the previous year.
           (2) the figure is obtained from the ratio between promotions to junior executive that occurred during the year and employees categorised as
               white-collar workers in the previous year, calculated by gender. promotions from blue-collar worker to white-collar worker and from junior
               executive to senior executive were not considered, because the number was not significant on an annual basis.
           (3) the figure is the result of the ratio between the annual basic pay for women for the different grades and the annual basic pay for men for
               the same grades. the figure was not calculated for blue-collar workers because there are no women in that category.
           (4) the figure is the result of the percentage ratio between the total annual remuneration for women for the different grades and the total annual
               remuneration for men for the same grades. the total remuneration includes, besides basic pay, production bonuses, the different types of
               incentives and the value of the benefits received over the year.

(1) this is the number of injuries with at least one day’s abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and
    multiplied by 200,000 (corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees). to facilitate comparison with other sources, this
    indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1,000,000 instead of 200,000 (consequently obtaining an injury rate five times
    that of the ilo). with this calculation method, the injury rate came out at 5.0 in 2016, 4.2 in 2015, and 6.3 in 2014.
(2) this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year, multiplied by 200,000. days not worked are
    calendar days, counted from when the injury occurred. to facilitate comparison with other sources, this indicator was also calculated using
    a multiplication factor of 1,000. with this calculation method, the lost-day rate came out at 0.2 in 2016, 0.2 in 2015, and 0.2 in 2014. to
    calculate the lost-day rate, the days not worked related to injuries occurring in 2016 were considered together with any continued absence
    related to injuries occurring during the previous years, following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence.
(3) this is the total number of cases of occupational disease divided by the hours worked in the year, multiplied by 200,000. in 2016, as in
    previous years, no cases of work-related illness for terna employees was ascertained. the type of activities carried out by terna does not
    entail any work associated – on the basis of the official legal tables – with the possible onset of occupational diseases. terna’s occupational
    disease rate must therefore be considered to be always zero.
(4) inspections performed by the sppm (safety, prevention and protection managers) and the operational transmission area managers.
(5) this is the number of injuries with at least one day’s abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and
    multiplied by 200,000 (corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees). to facilitate comparison with other sources, this
    indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1,000,000 instead of 200,000 (consequently obtaining an injury rate five times
    that of the ilo). with this calculation method, the injury rate came out at 1.5 in 2016, 2.2 in 2015, and 3.8 in 2014.

(1) this is the number of injuries with at least one day’s abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and
    multiplied by 200,000 (corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees). to facilitate comparison with other sources, this
    indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1,000,000 instead of 200,000 (consequently obtaining an injury rate five times
    that of the ilo). with this calculation method, the injury rate came out at 19.52 in 2016 and 22.49 in 2015.
(2) this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year, multiplied by 200,000. days not worked are
    calendar days, counted from when the injury occurred. to facilitate comparison with other sources, this indicator was also calculated using
    a multiplication factor of 1,000. with this calculation method, the lost-day rate came out at 0.53 in 2016 and 0.58 in 2015.
