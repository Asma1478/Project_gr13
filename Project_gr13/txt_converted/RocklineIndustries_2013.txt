            this year was a great year for rockline industries. our company grew and expanded at
            numerous sites adding over 130 jobs; we introduced new products to the marketplace,
            and we achieved key milestones in our sustainability program.



from the    rockline’s environmental sustainability program is now in its fifth year. as in the previous
            four, our mission is to take positive steps towards a more environmentally sustainable
            business. this report highlights the activities and initiatives that are helping get us closer



president
            to that mission.

            this year many of our customers increased their focus on environmental sustainability,
            which pushed us to deliver even better results. we welcome the increased interaction
            from our suppliers and customers as our collaborative efforts result in a better
            environment for the consumers of our products.

            we continue to drive toward our 2015 targets in energy, waste, and landfill rate.
            additionally, we have finally charted a consistent downward trend in our wastewater
            metric driving down wastewater 2% from our 2009 baseline.

            we also implemented our second generation of the green score tool—a newer, more
            user-friendly tool that gives a snapshot of the environmental impacts of our raw
            material choices and helps us get closer to our aspiration of creating more ecologically
            intelligent products.

            our logistics team has further expanded rockline’s use of pool point and intermodal
            shipping, just a few of the many innovative ways they have found to optimize shipments
            and reduce the carbon footprint of our shipping network.

            the purpose of this report is to give a quantitative and transparent account of our
            progress against our sustainability goals. we want to fulfill our mission of delivering
            long-term value for our stakeholders while respecting the environment we all share.
            to do this, we must always show continuous improvement.

            thank you for taking the time to read this report. as always, we welcome your feedback.

our geothermal        rockline’s booneville, ark. facility has introduced a number of large-scale

initiative in
rockline’s history.   more importantly, rockline’s geothermal system
                      has now doubled in size: currently, it boasts 240
                      wells that measure 400 feet in depth.
                      using a closed-loop water-pipe works, the system sends water 400 feet
                      below the earth’s surface, which naturally stabilizes the water at 60° fahr-
                      enheit. in the hot summer months, the water then proceeds through a
                      chiller, and a fan system blows the chilled air into the production rooms.
                      similarly, in the warm months, the water runs through a hot coil, and the
                      warm air is used to heat the production rooms. because the system oper-
                      ates from a year-round 60° baseline, it uses less energy than traditional
                      hvac systems and enables rockline to maintain internal production tem-

                      products a better value to its customers.

differently.          therefore, rockline defines wastewater as any water that is not a
                      component of the products we manufacture. our wastewater metric
                      focuses on reducing the amount of water consumed by rockline outside
                      of the finished product.

                      this includes:
                            • water used in the creation of the wet wipe lotions that are
                              wasted due to line inefficiencies
                            • water used to generate steam, which gives basket-style
                              coffee filters and baking cups their distinctive shapes
                            • water used in quality testing and cleaning
                            • water used by employees

                      rockline will never sacrifice product quality to
                      save water, but focusing on more efficient water
                      use, even in testing and cleaning, is a priority.

solid waste
the result of the    reducing waste ultimately means reducing the virgin natural resources
                     needed to produce a finished good.
inefficient use of
raw materials.
                     rockline focuses on measuring, reducing, and
                     eliminating waste from our manufacturing
                     processes to provide better value to our customers.
                     rockline defines solid waste as all waste leaving our facility regardless of how
                     it is generated or handled. for example, our coffee filter production
                     generates a high amount of waste because the round filters are cut from
                     square sheets of paper. even though the paper scrap is recycled, it is still
                     considered waste, because a truly efficient process would use all of the
                     paper.

                     because solid waste is generated—and thus reduced—differently in coffee
                     filter converting and wet wipe converting, we have separate metrics and set
                     different goals for each.

                          our landfill avoidance initiatives are captured in the landfill rate metric. to
                          calculate our landfill rate, we divide the amount of waste sent to landfill by the
