     our governance, ethics and business principles

     at the nse, we recognise the importance of corporate governance as a key element in achieving our vision and, therefore,
     ensure that we infuse best practices into all our activities to guarantee the highest level of business conduct in dealing
     with our stakeholders. we believe that eﬀective and eﬃcient governance contributes to improved business
     performance, and thus operate with integrity to maintain the trust of investors, customers, employees and other
     stakeholders.

     furthermore, based on our conviction that adopting and operating in accordance with high standards of corporate
     governance is essential for a company's sustainable long-term growth, performance, and value creation, we
     continuously encourage and support listed companies and dealing member ﬁrms to establish global best practices with
     respect to corporate governance for the beneﬁt of the listed companies, the continuous development of the nigerian
     capital market, and the sustainable development of the economy.

     the council is responsible for providing oversight for nse's business and ﬁnancial aﬀairs, strategy, structures and
     policies; monitoring the exercise of any delegated authority; and dealing with challenges and issues relating to corporate
     governance, corporate social responsibility and corporate ethics. as nse is a self-regulatory organisation (sro), the
     council – which currently comprises 13 members – is also responsible for ensuring that it meets all the conditions of its
     license as prescribed by the apex regulator of the nigerian capital market, the securities and exchange commission,
     further to the investment and securities act, 2007.

     the day-to-day management of nse is vested in the hands of the chief executive oﬃcer (ceo), who is assisted by the
     executive committee of management. the council also established seven (7) committees to facilitate eﬀective discharge
     of its oversight responsibilities and eﬃcient decision-making.


     ethics in business

     business ethics is totally entrenched in our governance structure. it constitutes the cornerstone of our csr and
     represents an integral part of our risk management strategy. at nse, we work hard to ensure that these ethics are
     projected in our daily operations and apply to all our stakeholders. consequently, we have developed codes of conduct,
     which set out the ethical and behavioural framework that governs our operations and the corporate governance rating
     system (cgrs) to maintain our business integrity. showing the eﬃcacy of our procedure, we did not record any sanctions
     for non-compliance with rules and regulations.


     sustainable business principles in our supply chain

     at the nse, we expect our suppliers to be predisposed towards ethical standards and we strive to ensure that our
     products and services are sourced responsibly. we are, therefore, committed to ensuring that our supply chain operates
     ethically in line with the gri supply chain governing codes, as well as the united nations global compact supply chain
     laws.


     we engage in ongoing consultation with our suppliers as regarding the management of social and environmental issues,
     helping and encouraging them to adopt best practices in managing their business functions.

     our procurement procedures involve treating suppliers fairly, selecting vendors based on value, performance and price,
     providing justiﬁable and transparent selection decisions, ensuring conﬁdentiality of supplier information, and ensuring
     that suppliers are assessed based on standardised iso criteria for pre-qualiﬁcation of vendors/contractors of the nse.

     materiality assessment

     at the nse, what matters to our stakeholders matters to us. our approach to materiality builds on our established
     engagement processes to strengthen not only our csr strategy, but our overall business strategy. following the
     stakeholder engagement sessions conducted, we have carefully determined and outlined our material issues as follows:

                 •                   support listed companies
                 •                   uncompetitive listing fees

                 •                   increased collaboration with operators, agencies and other listings
                 •                   varied products and reduced cost of transactions
                 •                   better compensation and staﬀ engagement activities
                 •                   promote more listings

centre, oke odo junior college, abule egba, lagos – 14/12/2015



the nse recognises that the education sector in nigeria has suﬀered severe neglect in the past, which has led to a general
decline in our standard of education. according to a research paper by the united states embassy in nigeria, an
estimated 10 million out of the 30 million school-aged children are not enrolled in school; the average senior secondary
certiﬁcate examination (ssce) pass rate over the last 5 years is about 29% and there are academic staﬀ shortages in all
areas, particularly in the critical areas of science and technology.

therefore, to build a pipeline of future leaders who can serve country and companies, the nse initiated the “adopt-a-
school” initiative, which was launched with the commissioning of a learning and development centre donated to oke
odo junior college, abule egba, lagos. the initiative is aimed at addressing the challenges experienced by schools in
nigeria through facility and process improvement, teachers' empowerment, and students' intellectual advancement.
this is implemented through a structured approach of facility and process improvement, empowerment of teachers and
the advancement of students' intellectual capacity.

the nse supports strategies that contribute to knowledge
development that can be transferred to other generations
and that add value to the society. in september 2015, the
nse commenced the process of donating capital market
related books to universities across 20 states in nigeria.
this project was aimed at providing materials that will
address the need of reference materials on the nigerian
capital market in our tertiary institutions. over 50 federal
and state universities have beneﬁted from this project.

     group excursions

     at the nse, we frequently host ﬁeld-trip tours of our trading ﬂoors across the country. this educative session gives
     students a 'live' view of what happens at a stock exchange and opens them up to the idea of seeking career opportunities
     in the capital market in the future. the schools visits provide a platform where young people and the general public can
     understand the operations of the stock exchange and nigerian capital market. in 2015, we had over 25 successful tours
     and 1,578 participants.


     2015 world cancer day

     fighting cancer is a key health focus for the nse, and world cancer day is an ideal opportunity to spread the word and
     raise the awareness of cancer, a disease that kills as much as 80,000 nigerians annually. the global cancer epidemic is
     huge and is set to rise. currently, 8.2 million people die from cancer worldwide every year, out of which, 4 million people
     die prematurely (aged 30 to 69 years).

     for 2015, world cancer day at the nse was observed through a 5-day internal & external interactive communication
     campaign from february 1 to 5, 2015, to raise awareness about the disease and to develop practical strategies to address
     the increasing cancer burden.

     global money week

     in line with our commitment to improve financial literacy and inclusion in nigeria, we commemorated the 2015 global
     money week in partnership with financial literacy steering committee. the nse hosted and participated in series of
     educational programmes during the week aimed at engaging young people in knowledge sharing about how money
     works, savings, investing, creating livelihood, gaining employment and entrepreneurship.

     we were able to directly reach over 200 students from over 15 secondary and primary schools across our operating
     environment. the event commenced with an interactive session on money & investing, which was moderated by the
     head, corporate services division, mr. bola adeeko. his opening remarks highlighted that the nse was on a journey of
     building a ﬁnancially savvy generation and urged the students both to become ambassadors of the nigerian capital
     market and participate in the 2015 essay competition.



     there was also a presentation by mr. abimbola babalola on various means of earning, spending and growing money with
     particular emphasis on investing. this was followed by a speech from mr. david adonri, ceo, equity capital solutions who
     took the students through the beneﬁts of shareholding.

     from the interactive session, the students were ushered to the trading ﬂoor where representatives from the schools
     were selected to ascend the podium with facilitators at the session to discuss knowledge gained at the session.

productivity. at the nse, our employees can communicate their concerns and questions conﬁdentially. we understand
and value diversity and inclusion, and, therefore, maintain a workplace free from harassment, and report potential
violations to the company without fear of retaliation. fortunately, we did not have any reported grievances about labor
practices during the reporting period and no reported incidence of discrimination. the nse does not practice collective
bargaining and as such, none of our employees are bound by collective bargaining agreement.


at the nse, employee satisfaction is critical to our operations. we. therefore, work to ensure open lines of
communication, and in 2015, we responded to the need for better compensation and increased staﬀ engagement with a
stream of unique policies and programmes.


employee volunteering

members of staﬀ at the nse support our local communities through the corporate entity or personally. investing in
communities is a long-standing tradition which has continued to receive positive feedback from employees. the nse
employee volunteering scheme was formally launched in 2015 after 2 years of working with employees to build
connectedness between employees and our operating environment. for the ﬂagship project, a special need focus was
unanimously selected by the csr champions and pacelli school for the blind and partially sighted children was chosen
as beneﬁciary.

for the ﬂagship project, a charity-based organisation that provides free education to less privileged children in our
operating community. it provides only boarding facility which houses over 130 students within the primary school age
range. the school has been in existence since 1962 and it is solely run on donations from individuals, groups and
organisations.

currently, we run bi-weekly reading and mentoring programmes at the school. we also had a food drive in november,
2015, with the school library and medical center upgraded also in 2015.

     training and skills development

     since we have created an enabling work environment, our employees maintain good relationships and support
     themselves internally, complementing one another in required areas and upholding team spirit. however, we train our
     employees at all levels to upgrade their skills. our employees periodically participate in both internal and external
     training programmes, which broadly cover soft skills, technical/functional skills and professional certiﬁcations.

     in 2015 alone, we had our employees at all levels participate in 93 training and development programmes. we educate,
     train and communicate our ethics and anti-corruption policies and procedures to all our employees irrespective of
     category or region and we did not record any form of discrimination during the reporting period.

     employee informal support
     in our employees lie our productivity, so we support them in as many areas as we can. knowing that their families are
     important to their satisfaction, we are very proud to have devised means of bringing their families closer to them. we
     have a fully equipped crèche within the building premises at our headquarters that provide excellent childcare to
     employees' wards. in addition, our married employees are entitled to parental leave-both male & female .

     in 2015, we had 96 females and 190 male staﬀ entitled to such paid leaves with the male employees entitled to 1 week
     paid paternity leave, while the female employees enjoyed a paid 4-month maternity leave. however, 5 male employees
     and 8 female employees were granted parental leave, out of which after 12 months, 4 female employees out of 5 were still
     employed with us, while all 8 male employees remained with us.


     nse activity centre

     the nse activity centre which comprises of the crèche, the gymnasium and the café was established in 2014 as a
     company initiative designed to support employee lifestyle and well – being.

     the crèche which is managed by professional child minders and educators, provides care and preschool learning for
     employees’ children during working hours in a conducive, friendly, and healthy learning environment within the
     company premises at no extra cost to the employees.

     the gymnasium sited within the premises of the head oﬃce is designed to encourage and support employee wellness
     and ﬁtness at no cost to the employee.

     the cafe and bar provide a relaxing environment which caters for a healthy variety of food and drinks and some light
     entertainment for employees at aﬀordable costs within the oﬃce premises.
     in 2015, the activity centre’s facilities continued to enable employees’ work-life balance and in so doing improved the
     company’s attractiveness to external talent, enhanced employee inclusion and helped to sustain company’s overall
32   talent retention strategies.

the implementation of innovations required to deliver a robust and eﬃcient capital market, in addition to identifying new
opportunities. in 2015, our activities were focused on improving our regulatory function, initiating new collaborations for
policy formulation, introducing new products into the market and encouraging reporting and monitoring practices for

nigerian capital market sustainability conference
on november 13, 2015, the nigerian stock exchange in partnership with ernst & young (ey) and global reporting
initiative (gri) hosted the inaugural nigerian capital market sustainability conference (ncmsc) in lagos, nigeria. the
event included a half day conference and a ceo roundtable themed, “business transformation through transparency”.
the conference provided a platform to discuss the business value of sustainable investment, enhancing corporate
transparency and ultimately performance on environmental, social and governance (esg) issues as well as reveal how
companies, investors and regulators can better collaborate to unlock the potential of the private sector in tackling
sustainability related challenges.

the conference included three break-out sessions on good corporate governance: key to sustainability, sustainability
reporting in the financial services industry and environmental, health, safety and social audits. the conference was a
huge success and led to the participants deliberating on likely sustainability indicators and provided recommendations
for “the nigerian capital market sustainability disclosure guidelines”.
