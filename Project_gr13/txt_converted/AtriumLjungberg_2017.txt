               just under half of our total rental value, which means development of the retail sector is important to us.
               despite several challenges, the retail sector continued to develop robustly in 2016.

fashion ­department store
rådhuset is one of uppsala’s most well-known
profile buildings, and it is an important landmark.
few places in uppsala – if any – have a history that
is as long and exciting as rådhuset’s. a great deal
has taken place in the building, which was
damaged by city-wide fires twice, in 1702 and
1766. we bought the building in 2006 and carefully
renovated it, showing the utmost respect for the
soul and history of the building, and since 2012
rådhuset has been a fashion department store.

emissions which are generated from visitors' journeys are based on a rough estimate
of habits and travel patterns. emissions from heating consumption are weighted to an
average year. emission figures for calculating emissions from oil, pellets, electricity,
district cooling, air travel and company cars have been obtained from the relevant
supplier. emission figures for district heating were obtained from the swedish district
heating association. emission figures for car journeys to our retail hubs and service
10 km correspond to a general car, according to the swedish environmental
protection agency. we use ‘nordenmix’ as the basis for calculating emissions from
tenants that have their own electricity subscription.

investments and projects




      investments in our
      own properties,
      acquisitions and sales

       property development is an important aspect of atrium
      ljungberg’s value growth. our existing project portfolio will enable us
      to invest the equivalent of approximately sek 11 billion in the future.
      the goal is to invest sek 1 billion per year in our own development
      ­projects, where new build and extension projects yield a return of
       20 per cent, thus generating good value growth within the company and
       growth in the company’s cash flows. the projects help us achieve our
       growth objective of a 10 per cent increase in the operating net per annum.

      in terms of area, half of our project portfolio consists of
      residentials and half of offices, retail, education and hotels. the project
      portfolio is divided among all of our areas where sickla and uppsala
      account for approximately 70 per cent.

      the rate at which we can complete the projects depends on the
      market situation and the progress made in the detailed development
      plan process. these issues are handled by our business development
      staff on a daily basis in close collaboration with internal resources such as
      project managers and market area managers, but principally with our
      customers and partners. a project market area is not usually started
      until we have secured a minimum return in the form of signed lease
      contracts.

      we acquire properties to create value growth or to obtain strategic
      benefits. this pertains both to acquiring land in order to gain access to
      development rights for future development projects and to acquiring
      investment properties that have development potential.

directors’ report internal control




internal control
the board of directors is, subject to the provisions of the swedish companies act and the swedish code of
corporate governance, responsible for the company’s internal control. this report has been prepared in accordance
with chapter. 6, §6 of the swedish annual accounts act and is consequently limited to internal control in respect of the
financial reporting. the company has, in order to describe the internal control, followed the framework established by
coso (the committee of sponsoring organisations), which comprises five components, namely control environment,
risk management and assessment, control activities, information and communication, and follow-up work.
