                       our environmentally friendly
                       energy production

•   finland’s energy production is based on coal, oil, nuclear power, hydropower, natural
    gas, wind power, peat and wood.
•   the jyväskylä energy group aims to produce energy in as an environmentally
    friendly way as possible, mainly with wood and peat sourced from the province.
•   the advantages of our fuel selection include renewability of raw materials and
    provinciality.
•   waste recovery is also advancing: biogas combustion into district heat at the
    mustankorkea waste treatment centre began at christmas 2003.
•   97% of the power plants’ ashes were utilised e.g. as forest fertilizers and in land
    construction.
•   we invest in energy saving e.g. by developing heat storage and providing advice on
    energy saving. we are committed to the promotion of sensible energy use by having
    signed the energy efficiency agreement in business and industry.
•   in accordance with our certified system, we meet the standards and provisions
    issued by the authorities and environmental legislation.
•   the possibilities and financial feasibility of solar energy production were assessed as
    part of the jyväskylän kangas project.

                     je group’s year 2013,
                     the plus points
•   the use of wood reached the record-high level of 44.5 % of the fuel flow of
    our power plants. the use of wood will increase in accordance with the
    company’s strategy.
•   carbon dioxide emissions fell due to the increased share of wood fuel.
•   almost all ashes were utilised (97%).
•   the water business commissioned the renovated janakka water production
    plant.
•   the renovation of the sewage network has served to reduce the number of
    water leaks in korpilahti and tikkakoski, among others.
•   our price of district heat was lower than the average price in the ten largest
    cities in finland.
•   the number of occupational accidents was record-low.
•   among our new strategy-driven projects are a reporting service that allows
    customers to monitor their electricity, heat and water consumption, and an
    expanded fault information service, both of which improve the quality and
    efficiency of our customer service.
•   our improved telephone services are now available also in evenings and
    during weekends.

                     je group’s year 2013,
                     the minus points
•   peat has been in short supply for several years, and the volume of peat
    production was low in summer 2013 as well. due to the peat shortage, we
    had to cut down on electricity production and use plenty of coal in district
    heat production.
•   the full capacity of our power plants could not be utilised, because the
    market price of electricity was on such a low level for long periods of time
    that it did not pay to produce condensate electricity.
•   in addition to the external factors that lowered the utilisation rate, the
    production of the keljonlahti power plant was reduced by a leak in the flue
    gas economiser.
•   the warm weather reduced the sales volume of district heat by about 6%
    compared to the year 2012, despite the fact that there was an increase in
    the number of cubic metres of the buildings connected to the district heating
    network.
•   the prices and operating costs (such as taxes) of solid fuels are expected
    to keep rising in the next few years.
•   the maintenance and renovation of the water supply system will still require
    sizable investments for many years to come.

                             jyväskylä energy’s year 2013
•   the group’s losses for the financial period totalled €11.4 m. compared to the previous
    year, the result weakened by €6.75 m. the group’s operating profit stood at €40.6 m.
    €16.5 m of interests were entered as income for the owner.
•   the group’s equity ratio has improved due to the owner’s investment in an unrestricted
    equity fund, but it is still weak. another reason for concern is the large amount of
    liabilities in relation to the turnover and profitability.
•   the group’s significant investments in the energy production capacity in recent years
    have increased the amounts of depreciation, leasing costs and interest expenses. they
    will have an adverse effect on the group’s profits for several years. the result is
    expected to turn positive in the financial year 2015 at the earliest.
•   the growing costs have not been included in the sale prices in full, because we want to
    ensure the price competitiveness of district heating in the long term. je’s district heat
    price was lower than the average in a comparison between the largest cities in finland.

                        jyväskylä energy’s year 2013


•   the financial period was the second one in the group’s history when the group’s two
    power plants were operated throughout the year. owing to this, the use of oil in heat
    production remained minimal, and the use of wood increased significantly, exceeding
    44% of the fuel flow.
•   the group has taken and is taking several measures that will significantly increase the
    share of wood in its fuel selection and thus decrease its dependence on peat.
•   due to the uneven availability of peat, the group invested in equipment permitting the
    use of coal in the keljonlahti power plant. the equipment was taken into use at the end
    of 2013, which means that its impact on the group’s profits will only show from the
    financial period 2014 onwards.
•   we improved the management of development projects, which is important in terms of
    strategy implementation, by standardising tools and training project managers.
•   during the financial period, we continued to make investments in the group’s
    comprehensive and systematic risk management, particularly in the management of
    foreseeable risks, as part of the strategic management of business operations.
•   we are involved in launching the electric vehicle charging operator activities in finland
    together with 16 other finnish energy companies.

                         je-transmission ltd’s year 2013

•   due to the fact that an amendment to the electricity market act entered into force at the beginning of
    september, je-transmission ltd. submitted a new application for an electricity network license at the
    end of november.
•   in connection with jyväskylä energy ltd’s electricity network investments, je-transmission ltd.
    achieved its main targets by replacing the protective relays in the hämeenlahti substation and by
    starting the modernisation planning for the savela switching substation. the building work will take
    place in 2014.
•   distribution networks were constructed in different parts of the distribution area. the most important
    new construction sites were the heinälampi and mankola residential areas.
•   we made replacement investments in several distribution substations and power distribution cabinets
    in the area of the distribution network.
•   we carried out regional renovations in the holsti and sysmälä areas.
•   we prepared for the building of the new central hospital in savela by cabling overhead power lines.
•   the remote reading and metering data management project related to the electricity network
    continued in 2013. at the end of operating year, only a few individual meters remained to be replaced.
•   we improved our online customer service in accordance with the je group’s development
    programme by deploying a customer contact system and an information system for mains
    interruptions.
•   je-transmission ltd. has participated in the funding of the finnish electricity research pool
    coordinated by finnish energy industries. since the beginning of 2010, we have also been involved in
    the elvari project coordinated by motiva oy, aimed at improving the efficiency of electric heating.

                             je-transmission ltd’s year 2013

•   the energy market authority issued its decision on the second regulatory period (2008−
    2011) almost 1.5 years later than originally expected. due to this, je-transmission ltd.
    has only the two last years of the third regulatory period for taking the required
    measures. the distribution price was reduced by 6% as early as 1 january 2012.
•   the authority has made several policy decisions that have had a retroactive effect on the
    calculation of a reasonable return on electricity network operations. for this reason, the
    net present value of the electricity network fell by about 11% due to the regulatory
    decision concerning the second regulatory period.
•   je-transmission ltd. has lodged an appeal with the market court against the energy
    market authority’s decision concerning the second regulatory period on 21 march 2014.
•   the sale of electricity distribution services declined by about 2% on the previous year as
    a result of the warm end of the year.

                             jyväskylän voima ltd’s year 2013

•    the availability of our production machinery was 89% in the financial period.
•    the keljonlahti power plant was operated from 1 january to 11 april and from 28 august to to 31
     december mainly for backpressure production, because a peat shortage in the spring and the low
     market price of electricity in the autumn reduced condensate electricity production.
•    from january to april, the plant was operated normally, i.e. according to shareholders’ orders.
     however, due to a leak in the flue gas economiser the plant was not operated at full capacity.
•    a service building containing a storage space and a staff room for employees was completed in
     january.

                            year 2013
•   the availability of our production machinery was excellent (98%) during the financial period.
•   the rauhalahti power plant underwent a two-month maintenance outage owing to an automation
    upgrade. production fell short of the forecast, remaining at the level of about 80%, which was mainly
    due to the mild weather during the autumn.
•   the availability of peat, coupled with taxes, constitute a significant risk for the company, the reduction
    of which requires that the share of biofuel is increased in a controlled manner towards a technical and
    financial maximum.
•   the research activities carried out in co-operation with vtt technical research centre of finland,
    metso corporation and kuopio energy with the goal of maximising the share of wood fuels were
    completed in spring 2013.
•   a decision to make modernisation investments in the rauhalahti power plant in order to prolong the
    plant’s service life to 2030 as a result of the increasingly stringent emission requirements of the ie
    directive was made in march 2014.
