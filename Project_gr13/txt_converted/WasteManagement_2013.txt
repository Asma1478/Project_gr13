    waste management has changed its methodology for calculating fleet efficiency to conform to the u.s. environmental protection
    agency’s current smartway truck tool. we recalculated our 2007 baseline emissions using this tool as well, to allow consistent
    tracking of emissions.

    we have reorganized our energy use reporting function. since energy use is less than 2 percent of our total direct emissions, we are
    holding over our 2011 values pending implementation of a new reporting protocol.

    we are reporting this data to inform our customers and the public about the potential ghg reduction benefits associated with carbon
    storage in landfills, our renewable energy production and the recyclable materials we collect and process. we are not presuming to
    characterize how emerging regulatory programs will allocate credit for these avoided emissions, so we do not claim these greenhouse
    gas reduction benefits as our own, nor attempt to deduct these reductions from our carbon footprint.

    2012 sustainability report.

    waste management a “most ethical company”

    for the sixth consecutive year, waste management
    in 2013 was named one of the world’s most
    ethical companies by the ethisphere institute, a                         most
    research-based organization advancing recognition
    of corporate social responsibility, business ethics,                     ethical
    anti-corruption and sustainability best practices.
    one hundred and forty-five companies represent-
                                                                              company
    ing over three dozen industries were listed on their
    2013 “wme index,” with waste management                                  award
    the only environmental services or waste industry                        6 years running
    company to be named. collectively, ethisphere
    reports that these companies performed signifi-
    cantly better than the s&p 500 —  ­ even through
    the worldwide recession.
