biodiversity




activities associated with biodiversity
to alleviate the impact of business activities upon biological diversity, the shin-etsu polymer group is actively engaged
in initiatives against contamination from the effects of business activities upon biodiversity such as (1) proper treatment of
industrial waste water, (2) non-use of hazardous substances contained in products and (3) reduction of voc (volatile organic
compounds) exhausts. we also re-evaluate the impact and make efforts to maintain biological diversity and sustainable use.




   revision of the shin-etsu group’s basic csr policy
    we strive for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity by understanding
           and evaluating the impact on ecosystems from business activities, and by reducing this impact.
   we added the above action policy to the group’s action policy in april 2010 to strengthen our initiatives to protect biological diversity.

        ― review of emergency measures ―
        with the great hanshin-awaji earthquake of 1995 as a turning point, we started to prepare and improve
        the crisis management system by, for example, creating an “emergency manual,” and began initiatives
        to create bcm. however, with the great east japan earthquake where situations beyond assumptions
        continued to occur, we identified defects such as prior disaster prevention like measures for preventing
        bookshelves from falling down, securing communication means between sites and emergency
        responses. for this reason, we reviewed the emergency manual and renewed it as “disaster manual.” in
        order to minimize damage and early restoration of operations, the manual stipulates the basic concept
        of disaster measures and emergency organization of our group. based on this manual, each site takes
                                                                                                                   the summer issue of the in-house magazine,
        its individual locality and specialty into consideration, organizes an emergency organization and makes    “next”, carried special features and discussed
        disaster prevention plans, repeats disaster drills and raises awareness of disaster prevention to enable   challenges and feedback from the disaster as
                                                                                                                   well as future disaster prevention and targets
        proper and timely responses possible at the time of an emergency.

in order to meet the requirements for the management of chemicals contained in products by customers,
we created the “global environmental communication system” to centrally manage all group companies including
overseas plants. this year, we also set up the control standards of chemical substances contained in products.
to respond to customers’ csr surveys, etc., we apply the global environmental communication system.
