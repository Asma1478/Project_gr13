  the market value of shares issued to employees for no cash consideration under the ltip is recognised as an employee benefit expense
  with a corresponding increase amortised over the vesting period in equity when the employees become entitled to the shares.

  incentive plan
  executives, senior managers and other employees who have greater potential impact on share price and long-term value generation
  receive part of any annual incentive awarded to them as cash and part as rights to restricted shares.
  rights granted under this incentive plan are priced at the vwap of the ten trading days prior to the day the remuneration and human
  resources committee decides to recommend to the board that it award them. the rights will be able to be exercised into restricted
  shares 12 months after grant provided the employee remains employed with the group. once the shares are acquired, they will be
  placed in a restricted class and employees will be required to retain them for a further 2 years. no exercise price is payable upon the
  exercise of the rights. the rights granted under this structure carry no dividend or voting rights. the restricted shares do carry dividend
  and voting rights.

  long-term incentive plan prior to 2011 financial year
  staff eligible to participate in the long-term incentive plan (ltip) prior to 2011 financial year were those of senior manager level and
  above (including executive directors).
  performance options and performance rights granted under the ltip were for no consideration. options and rights granted were for
  a 3 year vesting period for the earnings per share performance level with a subsequent 1 or 2 year testing period to achieve the requisite
  total shareholder return. the exercise period for these instruments granted to date will expire on the seventh anniversary of their
  allocation date. the performance rights issued to the former chief executive expire 90 days after the last date for vesting.
  performance options and performance rights granted under the ltip carry no dividend or voting rights.
  the exercise price of performance options was based on the weighted average price at which the company’s shares are traded on the
  australian securities exchange during the 30 days immediately before the determination date. no exercise price is payable upon the
  exercise of performance rights.

  termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts
  voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed
  to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or to
  providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

  certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 june 2015 reporting

  interpretations follows.
