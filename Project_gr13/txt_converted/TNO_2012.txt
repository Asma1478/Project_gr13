in this first year as chairperson, i have been able to see at close
quarters the key role played by tno for government, industry
and society. in the intensive introductory talks i met inspired
and capable people who are passionate about the field in which
they achieve practicable innovations. this provides a nourishing
base to continue fulfilling and strengthening this vital role in the
coming years in the face of so many changes in the economy, in
government and in society.

                               on 2010 (2.4 million euros). this is attributable in part to higher personnel costs of 8.0 million

                               fall came about by budget reductions implemented by the

                               personnel costs rose by 8.0 million euros, chiefly due to higher

employees make
the difference

                               tno is an organisation of professionals. to achieve the necessary impact, tno makes high demands
                               of its employees in terms of their expertise, creativity and customer focus, among other things.
                               the environment tno offers is full of project challenges and possibilities to combine qualities
                               and disciplines. a periodic employee commitment survey (ecs) measures the extent to which tno
                               has succeeded in connecting the ambitions of the organisation and those of the employees. in
                               preparing for the thematically-driven project organisation that took effect at the beginning of

                               solving the teething problems that are part of working in a new kind of organisation. the results
                               were extensively discussed at all levels of the organisation and led to improvement items for all
                               tno entities. the ecs will be held again in mid 2012 in order to gain more insight into the effects of

independent assurance report




during our investigation we discussed the necessary amend-
ments in the csr sections with tno and have established that
these amendments were properly incorporated in the definitive
version.

our conclusion
our work reveals no evidence that the information in the csr
sections, in every aspect of material import, is incorrectly
represented according to the g3 guidelines of the global
reporting initiative.

comparative information has not been examined
no assurance assignment has been performed for the
comparative csr information concerning previous years as
contained in the csr sections. therefore we can give no
assurance about this csr information included for the sake
of comparison.

observations
without compromising the scope of our assurance report, we
would like to draw the reader’s attention to the following finding:
tno has brought tangibility to its csr policy in the past year
by stipulating this in a corporate social responsibility policy
statement. we instruct tno to link goals and kpi’s to this so
that the progress of these goals can be monitored. we also
instruct an evaluation of the current methodologies (like the
environmental footprint model) to provide sufficient insight to
enable adjustments to be made.

so defence asked tno and rheinmetall waffe munition schweiz
(rwms) to co-develop suitable munitions. the fap (frangible
armour piercing) projectiles, which are brittle and fracture into
smaller pieces within a target, work in a very complex way but
accumulated knowledge has given tno the capacity not only
to evaluate such munitions but also to help develop them. tno
and partner rwms were thus able to come up with entirely new
25 mm fap munitions. so if the jsf is eventually purchased,
the necessary munitions will be ready on time. not only that but
the american air force is currently testing these munitions, and
contributing to part of the costs. and should the americans and
other countries decide to actually purchased these munitions in
the future, then for every cartridge sold, royalties will flood in to
tno (for reinvestment in defence research) and defence.

corporate governance 2011


                               corporate governance stands for the good and efficient corporate management of an organisation

                               subscribes to and applies these principles. this is evident from the presence and application of
                               a code of conduct, a complaints scheme, regulations and a whistleblower regulation. in 2011
                               tno also strove to optimise its corporate governance.

states that the accountant will each year (starting in 2012) also
audit compliance with the mandate.

accountability
in respect of government funding, by virtue of the tno act
accountability is provided in advance through the submission
by the rvb of the strategic plan, for a four-year period, and the
budget for the coming year, to the minister of the intermediating
ministry, being the ministry of economic affairs, agriculture and
innovation (el&i). accountability is retrospective by virtue of this
act through the submission by the rvb of the annual review and
annual accounts of the previous year to this minister. the rvt
has to approve these documents.

the annual accounts are accompanied by a statement from an
accountant designated by the rvt concerning the faithfulness
of the information. the rvt consulted with the accountant about
the accountant’s report also in the absence of the rvb. in 2011
the european tender for the assignment of the accountant was
completed, whereby kpmg will be responsible for the audit for
five years from 2011, with two options to extend by a year.
the accountant also undertakes a separate audit in respect of
legitimate collection and expenditure according to the audit
protocol agreed in the past between the ministry of education,
culture and science and tno.

sioenfonds tno. this pension scheme concerns a conditionally
indexed average pay ruling. indexation (adjusted to price rises)
of the claims and rights granted occur exclusively if, and insofar
as, the pension fund resources allow and the pension fund has
approved this. if the circumstances at the pension fund give
cause thereto, the board can decide to reduce the claims.

the pension scheme is characterised as a payment agreement
by the pensions act. the execution agreement with the pension
fund is for an unlimited period and remains in force until termi-
nated by one of the parties. the main agreements contained in
the execution agreement are:

– indexation gives no cause to amend the premiums
– the board sets the premium annually, its basis being
  established in a graduated interest calculation linked to the
  level of coverage.
– the maximum premium is 20% (including 2% extra premium
  when the coverage level is less than 110%).

the credit crisis and falling interest rate in the past year saw
a shortfall in the coverage of the pension fund at 31-12-2011.
the level of coverage (market value of the investments
expressed as a percentage of the pension obligations provision
according to the dutch central bank principles) of the fund at
balance sheet date was 99.6%. the minimum equity require-
ment (level of coverage) is 105%, according to the dutch central
bank. the required equity, given the current investment mix, is

gri guidelines

reports
                               for this report we have used the g3 guidelines for sustainability reports issued by the global
                               reporting initiative (gri). the guidelines have been applied at level b+, see the statement of the gri.
                               in addition to the compulsory information (categories 1.1 to 4.17 and the policy statements) we
                               have selected at least twenty economic, social and environmental indicators.




                                                                                                                                             the gri index chart reveals which gri ¬indicators are contained

                                 gri application levels communicate the extent to which the content of the

                                 the check confirms that the required set and number of disclosures for that
                                 application level have been addressed in the reporting and that the gri con-
                                 tent index demonstrates a valid representation of the required disclosures as
                                 described in the gri g3.1 guidelines.
                                 application levels do not provide an opinion on the sustainability perfor-
