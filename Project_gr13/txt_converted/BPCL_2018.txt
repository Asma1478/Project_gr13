      1        |   scope of the report

    the theme of this year’s annual sustainable development report is ‘fuelling sustainability aspira�ons’ which focuses
    on bharat petroleum corpora�on limited (bpcl)’s responsible growth and sustainable prac�ces. the report covers
    environmental, social and governance performance of the company. the report is developed based on the global
    repor�ng ini�a�ve (gri) g4 guidelines in accordance to the “core” criteria for repor�ng. to a�ain the “core” criteria,
    bpcl needs to report on atleast one indicator for each iden�ﬁed material aspect, and the management approach for the
    iden�ﬁed material aspects. this is bpcl’s eleventh year of repor�ng on social, environmental and governance parameters
    and tenth consecu�ve year of repor�ng based on gri guidelines. bpcl also reports on disclosures of the oil and gas
    sector supplement (ogss), the interna�onal petroleum industry environmental conserva�on associa�on
    (api/ipieca/ogp) and the american petroleum ins�tute’s oil and gas industry guidance on voluntary sustainability
    repor�ng (2010).

    bpcl has con�nued their associa�on with m/s nextgen pms pvt. ltd. for providing advisory services to build this report
    and assist with driving the sustainability agenda. data/informa�on which forms a part of this report is collected on a
    so�ware tool, p3 (acronym for people, planet, proﬁt) at the corporate and opera�ve level. bpcl has reported actual
    numbers in most of the cases, except for certain indicators where bpcl has applied logical assump�ons or es�ma�ons.
    the calcula�ons for that are detailed in the annexures.

    the informa�on in the report is assured by a third party, kpmg india, appointed through the e-tendering process. the
    assurance is conducted as per isae 3000 and aa1000 (2008) assurance standard (type 2) at moderate level. bpcl seeks
    assurance for their sustainable development report every year and the assurance process is facilitated by the corporate
    hsse team and m/s nextgen pms pvt ltd.

    informa�on on the previously published sustainable development reports are available on
    h�ps://www.bharatpetroleum.co.in/sustainability/sustainability-reports.aspx.

    report boundary
    the report boundary covers environmental, social and economic parameters across bpcl’s seven strategic business units
    (sbu’s) in india, over which bpcl has direct control. the sbu’s include avia�on, lubes, reﬁneries, lpg, industrial &
    commercial, retail and gas. mumbai and kochi reﬁneries have the most signiﬁcant areas of opera�on.

    the report boundary does not include bpcl’s retail outlets, lpg distributers, joint ventures, subsidiaries and
    in-transit product movement. during the repor�ng period, there has been no signiﬁcant change in terms of
    organisa�on size, structure, ownership structure or supply chain.

dear stakeholders,

complemen�ng the annual report, this year’s sustainable development report exhibits bpcl’s performance on three
fronts – the economic performance, the approach towards dealing with the environment and the engagements with
stakeholders at several levels. in this regard, i am happy to present bpcl’s eleventh sustainable development report with
a focus on ‘fuelling sustainability aspira�ons’.

the year, 2016-17 has been a signiﬁcant one for the bpcl group during which we have achieved record breaking proﬁts,
incurred the highest ever capital expenditure to augment our reﬁning/marke�ng infrastructure, acquired trans country
upstream producing assets and embarked on our journey of project sankalp. this achievement is a tes�mony to our
hard-work and the commitment diﬀeren�a�ng us from our peers. the ﬁnancial year saw the group achieve a gross reve-
nue from opera�ons of inr 2,43,747.46 crore as compared to inr 2,19,226.79 crore recorded in 2015-16. the proﬁt a�er
tax stood at inr 8,720.94 crore in 2016-17 as against inr 7,584.51 crore in the previous year. our market sales went up
to 37.74 mmt as compared to 36.83 mmt during 2015-16.

in this journey towards sustainability, i would like to share my vision for bpcl:

long term economic viability and growth: to ensure economic proﬁtability, bpcl is commi�ed to remaining ﬁnancially
strong, technologically relevant and responsibly opera�onal. our consistent growth is enhanced by advancements in tech-
nology. the strategy is to think beyond compliance, benchmark against global standards, expand to new markets, and
capture opportuni�es and innovate for long term sustainability.

environmental footprint: bpcl fully recognizes its responsibility towards the environment. being cognizant of the
challenges faced by the business, eﬀect on climate change and the impact created on the local communi�es, bpcl has
taken ac�ve measures to foster innova�on in dealing with these challenges. bpcl has complied with the bs iv norms and
has also invested in renewable energy. we have increased capacity of renewable energy from 19.57 mw to 22.17 mw
registering an increase in capacity of 13.3% as compared to previous year.


   sustainable development report 2016-2017                                                                                 2

    rainwater harves�ng and installa�on of energy eﬃcient ligh�ng are other steps taken toward reduc�on in carbon
    footprint. 2016-17 witnessed an increase in total catchment area under rainwater harves�ng to 7,22,800 m2 from
    5,30,475 m2 which is a 36.3% increase from the previous year while energy eﬃcient ligh�ng capacity has also been
    increased from 3.6 mw to 6.2 mw, an increment by 90.2% from previous year. through these ini�a�ves, we have
    achieved an annual reduc�on of ghg emission by 34,000 mtco2e. we are aware of the other milestones s�ll ahead of
    us on this journey toward alterna�ng to renewable energy sources, and we acknowledge our responsibili�es to con�nu-
    ously work towards minimizing our environmental footprint.

    responsibility toward people: with its mo�o “safety first, safety must”, bpcl will con�nue in its strife to become a safer
    workplace. we assume responsibility not only for our employees and contract workmen, but also extend the same to our
    channel and business partners. we con�nually engage with our people and partners increasing awareness on safety in
    all areas of opera�ons ranging from safety within bpcl plants to safety on the roads. however, i regret the fatali�es
    caused to one of our company employees and three contract staﬀ within our premises during the repor�ng year.

    talent management: people are the soul of the organisa�on. our approach is thus to a�ract and retain talent, at all
    levels.our total manpower strength as on march 2017 was 12,484. during the ﬁnancial year 2016-17, 469 management
    staﬀ were recruited in the corpora�on. training on behavioural and func�onal aspects has been provided to keep talent
    abreast with the latest updates. an e-learning portal is also at the disposal of our employees. going forward, we strive
    to enhance the learning atmosphere crea�ng an inclusive work space.

    concern for local communi�es: our opera�ons impact the lives of thousands of people from the neighbouring commu-
    ni�es, o�en in remote places which do not have access to basic ameni�es. our dedicated corporate social responsibility
    projects have helped iden�fy community needs and thereby ensure access to quality educa�on, water conserva�on,
    skill development, health & hygiene and community development. during 2016-17, as part of our ongoing corporate
    responsibility programme, the total spending on csr ini�a�ves is 1.13% of the proﬁt a�er tax. in line with the ‘skill india’
    campaign, we have taken lead in se�ng up mega skill development ins�tutes amongst industry peers. 2016-17 also
    marks the successful comple�on of the fourth batch of its in-house project saksham for professional development of
    primary/upper primary teachers and headmasters from 46 low income schools of mumbai. the ujjwala scheme
    supports na�onwide ini�a�ves with a focus on environment and health of women providing deposit free lpg connec-
    �ons to bpl families. to enable us to further improve upon our ini�a�ves and nurture inclusive partnerships, we strive
    to ensure an increased impact in the areas of educa�on, water conserva�on, skill development, health & hygiene and
    community development.

    these are the pillars aiding us toward sustainable growth. going forward we must appreciate that the world is changing
    at an incredible pace. disrup�ons have become the new norm and tradi�onal business models are being severely
    challenged. agility and adaptability are key to our growth and being focussed on our vision has become ever so import-
    ant. challenges notwithstanding, i am conﬁdent that bpcl will con�nue in its journey of value crea�on.

     corporate governance and ethics
     eﬀec�ve corporate governance at bpcl, goes beyond compliance. it is a culture and a mechanism for transparency, consis-
     tency, responsibility, accountability and fairness cra�ed for the stakeholders of the organiza�on. this structure trickles
     down to the working staﬀ of bpcl, its management and its board of directors, who strive to ensure highest ethical prac�c-
     es.
     an eﬀec�ve and a well-informed board is a means of achieving good corporate governance protocols. the board of direc-
     tors is the highest governance body exercising the powers subject to the provisions of the companies act, 2013. the board
     of directors are selected based on their competencies and qualiﬁca�ons as reviewed by the nomina�on and remunera�on
     commi�ee. the nomina�ons of the directors are suggested to the board and shareholders for approval under the provi-
     sions of companies act. the process of appointment of directors (whole �me directors, nominee directors and indepen-
     dent directors), however, is done by the government of india in line with the directorate of public enterprises (dpe) guide-
     lines applicable for central public-sector enterprises (cpses). dpe guidelines lay down the criteria of eligibility for the
     selec�on of directors.
     bpcl has a robust structure in place for strategy, implementa�on and monitoring of its sustainability ini�a�ves present in
     the sustainability policy approved by the board in 2012, detailed in the annexure sec�on of this report. the hsse depart-
     ment collates and communicates all material aspects to the sustainable development commi�ee during sustainability
     development (board level) commi�ee mee�ng which is held every six months. the sustainable development commi�ee
     overlooks and approves sustainable development ini�a�ves once ﬁnalized by the corporate hsse department.

     board of directors
     the board of directors comprise of 11 members, of which 5 whole �me execu�ve directors, 2 part-�me government direc-
     tors and 4 part-�me (non-oﬃcial) independent directors. currently all bpcl’s board members are male.
     in the ﬁnancial year 2016-17, the board met twelve �mes. the gap between two mee�ngs within the period prescribed
     under the companies act, 2013 and the lis�ng regula�ons.
     mee�ngs are generally a�ended by all directors barring excep�onal circumstances when the board grants a leave of
     absence. such a decentralized organiza�onal model aids in decision making and ensures transparency1

     board remuneration
     the remunera�on of the whole-�me directors is determined by ministry of petroleum and natural gas (mop&ng). the
     part-�me(ex-oﬃcio) directors do not receive any remunera�on from the company. for compu�ng the compensa�on, only
     regular heads of compensa�on (one-�me payments & perquisites are excluded) are considered. the major components
     are – basic pay, stagna�on increments, dearness allowance, hra, cafeteria allowances.

     the ﬁxed remunera�on component is accompanied by a variable component, based on the performance of the manage-
     ment. the performance related incen�ve scheme for management staﬀ (prism) is evaluated based on targets set in the
     mou with mopng. at the beginning of each ﬁnancial year, bpcl signs a memorandum of understanding (mou) with the
     ministry of petroleum & natural gas. the mou speciﬁes targets for various parameters including physical, ﬁnancial, social
     and environmental parameters2 .

ethics and integrity
to protect and serve the interest of all stakeholders, bpcl has put speciﬁc procedures, processes and systems in place,
under which the “code of conduct, procedure and disclosures for preven�on of insider trading in the securi�es of bpcl”
and “code of corporate disclosure prac�ces” have been adopted. the code of conduct is required so that bpcl employ-
ees and contractors are honest and responsive with the interac�ons they have with government agencies or regulators.
bpcl work with governments, non-governmental organiza�ons and interna�onal agencies on increasing transparency of
revenue ﬂows from sector to the host governments.bpcl has taken implementa�on of government policies in a proac�ve
manner and has also provided all necessary informa�on regarding ethical conduct to the employees on the intra link. the
e-magazine “soch” is aimed at enhancing the understanding related to various policies of the organiza�on and to
improve par�cipa�on.


bpcl follows a vigorous mechanism to communicate concerns with the various stakeholders. the primary level of griev-
ance redressal is tended to at the bu level. in the event that the grievance stays unresolved, it is then taken up by the
commi�ee of func�onal directors. post review of the concern commi�ee, the discussion is ini�ated with the board of
directors. the aggregate number of concerns raised during fy 2016-17 cannot be disclosed due to conﬁden�ality
reasons.


bpcl abides by the rules of the compe��on commission of india and has also signed a voluntary code of transparency
interna�onal’s integrity pact programme (ipp). bpcl stands upto the requirements not only on paper but in sprit by not
ge�ng involved in any an�-compe��ve behaviour. however, there are 5 cases which are at various forums in this regard
pending for the year 2016-17. the details of which are men�oned below.

     vigilance mechanism
     vigilance in bpcl is an integral part of ensuring good governance in the organiza�on. the department constantly endeav-
     ors to promote improvement in systems, processes and prac�ces through an approach of proac�ve and par�cipatory
     vigilance leading to “vigilance for corporate excellence”. it believes that with best prac�ces, adequate controls, account-
     ability and transparency, decisions taken will be eﬃcient, eﬀec�ve and consistent, ul�mately leading to corporate excel-
     lence. this also helps sensi�zing employees to this concept so that their thoughts and ac�ons are aligned towards integ-
     rity and transparency.

     vigilance, helps the business, iden�fy suscep�ble areas in exis�ng procedures & processes like tendering processes,
     vendor bill payments and channel partner selec�ons etc. the informa�on technology is being extensively u�lized to
     eﬀec�vely ins�tute more transparent processes like e-tendering, e-payments, e-receipts etc., thereby ins�lling conﬁ-
     dence of being a just & fair organiza�on amongst the vendor, channel partners and customers. many recommenda�ons
     are being made on ﬁeld observa�ons to improve exis�ng system and process.

     as a part of preven�ve vigilance, awareness sessions were conducted for bpcl employees working at opera�ng loca�ons
     and regional oﬃces by vigilance oﬃcers during their visits to enhance knowledge & awareness on the opera�onal
     aspects of various guidelines and standard opera�ng procedures in vogue. this was done with a premise to promote
     clean business transac�ons, professionalism, produc�vity, promptness and ethical prac�ces. corporate vigilance also
     carried out thorough inves�ga�ons into the complaints and source informa�on. complaints including those received
     online, were inves�gated both directly by team vigilance and through businesses / en��es within the s�pulated �me
     frame.

     there is a regular interac�on with the employees of bpcl through bpcl’s internal web site “intralink” as well as with the
     customers/others concerned through the vigilance portal available on the bpcl’s corporate website which has provision
     to lodge the complaints as well.
     vigilance portal has the objec�ve of crea�ng awareness on good governance, sharing knowledge on ethical prac�ces and
     proac�ve vigilance and connec�ng with all the employees. this website has useful links of central vigilance commission,
     department of personnel & training government of india etc.

     as a part of capacity building vigilance oﬃcers had undergone training programme conducted by central bureau of
     inves�ga�ons and various other ins�tutes of repute. the vigilance awareness week 2016 (from 31st october to 5th
     november, 2016) was launched at bpcl corporate oﬃce in mumbai.
     in line with the theme “public par�cipa�on in promo�ng integrity and eradica�ng corrup�on”, set by central vigilance
     commission during this period, various ac�vi�es such as awareness sessions, essay contests, ques�on answer sessions,
     vigilance quiz, debate compe��on, pain�ng contest and skit program (topic: figh�ng corrup�on) were conducted for
     employees & school children.
     as a of part public outreach programmes to propagate integrity pledge were conducted in vijayawada and guntur in the
     month of march 2016. these programmes were graced by central vigilance commissioner, shri k v chowdhary, irs as
     chief guest. during the programme more than 1200 par�cipants administered online integrity pledge.
     vigilance department has taken ini�a�ve for propaga�ng ethical values in school children so that they become vehicle
     to carry these values to their families, friends and society and integrity clubs are opera�onal in various schools in kochi,
     mumbai, chennai and kolkata.

     value based teachings �tled “cho� cho� batein “an ini�a�ve to rekindle the good values amongst school children were
     conducted by vigilance oﬃcers. through this ini�a�ve bpcl have covered 10 schools in mumbai, sholapur, chennai,
     kolkata and touched around 1100 students from various strata of the society.

the 7th edi�on of the vigilance plus was released and was received very well by the stakeholders. this magazine carries
a snapshot of various ac�vi�es carried out during the vaw 2016 and other events conducted by vigilance dept. the
ar�cles in the magazine were contributed by the staﬀ members, school students
narra�ng their experiences to combat corrup�on in day to day life.

bpcl vigilance has endeavored, as always towards a progressive path of preven�ve, par�cipa�ve and puni�ve vigilance.

         5       |   key impacts, risks and opportunities

     india has surpassed japan in the consump�on of primary energy and now stands as the 3rd largest consumer of energy in
     the world registering a growth of 5.5% in energy consump�on. with plans on the west coast reﬁnery gaining momentum,
     india is emerging as a reﬁning hub.

     the declining trend in oil prices con�nued in 2016-17. this bodes well for the indian economy given the increased
     dependence on oil and petroleum products as a source of energy. this year, the indian crude basket has marginally
     increased to $ 47.16 per barrel from $ 46.17 per barrel in the previous year. the increase is due to the deprecia�on in the
     indian rupee. the fall in prices has also kept the price of diesel under control, contribu�ng signiﬁcantly to ensuring healthy
     levels of inﬂa�on. further, the subsidy burden for the central exchequer has reduced by 28% to rs 19,728 crores as
     compared to the previous year, with the oil psus being fully compensated for throughout the year.

     while the decline in crude prices has reduced the prices of fuel in india and thus the subsidy burden, permi�ng the
     emergence of market determined prices based on established pricing models, it has also encouraged the private players
     to perform more aggressively. during 2016-17, private players gained a market share of more than 10%.

     renewable sources of energy are growing exponen�ally. it is expected that half of the addi�onal energy requirements will
     be met from renewable sources, together with nuclear and hydroelectric power over the next 20 years. this makes
     renewable sources of energy, both an opportunity as well as a threat, since it provides a pla�orm to migrate towards
     cleaner and more eﬃcient forms of energy, and a threat as it risks the obsolescence of huge investments in conven�onal
     forms of energy. but given the increasing compe��veness of renewable and concerns over carbon emissions, slowly but
     surely the fuel mix is undergoing a transi�on.

     robust infrastructure is a fundamental requirement for any industry and more so in the oil & gas sector due to the
     hazardous nature of the product. india has made several inroads in upstream, has an impressive reﬁning capacity slated
     to increase, has made signiﬁcant progress in storage, especially with the strategic crude oil storage plans, a strong
     distribu�on network and reasonable road infrastructure to facilitate transporta�on of products. however, there is an
     urgent need to enhance the import infrastructure, especially for the import of lpg. while a focused approach has been
     adopted to address this issue, it will be a while before india will have a comprehensive import infrastructure.

     demone�za�on in november 2016 has set the stage for digitaliza�on in the country. this has been a signiﬁcant decision
     that was implemented by the government of india, and has catapulted the country onto a digital pla�orm. with increasing
     number of digital transac�ons, india is ge�ng slowly but surely accustomed to a cashless mode of payment. what remains
     a challenge is, given the combus�ble nature of petroleum products, how safely digital transac�ons can be completed in
     the petrol sta�ons. another challenge will be to ensure the end-to-end security of these transac�ons.

     another major step that is being taken by the indian government is that on gst which was eﬀec�ve from 1st july 2017.
     the mul�-stage, des�na�on-based tax that will be levied on every value addi�on will impact the indian oil & gas industry
     in a unique manner, as not all petroleum products are covered under gst. this implies that there will be an incidence of
     non-recovery of input tax credit thus resul�ng in an increased cash ou�low. the exact ﬁnancial impact can be ascertained
     and analyzed only when suﬃcient data is available and once more clarity emerges on how such non-recoveries of input
     tax credit will be addressed.

india is at the threshold of a major transi�on. being one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a reasonable
growth in energy consump�on, india is poised to take on the challenges of intensiﬁed growth. in such an environment,
bpcl is very well placed to contribute to the development of the na�on. other than all the na�onal and interna�onal
challenges faced by bpcl, climate change is one of the main factors which is increasingly posing a number of risks. any
physical asset, under the inﬂuence of natural calami�es as a result of climate change would be under impending danger
at bpcl as plants and equipment’s may not be able to withstand the unexpected climate change pa�erns that may follow.
further, bpcl has also classiﬁed risk associated with climate change in 4 diﬀerent categories namely, physical risk,
regulatory risk, health risk and reputa�on risk.

          6 stakeholder engagement and materiality
     stakeholder engagement and materiality is integral in driving the sustainability vision throughout the company. the
     process is undertaken with transparency and accountability to ensure every stakeholder interest is considered without a
     bias. these stakeholder responses are then compiled to form a materiality matrix represen�ng stakeholder views and
     their impact on business.

     stakeholder engagement
     bpcl takes a structured approach to engage with their stakeholders and address their key concerns. the success of the
     process is a�ributed to the construc�ve dialogue with the stakeholders. bpcl engages with a broad spectrum of
     stakeholders in a variety of ways, to build and strengthen trust-based rela�onships. the iden�ﬁca�on process of the
     relevant stakeholders involves taking feedback from the business units and corporate oﬃce. the various sec�ons of this
     report have addressed the key stakeholder concerns. the details of iden�ﬁca�on, engagement technique and the key
     concerns of each of the stakeholder group is discussed below:

adhering to the gri g4 guidelines, bpcl follows the above methodology to iden�fy key material issues. the materiality
matrix developed is the same as the matrix developed last year. the categoriza�on under low, medium and high
demonstrates the rela�ve importance of aspects and does not necessarily depict that a par�cular aspect rated as 'low'
has low impact or relevance.

     the data and informa�on presented in the report is collected on a regular basis. bpcl has considered all their strategic
     business units in india which includes, reﬁneries (mumbai & kochi), avia�on, retail, lpg, gas, industrial, commercial and
     lubricants as the boundary for each material aspect. the joint ventures, lpg distributers, retail outlets and subsidiaries
     are excluded from the boundary of material aspect. there are no signiﬁcant changes from previous repor�ng periods in
     the scope and aspect boundaries.

     message from the director- finance
                                         sustainable development of society and the na�on is of paramount importance for us
                                         at bpcl. our commitment to sustainable development is to go beyond compliance and
                                         meet the customer and stakeholder expecta�ons and par�cipate in the overall
                                         development of the economy, society and environment.

                                         the oil and gas sector contributes a major share to the country’s gross domes�c
                                         product (gdp). the ﬁnancial year 2016-17 has seen a growth of 5.2% in consump�on
                                         of petroleum products as compared to the 11.6% growth recorded in the previous year.
                                         the main reason for a decline in growth was due to the substan�al decline in the
                                         demand for diesel which cons�tutes 40% of the total consump�on basket. diesel grew
                                         by only about 2% during 2016-17 as compared to the 7.5% growth recorded in the
                                         previous year largely due to reduc�on in the growth in commercial vehicles (cv). the
                                         sharp decline in oil prices over the past couple of years has been extremely beneﬁcial
                                         to india, making energy more aﬀordable, and easily accessible for the consumers and
     complemen�ng the government’s ini�a�ves to improve the availability, accessibility and aﬀordability of clean fuel together
     with reliability and self-suﬃciency.. however, the challenge of imports remains, as india is s�ll dependent on imports for
     80% of its crude requirements, thus making it more vulnerable to the interna�onal oil scenario.

     the government of india has taken a decision to implement daily price changes in petrol and diesel across the country, a
     shi� from a fortnightly re-structuring of price. a�er the success of the pilot project in chandigarh, udaipur, jamshedpur,
     puducherry and vishakhapatnam on 1st may 2017, the ini�a�ve has been rolled out across the country with eﬀect from
     16th june 2017. the change was made on the grounds of introducing interna�onal standards in the indian fuel retail market
     besides avoiding wide ﬂuctua�ons in rsp while ensuring complete transparency in petrol and diesel pricing. while the basis
     of pricing shall con�nue to be on interna�onal oil rates, the only change is the reﬂec�on of daily interna�onal prices in the
     petrol and diesel prices in india. it is expected that companies and consumers, both shall beneﬁt from this move. in order
     to ensure that the customers are well informed about the prices, several modes of communica�on such as mobile apps,
     automa�on at petrol pumps, led screens at petrol pumps, sms facility and upda�on of retail selling prices in the oil psu
     websites are being used.

     another major transforma�on in the tax regula�ons witnessed by the country recently is the implementa�on of goods and
     services tax (gst) with eﬀect from 01st july 2017. the mul�-stage, des�na�on-based tax that will be levied on every value
     addi�on will impact the indian oil & gas industry in a unique manner, as not all petroleum products are covered under gst.
     consequently, there will be an increase in the tax burden due to non-availability of input tax credits.

     over the years, bpcl has created tremendous value for all stakeholders and con�nues in its endeavor to be a leading energy
     company in the country. we strongly believe in good corporate governance and uphold the highest standards of
     governance in all our dealings and transac�ons. in this regard, we understand that public par�cipa�on in promo�ng
     integrity and eradica�ng corrup�on is very vital and all of us need to support it by being easily accessible, open, objec�ve
     and transparent in all our public interac�ons.
     bpcl has heralded many community ini�a�ves in the areas of educa�on, water conserva�on, skill development, health &
     hygiene and community development. through an ins�tu�onalized and project-based approach, bpcl con�nues to take
     up new projects, increasing the on-ground impact in alignment with our vision of responsible development.

     being one of the fastest growing economies in the world with a reasonable growth in energy consump�on, india is poised
     to take on the challenges of intensiﬁed growth. as we con�nue to conquer challenges that come in our way, we remain
     commi�ed to derive opportuni�es for growth and create posi�ve value for all the stakeholders as we traverse further.

    message from the director-reﬁneries
                                       at bpcl, we are cognizant that our reﬁneries are major contributors towards bpcl’s
                                       environmental footprint. we aim at striking a balance in improving our performance
                                       while ensuring our responsibility towards the environment.

                                       during this ﬁnancial year, mumbai and kochi reﬁneries achieved throughput of
                                       25.39 mmt, which is the highest throughput achieved so far. all units under the
                                       integrated reﬁnery expansion project (irep) at kochi reﬁnery have been
                                       commissioned.

                                       bpcl reﬁneries are producing environment friendly bs iv quality auto fuels and
                                       facili�es are being upgraded for producing bs vi qualify auto fuels prior to the
                                       deadline of april 2020 set by the government of india. focused eﬀorts toward
                                       energy conserva�on are carried out at the reﬁneries, resul�ng in reduc�on of steam
                                       consump�on and higher heat recovery ul�mately lowering co2 emissions.
    reﬁneries have implemented online stack monitoring systems and real �me data from stack analyzers is connected to
    central pollu�on control board (cpcb) site.

    water conserva�on is given high priority and both the reﬁneries are expanding volumes of the rain water harves�ng. as
    a part of water conserva�on measures kochi reﬁnery installed its ﬁrst reverse osmosis (ro) based de-mineralized water
    (dm plant), which will recycle the en�re eﬄuent generated. nearly 10,000 trees have been planted by mumbai reﬁnery
    at staﬀ colony and surrounding areas of mumbai. kochi reﬁnery maintains an eco-park covering an area of 5.5 acres of
    land in which more than 3,000 varie�es of plants and trees are planted. both the reﬁneries have commissioned solar
    power plants on the roof top of oﬃce buildings.

    various other ini�a�ves are undertaken by reﬁneries for con�nuous improvement on environment front like conver�ng
    organic waste to fer�lizer, disposal of canteen waste though biogas plant and recycling waste papers etc. our research
    & development center has completed a pilot project of u�lizing waste plas�c for road construc�on.

    safety is of utmost importance at bpcl. this year, we are happy to showcase mumbai reﬁnery’s achievement of
    comple�ng 26 million-man hours without “lost time accident” (lta). kochi reﬁnery too demonstrated its commitment
    to safety with an achievement of 48.43 million-man hours without lta.

    the company makes concerted eﬀorts to bring out qualita�ve impacts on the lives of the surrounding communi�es.
    focused interven�ons in the areas of educa�on, skill development, health and hygiene are carried out with the help of
    ngo partners thereby reaching out to thousands of people.

    against the backdrop of a vola�le global economy and india’s energy dependency on fossil fuel, we strive to operate in
    economically, environmentally and socially responsible ways; and invest for the future. one of the major ini�a�ve in the
    near future is se�ng up of 3 nos. bio-reﬁneries that will produce ethanol from agricultural waste.

    i wish all stake holders of bpcl a very prosperous and safe year ahead.

     8a. environmental performance
     as a responsible corporate ci�zen, bpcl acknowledges the impact it has on the environment. bpcl is constantly looking
     for opportuni�es to innovate and reduce its dependence on resources which would result in minimal emissions and
     waste. these technological innova�ons are in alignment with bpcl vision of being “most admired global energy
     company”.

     8.a.i energy management (renewable and non-renewable)
     bpcl has played a leading role in contribu�ng to india’s economic growth by providing energy. further, bpcl also
     understands the related challenges of being in this energy intensive industry and takes responsibility to address
     these. therefore, bpcl engages regularly in exploring investments in renewable and non-renewable sources to fulﬁl
     the energy demand.
     with limited natural resources, conserva�on is essen�al to save environmental degrada�on. the company is a
     signiﬁcant consumer of energy, with the reﬁneries responsible for a large share of the total energy used for
     opera�ons. therefore, energy conserva�on is a major pillar of sustainability. con�nuous eﬀorts are invested
     toward opera�ons/maintenance as well as toward development of new projects at the reﬁneries. energy
     conserva�on through energy monitoring systems, energy audits, technology innova�on, replacement by energy
     eﬃcient equipment and other energy conserva�on measures have helped in good speciﬁc energy consump�on.
     these energy conserva�on ini�a�ves are then benchmarked with global standards. the reﬁneries have undergone
     structural changes to improve energy eﬃciency, resul�ng in fuel saving.

mee�ng growing energy demand solely from fossil fuel would not sustain due to projected shortage of fossil crudeand
also due the nega�ve impact on the environment, emana�ng from the en�re life cycle use of the fossil fuel. thus, it
becomes cri�cal to promote usage of green energy. in this regard, the renewable energy capacity has increased from
19.57 mw to 22.17 mw by year end. the capacity of energy eﬃcient ligh�ng has also been increased from 3.26 mw to
6.20 mw. these ini�a�ves have resulted in annual reduc�on of ghg emission by 34000 metric tons of co2 equivalent.
bpcl plans to venture into development of large scale solar/wind power projects on jv basis a long-term plan.

        new 8” nb pipe line of length approx. 650 m long was fabricated, and erected.
     2. power limi�ng electrical heat tracing system was installed along with control panel in sub sta�on-6
        with a opera�ng temperature indica�on at bbu control room.
     3. the total cost incurred for this project is 126 lakhs .

     the use of electrical heat tracing system of bitumen line will result in saving of 8 t/d of steam. the payback
     period for the project is approx. 12 months.




     commissioning of new turbo aeration blower at minas plant,
     (mumbai reﬁnery)
     energy eﬃcient and state of art aera�on blower was commissioned on 09.11.2016 as a major step towards
     conserva�on of energy. it consumes just half of the energy of exis�ng blowers with minimum maintenance.
     the new turbo blower employs the high precision machined cast impellers, hydrodynamic air foil bearings
     (air –lubricated), highly eﬃcient permanent magnet motors and sensor less inverter drives, which
     eliminates conven�onal gear trains or pulley & belt to provide considerable energy savings without much
     maintenance.

     this machine will save about rs. 5.80 lakhs of energy cost per month and cost of machine will be recovered
     within 12 months’ �me. the blower was procured and installed in record �me with close coordina�on of
     e&c team and opera�ons team.

    solar pv system installed at pithampur lpg plant

    pithampur lpg plant has a solar pv system of capacity of 9 kw for the purpose of powering the admin
    building. the system is a roo�op grid type one without ba�eries so the power produced by the solar pv
    system is directly taken into the lt panel. the power of the solar pv system is preferen�ally used ﬁrst. if
    the power generated by the system is not enough then only power from the ht side is taken. if power
    generated by the solar pv system is under - u�lized, then the balance power passes onto the mldb panel
    and the balance power is then used up by other equipment in the panel. as the plant operates in double
    shi� and maximum power of the admin building is u�lized in between 08:30 am and 5:30 pm, this method
    is eﬀec�ve. it also reduces the cost of ba�ery maintenance.

    the solar pv system was successfully commissioned by 31st january 2016.

     bpcl recognises the value of natural capital and the impact of its opera�ons on the environment. therefore, bpcl has
     taken ini�a�ves to op�mize water consump�on at various loca�ons throughout india.


     water is the most essen�al resource for any oil and gas company. therefore, bpcl contemplates for conserva�on and
     management of water by adap�ng rain water harves�ng system and reusing/recycling of water wherever possible. the
     total catchment area under rain water harves�ng was 5,30,475 sq. meter which has been increased to 7,22,800 sq. meter
     during the year. no water bodies have been signiﬁcantly aﬀected by withdrawal of water by units of bpcl areas of
     opera�ons.


     the total water consumed by bpcl is 49,951.55 thousand kl in the fy 2016-17. the major water sources along with the
     details of water consump�on for reﬁneries and other bu’s for this year is given in the table below.

          b) rain water harvesting was implemented for all buildings. a network of pipelines and recharge pits
          spaced at 30m distances was provided in de-licensed area. all the storm water drains were also
          connected with this system so as to get maximum results. it really improved the ground water table
          in & around our depot. during the recent summer period, none of our bore wells went dry and all
          our water needs were fulﬁlled through ground water only.

     mumbai reﬁnery sports club
     the objec�ve of this project is to collect surface runoﬀ rain water from bpcl reﬁnery sports club ground
     and use the same as makeup water requirement of ccr raw water cooling tower inside the reﬁnery.

     rain water falling on ground being collected through a system of exis�ng and newly constructed storm
     water channels running around the periphery of the ground. underground precast modular ﬁltra�on
     system “furaat” has been provided to ﬁlter surface runoﬀ water. the ﬁltered rain water is channelized by
     common header of 160 mm dia hdpe pipe to 250 cu.m. u/g rcc tank.

     in order to bring water from sports club to reﬁnery, busy ghatkopar mahul road was cut for laying the 3“
     dia pipeline with sleeve. special permission from statutory authority like mcgm & rto was obtained. the
     job was completed within the s�pulated period 3 days and with least inconvenience to the general public.
     the reﬁnery sports club ground having catchment area of 25,170 sq.mt. and rain water harves�ng poten-
     �al of 53,289 cu. mt per year. project cost is 1.7 crore.

    roorkee lpg bottling plant
    solar plant
    a 10 kw solar power plant was installed on the roof of admin. building a�er the installa�on of this the
    kw/mt of the plant has reduced.in this type of solar plants, grid connected solar pv systems feeds solar
    energy directly into the building loads without ba�ery storage. in case of short fall if any, solar energy is
    imported from the grid. the solar pv modules are of crystalline silicon type manufactured in india.

    thus, bpcl can save approx. 90% of power consumed by our admin. building by installa�on of 10 kw on grid
    connected solar power plant without ba�ery on the roof of admin. building of roorkee lpg bo�ling plant.

    rain water harves�ng system
    water is our most precious natural resource and something that most of us take for granted. we are now
    increasingly becoming aware of the importance of water to our survival and its limited supply. the
    harves�ng of rainwater simply involves the collec�on of water from surfaces on which rain falls, and
    subsequently storing this water for later use. at roorkee we have installed rain water harves�ng facili�es at
    three loca�ons. one unit is installed near admin. building, one unit near lpg pump & compressor shed and
    one in green belt area. all these rain water harves�ng units are being used to increase the level of the ground
    water.




8.a.iii biodiversity
bpcl is strategically reviewing its impact on biodiversity in its areas of opera�on. bpcl has ini�ated the process of
crea�ng awareness on the importance of biodiversity among various loca�ons. bpcl has ini�ated the iden�ﬁca�on of
protected areas and poten�al areas of high biodiversity value near all its industrial units in india. an environmental
impact assessment is done for all new projects to iden�fy the impact of opera�ons on ﬂora and fauna. bpcl has begun
sensi�zing employees on the issues of biodiversity with the help of informa�ve note on biodiversity. the details of the
roles in protec�ng the biodiversity will be reported in 2017-18.

bpcl is conduc�ng tree planta�on drives throughout various loca�ons and also inves�ng �me and eﬀort in preserving the
green belt. the tree planta�on drive is usually carried out on occasions such as earth/environment day. saplings are
planted and even distributed under the csr ini�a�ve of bpcl. further, on this sec�on is discussed under community
contribu�on chapter.

     8.a.iv emissions management
     the energy and climate policies present major challenges to the oil and gas industry. the government holds primary
     responsibility to contribute to securing the energy supply with respect to the growing energy demand.

     bpcl is taking steps towards enhancing energy eﬃcient technologies in their opera�ons. this would reduce ghg
     emissions and in turn mi�gate climate change and global warming. bpcl’s emissions from opera�ons include carbon
     dioxide, nox, sox, methane and other gases.

     to reduce environmental impact, bpcl has set periodic targets at all loca�ons. systems and system upgrada�ons are
     made to measure the quantum of emissions. bpcl is progressing towards zero ozone deple�ng substance (ods)
     emissions from both mumbai and kochi reﬁneries. the details of the direct and indirect ghg emissions over the years
     along with the ghg emissions intensity for both mumbai and kochi reﬁneries is represented below:

   manglia receipt terminal certiﬁed as iso 50001 compliant location
   first in bpcl retail
                          in a bid to make energy accessible to the country and future genera�ons, manglia
                          receipt terminal (mrt) aspired to manage its energy consump�on eﬀec�vely in
                          systema�c manner by implemen�ng iso 50001: 2011(energy management system)
                          standard. implementa�on of this interna�onal standard is intended to lead to
                          reduc�on in costs, greenhouse gas emissions and risks. iso 50001: 2011 standard is
                          based on the plan - do - check - act (pdca) con�nual improvement framework and
                          incorporates energy management into everyday organiza�onal prac�ces.


   it is said that one unit of electricity saved is equivalent to two units produced therefore it is prudent to focus
   eﬀorts on improving energy performance. it started in may 2015 with the kick oﬀ mee�ng with pcra.
   subsequently mrt developed its own energy policy, set energy objec�ves and targets in accordance with
   requirement of the standard. this was followed by internal audit and external audit by team of senior audi-
   tors from the ﬁrm “indian register quality system (irqs)”, a division of indian register of shipping.

   mrt was awarded the iso 50001:2011 compliant loca�on cer�ﬁcate on 28.03.2016 by irqs.

     8.a.v managing wastes and eﬄuents
     the explora�on and produc�on of petroleum and natural gas generates eﬄuents and waste. being a responsible
     organiza�on, bpcl aims to reduce the consump�on of water in all opera�ons. bpcl maintains a regular check on the
     discharge of eﬄuents from all the opera�ons involved in the industry.


     the installed eﬄuent treatment plants [etps] are func�oning sa�sfactorily and the eﬄuent quality is in conformance with
     the regulatory standards. bpcl is trying to u�lise this water for signiﬁcant opera�ons of the industry, provided it meets the
     water quality requirements. else, the treated water is u�lized for secondary purpose.

    waste to electricity project at brahmapuram in ernakulam
    the agreement to provide viability gap fund by bharat petroleum corpora�on limited (bpcl) under csr
    to kochi municipal corpora�on (kmc) for the waste to energy project of kmc has been signed at the
    collectorate, ernakulam.

    bpcl is associa�ng with the municipal waste to electricity project of kochi municipal corpora�on as part
    of swachh bharat ini�a�ve based on the direc�ves from ministry of petroleum & natural gas, govt. of
    india. this is a project to convert solid municipal waste to electricity as part of urban waste management.
    bpcl is funding kochi municipal corpora�on to the tune of rs 25.00 crores as a one�me viability gap fund
    (vgf). the vgf would be u�lized for the addi�onal fund requirements of kochi municipal corpora�on
    (kmc) for paying to the concessionaire the diﬀerence between the quoted rate and rate approved by the
    kerala state electricity regulatory commission (kserc) for the electricity produced from this project.

    the plant has a capacity to process 300 mt of waste per day which will be collected from corpora�on and
    nearby municipali�es and grama panchayats. the accumulated waste will also be processed in the
    proposed plant.

     8b. social performance
     8b.i promoting safety through excellence in operations
     ‘safety first – safety must’ is the philosophy that is inculcated in the culture of the organisa�on. bpcl gives utmost
     priority to safety and constantly look for improving and exploring systems and prac�ces towards achieving this goal. the
     nature of risk a�ached with oil and gas industry calls for comprehensive preven�ve measures in the business processes,
     protocols and work culture. bpcl’s emergency response plan covers preparedness, mi�ga�on, planning and
     restora�on(pmpr).

     emergency preparedness
     to ensure all employees and workers are prepared for any emergency situa�on that may arise at any site loca�on, regular
     mock emergency drills are conducted at reﬁneries and all the marke�ng loca�ons. these drills are based on erdmp which
     is prepared as per the pngrb guidelines. a set of guidelines have also been shared with the workers so that they are alert
     and well-equipped to handle emergency situa�ons. to ensure that recurrence of the accidents is averted all accidents are
     documented and analysed. there is an involvement of local communi�es during the safety brieﬁngs. a key annual target
     of the hsse department is to review erdmp of select loca�ons, dcmps of certain loca�ons & fire drill reports, iden�fy
     gaps in preparedness, and guide bus for correc�ons as necessary. hsse also monitors bus for undertaking live ﬁre ﬁgh�ng
     training.




     bpcl understands that only a healthy individual can work with their highest poten�al. therefore, the
     employees are provided with regular medical camps, awareness sessions, access to premium health care and
     health advisors through the medical support services. occupa�onal diseases have not been detected in the
     factory. exposure to carcinogenic benzene has not caused cancer in any of employees. however, other forms
     of common diseases are lifestyle diseases among employees.

     mitigation
     in case of any severe incidents, bpcl has erdmp which is put into ac�on. bpcl trains employees for ﬁrst aid
     and has best in class ﬁre ﬁgh�ng equipment’s and machinery. bpcl ensures the situa�on is contained in best
     possible manner. all the incidents are recorded through an internal portal, both from reﬁneries and marke�ng
     loca�ons and disclosed in the sustainability report.

planning
the nature of work in the oil and gas industry calls for comprehensive preven�ve measures in the processes
and transporta�on. therefore, bpcl has invested eﬀorts in pu�ng together thorough safety and security measures by
adop�ng advanced technologies and stringent standard opera�ng procedures at all loca�ons. the use of technology to
automate process has resulted in reducing the exposure of workers to harmful or toxic chemicals. technological

primary responsibility is to ensure adherence to the hsse policy. the safety performance of bpcl is monitored by
corporate hsse council, 4 regional councils and further at reﬁnery and marke�ng loca�ons through their respec�ve
safety commi�ees.

     pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana
     launch at motihari, east champaran, bihar
     the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy) was launched at mo�hari, east champaran bihar by hon’ble
     union minister of agriculture and farmer’s welfare shri. radha mohan singh and shri dharmendra prad-
     han, hon’ble minster of state (i/c), petroleum and natural gas on 31 july 2016. this marks one more step
     in the direc�on of providing lpg connec�ons during the three ﬁnancial years commencing 2016-17 to 5
     crore families who are below poverty line (bpl).
     as a symbolic launch of the pmuy, 10 women from bpl families were handed over connec�ons.
     pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana which was launched by hon’ble prime minister of india on 1st may 2016
     at ballia (u�ar pradesh) is a scheme to provide clean cooking fuel to the women belonging to the ‘below
     poverty line’ (bpl) households across the country. pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy) aims to
     provide subsidized connec�ons to 5 crore bpl households by 2019 and is a part of larger program of
     adding 10 crore new lpg connec�ons by 2019. most of the connec�ons would be in the eastern part of
     india where domes�c lpg penetra�on is less than the na�onal average. this is the ﬁrst �me in the history
     of the country that the ministry of petroleum and natural gas is implemen�ng a welfare scheme beneﬁt-
     �ng crores of women belonging to the poorest households. the iden�ﬁca�on of bpl families will be
     made on social economic caste census (secc)- 2011 data. who study also suggests that 5 lakh women
     die every year in our country on account of fumes generated by using non-conven�onal sources of fuel.

     finance minister has budgeted rs. 2,000 crore to subsidies 1.5 crore lpg connec�ons for bpl households
     during the ﬁnancial year 2016-17. during the next two ﬁnancial years i.e. 2017-18 and 2018-19, the

a new low cost lpg stove has been developed (with bis cer�ﬁca�on and one star ra�ng) for the use of bpl
households and the cost of the stove is rs. 990 , and thereby reducing the burden on the poor households. oil
marke�ng companies shall also provide an op�on of interest free emi op�on to cover the cost of lpg stove and
/ or the ﬁrst reﬁll to the beneﬁciaries who are unable to bear this cost. the interest free emi op�on aims at
recovering the loan amount through the gas subsidy deposited in the bank account of the beneﬁciary from the
subsequent reﬁlls.

subsequent to the launch of the scheme on 1st may, 2016 at ballia; several regional launches took place in the
states of gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, odisha and bihar to expedite enrolment of more and more of
beneﬁciaries in this scheme. within a short span of less than three months, more than 20 lakhs of beneﬁciaries
have been released lpg connec�ons under the scheme. ministry of petroleum and natural gas is set to extend
beneﬁt of the scheme to 1.5 crore beneﬁciaries during the current ﬁnancial year 2016-17. in bihar, the scheme

9a. investor interests
investors are the most important stakeholders inﬂuencing decision making in the company. a sustainable return requires
sharper focus on corporate governance and environmental and social factors. and owing to the nature of the sector, the
business is chieﬂy driven by consumer spending, ﬂuctua�on in crude oil prices, strong government and a ﬁscally prudent
budgetary plan inﬂuenced by eﬃcient and quality proucts, derived by environmentally safe prac�ces. bpcl has been
strategically expanding its investment in reﬁning and distribu�on capacity to bridge the gap between sales volumes and
produc�on and create oportuni�es with the manufacture of nice petrochemicals.

indian petroleum sector
india is expected to overtake china as the largest consumer of petroleum products over the next 20 years.while oil
dynamics are expected to con�nue to remain uncertain and vola�le, the oil industry is well on the recovery path, ge�ng
accustomed to the new lows. the decline in prices has been extremely beneﬁcial to india, making energy more
aﬀordable and easily accessible. what remains a challenge though is that india is s�ll dependent on imports for 80% of
its crude requirements, thus making it more vulnerable to the interna�onal oil scenario. india accounts for only 0.3% of
the proven oil reserves, but has an energy consump�on share exceeding 5%. in such a situa�on, being one of the fastest
growing energy consumers, crude import decisions become extremely crucial.

over the years, india’s crude imports have been increasing consistently. during 2016-17, crude imports increased 5%
over the previous year. however, declining prices have had a posi�ve impact on the crude import bill. it was only last year
that the energy bill has increased by about 10% par�ally due to moderate increase in crude prices and par�ally due to
the deprecia�ng indian rupee.

planned indigenous crude oil produc�on for 2016-17 was 37.1 mmt against which the actual indigenous crude
oil produc�on that was recorded during 2016-17 is 36 mmt (36.9 mmt during 2015-16). the decline of 2% in
indigenous crude oil produc�on as compared to the previous year and the targets for 2016-17 is primarily due
to reduced produc�on from mature and ageing ﬁelds, underperformance and opera�onal issues in some
ﬁelds.




  sustainable development report 2016-2017                                                                                    60

     india is emerging as a reﬁnery hub, being the 2nd largest reﬁner in asia. india’s reﬁning capacity stands at 234.5 mmt as
     on 1st april 2017, up from 230.1 mmt in the previous year. the increase in reﬁning capacity is a�ributable to the integrat-
     ed reﬁnery expansion project (irep) at bpcl’s kochi reﬁnery. while the capacity expansion due to irep is expected to be
     6 mmtpa from 2018-19 onwards, 80% of designed capacity has been included at present. psu companies con�nue to hold
     a share of 65% in india’s reﬁning capacity.

     over the years, crude processing in india has been increasing. during 2016-17 it has increased by more than 5% to 245.4
     mmt as compared to the previous year. the increase is primarily due to the commissioning of the paradip reﬁnery in
     february 2016 and is expected to grow further with the irep stabiliza�on of bpcl’s kochi reﬁnery. consump�on of
     petroleum products grew by 5.2% to 194.2 mmt during 2016-17 as compared to the 11.6% growth recorded in the
     previous year. the main reason for a decline in growth was due to the substan�al decline in the growth of diesel that
     cons�tutes 40% of the total consump�on basket. diesel grew by only about 2% during 2016-17 as compared to the 7.5%
     growth recorded in the previous year largely due to reduc�on in the growth in commercial vehicles (cv). during 2016-17
     cvs registered a growth of about 4% as against the growth of 11.5% on the previous year. this, together with increased
     fuel eﬃciency have caused a sharp reduc�on in the growth of diesel during 2016-17.

     pipelines:
     bpcl group owns a robust network of 2241 km of product pipelines with design capacity of 17.84 mmt. pipelines have
     achieved throughput of 14.06 mmt in the year 2016-17 which is highest so far. pipelines have moved about 5072 mmtkm
     petroleum products to bpcl’s marketing locations spread across northern,central, western & southern part of the
     country, which is about 40 % of total primary transport.

     supplier identiﬁcation and tendering
     to ensure suppliers are in line with bpcl’s vision, it is important to monitor and track supplier progress. however, the
     sheer breadth and depth of bpcl’s supply chain make it challenging to eﬀec�vely manage all business requirements.
     thus, bpcl has embraced technology as a means to improve and op�mize their business. bpcl ensures transparent and
     eﬀec�ve management of tendering process with the help of technology. in accordance with the company policy, bpcl
     follows an e-tendering system before engaging with any external party. this robust e-tendering system allows bpcl to
     scru�nize all vendors and suppliers on various parameters before they begin work with bpcl. the bid qualiﬁca�on
     criterion (bqc) in the tender creates a ﬁlter for suppliers and ensures only high-quality products are procured.

     bpcl’s central procurement oﬃce engages in strategic procurement for various business units and reﬁneries. the
     procured materials need to inspected and cer�ﬁed as per company’s policy and by a third-party agency for larger
     procurements bpcl ensures no compromise is made pertaining to compliance with quality of procurement. to render
     support to the local suppliers, above 90% of our material and equipment is procured locally while balance is imported.
     local refers to india opera�ons.

     bpcl is fully complying with the public procurement policy for mses and ‘purchase preference clause’ for mses has been
     incorporated in the ‘general purchase condi�ons’ of all the tenders. as against the target of 20% this year, bpcl has
     achieved 27.98% of procurement through mses. the total procurement value for bpcl where mses could have
     par�cipated is 6094.63 crores and the actual value procured from mses is rs. 1705.27 crores. local in this report refers
     to india.


     this year bpcl inaugurated contractor management system (cms) which was made available in bpmai. this dashboard
     represents a single screen view of full cms process i.e. from pass registra�on to issue. this system has been implemented
     in the reﬁneries.

     it also provides below men�oned informa�on on a single screen:
     1. facility to monitor and eliminate discrepancies in licenses issued to vendor and total employees entering in reﬁnery
        premises against issued licenses,
     2. single point availability of contract employee details like medical, safety, esic, veriﬁca�on, bpcl in charge details etc.
     3. gender wise summary
     4. month wise contract employee’s summary

     the central procurement oﬃces (cpo) at bpcl constantly looks for new and innova�ve ways to reduce consump�on as
     well as procure more eﬃcient and environment friendly material. the cpo does this by trying to scale up the procurement
     of ethanol and other green products.

     supplier assessment
     bpcl engages with large number of suppliers as a                                                 constant
     normal course of work. these suppliers encompass                                                 quality check
     contract staﬀ supplying agencies and suppliers of
     products, materials and equipment. the robust
     e-tendering system on-boards all our vendors and                                     integrity pact signed as
     suppliers. bpcl ensures compliance with the applicable                               part of on-boarding process
     na�onal and interna�onal standards.

                                                                               suppliers -self
                                                                               declara�on




69                                                                                           bharat petroleum corporation limited

bpcl has a high regard for ethical conduct. thus, every supplier is to sign an integrity pact before empanelment. the
integrity pact contains the terms and condi�ons and monitoring mechanisms of working with bpcl and includes
condi�ons on environment protec�on, child labour, �mely payment of dues and good working condi�ons. all business
units and loca�on heads are well aware about the working condi�ons and ethics that are ar�culated to the company.

bpcl has both a formal and an informal mechanism to report cases of human rights, child labour, forced labour and
working condi�ons of contractors/ contract labour. over the years our contractors/ contractor labour have freely used
these channels and have had their grievances resolved if any.

safety training
safety in transporta�on is of utmost importance. products at bpcl are transported via rail, road and coastal
movements. since road transporta�on is exposed to a higher propor�on of risks, not only concerning damage to
products but also risk to life, bpcl focusses on providing safety training for drivers and suppliers. bpcl ensures high
safety standards right from unloading, transporta�on, reloading and processing of the oil in the reﬁneries.

a number of training programmes and safety standards are in place in an a�empt to support transporters. the training
broadly comprises of, driving techniques, fuel conserva�on, defensive driving, knowledge of traﬃc rules and handling
of hazardous materials. some of the ini�a�ves to increase safety are:

1. 100% vehicle tracking systems are installed in the trucks to support the drivers while in transit.
2. con�nuous expansion of pipeline network to minimize the transporta�on by road.
3. hsse department analyses every single road accident to understand the root causes behind them.
4. safety ﬁ�ngs in trucks as per central motor act and the company’s safety policy

addi�onally, safety training is also provided for pipeline surveillance and pipeline health monitoring.

     'train the needy' – a programme by pipeline department for petty
      contractors & vendors
     role of pe�y contractors & vendors, especially in remote loca�ons, assumes greater signiﬁcance because of
     lack of resources and facili�es. above all, many amongst such class of our business partners are
     compara�vely 'less literate' and need 'hand-holding' at various stages of site ac�vi�es. documenta�on part
     of contractual ac�vi�es is actually tougher for them than physical execu�on of the work. the
     documenta�on type covers e-tenders, entry and work permit system, comple�ng statutory formali�es etc.

     recently, pipelines en�ty observed that numerous          loca�on: piyala
     mistakes are commi�ed by such contractors /               date: 16th may
     vendors inadvertently and ignorantly while                a�ended by: 25 contractors who have been
     responding to our e-tenders, leading to poor              opera�ng at mathura, bharatpur, manmad,
     response or rejec�on of their bids.                       mangliya, piyala & bijwasan etc.
     challenges
     • unavailability of 3g internet network and even con�nuous power supply
     • chance of leaking conﬁden�ality of tender documents as the contractors used internet café of
       nearby ci�es
     learnings/change
     • pipelines hq , coupled with m/s e-procurement technology ltd , imparted stepwise and 'live'
       training of ﬁlling tender documents.
     • dos & dont's were also explained with the help of images of old tenders in which contractors
       o�en made mistakes.
     outcomes of the training:
     1. improvement in the quality of documenta�on
     2. reduc�on in the number of viola�ons due to
         wrong documenta�on
     3. timely submission of bills
     4. compliance with statutory requirements

 9d. dealers and distributers
dealers and distributers are key channel partners whose interface with customers directly aﬀect bpcl’s opera�ons. they
play a vital role in providing customers with a wide range of products and services before and a�er the sale.

bpcl ensures quality customer treatment through its dealers. the process right from dealer selec�on & eligibility to
training and product delivery is robust and has been developed in collabora�on with other oil marke�ng companies. the
selec�on of new lpg distributers is par�cularly stringent with speciﬁc criteria for eligibility. bpcl also con�nuously reviews
the performance of lpg distributors through audits and inspec�ons to ensure supply of lpg is made only to genuine
customers. bpcl also keeps a check on defaul�ng distributers by conduc�ng raids and leving penal�es on them.

bpcl has a ‘marke�ng discipline guideline’ which is applicable to all dealers and distributers which elaborates on
procedures on opera�ons of retail networks/lpg distributorship. it provides standard opera�ng procedures for the
marke�ng network which builds trust and sa�sfac�on to the customer. addi�onally, bpcl also has laid out a
‘recons�tu�on guideline’ providing rules for retail outlet/ dealership. apart from the usual dealership, bpcl has policies
and guidelines for company owned and company operated (coco) services.

all dealers and distributers undergo regular training programmes such as the ‘visionary leadership programme’ providing
insight on behavioural and func�onal changes in the method of engaging with customers and ensure quality,
courteousness and �mely services.

been provided with pos machines to facilitate credit and debit card transac�ons while drive is on to complete all retail
outlets at the earliest. e wallet acceptance at all the retails outlets is nearing comple�on to enhance cashless
transac�ons. bpcl has enabled credit/debit card & mobile wallet payments at its petrol pumps apart from its pioneering
smart card based loyalty program which can also be recharged using credit / debit cards / rtgs / neft & which is being
used by a large number of ﬂeet owners as payment management solu�on as well as by individual customers.

message from the director- marketing
                            the year gone by has been a very successful one for us in terms of sales volume achieved
                            and increase in market share. last year we achieved the highest ever sales volume of 37.74
                            mmt and cornered a market share of 22.77% amongst the public sector oil companies. at
                            bpcl we have always ensured that our values are ingrained in every aspect of what we do.
                            we recognize that the sustained growth of bpcl depends on the economic,environmental,
                            and social pillars and hence we have been striving con�nuously to fulﬁl our triple bo�om
                            line responsibility.

                            we acknowledge the impact that we have on the environment and are constantly looking
                            out for opportuni�es to curtail our nega�ve impact. moving forward with the vision of
being “most admired global energy company”, we have joined hands with teri, new delhi to act against consequences
of climate change. in line with the government’s auto fuel policy, our reﬁneries at mumbai and kochi have successfully
upgraded to bs-iv auto-fuels eﬀec�ve from march 2017, in an a�empt to reduce carbon emissions. we have also
carried out many renewable energy and energy conserva�on projects resul�ng in annual reduc�on of ghg emissions
by 34,000 metric tons of co₂ equivalent. we have made extensive budget outlay for developing infrastructure at
reﬁning and marke�ng loca�ons in our eﬀort to improve environment protec�on.

we are sensi�ve to the service levels oﬀered to our customers across every touch-point and commitment to enhance
customer experience. focus is to make every interac�on eco-friendly keeping in view that we interact with millions of
customers on day to day basis, for e.g., our focus is on promo�ng eco-friendly 4t lube oil across network and also
managing the reverse logis�cs of used lubrica�ng oil. the value-added services oﬀered by the lubricants business plays
a key role in facilita�ng the sales process through appropriate services oﬀerings to end customers. around 1584 retail
outlets of bpcl have a ‘quick oil change’ facility within the premises, where 2-wheeler customers can have their engine
oils changed within a �me span of 7-10 minutes without any spillage, through a pneuma�c machine that sucks out the
old oil.

we have undertaken community development by crea�ng opportuni�es for learning, skilling and infrastructure
development. we are energizing communi�es through csr ac�vi�es which are mainly focused on educa�on, water
conserva�on, health and hygiene and installa�on of solar lights and handpumps in remote villages. from the water
conserva�on standpoint, we have ini�ated project boond, a rain water harves�ng ini�a�ve with our specialized ngo.
we have increased total catchment area for rainwater harves�ng by 36.3%. on the solar energy genera�on front, we
have already set up 4 mw grid connected solar pv plant at bina dispatch terminal (bdt) at bina, madhya pradesh and
1.05 mw solar plant at crdc noida. we have set up a total of 704 kw solar plants at various loca�ons in the oﬀ grid and
grid �ed front. as on march 2017, 636 retail outlets(ros) have been solarized with an average power of 5 kw per ro.
this translated into 3.18 mw. at bpcl as of 31stmarch 2017 we are genera�ng power of 8.934 mw through all solar
installa�ons. going forward we have laid clear roadmap for increasing the genera�on of power from solar in the years
coming.

the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (pmuy) has enabled further outreach to rural communi�es. pmuy launched in 2016
to empower missions of poor women in india who were forced to inhale unhealthy emissions from the coal, wood and
other unclear fuels while cooking, has been well received. apart from focusing on health of rural women and other
family members, it is also and indirect and posi�ve eﬀect on deforesta�on and environment. propaga�ng safe use of
lpg in the rural hinterland through several modes, like nukkad nataks, safety clinics and house to house safety
educa�on, ujjwala suraksha mitra has remained a focus area for bpcl. 53.22 lakh connec�ons were released in the
year 2016-17. our endeavor has always been to ensure safety of our customers at every touch point

with these mul�tude of eﬀorts invested in r&d and technology, we are poised to meet the upcoming challenges and
set higher benchmarks to improve our sustainability performance, thereby aiding our growth in the business.

annexure 2- ghg calculation quantiﬁcation methodology
the methodology of calcula�on of ghg emissions from bpcl opera�ng loca�ons are aligned with the
following standard deﬁni�ons:

1. sta�onary combus�on: emission factors provided in the ipcc guideline for na�onal greenhouse gas
inventories of 2006 were used to calculate ghg emissions from sta�onary combus�on sources. ac�vity data
(quan�ty of fuel consumed) is mul�plied with the respec�ve default energy factor or actual measured net
caloriﬁc value (ncvs) and emission factor to quan�fy the direct emission from sta�onary combus�on sources.
2. purchased electricity: the quan�ﬁca�on of energy indirect ghg emission (scope 2) is based on ac�vity
data (purchased electricity in kwh) mul�plied by emission factors speciﬁed in the ‘co2 baseline database for
the indian power sector user guide’, issued by central electricity authority, government of india for uniﬁed
grid.
3. transporta�on: only transporta�on considered for calcula�on of emissions is in-plant vehicular movement
of the vehicles. emission factors provided in the ipcc guideline for na�onal greenhouse gas inventories of
2006 were used to calculate ghg emissions from combus�on sources. ac�vity data (quan�ty of fuel
consumed)is mul�plied with the respec�ve default energy factor or actual measured net caloriﬁc value
(ncvs) and emission factor to quan�fy the emissions.
