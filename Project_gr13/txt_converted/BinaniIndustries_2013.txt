from trading to manufacturing to global
operations, the story of the braj binani
group starting from humble beginnings
to the present-day global stature, is a
saga of pioneering efforts and
pathbreaking initiatives. today, the braj

house with interests in zinc, cement,
glass fibre, composites, project
management services, construction etc.
with an expanding global footprint. it
truly epitomises the growing aspirations
of modern indian business.
the braj binani group traces its beginnings to 1872, when pragdas binani, a
trader in metal utensils, began an enterprise with his son mathuradas to
import and export metals. this enterprise grew from strength-to-strength
until 1941, which is considered a watershed year in the group's history. in
1941, mathuradas' son, govardhandas took the bold decision to shift the
business from trading to manufacturing.

oxy-fuel combustion technology employs environment-
friendly process for the melting of glass. in this method, a
pair of auxiliary oxy-fuel burners is installed in an air-fired
furnace to accelerate the melting and fining rate. in most
furnaces, glass pull rate increases to about 10 to 30% as
compared with only air firing. in an oxy-fuel-fired furnace,
the temperature profile or the heat flux distribution to the
furnace load is relatively easily controlled by the number
and the placement of the oxy-fuel burners. this flexibility of
placing a flame, where it is needed, is a major reason
enabling the production rate increase.

it aids in improving the furnace energy efficiency.
additionally, reduced air emissions result in lesser impacts
on the environment.

    the fly ash generated from our captive power plants contains
    high carbon content and could not be used for producing fly ash,
    based ppc as the quality of fly ash does not conform to “bureau of
    indian standard” norms. secondly, during mixing of cement with
    water, carbon particles used to float on the surface of water. after
    several technical reviews, it was identified that if we spray it on the
    hot clinker bed of clinker cooler having bed temperature > 750oc,
    the carbon particles will burn immediately and fly ash will become
    a part of clinker.

stakeholder engagement and
materiality analysis




46 binani industries limited

we work to create the greatest value for our stakeholders
and, therefore, understanding their key concerns and issues
becomes an integral function of our sustainable
development strategy. we strongly believe in transparent
and equitable business practices and to accomplish this,
engage with our key stakeholders on a regular basis.
during the reporting period, several workshops were organised in each business unit to identify and
prioritise stakeholder concerns. these workshops were attended by all the department heads of our units
and moderated by a third party. the exercise helped us formally list all the groups of stakeholders that we
engage with during the regular course of conducting our business. we have been using various
engagement methods such as customer satisfaction surveys to gauge valuable feedback that provides us
vital insight into customer requirements and expectations.

through the process of prioritisation, we have identified our key stakeholder groups as follows:



                                                 employees



                            government &

we engage with our stakeholder groups frequently through various interactive mechanisms. our company
is a member of several industry associations such as confederation of indian industry, assocham,
federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry and the employers' federation of india.

viewed from the lens of sustainability, material issues reflect key issues having significant economic,
environmental and social impacts or that would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders. we have taken action to identify the issues of importance to us and our stakeholder groups
through workshops at unit level which were attended by department heads. the key materiality issues
were prioritised based on their relevance to our business. we assess each of these areas to identify and
pursue opportunities to enhance sustainability.

please refer to the sustainability reports 2010-11 of our group companies for details of the issues identified
as material for each business.

                         the company strives to create maximum economic value for all of its
                         stakeholders. being a holding company with multiple businesses, the
      economic           company gets directly affected from the global market trends; however, we
                         aim not only meeting the economic standards, but to go beyond them. we
                         believe in creating local wealth and fostering inclusive growth.

                         industries depend on natural resources like water, wood, coal etc. for various
                         industrial applications and production processes. therefore, environmental
                         sustainability is one of the core business issues. the company takes
                         cognizance of its responsibility and imbibes sustainable development
    environment          philosophy in the business operations and planning. we have installed
                         state-of-the-art technologies which reduce the resource usage, thus,
                         helping in conservation, improving energy efficiency, water optimisation
                         and developing alternative sources of energy and low-water processes
                         which are major priorities for us.

                         the company believes that employees are backbone of an organisation and
                         thus, the company respects the dignity, rights and ambitions of its
                         workforce. we actively seek to engage people across the organisation. we
 labour and decent       feel it is important to maintain a responsible human resources policy, with
   work practices        focus on training, health care & safety. we have systems to ensure highest
                         standards of safety at the workplace. we are an equal opportunity employer
                         and do not discriminate on basis of race, caste, national origin, religion,
                         disability, gender or age.

                         the company has systems to allow people to exercise their respective
    human rights
                         human rights and procedures to arrest any human rights misuse. we
                         actively engage with our contractors on the issue and have zero tolerance
                         towards unethical practices, viz. child labour, forced labour, etc.

                         we accord high significance to improve socio-economic conditions of our
                         neighbouring communities. we see ourselves as a change maker in their
       society           lives and livelihoods. we actively engage with them in meaningful dialogue.
                         we partner with the community for their betterment through various
                         projects in the areas of health, education, facilities for the elderly and
                         common community spaces, etc.

                         since our products are targeted at highly specialised use, the quality and
                         purity of our products is critical to us. we comply with all regulations
