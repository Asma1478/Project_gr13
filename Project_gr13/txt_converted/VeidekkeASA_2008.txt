many of the day-to-day operations in a company like veidekke are concerned with
social responsibility in practice. our core operations include the development and
building of houses, offices, hotels, roads, bridges, tunnels and railways. we pave,
operate and maintain kilometre upon kilometre of public roads. we have about a
thousand ongoing projects in different parts of scandinavia at any one time. clearly,
there are many people who are affected in one way or another by our operations –
because they live next door to a building site, or because they are clients or em-
ployees, or politicians who make decisions at local or central level about our future
projects. no matter what processes we implement at veidekke, we must never for-
get the people who are affected by our operations. our commitment to corporate
social responsibility will always be reflected in the way we manage the group, and
it is therefore rooted in our basic values of being professional, honest, enthusiastic
and ground-breaking.

we have set four main objectives for our endeavours to ensure responsible
operations in all parts of our organisation. we will always:

+ run a healthy and profitable business
+ live up to society’s and our own ethical standards
+ have an open dialogue and maintain good relations with the world outside
  the company
+ be open and proactive with regard to problems and incidents

we will live up to these standards – whatever the project or task in hand.

the construction industry can make

scandinavia. from what the panel says, we need to
reduce emissions of the various greenhouse gases
by 50 per cent by 2030 if we are to gain control of the
situation.

the construction industry can play a signiﬁcant role in
achieving this target in the years to come. forty per
cent of total energy consumption in scandinavia can
be related to the building and use of houses, ofﬁces
and other buildings, where there is a large potential
for smarter designs. our industry is also facing huge
challenges in the actual building process, for example
in drying out buildings to avoid damp.the construc-
tion industry is responsible for 13-14 per cent of
norway’s total emissions of co2, and this is a
substantial ﬁgure.

veidekke is also participating in a research project
with the norwegian building research institute to
increase knowledge about thermal bridges.these
are places in buildings that are particularly vulnerable
to heat loss, for example in the transition between
ﬂoors or between walls and ceilings.the object here
is to compile a ‘thermal bridge atlas’, which will make
it easier to choose the best solutions for different
building projects. in this way we will help to put a
stronger focus on total energy expenditure in our
ﬂats and on ways to reduce carbon emissions by
using smarter technical solutions.

veidekke has a decentralised organisation with a large
degree of local freedom. this means that we have to pay
particular attention to the ﬂow of expertise in the organi-
sation. how do we, for example, distribute knowledge
about building low-energy homes in trondheim to the
rest of our scandinavian organisation? the key is to
create good meeting places for the exchange of know-
how and this is where our training staff comes in. one
of their main goals is to create meeting places where
personnel with special know-how can meet and
exchange experience across regional boundaries.

from a well-functioning, stable construction market.
however, our industry has traditionally been vulnerable to
economic cycles. many companies have found it difﬁcult
to price projects correctly, because prices rise steeply
during the building process and eat up the calculated
margins. this has resulted in poor proﬁts for many
companies, even in boom periods.

                     veidekke’s decentralised organisation means that the group
