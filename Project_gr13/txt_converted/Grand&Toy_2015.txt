                   corporate citizenship report
                   letter from the general manager

                   it has been a busy year working with our key stakeholders on solutions to help our
                   customers and associates operate business more sustainably. seven years since
                   establishing a strong corporate and social responsibility program, we consulted
                   with our stakeholders to ensure this was still relevant in today’s market. all the core
                   principles remain yet our key stakeholders have helped us focus on the two most
                   important sustainability issues to them: recycling and green products.
                   as a result, we have worked with our new parent company, office depot to
                   leverage the best sustainability practices from both organizations. our green
                   products were re-classified according to office depot’s industry-leading criteria
                   and the “shades of green” were introduced to the canadian market.
                   in 2014, grand & toy partnered with terracycle canada becoming the first
                   e-tailer in canada to offer a recycling solution for coffee capsules such as k-cup®
                   packs, and bringing their zero waste box to our customers. this partnership
                   was further expanded in early 2015 by adding zero waste boxes for other waste
                   streams to our offering.
                   grand & toy’s internal practices were also improved: the environmental
                   footprint from waste generation was reduced significantly; we also continued
                   our seven-year partnership with start2finish by providing 7,500 backpacks for
                   underprivileged children.
                   looking forward, we will continue to focus on material sustainability issues.
                   we are focused on increasing our recycling options and the choice of green
                   products, while lowering our environmental footprint and engaging with external
                   and internal stakeholders.

internal waste practices
over the past few years, the grand & toy customer fulfillment centre in vancouver pioneered a waste reduction initiative
and managed to decrease the total amount of waste generated in the facility by a factor of eight. the following materials are
currently being recycled or reused in the vancouver facility: paper, cardboard, corrugate, plastic, styrofoam, shrink wrap,
plastic strapping, electronic waste, batteries, pallets, wood chips, and organic waste. in 2014, the best practices from this
pilot program were applied at other locations resulting in the sharp drop in overall generated waste going to the landfill and
the rise in the recycling rate from 33.4% in 2013 to 68.3% in 2014.

                                                                     2013 weight                      2014 weight

    green products
    it is the mandate of grand & toy to
    continue to expand our offering and sales
    of environmentally preferable products.
    these products were traditionally
    defined as follows:

    • products that have a minimum of 30%
      post-consumer content
    • products that carry a recognized third-party
      environmental certification
    • products that have a traditional attribute that makes
      them better alternatives to standard products
      (for instance, products made with less input materials than
      traditional alternatives.)

    in 2014, however, more thorough criteria were introduced          as the list of eco-conscious products is expanded, it is also
    to define which products are considered “environmentally          very important to us that the quality of the products remains
    conscious”. all green products are now classified according       the same or better than that of products being replaced.
    to their environmental attributes created by office depot

    one of the major green product changes in 2014 was the addition of recycled paper products from rolland enterprises inc.
    rolland’s facilities are located in saint-jérôme, quebec and utilize carbon-neutral biogas energy in production. because of this
    and other initiatives, rolland’s environmental footprint is markedly lower than the industry average. the environmental impact of
    switching to rolland recycled paper is also measurable: grand & toy customers may use the eco-calculator that is available on
    the rolland website.

     greenhouse gas footprint
     the greenhouse gas footprint of our facilities increased slightly in 2014, mostly
     attributable to weather trends within the year. scope 3 emissions from rented
     locations, however, was notably reduced after 19 stores were closed in 2014
     (not represented in the numbers below.)
     overall, grand & toy’s carbon footprint has dropped significantly since the
     2010 baseline year; while a portion of this decrease was the result of proactive
     initiatives on our part to reduce our impact, another portion was the result of
     changes in our business activity due to the economic climate.
