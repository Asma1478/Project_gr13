the automotive sector takes its environmental responsibility very seriously. while the vast majority
of the life-cycle emissions associated with a vehicle is from the in-use phase, the industry has strived
to minimise the energy used to make its products, not least because this also helps reduce costs and
improve competitiveness.

manufacturing energy use
department for energy and climate change
(decc) figures show vehicle manufacturing
accounts for around 4% of energy consumption
by all industry in the uk.
within a vehicle manufacturing site the paint
shop, boiler house and heating/ventilation
account for some 65% of emissions. the industry
has made great progress in reducing emissions.
whilst the largest step changes can be made in
the paint shops and boilers, these are the most
expensive operations to replace and have long
replacement cycles. efficiency gains have also
been made using existing plant more effectively,
for example, optimising running times, paint oven
controls or fan speeds, as well as investing in
new equipment such as decentralised heating
systems replacing old boilers, improved controls,
led lighting, and variable speed drives.

the in-use phase from customers is estimated
to account for some 85% of the life-cycle
emissions associated with a car, and it is the
combined efforts of all stakeholders – industry,
government, consumers, the media and others
– that will deliver the greatest efficiency gains
through a comprehensive approach. this on-
going collaboration is required to ensure further
gains are achieved most efficiently, which
will require more fundamental changes than
just vehicle technology. the necessity of the
comprehensive approach is also highlighted
where increased vehicle use can offset the
technological efficiency gains made.

the board improvements by petrol and diesel
engines, a market shift to diesels over the past
15 years, and more recently the rapid growth in
alternative powertrains. alternatively-fuelled

   gkn hybrid power flywheels in 750 uk buses
   gkn plc launched the gkn hybrid power business on 1 april 2014.
   the company specialises in flywheel-based energy storage systems,
   which were originally developed for use in formula 1 racing. a high
   speed carbon fibre flywheel stores the energy generated as the vehicle
   slows, and then uses it to power an electric motor to assist acceleration.
   this generates fuel savings of more than 20% at a significantly lower
   cost than battery hybrid alternatives. gkn hybrid power has already
   won contracts to fit its eco-technology to 750 buses in the uk.            gkn hybrid flywheel system
