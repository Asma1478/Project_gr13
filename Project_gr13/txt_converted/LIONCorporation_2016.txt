we reduced greenhouse gas emission by 0.4% (compared to
2014, emission intensity per unit of production), failing to attain
the target of a 1 % reduction for each year. this was because
energy efficiency decreased due to the plants with lower pro-
duction volume. we will work on more efficient production by
ensuring production volume according to production capacity.

                                        the environment
         harmonizing with nature
lion has assumed a leading role in tackling water-related environmental issues such as bubble floating occurred in rivers and
eutrophication of waterways linked to the use of detergents, and has considered biodiversity conservation at each stage from
raw material procurement to disposal. however, in order to receive and preserve the blessings of biodiversity into the future,
it will be mandatory for us to coordinate with local communities to focus on conservation of biodiversity and promote sus-
tainable use thereof. also, it is important to promote a shift in lifestyle of consumers through products that take biodiversity
into consideration, and to contribute to the realization of a society harmonizing with nature.
   to this end, lion will contribute to the development of a sustainable society through its business by ascertaining the natu-
ral resources used in business activities and the impact on biodiversity throughout the value chain and carrying out biodiver-
sity conservation activities that lead to the expansion of opportunities and reduce the risks. also, by having each of our em-
ployees participate in activities to conserve biodiversity as part of our environmental education, we will spread awareness of
biodiversity conservation to all our office sites.

2010, the cabinet office approved the change in the founda-
tion’s status to a public interest incorporated foundation,
and ldh commenced operations. through the three public
