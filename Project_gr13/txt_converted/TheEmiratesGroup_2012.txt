case study:
a test for eco-efficiency
situation
emirates flies one of the youngest, most advanced international jet fleet in the world, with an average age of 6.4 years
(the industry average is 11.3 years). from a performance standpoint, this translates into an extremely fuel-efficient
fleet. but how you fly an aircraft can also increase fuel efficiency. emirates participates in the inspire programme
(indian ocean strategic partnership to reduce emissions), a partnership created in march 2011 between air
navigation service providers and a select group of airlines with the aim of using air traffic management best practices
to reduce the fuel burn and carbon emissions associated with aviation.

     situation
     unit loading devices (ulds) contain the freight and baggage that is loaded into the hold of an aircraft. our most
     common uld, the ake, weighed 79kg and is made from aluminium. reducing that weight would pay off in fuel savings
     and co2 emissions.

a clean engine is more efficient
situation
jet engine core washing is part of emirates engineering’s routine maintenance programme. but increasing the
frequency of engine washing (above that specified by the manufacturer) is also beneficial. it lowers the engine’s
operating temperature, which extends engine life and reduces its fuel consumption.

     there is still the need to produce paper documents. for this, the emirates group came up with an environmentally-
     responsible solution.

     emirates group it (egit) strives for zero e-waste going to landfills. all corporate it and e-waste must be safely
     and securely re-used or recycled. re-use and recycling eliminates the health and environment hazards associated

     substances – such as mercury, lead, barium, arsenic, antimony and cadmium.

protecting and conserving natural environments




dubai desert conservation reserve
(ddcr)
established as a conservation reserve in
2003, ddcr covers 225 km2, nearly 5%
of the emirate of dubai.

in 2011-12, ddcr partnered with
biosphere expeditions, an international,
non-profit wildlife volunteer organisation
that hosts conservation expeditions
for environmental volunteers around
the world.

in january 2012, volunteers from europe,
united states and australia participated
in ddcr’s first expedition to work with
three species on the international
union for conservation of nature (iucn)
red list of threatened species:
the oryx, gordon's wildcat and
macqueen’s bustard.

ddcr also launched a major campaign
to plant thousands of indigenous ghaf
and acacia trees. these trees will provide
a valuable habitat for the more than 44
species of mammals, reptiles and 120
species of birds that have been recorded
in ddcr.
