               management                    we are using cutting-edge technologies
                                             to create a recycling-oriented society


               many products are thrown away after use, but the shin-etsu group strives to use limited resources efficiently and engage
               in recycling, achieving sustainable resource circulation.
                   our group collaborates with customers and related industry groups, using cutting-edge technologies to recover
               products, extract resources, and reuse them in our products. not only do these initiatives make it possible to reduce the
               waste output of our customers and the group itself, but they also contribute to resource and environmental conservation.

               every year the shin-etsu group creates environmental and safety management plans based on responsible care codes.
               the entire group works as one on key initiatives such as “environmental preservation,” “prevention of major disasters
               such as explosions or fires,” and “prevention of work accidents.”
