as machine learning. machines will be able to take decisions

governance and integrity
embedded in our business values




abb’s technology makes a major contribution to businesses
and communities around the world. however, it is not only
what we do, but how we do it that determines our reputation
with stakeholders and ensures our continued success.

abb sets high standards of integrity, which are expected of
every employee in every country where we do business. we
use a systematic approach, supported by tools and pro-
cesses, to embed integrity in the organization and apply
a zero tolerance policy for violations.

standards of business conduct
abb’s approach to integrity is based on a clear set of values
and strong communication from top leadership – to our em-
ployees and also to our business partners. these values and

kingdom support people with mental disabilities taking part
in summer and winter olympics. cancer research initiatives
receive long-term support from abb in several countries,
including canada, mexico, the united states and united king-
dom, with employees giving in different ways – from donations
to sponsored golf tournaments.

humanitarian assistance
abb has both a strategic and on-the-ground approach to hu-
manitarian crises. we have a decade-long partnership with
the international committee of the red cross (icrc), and our
annual contribution is currently used to support clean water
access in areas of humanitarian need in iraq and the demo-
cratic republic of congo. among other areas of cooperation,
abb engineers lead training sessions for icrc engineers on
technology such as pumps and motors that the icrc uses in
the field.

abb also provides support in the event of humanitarian and
natural disasters. in 2015, abb in india provided aid after the
devastating earthquake in nepal, while financial support for
flood victims was provided in argentina, myanmar and ma-
laysia.

as a first step, many locations focus on awareness building              waste and recycling
and on ensuring that processes are designed to support
material efficiency and waste sorting for improved recycling.                            350                                                      30%

currently, there is a conflict in the democratic republic of
congo where armed groups are being funded through the
sale of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (“conflict minerals” or
“3tg”) from mines which they control. we are actively work-
ing to identify whether any of the conflict minerals contained
in our products have been obtained from the mines support-
ing armed groups.

in 2015, we provided our second report, covering 2014, regard-
ing conflict minerals in our products to the united states
securities and exchange commission according to the require-
ments of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform
and consumer protection act.

we continue to assess our product portfolio to identify the
use of tin, tungsten, tantalum or gold in our products and uti-
lize abb product experts, including representatives from
supply chain management, engineering, and research and
development, in making these product portfolio assess-
ments.

to assess whether the necessary conflict minerals in our
products originated from the democratic republic of congo
or any of its nine bordering countries, we performed a “rea-
sonable country of origin inquiry” (rcoi) in line with the inter-
nationally recognized due diligence framework set forth in
the organisation for economic cooperation and develop-
ment due diligence guidance for responsible supply
chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk
areas and identified direct suppliers of products likely to
contain 3tg .we then surveyed these suppliers using the
conflict minerals reporting template as developed and is-
sued by the electronic industry citizenship coalition — global
esustainability initiative (eicc/gesi).

in 2015, we expanded the number of suppliers covered by our
rcoi procedures. we also increased our efforts to identify
the specific components within each of our products. this
enabled us to refocus our supplier selection procedures
based on the results of the detailed analysis of our product
components. conclusions from this work will be included
in abb’s next report on conflict minerals to the securities and

   other companies.

dnv gl assurance statement




                                                   independent assurance statement

                     scope and approach
                     abb asea brown boveri ltd (abb) commissioned dnv gl business assurance norway (“dnv gl”) to
                     undertake independent assurance of the sustainability performance report 2015 (the “report”) for the year
                     ended 31 december 2015. the scope of the report is set out on page 69.
                                                                                                  tm
                     we performed our work using dnv gl’s assurance methodology verisustain , which is based on our
                     professional experience, international assurance best practice including the aa1000 assurance standard,
                     international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (isae 3000), and the global reporting initiative
                                                                                                                          tm
                     (gri) sustainability reporting guidelines. we evaluated the report for adherence to the verisustain
                     principles (the “principles”) of stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness, completeness,
                     neutrality and reliability.
                     we evaluated the performance data using the reliability principle together with abb’s data protocols for
                     how the data are measured, recorded and reported. the performance data in scope were: the data
                     reported for the gri indicators noted in the summary table starting on page 62 (en3 en5 en15 en16 en17
                     en21(voc) en23 la6) and the data reported for 2015 achievements against the nine group sustainability
                     objectives for 2020 (see objectives dashboard on pages 8-11 of the report).
                     our scope included all the information within the pdf version of the report, but excluded additional
                     information and case studies hyperlinked from the report, to illustrate the sustainability programme.
                     we understand that the reported financial data and information are based on data from abb’s annual
                     report and accounts, which are subject to a separate independent audit process. the review of financial
                     data taken from the annual report and accounts is not within the scope of our work.
                     we planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for
                     our assurance opinion. we are providing a ‘moderate level’ of assurance. a ‘high level’ of assurance would
                     have required additional work at group and site level to gain further evidence to support the basis of our
                     assurance opinion.



                     responsibilities of the directors of abb and of the assurance providers
                     the directors of abb have sole responsibility for the preparation of the report. in performing our assurance
                     work, our responsibility is to the management of abb; however our statement represents our independent
                     opinion and is intended to inform all abb stakeholders. dnv gl was not involved in the preparation of any
                     statements or data included in the report except for this assurance statement.
                     dnv gl provides a range of other services to abb, none of which constitute a conflict of interest with this
                     assurance work. this is the second year that we have provided assurance of the full report. we have
                     previously provided assurance services with respect to selected sustainability indicators for a number of
                     years.
                     dnv gl’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by
                     the client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. dnv gl expressly disclaims any
                     liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this assurance
                     statement.




58   performance summary | abb sustainability performance report 2015

basis of our opinion
a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed work at headquarters and
site level. we undertook the following activities:
   review of the current sustainability issues that could affect abb and are of interest to stakeholders
   review of abb’s approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs although we had no direct
    engagement with stakeholders
   review of information provided to us by abb on its reporting and management processes relating to
    the principles
   interviews with selected directors and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability
    issues and review of selected evidence to support issues discussed. we were free to choose
    interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility for the programmes to deliver the nine
    group sustainability objectives for 2020. we also interviewed management responsible for
    sustainability in brazil, china, poland and switzerland
   site visits conducted in: guarulhos, brazil; beijing, china; lodz, poland and lenzburg, switzerland to
    review the process and systems for preparing site level sustainability data and implementation of the
    sustainability strategy. we were free to choose the sites we visited and they were selected on the basis
    of the significance of their contribution to abb’s overall environmental impacts, to provide a
    geographical and divisional spread in 2015, and a different geographical footprint to the 2014 site visits.
    the selected sites were all within the top 20 sites for impacts based on the data in scope
   review of supporting evidence for key claims and data in the report. our checking processes were
    prioritised according to the materiality of issues at a consolidated corporate level
   review of the processes at group level for gathering and consolidating the specified performance data
    and, for a sample, checking the data consolidation.



opinion
on the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the report does not
properly describe abb’s adherence to the principles. in terms of reliability of the performance data, with
the exception of consolidated data for lost days, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data
have not been properly collated from information reported at operational level, nor that the assumptions
used were inappropriate.


observations
without affecting our assurance opinion we also provide the following observations.


stakeholder inclusiveness
the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to
sustainability.
abb began working with a stakeholder panel at group level in 2015 which has strengthened its approach to
stakeholder engagement. the statement from the panel is a positive addition and adds to the transparency
of the report. the recommendations from the stakeholder panel are useful and include short and longer
term points. in addition to addressing short term priorities, abb should consider developing a roadmap for
implementation of the longer term recommendations.
in addition, we recommend abb consider extending its stakeholder engagement arrangements to more
clearly include requirements with respect to local engagement. the outcomes of these engagements
should be integrated into decision making at a global level.




                                                      abb sustainability performance report 2015 | performance summary   59

                     materiality
                     the process for determining the issues that are most relevant to an organisation and its stakeholders.
                     this year abb sought input on the issues in its materiality matrix from the stakeholder panel, validating the
                     priority issues it has identified. we restate our recommendation that abb should report on the extent to
                     which different material issues are relevant at local level across the organisation.
                     management of the priority issues is well embedded within the business at a group and local level.
                     however the connection between targets at a site, country and group level is not completely aligned, and
                     there would be benefit in ensuring this is clearer.
                     safety has again been an area of considerable focus for abb with development of a number of new
                     programmes to support the strategy. reporting has been enhanced with the introduction of leading
                     measures (hazards and safety observation tours) to support the existing lagging ones. data accuracy in
                     these indicators should improve as the systems become embedded.
                     abb is planning to introduce peer to peer auditing programmes, initially in safety, to promote sharing and
                     learning across operations. we recommend considering including performance data reviews in these to
                     increase confidence in data reliability and consistency.
                     responsiveness
                     the extent to which an organisation responds to stakeholder issues.
                     the abb sustainability board meets annually and provides senior oversight of the sustainability strategy and
                     progress. it has the capacity to oversee the process of understanding and responding to strategic
                     engagement with stakeholders. abb should consider whether more frequent meetings would enhance
                     oversight of the strategy and programme. meetings should be timed to allow review of stakeholder input,
                     as well as the annual sustainability performance report.
                     the group level objectives are not consistently focused on the key programmes and activities covered by the
                     relevant issue areas. we support the recommendation made by the abb sustainability board to enhance
                     the overall governance of the development of targets and tracking of progress against them. this should
                     include ensuring the targets represent an appropriate challenge for the organisation.
                     while the objectives dashboard (page 8-11) provides a useful indication of performance against targets, abb
                     should ensure that each target is specific and measurable and that associated kpis report actual
                     performance against each target.
                     abb has sought feedback on its sustainability approach and reporting through the introduction of a
                     stakeholder panel and the move last year to assurance that considers its overall approach, as well as data
                     accuracy. some of the recommendations made will take time to implement. it will be important in
                     demonstrating responsiveness, to report on how the company has responded to feedback.
                     completeness
                     how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organisation and its stakeholders
                     is reported.
                     abb’s reporting of performance including the disclosure of data is comprehensive. this gives stakeholders
                     confidence that these aspects are managed appropriately.
                     abb has improved the basis for calculating scope 2 ghg emissions by using local emission factors rather
                     than a single global emission factor. we recommend that local factors are reviewed annually to account for
                     any changes in the energy mix.
                     although abb has a target for decreasing energy intensity, there is currently no target for reducing green
                     house gas (ghg) emissions. we recommend establishing a target for reducing ghg emissions. we also
                     recommend abb expand on its preparedness to respond to the outputs from cop21.
                     the analysis of where abb believes it can support the realization of the un sustainable development goals
                     (sdgs) is encouraging and we look forward to seeing this developed further.
                     we restate our recommendation that abb should consider reporting on tax and include additional
                     indicators related to integrity and human rights, in addition to training and capacity building.




60   performance summary | abb sustainability performance report 2015

neutrality
the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organisation’s performance, delivered in a
neutral tone.
the section on challenges and progress adds to the overall balance of the report. report users’
understanding of the context for these could be improved by providing further detail throughout the report
in future.
reliability
the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying
data management systems.
abb has established a variety of process for collecting and consolidating the various data it reports. the
company continued its well-established annual process for submission and approval of environmental data
from its sites to a central database, including an annual training process for data owners at site level. for
the environmental data in scope we saw evidence that the central team had undertaken further checks, and
where necessary corrected data prior to consolidation. the group intends to replace the existing database
in 2016 which should further strengthen the reporting process.
the kpis relating to the nine group sustainability objectives have been internally developed and we restate
our recommendation to report these definitions in future. where data collection processes have already
been established for reporting these kpis, the processes were clearly described by data owners. we restate
our recommendation to ensure these processes are documented for continuity.
last year we noted that the data for co2 from transport by own fleet is an estimated figure, the basis for
which has not been reviewed in the last 5 years. given that this represents around 20% of the group carbon
footprint, we restate our recommendation that the basis for this estimation is reviewed.
this year, as last year, we noted a number of cases where data reported in the global incident database
(gid) were lower than local systems for lost days. we recommend considering how to raise visibility of this
indicator at site and country level to improve accuracy of the consolidated global data.

   results for this indicator are based on reported data covering 95 percent of employees in 2015 (93 percent of employees in 2014, 85–88 percent in earlier years) plus estimated water
   purchased per employee for the remaining employees. see the approach to reporting section for more details.
g
   see approach to reporting chapter for more details on ghg emission calculation.

   in 2015, we updated the factor used to convert sf 6 emissions to co 2 equivalents to 22,800 kg co 2e/kg sf 6, as recommended by the uk department of energy & climate change in july
   2014, and have applied that factor to sf 6 data reported for all years (2011 – 2015). previously we used 22,200 kg co 2e/kg sf 6.
 i
   estimated data.
 j
   the air travel indicator includes data from abb china and thomas & betts for the first time in 2014.
k
   2014 and 2013 data for air travel are calculated using the emission factors published by the uk department of environment, food and rural affairs (defra in its “2012 guidelines to
   defra / decc’s ghg conversion factors for company reporting). data from 2012 and 2011 were calculated using emission factors provided by defra in its 2009 guidelines. use of
   the 2012 factors gives a slightly lower total. for comparison, abb’s air travel emissions for 2012, calculated using the 2012 emission factors = 165 kton co 2 equivalent.
 l
   data is not available in this form for 2011 and 2012.
