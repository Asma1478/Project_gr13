2014 sustainability report


(g4-1)
         letter from the ceo
         dear stakeholders,



         in 2014, we worked hard to build the platform for a new phase in the development of

         our business.

         month by month, autogrill consolidated its strength in mature markets, like europe and

         north america, and took important growth opportunities in emerging markets, mainly

         by winning new contracts in major airports in fast growing economies like vietnam,

         indonesia, the united arab emirates and turkey.

         these initiatives reflect our group’s main focus on the airport channel, where we have

         made heavy investments and developed new foodservice concepts that we hope will

         satisfy the needs - which are continually evolving and increasingly sophisticated -

         of all the travellers that visit our points of sale every day.

         meanwhile, in italy, where the market continued to be weak, autogrill started to redefine

         its boundary of operations to concentrate resources on the locations with the highest

         potential.

         thanks to these measures and the numerous innovations we’ve introduced, as well as

         the know-how acquired by the group over many years of doing business globally, i am

         confident that autogrill can exploit the new opportunities that will arise in the future.

         a future we are confident of also in light of falling oil prices, which favour increases in

         traffic flows.

         with these assumptions we will continue the work done last year with the conviction that

         we can build on the good results delivered in 2014.

outcomes. before launching the materiality analysis project the targeted goal was
clarified: identifying a materiality scale to be used to measure sustainability aspects -
i.e. social, environmental and governance aspects that can affect autogrill’s ability to
create or retain economic, environmental and social value for itself, its stakeholders, the
environment and the community at large in the long run, in order to prioritize the
different management and reporting activities.




           methodology:
           1. identification of issues
           2. general internal analysis (by csr)
           3. specialist internal analysis (by the management)
           4. analysis of the external perspective
           5. development of the materiality chart



1. identification of issues

the starting point was the identification of the potentially material aspects (e.g. csr
issues), analyzing the sources that could provide a complete analysis of the company
from the outside and multi-stakeholder discussion and exchange platforms at the
international level.

2. general internal analysis (by csr)

after the identification of the relevant issues (classified based on the relevant attribution
to the people, product, planet and governance areas, and in some cases also grouped




                                                                                                       materiality analysis
together under a common umbrella) the analysis started giving a score to the various
issues, taking into account the group peculiarities:
• business segment
• context
• vision, mission, strategy
• risk analysis


and the criteria that, in our opinion, define the concept of “creating or retaining value” :
• impact on sales
• competitiveness / new opportunities
• social license to operate
• consumer perception
• employee engagement
• attraction of talents
• compliance
• reputation


in addition to assigning a score to the different issues, the second part of the analysis
focused on determining a rating with reference to:
• the perimeter of the issue, the boundary within which the impact can become
    visible (geographic, business-related, supply chain-based)
• the degree of control that the organization has on the management (potential or
    actual) of that specific issue, i.e. the control of the issue and its ability to influence it.
the implemented logic envisages that materiality is increased for any specific issue
when the corresponding perimeter focuses more on the inside of the organization and,
at the same time, the greater the control (real or potential), the more the same issue is
considered material.
all considerations made in this first phase of the analysis are based, as indicated
above, on autogrill peculiarities (see chapter “acompany” and “strategy and
sustainability”).



3. specialist internal analysis (by the management)

after completion of the first general analysis of the issues by csr (which, for self-
explanatory reasons, is particularly oriented towards sustainability, based on the long
run and aimed at assessing risks / opportunities emerging from the same issues), the
other divisions of the organization were also invited to contribute in order to construct a
general view and identify possible corrections for the process and score attributed to
the various issues and also to carry out a specialized, vertical analysis on their activities
and responsibilities (as experts on the different issues).




                                                                          2014 sustainability report

                                 4. analysis of external perspective

                                 the issues were also analyzed based on the principle of stakeholder inclusiveness in
                                 order to develop a complete framework reflecting how stakeholders prioritize specific
materiality analysis




                                 issues. the following topics were taken into account:
                                 • international business reports
                                 • international general opinion reports
                                 • autogrill press kit analysis
                                 • consumer requests (resulting from the customer satisfaction survey)
                                 • worker requests (resulting from the employee engagement survey)
                                 • interviews with managers who are in direct contact with the stakeholders to
                                      analyze their perception about the issues based on the group’s knowledge of its
                                      stakeholders.



                                 5. development of the materiality chart

                                 after completing these analyses and sharing the corresponding outcomes, all scores
                                 were summed up for each issue in order to measure the importance of the same issue to
                                 the organization (internal analysis) and the importance that stakeholders attribute to it.
                                 the issues taken into account were then consolidated and mapped on a graph
                                 showing stakeholder expectations on the vertical axis and the importance that the
                                 organization attributes to the items analyzed with a view to business success on the
                                 horizontal axis.




                                 comments to the chart
                       (g4-19)
                                 the chart reflects the importance of the sustainability issues to autogrill in this specific
                                 period. the pressures and trends change over time and for this reason the graph should
                                 not be considered either static or final, and should instead be periodically updated.
                                 compliance with the law is considered by definition a key and substantial issue for the
                                 entire population of the organization. this is why it was not directly reflected in the
                                 materiality analysis, but is accounted for as a criterion for the definition of the
                                 importance of the various issues. in the same way, stakeholder engagement is
                                 considered an element at the basis of the concept of sustainability and is key for the
                                 materiality analysis. for this reason it is included as a criterion for the development of
                                 the graph and is not visible in it.
                                 as indicated in the graph, the key material issues for autogrill refer to its core business
                                 and its offering, and those connected with people - in particular its workers - as
                                 autogrill is a service company that currently employs more than 54,000 employees.

speed and comfort offered by the different means of transportation, globalization,
demographic changes and the emerging regions are key topics for autogrill in its
pursuit of sustainability strategies aimed at maximizing the value shared on one hand,

and reducing to the minimum the risks correlated to the group activity on the other.


at the end of 2011, within the framework of the “route to innovation” (the group’s plan
dedicated to innovation) the autogrill group launched its sustainability roadmap. for
the first time, the afuture roadmap identified and defined precise sustainability
objectives for the group. in 2012 methods were identified to implement the roadmap
effectively and define a data baseline that allows the group to monitor the attainment
of objectives. in 2013 half-year data was monitored along with the activities carried
out at the country level to reach the objectives.

framework is the strategic framework of reference for autogrill’s actions, which presents
the group sustainability policy, summarizing it and defining it also at the operating
level in combination with the ancillary activities. its scope is to provide a strategic
orientation to supplement a sustainable approach in the management of the operating
activities, defining improvement and innovation objectives for the group companies in
order to identify, design and implement sustainable actions.

group operations are mainly ensured through contracts for the assignment of
commercial services awarded by the landlords and operators of infrastructures
(airports, highways, railway stations, etc.). in the majority of cases, contracts are
stipulated following competitive tenders for which it is of utmost importance to rely on




                                                                                                     the world of autogrill
elevated know-how, high quality standards of the offer proposed and of the quality-
price ratio and local differentiation of the product offering in order to meet different
consumer needs.




                                        autogrill is the world leader in catering
                                        and retail services for travelers



although there is much competition for them, in the majority of cases concessions
present an important advantage for the landlord compared to other types of contracts:
exclusivity.


the concession system allows the planning of activities over a medium-long time span.
the duration of the contract is usually proportional to the level of capital expenditure
required and varies based on the type of offering. generally, catering activities on
highways require higher investments than other channels, because in the majority of the
cases investments are also needed for the refurbishment of the building. in fact,
highway concessions have an average duration of 10 to 25 years, with peaks of over
30 years, while airport concessions range from 5 to 10 years on average.




                    the valuation criteria of the offer vary in relation to the business channels,
                    the offer type and the country of reference.
                    the main selection criteria include:
                    • economic-financial quality and sustainability of the commercial project;
                    • brand portfolio;
                    • design and layout of the spaces;
                    • operator’s know–how and track record;
                    • financial commitments undertaken in terms of capex and rents.

the autogrill group is exposed to external risks and uncertainties deriving from factors
correlated with the general macro-economic context or the specific industry in which
the group operates, the financial markets, the evolution of the regulatory framework
and the risks deriving from the strategic decisions and linked to the management of
operational processes.
the objective of the group’s risk management function is to ensure that the different
business units making up the group manage risks in a standardized way, through the
implementation of a model based on the systematic identification, analysis and
assessment of the risk areas that can have an impact on the attainment of the group’s
strategic objectives, contributing to the assessment of the company’s exposure to risks
and the development of the necessary risk mitigation actions aiming at reducing the
level of volatility of the group’s pre-established objectives.
here below is an analysis of the main risk areas broken down by “business-related
risks” and “financial risks”. for additional details on this specific topic reference should
be made to the 2014 annual report.




business-related risks

external factors: traffic flow and propensity to spend
the group activities depend on traffic flow. any factor that may significantly reduce
traffic flow in the countries and channels in which the group operates represents a risk
for the generation of value.
among the external factors, and as such uncontrollable, which can have an impact on
traffic flow and traveler propensity to spend are the general economic scenario and
its trend - in particular consumer confidence, inflation, unemployment levels and
interest rates - increases in the crude oil price and increases in transportation costs in
general.
traffic and average spending can also be affected by other uncontrollable events,
including, for instance, alternative travel options, changes in applicable laws and
regulations governing or influencing the performance of the group activities in the
specific operation channel (particularly relevant for airports), airline strategies and
policies, strikes, political uncertainty, terrorist attacks or threats, natural catastrophes,
pandemics, conflicts and wars.

                                    reputation
                                    reputation both in relation to customers, the landlords and licensors, representing the
                                    main stakeholders from this perspective, is particularly important for the group and
                                    represents one of the main assessment factors in the process of assignment and
the world of autogrill




                                    renewal of the concessions by landlords.
                                    events leading to a reduction or loss of reputation are in particular attributable to the
                                    reduction in the quality perceived of the service rendered - in the first case - resulting in
                                    reduced attractiveness and loss of customers and, in the second case, to the inability
                                    to fulfill contractual obligations with landlords and licensors, jeopardizing the possible
                                    renewal and continuity of the relationship.


                                    consumption habits
                                    changes in consumption habits represent a risk if the group does not promptly and
                                    adequately react to changing customer requests with actions targeting the service
                                    model and the offering.


                                    inexpensiveness of concession contracts
                                    group operations are mainly ensured through multi-year contracts for the assignment of
                                    commercial services, awarded through competitive tenders by the landlords of
                                    concessions for the management of the infrastructures (airports, highways, railway
                                    stations, etc.). concessions are a key asset for the group and their renewal at
                                    competitive conditions or the assignment of new concessions represents a strategic
                                    factor. in addition, the concession contracts stipulated by the group generally
                                    envisage, besides a multi-year duration, the obligation for the company to pay an
                                    annual minimum concession fee, regardless of the revenues generated as a result of
                                    the contract enforced. in the case in which the revenues generated by the concession
                                    are lower than the value budgeted upon its assignment, also as a result of reduced
                                    traffic or reduced spending, its profitability may be reduced or even become negative
                                    as a consequence of the obligation to pay the minimum fee.




                         risk management                    the objective is to manage risks
                                                            in a standardized way

service to consumers. the need to maintain levels of service consistent with customers’
and landlords’ expectations and the complexity of the overall international regulatory

framework limit flexibility in the management of the labor force.


regulatory framework
the group’s operating sectors are subject to strict regulations for the management of
operations and customer and employee safety, both with reference to the protection of
the individual and product quality.


innovation
the group’s ability to maintain a steady and ongoing process of innovation in its
operating model, concepts, products and processes represents a key factor in keeping
the level of service and the quality of the offering in line with customer expectations.
customer expectations are, in fact, of strategic importance to the group.


development of the emerging markets
the autogrill group operates in a number of emerging markets and future projections
include expansion also to other emerging markets, which, typically, present higher
risks than the areas in which the group has its main operations.




financial risks

autogrill manages financial risks through the definition of group guidelines to be
complied with by all of its business units in the framework of a self-financing logic.
the group’s finance and administration function ensures that the policies for the
management of the financial risks are standardized, provides indications about the
most appropriate financial instruments and monitors the results achieved.
in particular, the autogrill group excludes any use of speculative financial derivative
instruments. moreover, the group pursues the objective of maintaining adequate
financial flexibility through the availability of liquidity and committed credit lines that
enable it to cover re-financing requirements on a 12-18 month time span.

in 2014 revenues generated in europe were equal to € 1,804.1m, down 1.8% against €
1,835.4m in 2013. the growth recorded in some countries, achieved also because of the
new openings, failed to compensate for the reduction in sales registered in italy, where the
performance reflected the reduction in the consolidation perimeter.

revenues from sales in highways, the predominant channel in europe, posted a
reduction equal to 0.7% (-0.6% at current exchange rates). the positive contribution
deriving from the new openings in belgium and germany was entirely compensated
by the reduction in the number of stores managed in italy, following the termination of
some contracts during the contract renewal season that involved part of the network.

these concepts stand out clearly manifest in the materiality analysis. as matter of fact,
the issues relative to the people area are particularly relevant to the group.
during the process of identification of the specific sustainability issues that represent the
basis of the materiality analysis performed, the following items emerged:
• quality relationships with workers (including daily work, social welfare services
    and wages)
• hr development & assessment
• hygiene, health and safety in the workplace
• industrial relations
• diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion
• development and involvement of the community
• protection of human rights
• data security and customer privacy



                                           taking care of employees to provide value
                                           services is strategic for autogrill.


following the analyses described in the dedicated chapter - “materiality analysis”
(see page 8) - these issues were graphically represented based on their relevance to
autogrill activities (see graph below). this document includes disclosures about the
issues positioned in the top right quadrant (as envisaged by the gri g4 guidelines),
as they are considered material for the group and its stakeholders.
moreover, the chapter also includes other issues that are considered relevant
to autogrill (even if not strictly material), which could not be excluded from the
annual reporting.


the chapter starts with a section dedicated to listening and employee engagement. in
fact, autogrill believes that stakeholder engagement is a key factor and fundamental to
the basis of the sustainability concept and, consequently, an issue that precedes
materiality.


all issues regarding consumers are included in the a-product chapter, dedicated to the
customer centricity concept and to all activities developed by the group in order to
maximize the value of this vision.

in the modern social scenario, employee engagement is a key leverage for the positive
management of human resources in the long term. defining shared objectives that take
into account suggestions made by employees is crucial. as already anticipated,
stakeholder engagement represents a priority underlying the concept of sustainability
and, for this reason, the first chapter of people is dedicated to it.




                        “do you feel good?” and listening techniques
                        for the third consecutive year autogrill decided to administer the “do you feel good ?”
                        online survey at the european level with the objective of probing the level of employee
                        engagement. the questionnaire was structured in order to analyze the four areas
                        considered key to express employee level of engagement levels:
                         • satisfaction: level of satisfaction that an individual obtains from his/her work within
                             the organization;
                         • advocacy: willingness to act as a promoter for the organization, conveying a
                             positive image;
                         • pride: pride and sense of belonging to the organization;
                         • commitment: level of correspondence between the personal objectives of an
                             individual and the objectives of an organization, represented by the desire and the
                             motivation to remain in the company.




83% redemption level with 17,896 questionnaires filled out


the 2014 edition of the survey reached 83% redemption level with 17,896
questionnaires filled out, scoring 61% employee engagement in the f&b area
in europe.

                                                       taking the outcomes of the survey as a point of departure, all central offices and points

                                                       improving employee engagement starts from the understanding and sharing of the
                                                       outcomes and is then translated into the identification of the priorities and monitoring of

                                                       progress. the project is turning into a true management tool, used by the entire
                                                       organization in europe, and has already triggered a virtuous cycle based on ongoing
                                                       improvement.




           “do you feel good? is the survey addressed to the entire
           autogrill population in order to understand what employees
           think about a series of important issues, letting them voice                                do you feel good?
           their opinions, consistently with one of the five values that
           characterize the group: open mindedness and transparency”.

                                                       multiple initiatives were launched across europe to support the action planning phase
                                                       after analyzing outcomes. the strong focus on manager training and their ability to
                                                       listen and transform the needs identified in the surveys in actions to bring about results
                                                       targeting improved employee engagement has characterized the actions undertaken at
                                                       different levels across the organization in the last two years.
                                                       in italy, following the completion of the “do they feel good?” campaign, launched in
                                                       2013 to help the people leading groups of employees fully understand what
                                                       engagement means and what levers contribute to increasing it, in 2014 the “do i feel
                                                       good?” campaign was launched involving all teams that, assisted by an external
                                                       consultant, identified priorities and drafted specifically targeted action plans.

                                                       netherlands), with a view to empowering managers to work on the priorities related to
                                                       engagement as defined by top management, managers were given a toolbox
                                                       containing practical tools to support team activity management aimed at improving

                                                       conceived and implemented also based on the engagement priorities identified through
                                                       the survey. these include: the campaign on the new values; the internal communication

over the years, the analysis of the outcomes resulting from the engagement survey
and the performance of the annual customer satisfaction survey (see section
“feel good?” on page 78) has shown a positive correlation between customer
satisfaction and employee involvement in the stores. in italy, the correlation
between the engagement level and the performance level of store managers




                                                                                                     a-people
established a statistically significant link between their managerial skills and their
ability to involve employees in the workplace.
all this further enhanced the belief that people’s involvement should be a key
priority for the entire group.


the third edition of the “do you feel good?” people engagement survey was launched
in january 2015 - again online - involving 20,741 people in 16 countries, and was
translated in 11 languages.
the culture of listening is widespread in all the countries in which the group operates,
through the “open door” approach, based on direct dialogue across the different
hierarchical levels, both in the stores and in the central offices. in the majority of the
countries this concept also includes an email address that has been made available to
the entire population of the organization to report concerns, opinions and requests from
employees. other initiatives vary from country to country. for instance, hmshost
provides a toll-free number, available 24/7 for all employees in north america to air
any concern or problem, in addition to a web-based line for comments or questions to
be posted at any time. in italy, too, two email addresses are made available to all
employees; one is dedicated to social accountability 8000, receiving reports
regarding ethical concerns in the workplace, while the other is dedicated to the
communication of any eventual stressful situations.

in 2013 a new initiative was launched in relation to leaving personnel in order to
understand the main reasons for their leaving, trace them and use them for ongoing
improvement.

                                  communications at autogrill are developed on different tools, including aconnect (the
                                  group intranet), management roadshows on the sales network and the traditional

                                  aconnect enabled the conversion and integration of traditional services and systems to
                                  web-based solutions that profoundly changed the style and effectiveness of its internal
                                  communication as well as some business processes.


                                  the immediate availability of policies and continuously updated organization charts,
                                  organizational communications and news about the business make it a particularly
                                  effective working tool. furthermore, aconnect plays an important role in the process of
                                  integration of the company’s sectors of activity in different countries and working
                                  environments. its implementation has contributed to remarkably reducing the distance
                                  between colleagues operating in the countries in which the group operates, between
                                  functions, headquarters and the network, and enabling the sharing of best practices
                                  and the exchange of opinions and values.

                                  all european employees at the same time. in 2013 and 2014 the italian edition
                                  included the “we, week by week” column: every week this section features

in italy, the dedicated “welcome” area targets newly hired staff, including information
about the first steps to accomplish in the first days after joining the company.
autogrill spain is another important example in the matter of internal, direct and
effective communication: it has appointed an ambassador of internal communication
in every one of its stores. over eighty collaborators operate in stores scattered

they are making a precious contribution, ensuring that information and instructions
circulated from the central offices are properly received. they stimulate the participation
of all the collaborators, provide added opportunities for professional development and,
last but not least, ensure effective two-way communication, thus facilitating the dialogue
between the stores and headquarters.
also in spain, in 2014, a radio project was launched where prominent spanish
journalists explain autogrill’s new initiatives, contests, awards and projects, and also
interview autogrill employees.
in the united states, hmshost has set up an intranet network that employees can
access to make comments or report problems. hmshost intranet also features a
dedicated, always accessible page where employees can post ads or news about the
company. moreover, many central departments have developed newsletters regarding
their activities. these are sent by email to all employees and are also
posted online.


in north west europe (including france, belgium and the netherlands) amagazine is
distributed to all employees three times a year. this is an in-house magazine consisting
of articles by senior management on the company vision and strategy, best practices
relative to store activities and employee stories celebrating the group values.
lastly, as another integral part of the action plan resulting from the analysis of the
outcomes derived from the “do you feel good” 2012 survey, a project was launched
for the updating and communication of autogrill’s mission, vision and values, to
re-focus on the group identity, especially in this moment of radical change. in 2014 the
communication campaign of the new autogrill values was completed. launched
through a video message by the ceo, the new values were read and “interpreted” by
the employees through participation in a series of social activities: forwarding and
sharing of comments on the values posted on the company portal and participation in
photography contests.

                 a clear and well-structured social responsibility policy focused on the relations that an
                 organization develops with its collaborators can result in benefits to its competitive

                 and distinguish the organization.
                 any worker faced with a customer represents the company itself, the company’s
                 business philosophy, its know-how and its attitude towards the environment. this is why
                 the relationship between autogrill group and its employees is a strategic element and
                 a fundamental variable for creating and sharing value. issues like work schedule
                 planning, work/life balance, salaries, social benefits and services represent the ground
                 upon which autogrill is focusing to build up an increasingly solid relationship with its
                 employees.
                 the autogrill group operates in a market that requires great flexibility. successfully
                 managing daily, weekly and seasonal peaks while always remaining strongly focused
                 on customer care requires complex planning skills.
                 the key idea is that of translating the need for continuous flexibility into an opportunity
                 to balance private life and professional needs through the provision of part-time
                 contracts, work schedule planning and post-maternity programs. a breakdown of
                 workers by age brackets is also important, because it makes it possible to integrate the
                 type of job and the level of engagement requested with the different needs of the
                 various generations.


                 to facilitate a long term work/life balance the group is committed to developing
                 various initiatives of welfare and work/life balance. attention to employees and their
                 wellbeing is not limited to their working hours, but instead takes into consideration all
                 those elements that contribute to improving the quality of people’s lives and has led the
                 group to work on different themes and initiatives that involve people both as
                 employees (recruitment processes, development plans, training) and as individuals
                 (wellbeing and health, family, social commitment and environmental protection).
                 in the united states, hmshost administrative personnel may work on a home office
                 basis, depending on specific needs and projects.

employees in italy are given the opportunity to rely – in accordance with the trade
unions – on a formula that allows for part time work until their child is 36 months old. in
2007, special agreements were stipulated with child care facilities located in proximity
of the offices or along the main access routes. the agreement envisages the payment
of approximately 50% of the monthly fee by the company.




                                                                                                    a-people
also, in other european countries efforts were made to introduce flexible working hours,
making it easier for new mothers to return to work.


many other services are offered to employees and their family members in other group
companies:
• in the united states, the headquarters feature a fitness center with showers for
    employees who wish to exercise or who come to work by bike.
• in italy, several initiatives were implemented during 2014, focusing particularly on
    the family. an sos family support service was launched to provide assistance to
    couples facing marital difficulties, or having problems with their children or the
    elderly, as well as school orientation sessions to help parents and their children
    choose a high school or university, and meetings on parenthood and adolescence.


in 2014 the shopping bag project was launched to provide support to low income
families. all employees, with the exception of managers, received an autogrill branded
and reusable shopping bag, containing various types of food and personal care
products for a total commercial value of euro 80. all suggestions made by employees
for future developments of initiatives of this kind were collected anonymously through
questionnaires made available in the company intranet.



                                       the group supports flexibility offering services
                                       for employees and their family members.


these initiatives add up to a series of support actions already started in previous years,
including: assistance in compiling tax returns (and filing with the competent authority),
car insurance facilitations, special agreements with spas and other fitness centers, the
possibility of receiving seasonal anti-flu vaccinations free of charge through the national
health service, partnerships with other companies for the purchase of products and
services at discounted prices, online temporary shops with direct delivery to the
workplace offered at substantially reduced prices and much more.


in addition, the “good for me” project is still in effect at the italian headquarters.
launched at the beginning of 2011 to promote healthier lifestyles, the project envisages
the preparation of balanced menus within the headquarters’ ciao restaurant, the
organization of meetings with experts and online columns and advisory services
provided by a nutritionist directly in the workplace at a reduced price.

                                               specialist advice. the project also includes initiatives promoting physical exercise,
                                               including a corporate bike sharing service (with an indication of the bike paths closest

           (g4-la2)   salaries and benefits
                      the group’s compensation policy is based on incentive systems that are designed to reward employee
                      commitment and merit, while promoting a sense of belonging and attracting outside talent. for the
                      purpose of ensuring alignment among group companies, the group has established international
                      guidelines on different aspects concerning wages and compensation in full compliance with the
                      currently applicable laws and local regulations. one of the pillars of the system is the “weighing” of
                      positions: a group cross-sectional evaluation (an evaluation on a common scale of the impact of any
                      role on the organization), which is constantly aligned to labor market benchmarks in correlation with
                      the positions covered. to ensure cost optimization in the management of these activities and the use of
                      common standard benchmarks, the group promotes centralized supplier services/analyses and the
                      central management of initiatives that are proposed to the companies, assuming the role of central co-
                      ordination and data collection (i.e. pulse surveys that enable the group to rely on specific
                      compensation benchmarks broken down by country, limiting the efforts on the side of the various group
                      companies). also, with regard to benefits the group is committed to guaranteeing transparency and
                      clarity to its employees. the mechanism for the acknowledgement of benefits does not particularly
                      differ from standard labor contract formulas (fixed term contracts vs. permanent labor contracts and part
                      time vs. full time), but varies according to the different geographical areas as a function of the relevant
                      applicable laws that comprise or exclude specific situations and/or welfare and insurance coverage
                      (health care, accident coverage, maternity or paternity leave, disability) and to local labor market
                      practices. corporate supplementary pension funds and insurance certainly constitute a self-explanatory
                      example. in some countries the law promotes their use, providing tax benefits in return. a clear example
                      is that of hmshost, which published its salary scheme on the company’s intranet, thus enabling
                      people to understand the logic behind the construction of their packages. for the purpose of
                      underscoring the importance attributed to transparency, in the united states autogrill group launched
                      a communication campaign in spanish to enable first language spanish workers to perfectly
                      understand their situation and the advantages offered.
                      in 2014, the same automated tool used to assess performance and competencies and also to manage
                      mbos was extended to the majority of the european headquarters, enabling an increasing number of
                      employees to manage online the various steps along with the possibility of validating the electronic
                      signature. the same tool is also used as a repository for the documents linked to employee incentive
                      plans, thus facilitating their filing to the benefit of the entire population of the organization and reducing
                      the carbon footprint. the actions implemented and described above have enabled the group to
                      achieve higher levels of transparency and keep and trace employee comments.

management processes in the last two years also led to the development and integration
of regional and international teams dedicated to increasing the value of the group by
leveraging on the know-how and competencies of each individual country.
the development of autogrill human resources undoubtedly begins with personnel
recruitment and employer branding activities. in 2014, along with the definition and the
internal communication of the new values, a new employer branding campaign was
launched, shared by all european countries and aimed at positioning autogrill as
“employer of choice” in the job market, with the objective of attracting people who
share the group’s core values (“let’s share our values”).

the design and development of effective personnel recruitment systems represents an
important investment by the group, a key asset for the company and its growth: this is a
process that must be based on transparency and equity, in full compliance with equal
opportunities and individual career growth. autogrill is also committed to the ongoing
improvement of selection criteria aimed at identifying not only the required skills and
competencies for the short term, but also the potential necessary to cover other positions
in the long term, growing within and together with the group.
this is also why the selection process is often complex and broken down into different
steps. aptitude tests (administered by qualified personnel), english tests and targeted
interviews are used to identify the candidate’s adherence to the autogrill competence
model. since 2014 the hq position selection model has been adopted by all european
headquarters, thus increasing the synergies and the collaboration among different
countries that can now rely on shared recruitment criteria.
in all the countries in which the group operates and especially for network positions, the
selection process favors the hiring of personnel from areas adjacent to the location
where the activities are carried out. moreover, given the importance and the need for
knowledge and integration within the territory, the management is local as well.
the improvement of the human capital is achieved also through job rotation and job
posting processes within the group companies, at the international level between
different countries, and also for vacant office-based and network positions. to autogrill,
internal mobility represents an important tool for disseminating best practices at the
group level and developing the professionalism of the best talents, increasing the
knowledge and skills of its employees.




                                                                     2014 sustainability report

           traditionally, the sales network represents the key expansion area for the autogrill
           group, always looking for new personnel according to the business seasonality.
           recruitment mainly occurs through the “work with us” section posted on the local
           websites and other career growth tracks (linkedin, facebook, twitter, youtube).
a-people




           in all the countries in which the group operates, relations and partnerships have
           been established with culinary schools and institutes, as well as universities, for the
           development of new ideas, work projects and innovations. in italy a few examples
           are: bocconi university, the polytechnic of milan and the university of gastronomic
           sciences, in pollenzo. in the united states all the stores collaborate with local
           colleges and universities for possible hiring options. moreover, in 2014 hmshost
           confirmed the collaboration with the culinary institute of america to increase the
           company’s culinary expertise.

           autogrill believes that establishing a direct bridge between the company and the
           universities represents a key tool for recruiting, while concurrently providing students with
           a professional orientation that enables them to develop the most suitable competencies
           to efficiently enter the world of work. in this respect, in partnership with bocconi
           university, autogrill experts conduct periodic aptitude tests and orientation interviews
           with students in order to support them in understanding their points of strength and
           improvement areas and, thus, becoming aware of the professional activities most in line
           with their personal skills.
           in order to enhance the group’s dimension and capitalize on its know-how, best
           practices and the competencies available at the international level, in 2013 operating
           mechanisms were implemented, aimed at consolidating the european organizational
           model pursued in the last years:


           1) hr policy standardization. common grading systems, position weighting schemes
           and incentive systems (particularly for the group’s executives) were defined. the
           transparency of the compensation processes was increased thanks to the
           standardization of the levels and job titles within the company. a greater transparency
           on hr policies and procedures was a need identified and resulting from the 2014 “do
           you feel good?” 2014 survey. the integrated organizational structure generated a need
           for standardizing policies across countries.


           2) employee potential evaluation and talent development. in this case as well, a
           standard, certified management process was developed, based on standard metrics
           shared at the group level (and managed locally). for example, assisting employees
           when they assume broader managerial responsibilities, or in the planning of specific
           career paths.


           3) establishment of international teams and structures. the development of international
           teams and structures was further pursued in 2013 (with the involvement of high potential
           collaborators), generating relocation options with a variable duration through transfers to
           other group companies. the establishment of shared functions at the international level
           provided an additional employment opportunity within the group. the elimination of
           barriers between different functions and organizations facilitates the sharing of
           knowledge and ongoing training.

ghrp: a common platform to manage employee
personal data
in order to identify the key areas for improvement and the most suitable actions to undertake in
relation to people and for the development of the organization, it is necessary to rely on




                                                                                                            a-people
personal and organizational details that can be easily accessed and analyzed. in 2009,
autogrill group started the global hr platform project (ghrp), a platform that, fed by the local
employee personal data management systems, enables the corporate human resources
functions belonging to the group hr & organization department to rely on key information
necessary to efficiently control human resources management processes. thanks to the definition
of shared semantics, the global hr platform enables hr functions to promptly obtain
standardized and comparable information about the group’s people (i.e. gender, age, type of
contract, level, seniority level, education, etc.) with different levels of information accessibility. at
31 december 2014, ghrp collects the data of all group companies belonging to the f&b
europe region, with the exception of greece, the czech republic, poland and slovenia.




the ghrp system allows us to:
• rely on a common master database, to be used to develop systems that support processes
    such as online training, internal job posting, people development, personal profile, etc.;
• enable access control and profiling on the aconnect portal, communication management
    aimed at specific targets, text messaging services and knowledge management/exchange in
    addition to integration process services like, for instance, people & location directory, which
    permits the sharing of contacts (email addresses, telephone numbers, operating locations,...)
    of the colleagues registered on ghrp and the automation of the corporate processes
    through the introduction of a work flow logic (i.e. employee data management for expense
    reimbursement processes and reservation and approval of travel indemnities); recover and
    register qualitative information regarding people (i.e. skills not registered by traditional
    systems, like languages spoken), also in a self-service format;
• reduce manual processing activities and facilitate prompt generation and updating of
    documents regarding the organization.

                                in the framework of employee development, autogrill group puts great emphasis on
                                employee upgrading, considering it an investment that generates a twofold value, for
                                the people and for the organization. in 2014, autogrill group launched academy, an
                                international training project focusing on the development of employee competencies
                                through the provision of ad hoc training courses based on the employee level of

                                sharing of best practices. the courses - held in english – are attended by employees
                                from different european countries. one of the objectives of this project is to increase
                                integration between employees through the organization of meeting opportunities that
                                contribute to developing a common language and culture.

                                development projects, focused on specific needs of the organization with the ultimate
                                objective of creating concrete and positive impacts on the business.
                                moreover, with a view to eliminating language barriers and facilitating communication
                                inside and outside the organization, in 2014 141 employees in italy, france, belgium,
                                germany and spain took advantage of the online platform made available by autogrill

                                on gender equality issues. this project involved 13 internal mentors and 18 mentees
                                working together in order to eliminate barriers associated with gender issues by
                                introducing new approaches and competencies in the organization.
                                similarly, in the united states a project was launched to support the personal and
                                professional growth of hmshost women, providing them with networking
                                opportunities, increasing their visibility in the workplace and the development of
                                leadership skills (women’s leadership network - wln). wln was developed as a
                                result of a need and determination to support diversity in leadership roles at all business
                                levels, contributing to the success of the company and the industry.
                                lastly, in the last months of 2014 sync was launched, a project involving all the key
                                people of the new european organization, with the objective of facilitating cooperation
                                between individuals within the organization, so that the organizational mechanisms
                                become increasingly successful and effective.

academy operations was developed in 2014 for network workers. this is a training
program combining managerial skills and on-the-job experience. various specific paths
were developed for the different roles available in the store, adding up to the offering
of online and in-class courses. in 2014 academy operations covered italy and spain
and in 2015 they will be extended to france, belgium and the netherlands.




                                                                                                    a-people
technological supports also play an important role in training. the moodle web-based
platform, accessible from aconnect in the company’s intranet, is used to disseminate
training in europe, while a different web-based platform is used for training in the
united states. online training tools also monitor course attendance and the
development of statistics and analyses with a view to improving training courses on an
ongoing basis.
in italy, the installation of “kiosks”, made available to all employees (56 pc-based
ergonomic consoles, including keyboard and intranet connection), located in selected
stores of the sales network, facilitated the provision of online training. similarly, in spain
laptop computers were also distributed to stores in 2014 in order to provide employee
with free access to learning and communication tools.
also in spain in 2014 an app was launched with the objective of training people on
the company core values, products and services, thus more effectively circulating
knowledge through games and challenges among colleagues with a series of closed
questions. all headquarters employees and store managers were involved in the first
campaign. lastly, in spain the sales force can attend free training courses designed to
improve their skills and knowledge in the area of customer service.

in spain, in addition to heads of service trained as training facilitators, a team of tutors
was established to disseminate campaigns relating to food products, coffee and beer,
consisting of individuals who received training from the hr department. these tutors
-contribute to delivering training to all network employees. in specific months, the heads
of service leave their stores to go and train colleagues in other stores.
some years ago hmshost launched “people first” in a number of locations. this is a
training course that aims at developing a new culture entirely focused on people, to the
benefit of both employees and customers. “people first” involves store managers in
training and development initiatives pertaining to teamwork and the development of
managerial and leadership skills, without neglecting to put great emphasis on the
importance of feedback as a key tool in fostering employee development and motivation.

                            “manager in training” is one of the support tools of the people first program,
                            dedicated to new managers who participate when hired on or promoted.
                            the objective is to provide them with information from different areas, including hr
                            management, it, safety, cash management and food security, and to develop a team
                            of heads of operations who are always ready in case of new openings.

                            moreover, in the united states, surveys were carried out in order to process succession
                            plans. these led to the identification of different training needs for men and women.
                            the women’s leadership network (a project developed to support women’s
                            professional growth within hmshost) took into account these requirements and
                            oriented the training proposal accordingly.
                            every year, as usual, hmshost launched a reprise of a training course to raise employee
                            awareness concerning the contents of the code of ethics, to enable them to make
                            appropriate decisions and report potential violations of the company policies or the law.
                            in italy, in 2014 a training course was organized for the entire population of the
                            headquarters and the stores, focusing on the provisions contained in italian legislative
                            decree 231/2011.


           “manager in training” is one of the support tools of the people
           first program, dedicated to new managers who participate
           when hired on or promoted.

                            more in general, the evaluation process for competencies and performance was
                            divided and optimized as a function of two different objectives: the first objective, the
                            evaluation of competencies, targets individual training and development, while the
                            second objective focuses on performance, as a specifically designed tool orienting the
                            individual’s professional performance.
                            the same automated on-line tool used to assess employee competencies and
                            performance was extended to several countries (united states, italy, france, spain,
                            belgium, the netherlands, germany, austria and the corporate offices), managing the
                            evaluation of employee competencies and performance both for the headquarters and
                            the sales network (up to heads of service). this results in complete transparency and
                            ongoing accessibility also in terms of activity updating. for the first time in 2014 all
                            assessment processes were simultaneously started across all european countries,
                            marking a step forward in hr management, especially for an increasingly integrated
                            organization like the one currently characterizing the european headquarters. self-
                            assessment tools were added to the standard top-down assessment processes with the
                            objective of raising employee awareness about one’s own professional growth.
                            the sharing of processes, schedules and the web-based platform enabled the
                            company to target greater efficiencies and an increasing focus during the appraisal,
                            using it as an opportunity for personal growth and a bilateral exchange of opinions
                            between workers and managers. moreover, the online management of processes and
                            the possibility of validating appraisals through electronic signature reduced paper
                            consumption considerably.
                            performance assessment in the stores is more closely and easily correlated to sales
                            trends, and for this reason, autogrill is committed to motivating workers through the
                            implementation of different initiatives.

diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion
autogrill leadership is the result of a significant process of internationalization and
expansion, which has resulted in the sustained growth of its human capital, across a
progressively wider range of nationalities, cultures, skills and competencies. for this




                                                                                                    a-people
reason the themes related to innovation and social-cultural change are an integral part
of autogrill. the cultural diversity of our collaborators is an asset and an important
growth lever, reflecting also on customers, products, services and consumption models.
for this reason the activities relating to the acceptance, introduction and integration of
newly-hired people are a key focus in the group’s commitment to orientation.
autogrill is inspired by the highest international standards (international labor
organization), implementing the principles established in its corporate governance in
all circumstances, and the group is committed to eliminating any obstacles to equal
opportunity and proactively promotes numerous activities designed to encourage and
enhance diversity. in the majority of the countries in which it operates, the group has
established hotlines and email addresses for employees to signal any occurrence of
discriminatory behavior.


the challenge of cultural diversity lies in the promotion of an attitude that respects
differences and guarantees equal opportunity:
• in spain, autogrill has drawn up a “plan de igualdad” [equality plan], a policy
    promoting equal opportunity for all collaborators in addition, the group has also
    implemented a set of targeted activities, including the exemption of muslim workers
    from the performance of their duties during the ramadan period, and foreign
    workers are given the possibility of taking a one month vacation, without
    interruptions, to enable them to visit their country of origin;
• in belgium, workers are given the possibility of taking a one month furlough from
    work (without salary) in addition to the holiday month, in order to spend more time
    with their families. also in belgium, flemish courses are held during working hours:
    the teacher works together with the employee and meanwhile helps him/her to
    learn the language on the job;
• in the united states, training courses in english were organized in several locations
    to improve the language skills of foreign employees. in addition, materials for basic
    training are available in english and spanish, as well as ad hoc kits to illustrate
    health and pension plans and systems and federal and state laws.


hmshost also participates in the “work and travel” program, sponsored by the us
state department, in which foreign university students spend approximately 90 days
working at a group restaurant. in this way, hmshost can rely on excellent service for
its customers, provided by students, and students and us collaborators have the
possibility of enjoying an experience of cultural exchange, targeting improvement and
mutual understanding;
- for all employees of the european headquarters autogrill academy offers training
courses designed to raise employee awareness and develop cross-cultural
competencies.

                                    diversity, autogrill joined valore d a few years ago. this is the first italian association of
                                    large enterprises established to support female leadership in organizations.
                                    valore d promotes an innovative company organization that overcomes all implicit
                                    biases associated with gender and favors conciliation by providing female managers

                                    with the tools and knowledge useful for their professional growth. the association
                                    proposes a new cultural model that envisages women’s full participation in the economic
                                    and social life of the country in which they live. the membership provided a group of
                                    women at autogrill headquarters with the opportunity to participate in meetings and
                                    workshops focusing on these topics, leveraging on diversity to approach the business as
                                    an added value for the organization. ad hoc growth paths were developed by autogrill
                                    to concretely deal with gender balance issues (see section on page 57).




           valore d is the first italian association of large enterprises
           established to support female leadership in organizations.


                                    autogrill has promoted concrete actions in relation to the differently able, including the
                                    elimination of physical barriers in the stores, ad hoc store design to make their stay
                                    more comfortable and particular attention to differently able employees.
                                    regulations in the matter of disability and labor differ from country to country and the
                                    group companies are committed to scrupulously complying with the pertinent laws.
                                    in spain, 13 individuals were hired on a permanent employment contract in 2013 in
                                    collaboration with “fundación incorpora” and atam (ngos assisting companies in
                                    the process of recruitment of the differently able). in specific cases (collaborators with
                                    down’s syndrome) a special training course was promoted in collaboration with the
                                    madrid regional institute for health and safety.
                                    in accordance with trade unions and in compliance with the legislation in force,
                                    autogrill employs differently able individuals, or stipulates collaboration contracts with
                                    outside companies, employing them for service activities in line with its needs.
                                    in italy, 398 differently able people and individuals belonging to the so-called
                                    “protected” categories are currently employed by the organization.
                                    hmshost, too, has drawn up guidelines for the hiring, training, integration and
                                    management of individuals with various forms of disability, according to the regulations
                                    issued by the equal employment opportunity commission and in line with the
                                    requirements set out in the american disabilities act of 1990. many locations in the
                                    united states directly collaborate with local organizations to employ differently able
                                    individuals. in these cases, both parties periodically carry out accurate appraisals to
                                    ensure that employees are given a position that guarantees their health and safety on
                                    the one hand, and the productivity of the post for the organization on the other.

autogrill group’s ongoing commitment to ensuring the health and safety of all its
employees is based on prevention, technology, training and daily monitoring.
for this reason the group has established specific health and safety committees in all




                                                                                                                                                          a-people
the countries in which it operates (based on the relevant policies), composed of worker
representatives, management and trade unions, to periodically monitor compliance with
the applicable laws. the committees carry out training activities, analyze any issues
identified in relation to health and safety and develop the most suitable solutions to
eliminate or, when it is not possible, mitigate risks regarding the occurrence of
accidents.


the group applies the highest safety standards, in the first place through the
implementation of organizational and managerial measures (ongoing updates of
policies and procedures in the matter), but also through technical actions, use of state-
of-the-art technology, individual protective devices and training. in order to ensure that
the actions currently in force continue to be effective, a monitoring system was
launched to measure volumes and types of accidents, to be used by the key countries
in which the group operates. in this way, it will be possible to share competences
and initiatives in the matter of health and safety in the workplace. thanks to its
unwavering focus on ongoing improvement in the matter of health and safety in the
workplace, the group has posted a remarkable reduction in the number of injuries in
the last three years.

                         at the end of 2011 autogrill first launched an internal challenge in terms of sustainability
                         objectives to be reached within 2015, based on a 2012 baseline. in relation to the
                         people area, the objective focuses on health and safety. in 2014 autogrill targeted a
                         reduction in the number of injuries equal to 3% compared to the previous year.

                         note: the perimeter of reference was identified based on the robustness of the currently implemented analysis
                         system, which enables an effective flow of data useful for monitoring the objectives included in the roadmap

                                     number of injuries. this, in fact, contributes to providing a preventive overview of events
                                     (like, for instance, information relative to structures, training, etc.).



              the health & safety committee meets three times a year
              to periodically monitor accident trends, health surveillance

                                     the same issues are dealt with in meetings with the supervisory body. the report
                                     required by italian legislative decree no. 81/08 on safety in the workplace is
                                     periodically submitted to the attention of the board of directors, in line with the autogrill

                                     analyses and monitoring activities, corrective actions are developed to mitigate the risks

in the last few years envisaging the re-definition of responsibilities held by managers,
with a checklist including all activities to be performed in order to ensure a correct store
management (particularly in relation to health and safety in the workplace, fire
prevention policies and procedures and contract management). the documentation is
made available to the entire population of the organization on aconnect intranet.




                                                                                                   a-people
in the united states, the policy on health, safety and risk management provides all
employees with all the necessary principles to comply with for their safety at work and
identifies the procedures to be followed to detect, prevent and manage any accident
occurred to employees, consumers and clients. safety teams are specifically
established at the store level, comprising members of management and the operating
staff. their task is to map, through specifically designed audits, the most frequent causes
of accidents, and subsequently suggest the adoption of equipment and individual
protective devices, update the existing procedures and develop ad hoc training
programs. posters dedicated to issues related to health and safety are sent to all stores
on a monthly basis. these refer, for instance, to cleaning procedures, the correct use of
safety devices, chemical products, how to deal with emergencies, etc... in addition, a
24/7 medical assistance service is available to employees to provide first aid in case
of an injury. the primary objective of this program is to help people manage situations
regarding health in the workplace. in 2014 the training on health and safety in the
workplace in the united states was updated and in 2015 a new training project is
expected to be launched.



                      ergos was developed to identify accidents, analyze them
                      and reduce their number and it is based on a listening
                      approach towards employees.


frequently, autogrill group safety policies rely on significant collaborations. autogrill
france has been collaborating with caisse nationale d’assurance maladie des
travailleurs salariés (cnam–ts) for years in the ergos project. ergos was developed
to better identify accidents, analyze them and reduce their number. it is based on a
listening approach towards employees and is supported by a network of ergos
managers available in each store, organizing advisory sessions with collaborators. this
is an innovative approach that includes the participation of each individual
collaborator, which lies at the core of professional risk valuation in the workplace and
the involvement of operations and support services for the implementation of concrete
preventive actions.
autogrill spain also collaborates frequently with a number of universities on projects
regarding health and safety in the workplace.

                                           over the years, the group has established a productive dialogue with the trade unions
                                           in every country in which it operates, in order to promote the identification of solutions

                                           group guarantees each worker a transparent labor contract as well as the protection
                                           of employee rights, regardless of the specific labor contract for each business sector
                                           and/or country of reference.
                                           such transparency in the relationship results in the availability of several types of
                                           contracts: national and/or sector-specific labor contracts, collective and/or corporate
                                           labor contracts and individually negotiated labor contracts. in italy, due to the
                                           economic crisis that has gripped the mobility sector and the concurrent reduction in
                                           consumer spending, a rationalization and/or re-organization procedure was launched
                                           with the trade unions, targeting store efficiency and envisaging a review and
                                           identification of the solutions that could be introduced in a new round of collective
                                           bargaining.


                                           policies and regulations specific to each individual country are implemented to support
                                           a clear working relationship. some significant examples include canada, with the
                                           provincial employment standards act, defined by the canadian government; great
                                           britain, where the works council protects the rights of those employees not covered by
                                           a collective labor contract, and the united states, through the establishment of the
                                           arbitration committee. in some asian countries, the absence of laws or trade unions
                                           responsible for the protection of workers’ rights means that local management must fill
                                           the void by managing their personnel according to policies and guidelines designed
                                           and implemented by the parent company.

                                           throughout europe, autogrill group has developed clear working criteria through the
                                           european corporate committee (ecc), an information and consultation tool used by
                                           the company and employee representatives to evaluate the company’s performance
                                           and perspectives. information and consultation represent the ecc pillars and they have
                                           been progressively supplemented and enriched. the autogrill approach to human
                                           capital is increasingly oriented towards a model based on periodic training meetings,
                                           which ensure recurring contact, facilitated through the implementation of web
                                           collaboration tools, dissemination and sharing of the group’s organizational model,
                                           key projects currently in progress and an increasing propensity towards direct contact

a new portal was launched in 2010: a–ewc, autogrill european works council,
which is the result of one of the first collaboration areas activated in autogrill intranet,
where autogrill representatives and european employee delegates share operating
documentation, project progress reports and meeting schedules. this tool makes
available a steady and reliable flow of information about group events, with prompt




                                                                                                    a-people
updating, while concurrently providing a forum for contributions outside the officially
scheduled meetings. in 2013 the training session dedicated to information and
consulting continued within the “empowering the new ewc autogrill” project, which
also obtained financing from the european union in the context of social dialogue
projects.


moreover, it should be noted that based on the agreements reached at the group
level, should any significant organizational change occur that necessitates employee
transfer, employees will be informed at least four weeks in advance.


activities in progress were continued with the objective of sharing local best practices
in europe in relation to the issues that the ewc designated as priorities - health and
safety, work/life balance, intra and intercompany mobility, quality and ergonomics in
the workplace. representatives of all autogrill employees in europe participate in this
body as a result of an agreement that specifically establishes that “corporate social
responsibility programs” represent an institutional pillar for information and consulting.


with regard to the management of labor relations, a limited number of employee
legal suits have been filed in the main countries in which the group operates: in 2014
autogrill italia (about 10,000 collaborators) was involved in 134 litigations. these
lawsuits were mostly in reference to dismissals for just cause or the denial of extensions
for fixed term contracts whose term had expired.

                        community development and involvement
                        autogrill views sustainability as a responsible stance towards the business, strictly
                        considering the impact that its activities have on its stakeholders.
                        due to the characteristics of the autogrill activities and the situations in which the group
a-people




                        operates (travel channels, based on concession contracts for the majority of the stores),
                        its relationship with local communities is rather limited. nevertheless, autogrill is focused
                        on maintaining dialogue with and commitment towards the local communities with
                        which it interacts through the development of projects of common interest. the objective
                        is to contribute to improving quality of life and protecting the environment.
                        despite the unfavorable macroeconomic scenario, autogrill group continued its support
                        of non-profit associations operating at the local, national and international level through
                        cash donations by group companies (direct contributions), funds raised thanks to
                        consumer, employee and partner awareness campaigns (indirect contributions) and
                        donations of food products and/or material goods used in the normal management of
                        stores, thus providing concrete and immediate assistance to numerous associations
                        (contribution in kind and services). in this way, a value-creating cycle and relationship
                        is established between the company and its workers, partners and consumers.




           autogrill group continued its support of non-profit
           associations through donations and funds raised.


                        in order to understand the relationship with the local community from the standpoint of
                        business sustainability, in the last years autogrill has made a contribution to the
                        development of projects related to the food & beverage segment. this means through
                        the donation of food and meals to associations that are directly in contact with the
                        needy or to organizations that act as mediators between restaurants and food service
                        companies and non-profit organizations operating in the social assistance sector.
                        in 2014, donations in kind involved various local and national food banks, particularly
                        in italy and the united states. autogrill italia renewed its commitment to the needy
                        through the donation of food products, mainly donated to associations like
                        fondazione banco alimentare and other groups that are very active and present at
                        the national level.


                        in the united states, hmshost collaborates with food donation connection,
                        developing programs for the donation of food products from the stores located at
                        airports and on highways. food donation connection is a private us company that
                        acts as a bridge between restaurants and food service companies willing to donate
                        excess food and local associations operating in the social assistance sector, which
                        distribute the food to the needy. over 130 locations, including airports, and numerous
                        stores located on the highways and in malls, participate in the program.

in 2014 the “do you feel good?” project (see page 49) supported wwf by
donating one euro to the association’s oasis network projects for each autogrill
questionnaire filled out by workers.

on the occasion of christmas 2014, in line with the previous years, in collaboration
with the coca-cola company and caffarel, the “perfect menu” xmas edition was
proposed to consumers in over 400 acafè and snack bars of the autogrill network
in italy. the menu included a sandwich and a coca-cola company branded
beverage and a dessert, or, alternatively, a fruit salad, at a fixed price and a
portion of the revenues from this project was donated to the italian red cross to
support the homeless.

autogrill is inspired by the highest international standards (international labor
organization), implementing the principles established in its corporate governance in
relation to the management of human resources. in all the geographical areas in which
it operates, the group shuns the use of child or forced labor, pursuant to the main
international legislation, such as the un convention on children’s rights (uncrc) and
the human rights act of 1998. the group complies with the laws and regulations
applicable in each country in which it operates and specifically, in developing
countries considered at risk, the holding company’s policies are applied to prevent risks
associated with the use of child or forced labor. in the majority of the countries in
which it operates, the group has established hotlines and email addresses for
employees to signal any occurrence of discriminatory behavior.




data security and customer privacy
autogrill pays close attention to issues regarding the security and privacy of employee
and consumer data (management of loyalty cards).

continuously renewing its offering and services with a view to providing the best quality
experience to travelers stopping at an autogrill store. to do so, the starting point must
be “customer centricity”, meaning that consumers are at the heart of business-oriented
decision making.


the following themes were identified during the materiality analysis (see page 8) and,
in particular:


• product quality and safety (including correct and balanced diet and ingredient
    characteristics)
• service accessibility and quality
• product information and communication
• responsible selling



                                 catering activities and all the services revolving

the materiality chart below was developed based on the analyses described in the
dedicated chapter – “materiality analysis” (see page 8), including the various issues
according to their (internal and external) materiality vis-à-vis autogrill activities.
obviously, the issues regarding products and the offering proved particularly relevant,
considering the group’s core business, especially the ones involving product quality
and food safety.
consequently, this chapter illustrates information relative to the issues of the top right
quadrant (as requested by the gri g4 guidelines), as they are material for the group
and its stakeholders.


the chapter includes also some other topics relevant to autogrill (even if not strictly
material), which the group thought it opportune to include in sustainability report.


the chapter opens with a section dedicated to listening and engagement with group
consumers and collaboration with its business partners, because, as already
anticipated in other chapters, autogrill believes that stakeholder engagement is at the
basis of the concept of sustainability and, hence, comes before materiality.

the new geographic scenarios and recent developments in the global economy have
had an impact on traffic and destination flows. only by getting to know these new
travelers and the reasons why they travel will the group be in a position to design
appropriate offers. the typical travel channels – airports, highways, railway stations –
are actually privileged observatories; they reveal who today’s travelers are and their
experiences as consumers, as actors in the same complex and dynamic scenario as
the group.
in this context, autogrill is in the best position to understand travelers’ needs, interpreting
the speed and complexity of the changes that occur every day and translating them
into innovative products and services. airports in particular represent the places where
autogrill group experiments and develops top notch solutions and services.



                 in food consumption habits are increasing the demand
                 for healthier food and interest in local products, sustainable
                 and not excessively processed.


product and concept design is always triggered by traveler expectations. the outcomes
of the analyses carried out reveal a profile of a traveler who is aware of his/her role,
wants to play a leading role, is demanding, makes informed purchases, looks for high
quality and expects customized products. in recent years, an increasing number of
people follow specific diets as a result of intolerances or allergies to specific food
products (coeliacs) or prefer not to eat meat (vegetarians and vegans) or, also, observe
dietary restrictions based on their culture and religion.
other important factors to consider in consumer food habits refer to the increased
demand for healthier food, interest in local products (with controlled and/or certified
origin) and sustainable, not excessively processed products. curiosity about ethnic
recipes with foreign influences has also increased (including asian food or latin-
american food in europe and european specialties in the americas, with a preference
for ingredients considered healthy and symbolic of the mediterranean diet), especially
in the travel channels, where cross-cultural influences, already strong in modern
societies, tend to be amplified further.

                             a policy that targets listening, involving not only all employees (see page 49), but also
                             the stakeholders, implies the participation of the different subjects involved in the
                             group’s activities, facilitated through the development of effective communication
                             channels and the maintenance of a constructive relationship over time.

                             research, the group periodically analyzes the emerging changes, innovating,
                             increasing and re-inventing its concepts in order to continue to improve its offering. for
                             this reason, at the corporate and country level the group collects and analyzes
                             information about consumers, landlords and competitors, as well as on the efficacy
                             and consistency of its marketing programs, defining the guidelines for the
                             implementation of targeted marketing actions.



            autogrill recognizes the central role of consumers as supporters,
            partners and players in the changing environment.


                             autogrill combines data derived from internal sources (data retrieved from accounting
                             and non-accounting systems) with data collected from external sources, specifically
                             from landlords and brand partners, and market surveys and analyses (tests on
                             concepts, products and services, critical for understanding and anticipating consumer
                             needs). these survey tools are also supported by direct opinions expressed by
                             consumers through customer satisfaction surveys, toll free numbers, e–mail contacts and
                             green cards which each country makes available based on different criteria. market
                             research plays an important role in understanding travelers and their different profiles

                             surveys and analyses carried out are key to the development of an offering that is in

also in europe autogrill listens and responds to consumers using different
communication tools - toll free numbers, email addresses and green cards according
to the country of reference. for the purpose of developing the offering, a culinary
council was established at the european level, with the collaboration of prominent
figures in the catering sector, world-renowned chefs and nutritionists, along with
sociologists specialized in consumer behavior.


for the past several years, the group has focused its attention mainly on increasing the
value of its relationship with travelers and on the concept of “customer centricity”, with a
view to putting the customer experience at the heart of the design of its products and
services, and creating new models and consumer formulas based on their needs. this
section focuses on consumers and is an introduction to the central chapter of this
sustainability report, dedicated to the autogrill core business: “a-product”. all the
concepts pertaining to products will be developed according to this perspective, shaping
all that autogrill does for its consumers and travelers in general. the chapter will also
explain the concept of customer centricity in greater detail.

thanks to the information collected it was possible to develop an even more precise
and accurate overview of customer needs and expectations as well as design new
solutions to increase customer satisfaction in every country in which the group
operates, across channels and even in terms of concepts. the outcomes of the surveys
represent a point of departure for the development of national marketing plans, both
from a tactical viewpoint for the implementation of targeted actions in the short term
and from a long-term strategic standpoint.

based on the customer centricity concept, for the first time in 2014 autogrill
decided to include the outcomes of the “feel good?” survey in the mbos
(managing by objective) of all the employees working in a selected number of
european countries: belgium, france, italy, spain and switzerland. this enabled
the group to further focus its management activities at all levels on customer
centricity and meet consumer needs more effectively.

partner          engagement


          customer requests and wishes are constantly changing from place to place and
          increasingly evolving. the autogrill group responds to this complex situation by continuously
          renewing its offering, cooperating closely with landlords and partner brands. a crucial role
          is assigned to the assortment of brands managed (either directly or through a license), as
          they enable the group to be present in 29 countries worldwide, with different and
          innovative solutions meeting the needs of increasingly demanding and varied customers.
          over the years, the group has built up genuine and enduring relations, which have
          helped not only to offer consumers high-quality products but also to extend knowledge
          and anticipate consumption trends. thanks to this ongoing synergy, the group continues to
          improve its offering, guarantee high product quality and respond proactively by
          anticipating trends.
          autogrill features a broad portfolio of brands that can meet landlords’ expectations and
          live up to customers’ expectations, while offering accountability, competence, quality and
          confidence to its commercial partners. at the same time, the group represents a bridge to
          travel channels for its brand partners.

important for autogrill in terms of diversifying its offering and meeting consumer needs
and expectations through the broadest possible product mix.
a consolidated partnership is the one between the group and starbucks coffee
company, which was first stipulated more than 20 years ago in the united states and
included new activities in europe. established in 1991, this partnership leverages on
over 400 stores in 8 countries and generates more than $ 500m revenues on a yearly
basis: it required hard work and no reticence about sharing knowledge and
competencies.
the international collaboration with burger king for the development of the brand in
the travel channels was initiated in the united states in 1982 and today includes more
than 140 stores in north america, europe and the pacific.
moreover, new opportunities have opened up in recent years following the agreements
made with the university of gastronomic sciences, in pollenzo, giving rise to the new
bistrot concept.



partnerships with landlords
in last few years autogrill has strengthened partnerships with landlords and extended its
business through openings in new markets and regions. the group’s strategic actions
targeting expansion mainly focused on northern european airports (a region showing
good opportunities for growth in the provision of airport catering services in upcoming
years) and on emerging countries.



                      in 2014 autogrill group:
                      • started activities at the fort lauderdale airport in florida, thus completing its presence
                          in the 30 top list of the north america’s most trafficked airports;
                      • renewed before expiry the concession for the copenhagen international airport, the
                          main hub in north europe by passenger traffic;
                      • started activities in the abu dhabi international airport, the second ranking airport of
                          the united arab emirates;
                      • continued its expansion in south-east asia with the opening of 32 new stores in
                          vietnam in the international airports of ho chi minh, hanoi and nha trang and
                          indonesia, in the bali-ngurah rai airport;
                      • increased its presence in the united kingdom, in the airports of manchester, london-
                          stansted and in the railway station of london-euston;
                      • grew in germany thanks to the stipulation of a new contract for the frankfurt hub;
                      • entered in the dutch railway station segment with the stipulation of a contract with the
                          railway station of utrecht.




                                                                    2014 sustainability report

                                               partnerships with landlords are not limited to the assignment of the contract, but,
                                               instead, evolve into long-term relationships based on trust and collaboration. to
                                               promote relations with the landlords, autogrill decided to make its expertise and
                                               knowledge about the market available. for this reason it has developed an
                                               innovative communication tool: “take a look” is a newsletter, launched in 2014,

                                               trends and how autogrill and hmshost react in order to always be at the forefront
                                               on these issues.



                              the relations with the group’s suppliers reflect directly
                              on the quality of the products and services offered to consumers.

                                               establishing good relations with suppliers is essential to obtaining products and
                                               services that consistently meet expectations. as in any corporate process, supplier
                                               selection is deeply rooted in the search for quality, flexibility and maximum
                                               professionalism. raw material (food and non-food) procurement and selection is key
                                               for the continuity of autogrill’s business, as well as the selection of partnerships:
                                               relations with the group’s suppliers reflect directly on the quality of the products and
                                               services offered to consumers. the autogrill supply chain mainly consists of suppliers
                                               of food products and beverages: in case of fresh products supplies are predominantly
                                               local, while for those products that are not based on freshness and regional
                                               specialties the group leverages on its multinational dimension to start supply projects
                                               that are extended to various countries. these suppliers are joined by a lower number
                                               of technical suppliers and service providers (maintenance and cleaning). corporate
                                               procurement and the specialists at the headquarters of the different countries are
                                               responsible for procurement processes and the development of partnerships with
                                               suppliers. based on the same logic, hmshost in the united states relies on a
                                               qualified international operator for its purchases.

collaboration between the group and its partners is mutually enhancing when
regulated by precise policies and procedures, and it is therefore in autogrill’s interest to
identify assessment tools that verify supplier conformity, which is necessary to continue
working together. assessment and verification are indispensable to ensure high quality
standards for all products and services. for this reason periodic audits have been




                                                                                                   a-product
designed, employing screening activities implemented in different ways, through
questionnaires, (direct or indirect) information collection, sampling and audits. the
strong focus on establishing sound relationships with its suppliers of goods and services
is also expressed on an ethical level. for this reason the supplier selection process is
entirely transparent, according to the group’s code of ethics, the general purchase
conditions and the company’s specific procedures developed for each single country.
the us “procurement policy & procedures” policy was developed in order to guarantee
equal opportunities and also allow small local businesses to be included in the
hmshost supplier list without discrimination (based on size, gender, nationality,
religion, race, etc.). in addition, the conditions envisaged in the agreement include the
provision that no contracts shall be entered into with companies that violate human
rights and workers’ rights, or the rights of minors or that implement procedures that
violate laws, regulations or directives.



                             the relations between the group and its partners
                             are mutually enhancing when regulated by precise
                             policies and procedures.


in italy, the group puts great ethical emphasis on supplier selection. in italy, the
general purchase conditions stipulate that suppliers must comply with the autogrill
code of ethics and the indications set out in the organizational model pursuant to
italian legislative decree no. 231/2001.


again in italy, the social accountability 8000 certification – originally obtained in
2009 – marked a fundamental step for autogrill in its commitment to the protection
of human rights and workers’ rights, the fight against child labor and the guarantee
of health and safety in the workplace along the entire supply chain.
this certification enabled the company to increasingly involve and raise the
awareness of its supply chain in relation to the protection of workers’ rights and
also in relation to environmental issues, following the attainment of iso 14001
certification.

                                                   the results are then linked to the mbo systems of store managers and head office
                                                   managers. in addition, the “excellence award” assigns a prize to the stores scoring
                                                   highest every year. the quality audit system adopted in italy is partially managed by
                                                   an external company. in 2014, a new profile was developed internally, namely the
                                                   quality auditor, with the task of testing the alignment of the italian quality audit system
                                                   with the european “autogrill excellence audit” system in 2015.
                                                   hmshost also has a robust food quality and safety program in place, managed by a
                                                   third company (audits are based on the food and drug administration good guide
                                                   regulation). each store is visited at least twice every year without notice and the
                                                   quality control department reviews each audit and follows up the implementation of
                                                   the improvement plan. the action plan relative to the faults identified during the audit is
                                                   proposed by the same store managers.




                                                   autogrill group

                                                                                             85




the quality control department monitors the performance of the stores to help the
managers concentrate on the improvement areas; it organizes webinars at least twice
a year, inviting the stores to participate in examining the results of the audits, the
objectives and the possible changes to the program; it has regular meetings with the
auditing firm and the auditors to pursue ongoing improvement and ensure that the




                                                                                                    a-product
controls are performed thoroughly, consistently and in a constructive way. the results
are used to develop action plans and are linked to the mbos at the level of each
single store.


moreover, autogrill, as brand licensee, is in turn subject to audits by its brand
partners (this aspect of partnerships with more or less renowned brands also
contributes to the unflagging maintenance of the highest quality standards) and
landlords. employee training on food safety regulations and h.a.c.c.p. processes
completes the group’s focus and control on these issues.


the need to monitor the quality of the service and therefore improve the offering led
autogrill group to introduce the “mystery client” in its management systems. the
mystery client is an employee who, being responsible for assessing quality, visits the
stores incognito, pretending to be a normal customer.


in italy, the areas monitored by mystery clients were in line with those surveyed
through customer satisfaction (see page 78). these are therefore more focused on
customer experience, following the customer-oriented approach that characterizes
autogrill’s new way of doing business. after the visits, carried out by an
independent company, an assessment form is filled out on the store visited.


the results are then promptly communicated to the main offices and store managers for
the purpose of designing improvement actions. the mystery client’s findings (matched
with those of the customer satisfaction surveys) are also entered in the mbo system of
network and headquarters directors and managers.

               certifications
               the group puts great emphasis on certifications, which testify to the success of its
               management models and serve as motivation to improve. in italy, in 2014 the
               iso9001 certifications on quality management systems and the uni 10854

               certifications were maintained. the iso22000 on food safety (for the milan offices,
               the giovi ovest store and the orio al serio airport) was renewed and the social
               accountability 8000 ethical certification for autogrill s.p.a. is still valid.
               the offices of telefonica in madrid obtained the renewal of the iso 22000
               certification on the food safety management system.

                                 in the past few years remarkable changes in eating habits and tastes have emerged.
                                 consumer trends profile an increasingly demanding customer privileging a healthy
                                 and personalized offer. in recent years the autogrill group has increasingly
                                 concentrated on activities aimed at promoting healthy and balanced lifestyles, also
                                 thanks to quality diet.



            hmshost extended its selection of fresh and vegetarian
            menus with low-fat and low-calorie options.


                                 hmshost continuously monitors emerging food trends with the help of several
                                 organizations, and develops new menus based on the findings. with reference to the
                                 tendency to look for particularly healthy food, hmshost extended its selection of fresh
                                 and vegetarian menus with low-fat and low-calorie options and combined menus, such
                                 as, for instance, salads and, in general, side dishes with vegetables (in the past few
                                 years many 500-calorie or less menu options were added). the focus is on expanding
                                 the offering in general, because “healthy” can mean different things to different people,
                                 and consumers can choose the best option for themselves when offered several
                                 alternatives. moreover, in compliance with the federal regulations issued by the united
                                 states department of agriculture and the us food and drug administration, the
                                 nutritional value and calorie content of the food products are specified on the menus.
                                 attention to proper nutrition is high across europe and there are multiple solutions
                                 available. for example, a wide choice of fruit and vegetables is available within many
                                 concepts, and varieties of wholegrain bread are available in the concepts offering
                                 baked products and sandwiches.

in the ciao restaurants in italy, fish menus were increased; in the netherlands, the salt
content in products has been reduced. in switzerland, the “greens” concept,
implemented in cooperation with the swiss biosuisse association, offers organic food

                                       autogrill designed special menus for kids,
                                       tailored to their specific nutritional needs.


the group also pays great attention to children’s dietary needs. autogrill designed
special kids’ menus, available in all ciao, spizzico and burger king restaurants,
tailored to their specific nutritional needs (for instance, suggesting smaller portions,
with yogurt and fruit compote as an alternative to ice cream in the menus).
in 2014 hmshost collaborated with kraft in the development of new kids’ menus in
the united states.

consumption trends show that consumers want to learn more about the cultural identity
of the geographical area they are visiting through the enjoyment of the typical food
and beverage products of a country or a city. the group has been working for years
on becoming a showcase for the territory. autogrill italia acknowledged the starring
role of certified products and typical local products by introducing sandwiches with
the different certification brands, i.e. doc (controlled designation of origin), pdo
(protected designation of origin), pgi (protected geographical indication), docg
(controlled and guaranteed designation of origin), as well as regional specialties.
the market area in the stores, dedicated to the distribution of food products and other
items, and specifically the “la bottegaccia” corner, is a real showcase, intended to
bring travelers in contact with local products.

                         in france as well, autogrill encourages travelers to discover and rediscover the products
                         of the territory and traditional cuisine, both through prepared dishes to enjoy in
                         restaurants and take-away products (in this respect, the most famous boutiques are “la

                         flavor. for example, in phoenix, the “blue burrito” offers food and beverages that are
                         very popular in the southwest; the anchorage airport, in alaska, within the framework
                         of the norton sound seafood house, offers fresh fish that it receives directly from a
                         local fishing co-operative (norton sound economic development corporation),
                         updating the seasonal menus according to fish supplies. in fact, seasonality of
                         ingredients is extremely important and is taken into account in designing the menus
                         developed by the different concepts.


                         in this respect autogrill stipulated a partnership with airc (the italian association
                         for cancer research) in the year in which the association celebrates 50 years of
                         activity. on the occasion of the “oranges for health” campaign featured in
                         february 2015 in more than 500 autogrill stores in italy, the morning menu
                         included fresh-squeezed orange juice made with italian red oranges certified by
                         the association, rich with anti-oxidants and vitamin c.
                         research was funded thanks to the small contributions made by many consumers.




                         the development of new products
                         at autogrill group, commitment to food experimentation and research has always been
                         a priority. the group’s experimental kitchens – in america, italy, spain and switzerland
                         – are places where our chefs can develop new recipes with a wide selection of quality
                         products in full compliance with the principles of diet and health.
                         in italy spazio fucina is a true research laboratory, where chefs of the organization,
                         renowned italian and international cooks, test ingredients, develop ideas, recipes and
                         concepts, translating inputs deriving from emerging dietary trends, the evolution of
                         nutritional standards and food technology in products that enrich the commercial

the culinary council is an international program of culinary innovation through which
autogrill benefits from a collaboration with sociologists specialized in consumer

                 the cooperation with chefs and food institutions
                 increases the level of excellence of the food experience.


the exchange and cooperation with chefs and wine and food institutions have always
been considered by the group as an opportunity for a detailed analysis of emerging
food trends and a forum for innovative ideas, with a view to increasing the level of
excellence of the food experience in the travel channels. in the united states, autogrill
has been collaborating for many years with the culinary institute of america (cia),
one of the world’s most prominent universities of food sciences, in the framework of the
“education, menu development and training” program, which includes consulting and
training services for the development of new menus and recipes in us stores. in
addition, again in the us, activities in partnership with 29 celebrity chefs were
developed to open restaurants with signature brands and menus prepared by the
celebrated gourmet chefs in the major us airports.
in italy, the collaboration with the university of gastronomic sciences in pollenzo
resulted in the development of the bistrot concept, based on an accurate selection of
wines and food products and on the recovery and revisiting of local dishes.
in spain, the development of new products is the result of employee engagement, with
the objective of discovering new talents and motivating and involving workers in group
activities. in the past few years various contests were launched in this area. in 2014 a
new coffee blend and new sandwiches were developed. at the end of the
competition, the best recipes were included in autogrill menus with a specifically
targeted communication explaining their origin. consumer response was very positive.

            in the past few years great emphasis has been placed on enhancing an aspect of
            customer relations: “customer centricity”, which puts the consumer experience at the
            center of product and service design, so that new models and formulas are developed
            around his/her needs.



            design for all
            travelers place great importance on services and the physical spaces and demands
            differ depending on the type of traveler. habitual customers, including truck drivers,
            families, children, the differently able, pets, bikers and business people, are only some of
            the people that come into contact with autogrill every day. they want more comfortable,
            more functional and basically more attractive and relaxing interiors, so that stopping
            becomes a pleasant experience, with modern furniture, better lighting, attention to
            materials used and more comfortable chairs, tables and stools, all welcome amenities for
            travelers. for this reason, autogrill italia pays special attention to the needs of these
            customers when developing new stores. the mensa di ravenna and villoresi est stores
            have been certified by the “design for all” association for their special attention to
            making every service accessible and today the group tries to implement the best
            practices learnt from the development of these new stores, replicating, wherever possible,
            a design that follows the same guidelines.
            the elimination of architectural, perceptual and cultural barriers and the definition of an
            innovative interior design have resulted in the development of a next generation shop
            experience that enhances freedom, safety and ease of movement for all travelers.



            the best service for different needs
            the broad range of services offered by the group meets the needs of the different types
            of consumers, including children, families, differently able individuals, business people,
            truck drivers, bikers and people travelling with their pets. for this reason, different
            solutions have been developed to meet consumer demand.
            the autogrill group aims at making the traveler’s day better. for this reason, it offers
            solutions for every type of traveler.
            in the major european countries, for people traveling with children, autogrill has set up
            baby rooms in the stores, and recreational spaces tailor-made for children, with pint-sized
            tables and chairs, games, videogames and large-screen tvs showing cartoons.
            characters have been developed to accompany children during meals, as well as gift
            gadgets for the smaller guests. specifically for families, hmshost launched a parallel
            program for children with menus and entertaining games in addition to options aimed at
            increasing the purchasing power of families with children. in addition, the majority of the
            stores have designed special kids’ menus tailored to their specific nutritional needs.

has developed freedom to choose, a web-based, in-house platform, made available
to all network workers, which contains hundreds of recipes and thus lets them plan and
execute menu changes more rapidly, to satisfy specific requests made by customers or
regional trends.
moreover, discount programs and dedicated offers targeted to truck drivers and bus
drivers are made available also in the united states.



assistance and control
in italy the stores are constantly monitored, thanks to the implementation of an
operations center that conducts remote video surveillance on all the stores to guarantee
support, security and safety, especially during night hours, for both workers and
customers. the system, which is currently operative in 200 locations, will gradually be
extended to the entire network, in particular on the highways, where the stores are
open round the clock.
autogrill italia is actively involved in the italian national observatory of sports events at
the italian ministry of the interior and it participates in the weekly meetings where,
together with the several attending authorities, it plans shifts and stops along the highway
network during the days in which the football matches of the italian serie a “take place.
moreover, autogrill italia participates in the “viabilità italia” initiative, a national center
that deals with road traffic congestion situations, set up by the italian ministry of the
interior and guided by the chief of the highway police. the initiative is geared to
planning the most effective action strategies during the peak summer periods,
preparing the snow management plan and organizing security and safety measures
during special events. in fact, in periods of peak traffic and according to high traffic
flows, a steward and customer assistance service has been set up in the mostly heavily
trafficked parking areas, with the presence of dedicated personnel or paramedical
control units with ambulances.
in the united states hmshost launched network operation center, a new system to
ensure the highest levels of electronic payment safety, guaranteeing the best customer
experience for all services linked to wi-fi networks offered in the majority of the
hmshost stores in north america.

                standpoint
              · reduce costs by 5%

              at the end of 2011, for the first time autogrill launched an internal challenge in terms         (g4- en1; g4-en2)
              of sustainability objectives to be reached within 2015, based on 2012 data. for
              the product area the objective is packaging: promotion of sustainable packaging
              and a 5% cost reduction.


              the objective was already reached thanks to the european packaging project
              launched in 2013 to map all purchase categories (shopping bags, cutlery and
              plates, etc.) in order to increase the efficiency of the purchase process.


              autogrill implemented actions to reduce the weight of the triangular, paper-plastic
              plate used for serving pizza. the weight of the packaging was reduced by 11%
              and this action proved successful thanks to the reduced thickness of the cardboard
              used. in addition, the cardboard was made with 100% recycled material. the
              barrier effect with food is guaranteed by the application of a layer of opp (oriented
              polypropylene) film. the reduced weight of the packaging also resulted in a
              reduced impact due to both savings in the use of raw materials and in the
              management of its disposal. in addition, the use of the material deriving from post
              consumption recycling led to other savings in terms of carbon footprint per unit of
              product, especially in terms of water consumption.
              by implementing similar actions also on the plates used to serve crepes, autogrill
              managed to target a 9.54% cost reduction on the two items in 2013.

from values to the concept factory
the opening of the villoresi est service station, in 2013, was a milestone in the path
towards sustainability within autogrill. villoresi exemplifies international best practice
within the group in terms of sustainable innovation. it implements a set of virtuous solutions
in the store, which can be individually replicated in other stores of the group’s global
network in the future.
as regards the product offering, villoresi est, with its design of services entirely structured
to meet the distinctive characteristics of its customers, offers the opportunity to experience
the location at two different speeds: an ideal separation was then accomplished in the
location between the “fast” area with a new concept, spizzico bar, displaying innovation
in its layout and in the offering of autogrill’s original brand, and the “slow” area,
dedicated to catering services, retail and relaxation for all those who want to take their
time. here, a re-interpretation of the bar motta was introduced, as a trait d’union with the
nearby city of milan, along with a revisited version of the ciao restaurant, intended to
satisfy the new trends and styles in terms of food and diet. for example:
- recipes containing seitan and tofu were added to the menus,
- grilling was added as a cooking method for numerous dishes,
- fish products were added,
- customers are given the possibility of ordering dishes based on their needs.
in addition to this, the innovation of “territori d’italia” was also introduced, a new concept
dedicated to the typical regional specialties.



from the perspective of eco-sustainability, the villoresi est location was entirely designed
and developed in compliance with the energy efficiency and carbon footprint standards of
the leed protocol (leadership in energy and environmental design) obtaining the leed
gold certification in addition to emas and iso 14001 certifications. the building extends
over a surface of approximately 2,500 sq m, with a skeleton entirely in pefc certified
lamellar wood harvested from sustainably managed forests. as required by leed
standards, only eco-compatible and recyclable materials were used. its characteristic
volcano shape (reaching a height of 27.5 m) facilitates the flow of excess heat towards the
top and the ideal exploitation of external temperature conditions, thus reducing the energy
used for heating or cooling air.
a “thermal battery” geothermal plant was built, with 420 sensors installed in the subsoil
25 m deep, providing an output exceeding 380 thermal kw and covering 85% of
requirements. in addition, the roof of the store extends over a surface of 350 sq m
captures either solar energy or cold, depending on the season, and led lighting is used
for both interiors and the exterior.
 as to water, rainwater and groundwater are used for cooling air, irrigation of green
areas, the management of toilets and the firefighting systems, reducing the uptake of water
from the public waterworks for industrial purposes to zero.

in the united states, the delaware welcome center is still hmshost flagship. it extends
over a surface of 4,000 sq m and was designed in accordance with the leadership in
energy and environmental design (leed) principles, recycling and re-using 75% of the
material derived from the demolition of the pre-existing building. the store optimizes the
use of natural sunlight, significantly cutting energy consumption. moreover, in order to         delaware
better insulate the building, the roof was constructed with highly reflective material and
                                                                                                 welcome center
the walls with insulating materials to avoid heat dispersion in winter. with regard to air
ventilation, a geothermal plant was installed with 60 geothermal wells feeding 37
pumps distributed throughout the building.




the milan bistrot is the result of a collaboration established with the university of
gastronomic sciences in pollenzo and features an offering based on authentic local
recipes, the concept of seasonality, naturalness, typical and regional dishes and recipes
from the local tradition.
the first bistrot was opened at the milan centrale railway station, and the objective is
to develop a sustainable location with particular attention to environmental protection,
culture and the local economy also through the use of natural materials in interior
design (like, for instance, chairs from the first years of the 20th century, lined with fabric
recovered from old jute bags that had been used to transport wheat and coffee); the
use of wooden floorboards taken from old houses being demolished or renovated;
extensive use of wood grown in controlled plantations, etc.).
in particular, the food offering includes bread and pizza made locally with yeast,
handmade pasta with local eggs and wheat, organic beer, wine from local vineyards,
fresh vegetables, fruit juices and fresh smoothies with fruits and vegetables in season. in
addition to the restaurant there are also a market area and services designed
specifically for the type of location: free wi-fi for customers, ipads for free consultation,
screens with the train timetable in real time and sockets for recharging pcs and cell
phones. there is also a selection of wines, books and other reading material to peruse
while comfortably seated in one of the store’s lounge areas, as well as free drinking
water.
given the great success of the milan store, the first international opening is scheduled
at the düsseldorf airport in germany with an array of typically mediterranean
products. great attention will also be paid to local traditions (for example, a barbecue
grill is planned instead of the table for handmade pasta) and km zero products. in
2015 this concept is expected to be further developed at the international level.




                                                                  2014 sustainability report

burger federation is the first concept directly developed at the group level through
a work group, which involved colleagues from different countries, taking landlords’
requirements, consumer insights, the group’s knowledge and employee
competencies into account. this project provided the opportunity to better
comprehend and exploit the group’s international nature for the purpose of
devising a concept that will offer high quality burgers from all over the world.
the first burger federation opened in mid-2014 at the rome fiumicino airport and
in 2015 new burger federation restaurants will be opened in other locations where
the group is present.
in addition to the development of the concept, another result of this international
study is the gourmet burger, presented in italy, france, spain and germany in
several stores directly managed by the group.




with a view to enhancing local production, the “harvest market” concept was
launched at the belfast, dublin and amsterdam schiphol airports. it reproduces a
typical urban street market, where travelers can stroll and choose local products,
fresh seasonal products like dutch cheese, organic meat and fruits and vegetables
direct from local suppliers. menus are changed frequently, following the seasons,
always with a strong emphasis on fresh and healthy ingredients and, whenever
possible, organic. in particular, at the schiphol amsterdam airport (over 300
destinations and more than 45 million passengers every year, 4th in the ranking of
europe’s most trafficked airports) hmshost designed its stores using the chairs
made with recycled pet coke bottles.




hmshost makes informed decisions when developing concepts and products to
target an improved balance between sustainability, costs and quality. the new
la place restaurant was opened on the premises of the amsterdam schiphol
airport and was awarded the schiphol consumer prize for corporate
responsibility.

the la place restaurant offers all natural products with no artificial flavors or food
coloring agents. the furniture is made of scrap wood from denmark and the
restaurant features led lighting and energy efficient refrigeration plants.
moreover, last year hmshost started a collaboration with marie-stella maris,
according to which all restaurants at the schiphol airport carry bottles of this
brand of water, whose mission is crystal clear: “drink water give water”, for
each liter of water sold, euro 0.05 is donated to a foundation engaged in
bringing drinkable water to populations that do not have access to it. (it should
also be noted that the bottles are produced with 50% recycled pet).

in 2013 hmshost also stipulated a contract for the sale of sunday’s the green
products, for the delivery of fresh produce, organic homemade bread, meat from
sustainable farms, cage-free eggs and local vegetables. obviously, for the
packaging, the paper used is f.s.c. certified (derived from sustainably managed
forests) and instead of plastics p.l.a. is used (non-plastic, degradable material).

the group leverages on its international dimension and develops synergies and
collaborations across countries with different teams, not only for the purpose of
developing new concepts, but also to spread them in the markets in which it
operates, adjusting them according to local needs.
“la tapenade, mediterranean café” is a concept designed in the united states
in 2007 and was first applied in the chicago international airport. last october
a revised version of the “la tapenade, mediterranean café” restaurant was
opened in the marseilles airport, adapted to the european market. the restaurant
offers travelers a selection of typical mediterranean products. “la tapenade,
mediterranean café” is a “café-restaurant”, that offers customers a broad
selection of fresh and healthy products in a modern and colorful atmosphere. the
concept was inspired by mediterranean culture and tradition and offers products
from spanish, italian and greek traditional cuisine.




at the international airport of toronto pearson hmshost, in partnership with
some of the most prominent chefs, transformed the airport into a magnet for
gourmet connoisseurs thanks to the opening of new restaurants that feature a

autogrill and milan are bound historically. the first link dates back to the opening
of the bar motta in 1928, which remains an indissoluble link with the city in its
revisited version, which has shown itself to be capable of embracing and
interpreting emerging consumer trends and culture through product innovation
inspired by milanese urban customs. as matter of fact, over the years the duomo
store was the stage where changing consumer habits and cultural phenomena that
affected the heart of this city first became visible: in the duomo square.
in 2013, after 17 years, autogrill renovated the space occupied by the historic “bar
motta 1928” and on 20 october 2014 the bar motta received the prestigious
recognition of “landmark store” within the framework of the “register of landmark
stores” promoted by the lombardy region to enhance the importance of the retail
stores of the region that stand out for their unique historical and architectural
identity.
in october 2014 the store was subject to new refurbishment work. the new
opening is scheduled for spring 2015 and will feature new concepts: il mercato,
bistrot milano duomo, spazio (the laboratory-restaurant by niko romito
formazione), motta and terrazza aperol.

operating under concession agreements in complex and differentiated situations like
the travel channel means first and foremost knowing how to adjust the procedures
developed for environmental protection to the requirements of the different types of
landlords. it also means identifying common points of integration around shared
principles like, for instance, the responsible use of water and energy, reducing polluting
emissions, using eco-sustainable packaging and applying appropriate waste disposal
procedures.
the most important factor is engagement, getting both collaborators and consumers to
pull in the same direction. in fact, protecting the environment means, first and foremost,
consuming less and, therefore, it is of key importance to raise employee awareness
and foster employee engagement and commitment so that everybody makes a
contribution to sustainability.



                            the commitment towards environmental compliance
                            and protection poses great challenges and difficulties.


only a cultural transformation can lead people to reduce their energy and water
consumption. this requires changing ingrained habits and a re-orientation of workers
who use the equipment on a daily basis, suppliers who produce it and consumers who
come to autogrill stores and make use of the services. in order to disseminate a pro-
environment culture, autogrill designs ongoing projects targeted to all group employees
to raise their awareness and engagement in terms of environmental protection and
waste reduction. the message conveyed to collaborators focuses on the proper use of
kitchen equipment (hot plates, ovens, deep-fryers, dishwashers, etc.), which in low
traffic time slots may be switched off, thus generating significant savings. other
initiatives are targeted to consumers, like the sale of compostable shoppers or jute
bags, theme-focused communication campaigns focusing on sustainability issues and
the proposal of waste differentiation.
the group aconnect portal includes the “afuture” section. this is a virtual location
containing all the information of the roadmap, ranging from its history to the news and
events from all over the world dedicated to the dissemination of the principles of
sustainability. last but not least, the monthly column “go green” was developed to
disseminate best practices for the responsible use of paper, water and power. simple
concrete actions that every worker can apply every day.

                                         hmshost has implemented a program called “startsomewhere”, which groups all the
                                         initiatives revolving around eco-sustainability and, above all, delivers effective
                                         communication to employees about the importance of their contribution, in addition to
                                         engaging with the authorities granting the concessions through participation in initiatives.
                                         in 2014, on the occasion of earth day, hmshost planted 10,000 trees, matching the

                                         practices about sustainability. moreover, for the fifth consecutive year, the survey on
                                         environmental issues was continued, involving all the stores in the united states,
                                         canada, australia, new zealand and malaysia. the questionnaire covered various
                                         topics. the first part was dedicated to the management of the main environmental
                                         aspects of store operation: power, water and differentiated waste – cooking oil, coffee
                                         grounds, milk packs, glass and plastic bottles, cans, wooden pallets, etc.. the second
                                         part maps other initiatives, such as the use of led lamps, the installation of individual
                                         presence detectors for switching on lights, training courses teaching the staff how to save
                                         water and the use of recycled paper in the offices, up to the environmental certification
                                         obtained. this annual survey proved to be an important tool for involving and increasing
                                         employee engagement in adopting sustainable behaviors, also because it includes a
                                         section in which the stores can enter suggestions, request information and even make
                                         requests regarding the sustainability program adopted by the group. the results showed
                                         particular attention to recycling cooking oil, cardboard and ink cartridges, as well as the
                                         use of energy-efficient bulbs. in order to reduce water consumption, presence detection
                                         systems were installed on the wash basins in the toilets.
                                         also, at the main headquarters of the group differentiated waste collection is pursued
                                         according to different criteria and following the differentiation methods defined by the
                                         companies responsible for local waste collection and disposal (paper, plastic, glass,
                                         aluminum and ink cartridges).
                                         in the united states, hmshost offices are leed gold and energy star certified (energy
                                         star certified buildings have a 35% lower consumption than comparable buildings, with
                                         lower greenhouse gas emissions by about 35%).
                                         also in relation to its suppliers, the group pays a great deal of attention to ethical and
                                         environmental aspects in the supplier selection process. this means adding another
                                         layer of assessment in addition to material quality and process reliability. selecting the
                                         right suppliers with whom to support the group’s commitment towards eco-sustainability
                                         means facilitating dialogue with category associations and organizations operating in
                                         different fields, which can become important mediators and also facilitate the process
                                         of technological and cultural innovation that the sustainability challenge requires.

as for waste, the group’s broad offering of products and services make effective

also when the service is rendered. waste is also produced when food supplies are

delivered on site, with packaging that must be disposed of. the correct approach to
each of these steps represents another fundamental engagement in favor of the
environment. operating in airports, railway stations and malls also implies compliance
with the waste management policies adopted by the landlord. on the highways -
where autogrill, though operating under concession, is responsible for waste - the
group relies on the municipal services and, where these are not available, it
establishes collaborations with specialized companies. this is the starting point for the
analysis of the various aspects that pertain to differentiated waste collection, recovery
and recycling. in all the stores where the local conditions allow it, autogrill group has
introduced waste differentiation.
the group is committed to reducing waste (particularly in relation to the
undifferentiated portion) by installing waste collection and recycling systems in the
back of its stores, on one hand, and reducing the volume of waste in order to
decrease the number of waste pick-ups and the relevant (environmental and economic)
impact linked to logistics, through the installation of compactors and glass-crushing
machines, on the other.



                                      the group is committed to reducing waste
                                      by installing waste collection and recycling
                                      systems.


at the european level (austria, belgium, france, italy, spain and switzerland), a
growing number of stores are committed to differentiating oil, plastic and paper and,
where possible, also recycling plastic materials and glass bottles collected from
consumers.
autogrill italia collaborates with the main specialized waste management operators for
the management of the service that collects waste from the stores located on the
highways, which are not always covered by local municipal services. the agreement
includes the collection of waste in a deferred way, meaning that waste is first collected
from the store undifferentiated, except for paper and paperboard, and then brought to
a selection-treatment plant, where it is separated. in particular, cooking oil is separated
and collected separately in all stores making use of it, and is used to make fuel;
moreover, in approximately 30 stores on the highway, where waste collection is
entrusted by the group to private operators, organic waste is collected separately and
brought to composting centers.




                                                                     2014 sustainability report

                         to this end, in 2013 a project was launched in collaboration with wwf italia which
                         envisaged the development of an experimental hub dedicated to food waste. the
                         project involved the highway service stations of villoresi est, brianza nord and brianza
                         sud, located close to the city of milan. the project, which is part of the wwf one

                         again in italy, the “destinazione ambiente” project was continued, currently involving
                         13 stores along the turin-venice a4 highway. the initiative was launched in 2009
                         thanks to a collaboration with conai (consorzio nazionale imballaggi; italian
                         packaging consortium), waste italia, the hera group (italy’s main waste management
                         companies) and id&a (engineering company) for the development of the equipment
                         used. this project envisages the management of differentiated waste collection during
                         both the preparation and distribution of food. for the purpose of the project, not only
                         workers are asked to contribute, but also consumers inside and outside the stores.
                         to this end, different forms of communication and different ad hoc designed devices
                         will be installed to collect different waste types.


                         in the stores located at the seattle-tacoma international airport in the united states,
                         thanks to a direct partnership with the airport facility management company, hmshost
                         developed a method to reduce the quantity of organic waste and paper brought to the
                         landfill, using composting in the back of the store and replacing disposables with
                         recyclable materials in the 5 restaurants managed.

containers in atlanta.


in 2010, the locations in france began involving customers proactively through the
development - in partnership with the coca-cola company - of equipment to
differentiate and collect pet bottles and cans in the store of carrousel du louvre.
this equipment was then installed over the years in another 20 locations.
moreover, the plastic material used for take-away packaging was eliminated.


the decision to use bags produced from recycled or biodegradable material was
made unanimously by autogrill france, autogrill austria, hmshost and autogrill italia.




excess food
the management systems developed and fine-tuned over the years thanks to
experience and technology enable autogrill group to calculate customer flows to each
store every day of the year with a relatively low error margin. these systems allow the
group to:


• meet consumer demand, minimizing the risk of unavailability of a minimum basic
    offer, on one hand, and
• reduce scrap and food in excess, by more precisely calculating the quantities and
    foods to cook, on the other.


methods and procedures represent the first step towards reducing scraps, including
excess food. the rigor that has always characterized autogrill in this field enables
it to produce fewer scraps. in the united states, hmshost collaborates with food
donation connection, developing programs for the donation of food products from
the stores located at airports and on highways.


thanks to this project, in the united states, autogrill manages to collect excess food
and redistribute it to the community. in italy, autogrill continues its collaboration with
banco alimentare, to which it donates excess food.

intended to improve and control energy consumption and efficiency.
for the recently opened stores in france, various energy efficiency technologies
(insulation, shading system, natural light and low consumption light bulbs) were
implemented, and plants generating energy from renewable sources (photovoltaic
panels for energy generation and solar panels for hot water) were installed. also,
when investments are made in restyling a location, autogrill takes all the necessary
actions to improve energy efficiency in the building as well. examples include the roof
and window insulation technology used for the store located in reims, which was
made possible thanks also to the financing envisaged by the certificats d’economies
d’energie government program, targeting an overall reduction in the store’s energy
consumption.

                         · at least 30 stores leed-certified



                         at the end of 2011 autogrill launched for the first time an internal challenge in terms of
                         sustainability objectives to be reached within 2015, based on 2012 data.
                         in the planet area, one of autogrill’s objectives is energy consumption.
                         during the course of 2014, the energy consumption index improved by 5% (€/mwh)
                         against 2013.
                         as to new stores opened in 2014, the energy consumption index improved by 4%
                         (€/mwh) against 2013.

                         note: the perimeter of reference was identified based on the robustness of the currently implemented
                         analysis system, which enables an effective flow of data useful for monitoring the objectives included in
                         the roadmap (italy, belgium, france, spain and austria).




                                                                         2014 sustainability report

           inside the los angeles international airport, hmshost implemented energy star certified
           equipment (refrigerators, grill hot plates, etc.). the innovation of the energy
           management system inside the new international terminal f in atlanta was also of
           interest. this refers to an innovative ventilation system used in kitchens. through this
           integrated system, the fans automatically change based on the temperature in the
a-planet




           discharge flues, saving energy. this new system distinguishes between the moments in
           which food is being prepared, the troughs and peaks. with reduced traffic, fan speed
           slows down and the air ventilation switches off, thus reducing operating costs.


           in spain autogrill relaunched the “edison project” in 2014. the objective of the
           project is the efficient reduction of energy consumption in the stores, maintaining
           worker awareness towards environmental issues high. an important characteristic
           of this project is operator awareness, considered the key to a successful energy
           efficiency policy.


           the project envisages training courses for store managers, a practical manual for the
           correct use of equipment and information about energy consumption. a calendar was
           also developed for each store to help use air conditioning and heating efficiently.
           moreover, a competition was launched among the stores with the objective of
           increasing employee engagement in the initiative aimed at reducing energy
           consumption.
           in the netherlands concerted efforts were made to bring about improvements,
           especially with regard to energy efficiency. these efforts resulted in the achievement of
           good results: in recent years smart energy meters were installed in all stores, as well as
           gas meters.
           sharing best practices among the countries within the group plays a fundamental role
           in terms of engineering aspects and technical purchases, similarly to the management
           of other business aspects (human resources, product offering and new service
           development).


           for instance, the use of led technology in new stores is spreading in all the
           countries in which the group operates, like the use of the high-speed panini grills
           hot plate. developed in collaboration with electrolux, this solution combines three
           different technologies in a single piece of equipment (contact plate, infrared and
           microwave). 30 seconds are sufficient to warm up a sandwich, instead of the 2
           minutes required using traditional plates, and they consume 0.5 kwh, half as much
           as the traditional ones. this technology also contributed to improving employee
           safety in the workplace.



           in addition, after an initial test, which proved very successful with consumers, open
           refrigerators were replaced with refrigerators equipped with sliding doors in the stores
           in europe. this small modification will also yield energy savings.
           recovery of gases potentially hazardous to the ozone layer from the refrigerating plants
           is performed in accordance with international standards and under safe conditions for
           human health and the environment. in all the stores located in italy, all plants containing
           gases potentially hazardous to the ozone layer are registered and managed according
           to specific maintenance standards by companies responsible for store maintenance.

any maintenance activity is registered in specific logbooks, with an indication of the
plant specifications and activities performed. based on the results of the relevant
feasibility studies, the replacement of the gases contained in the refrigeration plants
(refrigerators and air ventilation) is periodically assessed in correspondence with store
restyling.




                                                                                                                            a-planet
in relation to the role played by autogrill in facilitating sustainable mobility, at the
delaware welcome center, hmshost has developed a project dedicated to truck
drivers, designed in collaboration with cabaire (a company supplying electronic
components for trucks): in the parking area of the infrastructure, there are now 50
stations supplying electricity for trucks to power air conditioning and heating without
keeping the motor running. the delaware welcome center also features stations for
recharging electric vehicles.
in italy, in 2014 the first twelve supercharger tesla systems were installed in the gas
station of dorno est and dorno ovest (on the a7 milan-serravalle highway), the result
of a collaboration between the palo alto-based company, autogrill and the milano-
serravalle highway company. these twelve stations will allow the free recharging of all
model s vehicles that park in the reserved areas, charging 50% of battery capacity in
just twenty minutes. this service is added to the collaboration between the foundation
and v-now!, loginet and nissan, thanks to which the first recharging unit for
electric-powered cars was installed at the villoresi est refilling station on the italian
highway, allowing recharging in less than half an hour.

                                                autogrill is fully aware of and recognizes how important it is to correctly manage water
                                                and, for this reason, the group has undertaken several projects. in the italian stores
                                                water supply needs are met through uptake from the public waterworks: water is used
a-planet




                                                for the management of toilets, kitchen activities and the fire-fighting systems. in the areas
                                                located far from the public waterworks, water is supplied through wells and/or from
                                                rivers, while water drainage management complies with the local and national
                                                regulations in the matter.
                                                in the stores where autogrill is responsible for the management of toilets, the largest
                                                quantity of water used is concentrated there. having said this, it is easy to understand
                                                how water consumption in the group’s stores is not strictly correlated to the
                                                management of company processes, but rather to consumer behavior. in this respect
                                                autogrill can only influence it partially, through the implementation of technology that
                                                reduce consumption to a minimum. autogrill is deeply committed to pursuing this goal.
                                                in all major countries in which the group operates, stores use rainwater for the toilets,
                                                while progressively a self-cleaning mechanical system is being installed in the stores to
                                                replace the traditional water-based system. in recent years, water regulation systems,
                                                two-way water taps, air/water mixer valves and presence detection systems have been
                                                installed to optimize water consumption in the stores.
                                                as with power, actions targeting savings and reduced consumption are continuously
                                                combined with control and prevention systems in the main stores.

                         at the end of 2011 autogrill launched for the first time an internal challenge in terms of sustainability objecti-
                         ves to be reached within 2015, based on 2012 data.
                         in the planet area, one of autogrill’s objectives is reducing water consumption.
                         water consumption is represented by partial cost estimates. as a result, consumption is heavily impacted by
                         the significant increase in water tariffs, particularly in italy, since the number of stores is far higher than in
                         other countries.
                         in 2014, water consumption was reduced by 3% compared to 2013.
                         as to the new stores opened in 2014, water consumption was reduced by 74% against 2013 (data specifi-
                         cally refers to the openings of the new starbucks stores in belgium).

                         note: the perimeter of reference was identified based on the robustness of the currently implemented analysis system, which
                         enables an effective flow of data useful for monitoring the objectives included in the roadmap (italy, belgium, france, spain
                         and austria).

oil management
in some countries and channels, food & beverage units also offer, in a more or less
integrated way with the catering offering, products for daily use (papers and
magazines, tobacco, lottery tickets) and other products, food and non-food, as well as




                                                                                                    a-planet
refueling services. in the gas stations in which autogrill is present, the group is
committed to complying with all applicable regulations and best practices in the matter,
both in relation to environmental protection and health and safety.




protection of biodiversity
when it comes to building or restyling an existing store, there are several complex
factors to consider: first, the level of integration in the ecosystem, defined through an
analysis of the different stages in the life cycle of the building, the materials and the
equipment. considering that the majority of the autogrill stores are located in high
traffic areas, like airports and railway stations, often these issues do not directly affect
autogrill, but landlords.
on the highway, the casilina est gas station, along the rome-naples a1 highway
(italy), an ancient necropolis was unearthed, yielding important archeological finds,
including an extremely rare funeral bed from the hellenistic period, and is surrounded
by the station, in a museum-like setting. a terraced garden and a series of walls in
crystal glass give travelers a clear view of the archeological site.
also in italy, for the purpose of ensuring continuity with the landscape and underscoring
the environmental bond between the villoresi est store and the groane park,
approximately 30% of the surface of the gas station (19,000 sq m) was developed as
a green area, with local trees and bushes.

           (g4-15)   environmental certifications
                     the possibility of obtaining important environmental certifications is a natural consequence
                     of autogrill’s unfailing focus on the environment.
                     the leed® (leadership in energy and environmental design) certification, thanks to its
a-planet




                     international standing comprising all aspects relating to construction and management of
                     buildings, was adopted as a reference standard in the group roadmap. in 2013, the
                     italian villoresi est gas station obtained recognition for the application of the “leed® new
                     constructions for retail” protocol at the gold level, a first for the italian catering industry.
                     this important achievement is added to the fifteen leed® certified locations on the
                     canadian highways (and precisely, eleven leed® silver certifications: west lorne, dutton,
                     tilbury north & south, trenton north & south, morrisburg, mallorytown north & south,
                     odessa & napanee - and four leed® gold certifications: bainsville, port hope, ingleside
                     and woodstock) plus the leed® silver certified delaware gas station on the delaware
                     turnpike in the united states.
                     in 2014 the villoresi est store obtained the iso14001 certification for the environmental
                     management system and the emas certification. also in italy, in 2014 the iso14001
                     certification was renewed for the headquarters, for the brianza sud store and for the stores
                     inside the turin caselle airport, and the emas certification was obtained for the
                     headquarters and the brianza sud store.


                     the hmshost stores inside the tom bradley international terminal at the los angeles
                     international airport were built according to the standards established by the california
                     green building code - level i and the california energy standard - title 24, in order to
                     make the airport the greenest airport in the world. the calgreen code requires that each
                     new building in california reduce energy consumption by 15%, water consumption by
                     20% and that 50% of waste deriving from the building site be recovered, or in any case
                     not dumped in landfills, and that fewer polluting materials be used. level i contains
                     additional voluntary measures and prerequisites in terms of bio-architecture. in the united
                     states the building of the bethesda headquarters is certified both energy star and leed
                     gold.
                     within the group, other countries fine-tuned their management systems in order to obtain
                     environmental certifications: in france, the canaver store was hqe (high environmental
                     quality) certified; the ambrussum store, close to montpellier, obtained both the hqe (high
                     environmental quality) certification and the bbc (low energy building) certification; in
                     spain, the autogrill stores inside the telefonica headquarters in madrid are iso 14001
                     certified.

number of weekly deliveries and the routes driven to deliver the goods, privileging
delivery to locations not far from one another. at the european level, logistics delivery
and distribution services to the stores are mainly accomplished through road transport
managed in outsourcing. autogrill italia defined its own car policy with the objective of
maintaining a car park managed according to sustainable principles and, as a result,
reducing atmospheric emissions, yet with the same car comfort, safety and
performance levels. in addition, a concrete step was the setting of a cap for co2
emissions at 160g/km per car (257g/mile).

             note: north america and the pacific region area are not included in the perimeter because workers in this area are classified pursuant to the
                   currently applicable legislation (“at-will employment”), and therefore it was not possible to classify them based on the two types of
                   contracts used at the european level. this legislation envisages that either party can terminate the employment contract at any time
                   without any liability of either party.
