in a great service organisation the customer only has to ask once.

 concise annual report 2002.                      contents on page 8.




this year westpac received around 4,000 complaints a month from
customers and some 40% of them had to approach us four or more
times before their issue was fully acknowledged, let alone
satisfactorily resolved.

this is clear evidence that for all the progress we have made over
recent years and despite yet another record profit result, we are still
falling well short of our customers’ expectation for better service.

the reality is our staff share our customers’ frustration. they want
to help but many feel they lack the tools and training they need.
we could tell them they have to cope with the situation, but then we
would lose some of our best people. we could say we have higher
satisfaction ratings than most of our competitors, but, in truth, it’s
only by a small margin. we could say it doesn’t really matter because
we’re still very profitable, but we could easily see our profits evaporate
along with our reputation if we did.

we’ve concluded we must act and act decisively. our ongoing
prosperity depends on it. we owe it to our customers and our
shareholders to make service quality a top priority. but, more than
anything, we owe it to our staff to start a revolution they can all take
part in and be proud of. this annual report is just the beginning...

“it’s a huge relief when a customer knows that one person is going to
 take ownership of their issue. too often in the past they were left feeling
 it’s their problem, not the bank’s and that no one wants to know.”

annalisa martello, call centre representative

“i must admit, it was often easier to pass a customer’s problem on to someone
 else rather than taking responsibility for solving it myself. knowing that i’m
 part of a team that won’t tolerate this any more is changing everything.”

 jesse mccrimmon, customer services representative

“we did the impossible with our computer system to meet the y2k deadline
 and we’ll do it again to build the systems that can bridge the gap between
 the bank and our customers so that it all works as it should.”

calvin cheung, solutions delivery manager – webtop

“of course a customer should only have to ask once. but they should only
 have to give us their details once as well. getting this right will instantly solve
 the most common complaint i hear from my customers when i ask them for
 information they’ve already given the bank three times.”
 allan brown, business banking manager

“currently there are around 30 of us dedicated to resolving customer
 problems and complaints, so imagine the power of having 25,000 people
 dedicated to dealing with the issues before they even need to come to us.”

deanne arbuckle, customer relations manager

customers
will only
have to ask
once. an
impossible
promise?

a lot of people may think that only having to ask once is an impossibly ambitious
promise for a bank to make. we don’t think it is.
our people have shown, time and time again, that with the right focus and support
they can achieve amazing things and rising to this challenge is no exception. they
have shown they understand and believe in the value of great customer experiences.
but this revolution in customer service won’t happen on its own, it requires a major
commitment from us if it is to become a reality. this is why we’ve rethought our
business processes and are investing significantly in our people and technology to
achieve it. we recognise that the time for big talk is over, it’s now time for big actions.
this year we’re using our report to set out our plan to deliver on our ‘ask once’
promise. a brave initiative that will see everyone in westpac, not just frontline staff,
become better equipped to take ownership for delivering great customer outcomes
and resolving any problems customers may have. this doesn’t mean having to know
all the answers, just where to find the answers. ultimately, it means whomever the
customer asks first about a problem will be the person who takes responsibility
for getting it solved.
this will apply from the board down, no exceptions. let the revolution begin.

chairman’s report

seeing it like it is
while a significant portion of this report focuses on our strategy for dramatically
improving our customer experience and its link to shareholder value, i would like
to take the opportunity to address an equally important issue that impacts on our
reputation. that is, the growing outrage in the community over what is seen as a
breakdown in the corporate oversight system. people are understandably frustrated
and angry at what they see as a lack of corporate transparency and accountability.

highly questionable behaviour by a few, who can blame them.
we are under no illusions. with corporate integrity under question globally, the
challenge facing australian business is to continually demonstrate a genuine
commitment to good governance and social responsibility, both of which are
fundamental to our future.

our social impact report

a fresh perspective.
our responsibility to the
society from which we profit.




in july 2002 we issued our first social impact report, ‘a fresh
perspective’, showing clear measures of our performance against
more than 70 indicators covering social, environmental and
economic dimensions.

this report is one of the first to conform to the new sustainability
reporting guidelines developed within the global reporting initiative
framework. we remain the only australian financial institution to
release such a report. the following pages summarise some key
focus areas extracted from our full social impact report, which is
available on our website at www.westpac.com.au

we know that the task of ensuring the longer-term sustainability
of our company goes beyond just the financial dimension. our
customers and the community more generally are telling us very
clearly that they expect us to take greater account of our impact
on society, by improving the transparency of all our business
practices, thereby charting a path to a healthy and sustainable
future for our company and the communities we serve.

notes:
1   base pay is the total cost to westpac of salary and packaged benefits (including motor vehicles and parking) received in the year to 30 september 2002 and includes fringe
    benefits tax. the short-term incentive figure reflects annual performance awards accrued but not yet paid in respect of the year ended 30 september 2002.
2   other compensation is determined on the basis of the cost to westpac and includes notional surchargeable superannuation contributions (as determined by the plan’s actuary)
    and other benefits (such as staff discount on westpac products) and all fringe benefits tax.
3   these options were granted on 1 march 2002 following the approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting on 13 december 2001 and are subject to performance
    hurdles which will determine the number of options that will vest at the end of the performance period. the notional value of these options has been assessed at $2.37 per option.

notes:
1   base pay is the total cost to westpac of salary and packaged benefits (including motor vehicles and parking) received in the year to 30 september 2002 and includes fringe
    benefits tax. short-term incentive figures reflect annual performance awards accrued but not yet paid in respect of the year ended 30 september 2002.
2   other compensation is determined on the basis of the cost to westpac and includes notional surchargeable superannuation contributions (as determined by the plan’s actuary)
    for those executives who are members of the staff superannuation plan, housing and other benefits (such as commencement incentives, relocation costs and separation
    payments) and all fringe benefits tax.
3   the options granted during the year were granted with a 10-year term pursuant to the general management share option plan, under which the number of options exercisable
    depends on performance against prescribed performance hurdles. the fair value of options granted has been estimated using pricing models which incorporate factors
    including the term, the risk free interest rate, volatility of the share price, the dividend yield and a discount factor to reflect the probability of reaching the performance hurdles.
    the grant of options first exercisable in march 2005, may 2005 and august 2005 have been assessed at $2.23, $2.30 and $2.29 respectively.
4   the number of performance options and performance share rights to be granted under the new westpac performance plan has been estimated as part of the year end
    performance review. the indicative value for performance options is $2.39 and for performance share rights is $8.48.
note:
   this table discloses remuneration for the six most highly paid senior executives involved in the management of westpac’s affairs. other individuals who are rewarded under
   incentive-based systems according to results, consistent with market practice within the industry, may within any given year, receive remuneration at a level in excess of that
   received by some executives shown.

notes:
1   the above statements of financial performance extracts for 2002, 2001 and 2000 and statements of financial position extract for 2002 and 2001 are derived from the
    consolidated financial statements included in this report, and for prior years are derived from financial statements previously published, each of which have been presented
    in accordance with australian gaap.
2   we have entered into various tax effective financing transactions that derive income that is subject to either a reduced or zero rate of income tax. the impact of this is reflected
    in lower income tax expense and interest income. in order to provide improved comparability, this income is presented on a tax equivalent basis.
3   for reporting periods ending on or after 30 june 2001, we are no longer permitted (under australian gaap) to disclose abnormal items on the face of the statement of financial
    performance. where a revenue or expense is of such a size, nature or incidence that its disclosure is relevant in explaining our financial performance, we are required to
    disclose its nature and amount on the face of the statement of financial performance or in the notes to the financial statements.

under legislation effective from 1 july 2002, the franking account is to be maintained on an australian income tax paid basis rather than on australian taxed profit basis as was
previously the case. in accordance with this legislation, the franking account balances as at 30 june 2002 are converted so that the opening balances on 1 july 2002 reflects the
australian income tax paid amounts. amounts debited to the franking account in respect of dividends paid after 30 june 2002 are the franking credits attaching to those dividends
rather than the gross amount of the dividends. the 2002, 2001 and 2000 franking account balances disclosed above have been determined on an australian income tax paid basis.
