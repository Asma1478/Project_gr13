     message from                                    as i had shared with you last year, our practice of reporting our sustainability performance was triggered by an investor who asked
                                                     us, eight years ago, if we had a triple bottom line report. that made us realise that it is not enough to act sustainably; we must also
     chairman & managing director                    let people know about it. and we have been doing so ever since. so it is a pleasure to share with you the strides that we have
                                                     made on the triple bottom line parameters of profits, people and planet since the last report.

                                                     our focus last year was on institutionalising sustainability by adopting customised roadmaps for major businesses, and creating a
                                                     tighter fit between sustainability and the businesses. this year we have gone one step further and integrated the brand philosophy
                                                     of rise with our sustainability journey.

                                                     the current narrative on sustainability emphasises limits - how resources which were once in abundance are now limited; how we
                                                     have breached the limits of the natural ecosystems; how there are limits to growth, limits to economies of scale, limits to human

     diversity & inclusion
     diversity instils vibrancy. in recognition of the growing relevance of diversity
     and inclusion (d&i) at the workplace, mahindra group has formed group and
     sector-level diversity councils. these councils aim to provide strategic
     direction to initiate and fuel the d&i journey, and harness the power of
     diversity cutting across gender, physical abilities and race.

 starting this year, we have revised the reporting
 format of mahindra's sustainability performance.
 while sustainability performance of m&m (auto &
 farm sector) has been reported individually in line
 with gri g4 guidelines, the sustainability highlights of
 all the subsidiaries and associates of m&m have been
 captured in a separate section. the reason for this
 change in presentation is not just alignment with the
 new g4 guidelines but also enhanced comparability
 of sector performance. some of our subsidiaries like
 mahindra lifespaces and mahindra finance are
 already publishing their individual reports.

single axis tracking system
trackers helps improve efficiency, still they have not been widely deployed in
the solar industry. most developers have reservations regarding reliability,
installation and environmental suitability of trackers. mahindra susten has
developed in-house horizontal single axis tracker (msat-100) which
overcomes traditional disadvantages of using trackers.
