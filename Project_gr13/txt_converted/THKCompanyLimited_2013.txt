       introduction

       from the very start, the thk group (usually referred to in
       these pages simply as thk) has always conducted its op-
       erations faithfully and conscientiously, with the aim of con-
       tributing to society through its core business activities.
          this year’s thk csr report includes a feature section
       focusing on thk’s efforts to honor its corporate social re-
       sponsibilities in two key areas. the ﬁrst part, which re-
       counts the experiences of people who rely on thk’s seis-
       mic isolation systems, stresses the vital importance of
       being prepared for the ever-present danger of a major
       earthquake. the second part examines various measures
       adopted by thk in order to conserve electricity in the after-
       math of the great east japan earthquake, and the results
       achieved. the feature section ends with a look at the expe-
       riences of thk employees who have volunteered to help
       with post-quake reconstruction work.
          the section entitled “management system” includes a
       discussion of risk management efforts, while “involvement
       in society” focuses on thk’s relationships with its various
       stakeholders. “harmony with the environment” examines
       thk’s environmental initiatives in ﬁscal 2011 and presents
       some quantitative results.
          the thk csr report is an essential tool for communi-
       cating with everyone who is connected in any way to thk
       and its activities. reader comments and feedback will be
       greatly appreciated—please take the time to ﬁll out the
       enclosed questionnaire.

thk’s seismic isolation systems incorporate two of its principle products, lm guides and ball screws. there are two basic
types of systems, one designed to protect buildings and one designed to protect equipment. once they are installed, seismic
isolation systems can deﬂect earthquake vibrations, safeguarding buildings and equipment.
