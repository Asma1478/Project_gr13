                                  i’m pleased to present the union of concerned scientists’ sixth annual sustainability report,
                                  which covers our fiscal year 2012 (october 2011–september 2012). this report marks our
                                  tenth year of measuring and reporting our carbon emissions. a lot has changed from a sus-
                                  tainability perspective over the past decade; today, as a result of regular meetings with our
                                  analytical staff and ongoing partnerships with peer organizations, we have been able to not
                                  only fine-tune our reporting methodology for more accurate data analysis, but also explore
                                  new initiatives to further reduce our environmental impact. our efforts are detailed in
                                  the pages that follow.

                                  our internal sustainability work is a natural extension of the work we do to promote change at
                                  the regional, national, and international levels. during this reporting period, we launched our
                                  center for science and democracy with a lewis m. branscomb forum dedicated to improving
                                  citizen access to governmental scientific information (visit www.ucsusa.org/scienceanddemocracy
                                  to learn more); we also launched our half the oil campaign (www.ucsusa.org/halftheoil),
                                  designed to cut projected u.s. oil use by 50 percent by 2035. we witnessed the closure of
                                  chicago’s two coal-burning power plants on the heels of our ripe for retirement report, and
                                  the strengthening of california policies that promote the development of zero-emissions
                                  vehicles and clean electricity resources. additionally, our nuclear experts met with the nuclear
                                  regulatory commission to present lessons learned from the fukushima daiichi nuclear
                                  disaster in march 2011, which can be applied here at home to make u.s. nuclear power
                                  plants safer and more secure.

                                  many of our external successes also affect our office environment, and that of offices every-
                                  where, such as our efforts to clean the electricity grid and improve fuel efficiency. we look
                                  forward to building on these successes—both in our office and around the country—in the
                                  years ahead. visit www.ucsusa.org for the latest news and updates on our work, and learn

    assessing carbon emissions from other travel modes

    business travel by passenger vehicle is the second-largest
    source of business-travel-related carbon emissions. emis-
    sions in this area have improved significantly in recent years,
    dropping from 25 metric tons co2e to 5 metric tons co2e
    between cy11 and fy12. the use of new business travel data
    collection software from concur, an online travel and expense
    management service, may have partially contributed to the
    reduction in reported emissions by more accurately captur-
    ing vehicle travel compared with past reporting methods.
    in addition to providing data we can use for calculating travel-
    related emissions, concur allows staff to quantify and com-
    pare the carbon emissions of their travel options. although
    concur does not track amtrak, bus, taxi, or subway travel,
    which was captured in the past, business-related travel from
    these sources was negligible in previous years (accounting         utilizing video conference services allows ucs staff to participate collaboratively
    for less than 2 percent of total business travel emissions).       in organizational discussions without needing to fly to other offices.

to further increase employees’ awareness of their travel emis-
sions and help them make informed decisions. for example,
we are exploring partnerships with peer nonprofits and
businesses to ask the airline industry to provide consumers
with information about the carbon emissions of their flight
options. and, as ucs continues to use the concur travel
program, staff will explore how to better utilize its features
to help choose lower-carbon travel options.


emissions from employee commuting
given the nature of our work, ucs employees are predis-
posed to factor environmental sustainability into their per-
sonal decision making. in fy12, 64 percent of all employee
commutes utilized low- or no-carbon forms of transportation
such as bikes and trains. as a result, total commuting-related
emissions decreased by more than 6.6 percent from cy11            ucs staff en route to our washington, dc, office. about half of ucs staff bike
