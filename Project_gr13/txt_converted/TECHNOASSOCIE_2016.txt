*1 coefficient of co2 emissions is in accordance with the “ministry of the environment: draft ver. 1.6 of guidelines for calculation method of greenhouse gas emission by entities.”
*2 electricity means the electricity purchased from the electric company.
*3 gasoline and light oil are used for company vehicles and do not include consumption by consignment to transportation companies.
*4 self-evaluation standards:
   co2 emissions and final disposal rate      = achieved targets      = although targets were not achieved, emissions reduced from previous year       ＝ targets were not achieved and emissions increased from previous year
   environmentally friendly products          = achieved targets      = although targets were not achieved, share increased from previous year       ＝ targets were not achieved and share decreased from previous year

the use of electricity and gasoline by techno associe accounts for                                   techno associe strives to save energy by turning off lights during
about 97% of the company’s total co2 emissions. we are therefore                                     employee break times, keeping air conditioners set at reasonable
focusing on reducing the use of these.                                                               temperatures, and holding ‘no overtime’ days to encourage work
     our target for fiscal 2015 was to reduce co2 emissions by 1%                                    efficiency.
over the previous fiscal year, and to this end we switched to led                                          our target for fiscal 2015 was to reduce electricity consumption
lighting and made work processes more efficient in order to save                                     by 1% over the previous fiscal year, and thanks to replacing
electricity. we also reduced the number of company cars and                                          mercury lamps with 353 led lights in warehouses at five bases, we
switched them to more fuel-efficient vehicles. as a result of these                                  were able to reduce electricity consumption by 258,600 kwh.
aggressive efforts, emissions were 1,486.9 tons (down 12.6% over                                     overall electricity consumption was down by 374,900 kwh (down
the previous fiscal year), easily meeting our target. we are aiming for                              11.2% over the previous fiscal year, of which 7.7% comes from
a 2% emissions reduction in fiscal 2016.                                                             switching to led lighting). we are continuing to install led lighting

                                  also work to reduce risk. for example, box cutters are used frequently in the
    chikara imafuku               warehouse, and employees have gotten incision wounds in the past. in
    facility management           response, we have switched to safety cutters and created unified safety
    representative,               standards for performing cutting work. these efforts will of course benefit the
    kyushu office
                                  kyushu office, but i believe that, via the hr & administration department, they
                                  will also contribute to reducing risk throughout all of techno associe.
