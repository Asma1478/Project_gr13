    the iino group’s history dates all the way back to 1899,
    when forerunner iino shokai was established at maizuru port (kyoto) to transport coal by barge.
    during its 112 years in business, the company has developed a thriving marine shipping business,
    alongside which its real estate operations have developed into a second core business.
    iino’s shipping business operates a fleet of more than 100 vessels, including oil tankers, chemical tankers,
    gas tankers, and bulk carriers, engaged in worldwide transport of a variety of cargoes
    that are essential to modern life and economic activity.
    iino’s real estate business provides comfortable office environments
    to tenants of its six office buildings in central tokyo. our properties include the iino building,
    which is under reconstruction toward completion in autumn 2011.

    next, please explain the specific policies of the new
    medium-term plan, ieg14. the plan’s theme is “growth and         you noted that bulk carrier profitability has increased, so do
    evolution”, and you have established “reformation”,              you intend to make that business line your third growth
    “stabilization” and “growth” as the plan’s three pillars
    based on five cornerstone action goals, starting with
    “bolster resilience to market fluctuations” (see diagram on
    page 4). under “reformation”, the plan calls for
    restructuring of the chemical tanker division. what specific
    measures are planned?

    chemical tanker shipping is our group’s core business, and
    the previous medium-term plan aimed to further grow our
    chemical tanker operations. we expect demand for marine
    transport using chemical tankers will continue to expand
    globally and therefore plan to further strengthen these
    operations under our new plan. the iino group’s core route
    is the middle east – far east route, where we command a
    world-leading share of shipping volumes for petrochemical
    products. we intend to build upon this strength and further
    expand our market leading share.
    the iino group aims to build a solid operating base that will
    enable not just its chemical tanker business but its entire
    oceangoing shipping operations to perform stably despite
    fluctuations in such external factors as freight rates and
    exchange rates. specifically, the new plan aims to boost
    profitability through such measures as reducing unprofitable
    vessels, using of larger vessels on specific routes, and
    enhancing transport efficiency. for example, to enhance

                  division                                                                                  overview of business


                             the division operates a fleet comprised of tankers including 300,000-dwt-class very large
                             crude carriers (vlcc), medium- and small-sized crude oil tankers, and product tankers

oil tanker                   (petroleum products).
                             most of the vessels are used to transport crude oil and petroleum products on routes around
                             the world on medium- to- long-term contracts. to help protect the marine environment, the
                             division’s entire fleet is double-hulled.



                             the division’s fleet is one of the industry’s largest. the fleet includes chemical tankers with
                             stainless steel tanks and dedicated methanol tankers. the division taps advanced vessel

chemical tanker              management know-how required for the transport of petrochemical products to transport
                             petrochemical products, vegetable oil, methanol, and other products on routes around the
                             world. the division has a leading market share in the transport of petrochemical products




                                                                                                                                           operating review
                             particularly on the middle east to asia route.



                             the division’s fleet comprises mainly refrigerated large gas tankers and transports liquefied
                             petroleum gas (lpg) and liquefied natural gas (lng). the division’s lpg tankers transport

large gas tanker             lpg on medium- to long-term contracts, mainly to the far east, and are also engaged in the
                             transport of ammonia and other petrochemical gases. the division participates in
                             japan-bound and trilateral joint lng transport projects, and also manages an lng vessel for
                             the korea gas corporation.



                             the division’s fleet comprises a diverse range of vessels including large to small-sized bulk
                             carriers as well as wood chip carriers. it transports products such as coal for electric power

bulk carrier                 generation, steel, fertilizers, and wood chips. the division finely tunes services to meet
                             customers’ differing needs depending on cargo. it provides dedicated vessels for the
                             transport of coal and wood chips that are integral to customers’ stable transportation
                             systems, and it also provides flexible transport of fertilizers using small bulk carriers.



                             the division’s fleet comprises mainly pressurized small gas tankers and transports fuel gases
                             such as lng and lpg, and petrochemical gases such as propylene and vinyl chloride

small gas tanker             monomers (vcm) in japanese coastal waters and adjacent waters including east asia and
                             southeast asia. the division ranks among the leaders in terms of share of domestic transport
                             of lpg and petrochemical gases, and boasts one of the largest operations in adjacent
                             waters. the division also operates one of the few lng tankers in japanese coastal waters.




                             having begun with the completion of the old iino building in 1960, the division currently owns
real estate and              six office buildings in the heart of tokyo (including the iino building which is scheduled to go
leasing                      into operation in autumn 2011). the division provides comfortable office space, offering
                             integrated services from planning to operation, management, and maintenance.




                             the division operates two photo studios and two retouching offices in central tokyo and also

real estate                  has an office in london. based in these two cities, it not only provides photography studios
                             but also handles graphic design, photo retouching, and other services through its enhanced
related business             creative division, thereby providing integrated support from photography and production
                             through to delivery.



                                 notes: revenues for each division include intra-group sales, so the aggregate of divisional
                                        revenues does not equate with consolidated revenue.

     demand for crude oil from china and other emerging market
     economies rises.
     the product tanker market has recovered from the 2008
     post-lehman crisis, and demand from petrochemical raw
     materials is growing in china and some other areas.
     tonnage overcapacity continues to be a problem,
     however, with the influx of newly built medium-range
     tankers, the predominant type, outstripping demand. as
     fewer newbuilds are completed in 2012 and beyond,

     we secured stable earnings from both large lpg and large
     lng tankers by deploying the fleets onto medium- and
     long-term contracts. we also managed to renew shipping
     contracts on favorable terms during the year. additionally,

     shipbuilding prices, we secured medium- and long-term
     contracts for newly built large lpg tankers.


     fiscal 2011 outlook
     with only a limited number of newbuilds entering the market
     despite the anticipated scrapping of superannuated vessels,
     large lpg tanker freight rates should remain firm as the
     supply-demand balance tightens. the latest, highly

       safety and environmental management in the real estate business



     safety, quality, and environmental management initiatives
     our real estate business engages in safety and environmental initiatives. while maintaining safety and amenity within buildings, we
     practice quality management to ensure customer satisfaction. we also engage in environmental management to reduce buildings’
     environmental footprints. specific measures include those to reduce energy consumption and waste emissions at our buildings.
     building management is carried out by iino building technology co., ltd. (ibt). these safety and environmental initiatives will also
     be incorporated into operation of the iino building, which will open its doors in tokyo’s uchisaiwaicho district in autumn 2011.
     the table below summarizes ibt’s attainment level for its safety and environmental management program targets for 2010
     alongside targets for 2011. two of the iino group’s real estate business companies have obtained combined iso 9001/14001
     certification: iino lines (property business group) and ibt.

       notes to consolidated financial statements



     iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (iino lines) and its consolidated subsidiaries

     notes to consolidated financial statements

     1. basis of presentation of the consolidated financial statements
     the accompanying consolidated financial statements of iino kaiun kaisha, ltd. (the “company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the
     “companies”) are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in japan. the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared
     by the company as required under the financial instrument exchange law of japan.

     certain items presented in the consolidated financial statements submitted to the director of the kanto finance bureau in japan have been reclassified for the
     convenience of readers outside of japan.


     2. summary of significant accounting policies

     a. basis of consolidation
     the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its 49 significant subsidiaries in 2011 (45 in 2010).

     the other subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation since, in aggregate, the combined total assets, net sales, net income, and retained earnings of these
     subsidiaries do not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the companies.

     for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, all significant intercompany transactions, account balances, and unrealized profits among
     the companies have been eliminated.


     b. equity method
     investments in significant affiliates are accounted for under the equity method as of march 31, 2011 and 2010.

     investments in the remaining 14 non-consolidated subsidiaries and 2 affiliates of the company are stated at cost on march 31, 2011 (13 non-consolidated
     subsidiaries and 2 affiliates on march 31, 2010) since the company’s equity in their net income (loss), on aggregate, does not have a material effect on the
     consolidated financial statements.


     c. fiscal periods of consolidated subsidiaries
     the accounts of the consolidated subsidiaries, except for serpent’s mouth carriers s. a. and 6 other subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends are december 31, are
     prepared as of the same date as the consolidated financial statements. the aforementioned 7 subsidiaries with differing financial years are included in the
     consolidated financial statements based on their accounts as of december 31 (their fiscal year ends), and necessary adjustments for significant transactions
     during the period between their fiscal year ends and the consolidated balance sheet date are reflected in the consolidated financial statements.


     d. foreign currency translation
     all monetary assets and liabilities of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into japanese
     yen at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. the foreign exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the statements of
     income to the extent that they are not hedged by forward exchange contracts. revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates of the
     respective periods.
     foreign currency translation of foreign subsidiaries follows the accounting policy of the company and its domestic subsidiaries as permitted under japanese
     generally accepted accounting principles for foreign subsidiaries located in tax-haven jurisdictions.


     e. vessel operating revenues and related costs
     vessel operating revenues and related costs are recognised using the percentage-of-completion method.


     f. income taxes
     the provision for income taxes is computed based on “income before corporate income taxes” in the consolidated statements of operations. the asset and
     liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
     amounts and the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for tax purposes.

g. net income and dividends per share
net income per share of common stock is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year, appropriately
adjusted for stock splits during the year.

cash dividends per common share shown for each year in the accompanying statements of operations represent dividends approved as applicable to the
respective year.

net income is adjusted by deducting bonuses paid to directors as well as the payment of dividends to shareholders of preferred stocks to be recognized as an
appropriation of retained earnings, and the calculation of net income per share is made on that adjusted net income basis.


h. cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of cash in hand, bank deposits able to be withdrawn on demand, and
marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less and which represent a minor risk of fluctuation in value.


i. marketable securities and investment securities
equity securities classified as “other securities” (available-for-sale securities) for which market quotations are available, are stated at fair market value. net
unrealized gains or losses on these securities are reported as a separate item in other comprehensive income at a net-of-tax amount and carried as accumulated
other comprehensive income. equity and debt securities classified as “other securities” (available-for-sale-securities) for which market quotations are not
available, are stated at amortized cost or acquisition cost calculated using the weighted average method.


j. derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
in accordance with the “accounting standard for financial instruments” and the “guidelines for accounting for financial instruments”, gains or losses arising
from changes in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts designated as “hedging instruments”
are reported as a separate item in other comprehensive income and carried as accumulated other comprehensive income until the profits and losses on the
hedged items or transactions are recognized.

in addition, net cash flows from interest rate swap agreements which meet certain criteria under the accounting standard, are offset against or added to the
interest arising from the hedged interest-bearing debt.

in addition, designation (“furiate-shori”) is applied to forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts designated as hedging instruments under
certain criteria.

derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market, and the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative instruments are
charged or credited to current earnings.


k. allowance for doubtful accounts
an allowance for doubtful accounts is generally provided at an amount calculated using the bad debt loss ratio, primarily based on past experience, plus the
estimated uncollectible amount of specific receivables.


l. inventories
real estates held for sale are stated at cost, determined using the specific cost method and the real estate held for sale with lower profitability are written down
for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet. other inventories are stated at cost, determined using the first-in first-out method and other inventories
with lower profitability are written down for the purpose of reporting on the balance sheet.
                                                                                                                                                                            key financial data

     m. depreciation and amortization
     tangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
     vessels, property and equipment, including significant capital expenditures and additions, are stated at cost. maintenance and repairs are charged to
     income as incurred.

     depreciation of vessels is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as designated by the japanese income tax laws.
     depreciation of buildings (except for those acquired on or after april 1, 1998; excluding building fixtures) and other equipment is computed using the
     declining-balance method. depreciation of buildings acquired on or after april 1, 1998 is computed using the straight-line method in accordance with the
     revision of the japanese income tax law in 1998.

     intangible fixed assets (excluding lease assets):
     amortization of intangible assets is primarily computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as designated by the japanese
     income tax laws. software for internal use are depreciated using the straight-line method over the period of estimated use (5 years).

     lease assets:
     finance lease transactions that transfer the ownership are capitalized and accounted for as ordinary sales transactions.
     finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership are capitalized and depreciated by using the straight-line method over the lease term of the assets
     with no residual value.
     finance lease transactions that do not transfer the ownership, which commenced prior to april 1, 2008, are accounted for as ordinary lease transactions.


     n. accrued employees’ pension and severance costs
     accrued employees’ pension and severance costs under the defined benefit plans of the companies are determined based on the actuarial present value of
     projected benefit obligations at year end, calculated by applying the plan’s benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date, and the fair value of plan
     assets at year end.


     o. reserve for retirement benefits to directors and statutory auditors
     a reserve for retirement benefits to directors and statutory auditors is provided for at the amount which would have been paid based on the companies’
     internal policies, if all eligible directors and statutory auditors had retired at the balance sheet date.
     effective from the shareholders’ meeting of the company, held on june 28, 2006, the company abolished the retirement benefit plan for directors and
     statutory auditors. accordingly, the company recognized the liabilities for retirement benefit for directors and statutory auditors until the shareholders’
     meeting on june 28, 2006, which would be paid up on their retirement, as other non-current liabilities.


     p. reserve for periodic overhaul of vessels
     under japanese law, the vessels of the companies are subject to periodic overhaul. japanese law requires that vessels be overhauled every five years. the
     companies provide for the estimated cost of the future periodic overhaul of vessels.


     q. appropriation of retained earnings
     the corporation law of japan provides that an amount equal to 10% of distribution of surplus (aggregate of capital surplus and retained earnings) must be
     appropriated as a legal reserve or as capital reserve depending on which surplus is distributed, until the total of such reserve and additional capital reserve
     equals 25% of capital.


     r. change in accounting policies
     (adoption of accounting standard for presentation of comprehensive income)
     effective from the fiscal year ended march 31, 2011, along with the companies’ adoption of the “accounting standard for the presentation of comprehensive
     income” (asbj statement no.25), items previously reported as revaluation and translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income and
     carried as accumulated other comprehensive income until underlying assets/liabilities are derecognized.

since there should not be significant amounts of differences between the book values and fair values. available-for-sale securities are measured at fair value
based on the market quotations. the fair value of long-term borrowings is based on the discounted cash flow of its interests and principals by
incremental borrowing rate.

     6. derivative financial instruments

     in the normal course of business, the companies employ forward exchange contracts to manage their exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates
     in respect of receivables and payables. in addition, the companies use interest rate swap agreements to limit their exposure to loss in relation to underlying
     debt resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates. the companies do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.


     there are no derivative instruments outstanding to which hedge accounting is not applied.

 communication



message from the editorial office
we offer our sincerest sympathies to all those affected by the march 11 earthquake in japan, and
we immensely appreciate the support of the many people who made this 2011 iino report possible
despite the disaster.
we have issued this report to communicate information to our stakeholders on a wide range of
matters, from iino group business strategies to csr initiatives. from 2009, the iino group
combined its until-then separate annual report and safety and environmental report into the iino
report, a single report that describes all group activities. this is the third iino report. since
integrating the reports, we have strived to ensure continuity of reporting and have collated the
voluminous data in a largely uniform way. we also feel that the standing of and expectations
vis-à-vis environmental accounting and csr reports have changed considerably.
we look forward to receiving your thoughts and opinions about this report, which we hope to use
to improve the iino group’s operations and csr initiatives and as a valuable reference when
preparing future reports.
