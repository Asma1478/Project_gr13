a year of dialogue and development
we want to be a leading alcohol beverage company in the nordic and
baltic regions, also when it comes to corporate responsibility. for us,
responsibility is both a strategic priority and a success factor in business.
we are increasingly engaging in dialogue on responsibility with our
partners, suppliers and customers. our efforts in the area of
responsibility build sustainable long-term business for altia.




at altia, responsibility is part of everything we do — from the executive management team’s
agenda to brainstorming by the product development team and the planning of our marketing.
in 2015, we took significant steps forward in our work on responsibility.

the koskenkorva bioenergy power plant celebrated its first anniversary in november. it has
reduced the carbon dioxide emissions of the koskenkorva production plant by as much as 35
percent. finnish barley finds a wide variety of uses at our plant. it is a valuable raw material
that we utilize almost completely in our production operations.

at the grand opening of the bioenergy power plant, i emphasized how proud i am of the high
level of fuel self-sufficiency of the plant’s steam generation, which is expected to be as high as




9

altia’s responsibility report 2015



65 percent. that sense of pride is still strong, as the bioenergy power plant represents a
profitable investment that is a significant part of altia’s future. it is a major step for us, but we
have also taken many smaller steps forward in other areas of our operations.

responsible alcohol consumption
altia is a significant operator in society. we pay a substantial amount of taxes in our operating
countries, we make investments, we create stability and jobs, and we work together with other
operators to promote a responsible drinking culture.

we are committed to responsible alcohol consumption and its development in all of our
operating countries. through our actions, we want to set an example for other operators in our
industry. we participate in campaigns to promote a responsible drinking culture in our various
market areas.

we respect the right of adults to consume alcoholic beverages, or to choose not to consume
them. most adults consume alcoholic beverages in moderation in various social settings. we
take the negative impacts of alcohol abuse seriously, and we believe society must prevent them
through sensible regulation. we are strongly against alcohol consumption by minors.

transparency through communication and stakeholders
this responsibility report marks the first time that we discuss our corporate responsibility
objectives and our progress with respect to them.

our stakeholders’ views regarding our responsibility are of essential importance to us in the
development of our operations. in may, we conducted our second stakeholder survey on
responsibility. the materiality analysis carried out based on the survey highlighted nine key
themes that we will focus on in this report.

employee well-being and good leadership are among our three most important responsibility
themes. i am pleased to say that the results of altia’s annual personnel survey showed a
significant improvement. during the year, we have focused on leadership development and
increased communication by our management.

responsibility goes hand in hand with transparency. in 2015, we increased our stakeholder




10

altia’s responsibility report 2015



dialogue in various ways, including the launch of our twitter account, @altiafi, which
provides us with a platform for dialogue with our audience and open communications about
our operations.

another change that promotes greater transparency is the whistleblower channel we
introduced during the year. it offers our personnel a secure channel for reporting conduct that
is in breach of our business principles.

responsible product development and local production
altia buys barley mainly from 1,500 contract farmers for use at the koskenkorva distillery. we
have signed the baltic sea action group (bsag) commitment. in accordance with the
commitment, we encourage farmers to use environmentally friendly practices in agriculture.
we also made a concurrent commitment to reducing our water consumption. we favor local
production whenever possible.

responsibility is an important consideration in our product development. we launched non-
alcoholic wines during the year, and we are also developing our selection of organic and
fairtrade wines. the rajamäki plant also received certification in 2015 for bottling fairtrade
wines. we launched our first product manufactured from organic grain spirit produced at
koskenkorva and finnish organic blueberries: the rooftop garden organic blueberry ginger
liqueur.

product quality and safety is the most important theme for our stakeholders as well as everyone
at altia. responsibility is a key aspect of our product development and the development of our
portfolio of partner brands. we believe it will also provide a competitive advantage for altia
going forward.

i hope you enjoy reading our report!

pekka tennilä, ceo

                   altia's approach




15

altia’s responsibility report 2015




business environment and altia’s strategy
altia is the leading producer and importer of alcoholic beverages in the
nordic and baltic countries. our competitors include major
international beverage industry players, nordic companies, local
importers and small local producers. we value diversity, as it enriches
the industry and helps shift drinking culture from a focus on quantity
to a focus on quality.

strategy development in progress
altia’s long-term focus is on profitable growth. profitable growth is sought by implementing
the company’s current strategy, which extends to 2016. its focus areas are brands, innovation,
customer insight and leadership development. altia has also begun to develop its strategy 2020
in a broad-based effort within the organization. the new strategy 2020 will be a seamless
extension of the strategy being implemented at present.

as part of the development of strategy 2020, altia has defined the company’s purpose, let’s
drink better, which is related to the development of drinking culture in our market areas. our
purpose combines our nordic heritage with innovation as we contribute to a more responsible
drinking culture. a better drinking culture is social, environmentally friendly, innovative,
experience-oriented and moderate. it focuses on quality instead of quantity.

we engaged our personnel to generate and discuss ideas on what our purpose could mean for
altia’s business. the response was fantastic, with more than 700 ideas and 2,500 comments
received. the executive management team has reviewed all of the ideas and they will be
implemented gradually over several stages.

the approach based on responsibility and better drinking culture represents a significant
business opportunity for altia. profitable long-term growth is built from sustainable business
operations and the development of a responsible and diverse drinking culture.

altia’s responsibility report 2015



economic climate remains weak
the economic climate in the food, retail, travel and restaurant industries remains weaker than
average. this is also reflected on the beverage industry. the markets for alcoholic beverages are
stagnant or declining in all of our operating countries, and competition is intense.

nevertheless, altia has been successful in capturing market share in several product categories
in spite of the difficult market situation. in marketing, altia has focused on insight into the
nordic consumer, as well as brand building. in product development, attention has been
shifted even further towards responsibility and new innovations that create added value.
examples of this include fair trade and organic products launched during the year, as well as
non-alcoholic and lower-alcohol beverages, which are increasingly sought by consumers.

altia also took significant strides forward in improving the efficiency of its operations with
regard to production as well as the supply chain. the koskenkorva distillery, for example,
operates at full capacity every day of the year, and the high efficiency creates a cost advantage.

continued digitalization
digitalization is a strong trend, also in the alcoholic beverage industry. consumers in the eu
buy alcoholic beverages remotely from online stores. online sales remain relatively minor and
focused on enthusiasts. nevertheless, e-commerce represents a significant trend in consumer
behavior that domestic operators should be able to respond to.

international competitors are currently able to fully utilize social media channels and e-
commerce, even towards finnish consumers. at the same time, domestic operators are partly
prohibited by law from participating in this competition in finland.

the problem of gray imports
the nordic countries are characterized by strict legislation and taxation of the alcohol industry,
while in our other operating countries, latvia and estonia, the markets are more liberal. the
border trade and gray imports are nevertheless a common feature of all of our operating
countries. they are a significant problem in finland, sweden and estonia, for example. in
finland, the value of gray imports exceeds the total sales of the entire restaurant industry.
denmark represents the opposite example; it has achieved a decrease in gray imports by




17

altia’s responsibility report 2015



reducing taxes on alcohol.

a comprehensive reform of finnish alcohol legislation began in 2015. the process will
continue in 2016 and new legislation is expected to enter into force at the beginning of 2017.
we hope that the legislative changes will make it easier for finnish companies in the alcohol
industry to operate and pursue success in export markets.

altia’s responsibility report 2015




steering of altia’s responsibility work
altia’s responsibility work is guided by altia’s strategy, stakeholders’
expectations, our business principles and other internal principles and
guidelines, as well as the ethical principles of the business social
compliance initiative.
responsibility topics that affect altia as a whole are addressed by altia’s corporate
responsibility working group, whose ten members represent different parts of the
organization. the working group reports to the executive management team. it is chaired by
the senior vice president for commercial operations, who is also a member of the executive
management team.

based on a proposal by the working group, the executive management team annually
approves the actions to be implemented in the following year.

the actions supporting altia’s responsibility are part of each business’ operational plans and
their implementation is monitored in the respective management teams.

performance is monitored with the help of various indicators including, for example, five
different environmental indicators from the amount of waste material to water and energy
consumption, the sickness absence rate and the accident rate, as well as personnel surveys.

altia’s communications department is in charge of the coordination, development and
reporting of corporate responsibility efforts.




22

altia’s responsibility report 2015




stakeholder interaction and materiality
analysis
our stakeholders’ perceptions regarding our responsibility are of
essential importance to us. they help us develop and prioritize our
operations. we want to be a leading alcohol company also when it
comes to responsibility.
we aim to communicate our operations to our stakeholders in an open and transparent
manner. we developed our stakeholder communications by launching altia’s twitter account,
@altiafi, in september 2015.

in addition to day-to-day stakeholder interaction, we evaluated our stakeholders’ perceptions
regarding our responsibility by conducting our second comprehensive stakeholder survey.
according to the results of the survey, the themes related to altia’s responsibility cornerstones
perceived as the most important by stakeholders are product quality and safety, employee well-
being, and good leadership.

we conducted a materiality analysis based on the results of the stakeholder survey and our
internal assessments, and we also produced our first-ever materiality matrix. of the
responsibility cornerstone themes, nine were highlighted as the most material aspects of our
responsibility.

responsibility cornerstones




24

altia’s responsibility report 2015




stakeholder interaction
stakeholder survey: product quality and safety is the most important
aspect.
in may 2015, we conducted our second stakeholder survey on responsibility to assess our
stakeholders’ views on the responsibility cornerstones that guide our responsibility efforts and
to support the development of our work in the area of responsibility.

the most important themes among our responsibility cornerstones, as highlighted by our
stakeholders, were product safety and quality, employee well-being, good leadership,
responsible marketing and the use of responsibly produced raw materials. product quality and
safety was also highlighted as the most important theme in our first stakeholder survey
conducted in 2013.

the least important themes according to the respondents were our measures to reduce water
consumption and protect groundwater and to minimize environmental impacts by reducing
waste volume and developing packaging.

domestic ownership, production and raw materials was highlighted as the most important
theme in the responses to an open-ended question at the beginning of the survey to gauge
respondents’ opinions on what altia should focus on in its responsibility efforts.

overall, the responses of the various stakeholder groups regarding the order of priority of the
responsibility cornerstone themes were very similar.

our contract farmers highlighted the price we pay for barley, which was characterized as being
too low and unfair. altia’s barley pricing is influenced by the prices of grain in the world
market, and particularly by the development of the market prices of wheat and barley in the
eu’s internal market. altia’s public market price for barley is competitive compared to other
public barley prices.

some of the survey results support the conclusion that the level of awareness among our
stakeholders regarding our responsibility efforts is not yet high enough, which presents us with
a good opportunity to develop our communications on responsibility via various channels.




25

altia’s responsibility report 2015



invitations to participate in the survey were sent by e-mail to 2,238 stakeholder representatives
in our operating countries, and a link to the survey was also posted on the company website.
we received a total of 238 responses.

the largest respondent group was suppliers at 27 percent, followed by personnel. as expected,
the majority of the responses came from finland (61 percent).

we have not received any other direct feedback in our operating countries with regard to the
development of our responsibility efforts, aside from the results of the stakeholder survey.

materiality analysis
we conducted our second stakeholder survey on responsibility in may
2015. we sent a link to the survey to 2,238 representatives of different
stakeholder groups, and the link was also posted on our website. we
received a total of 238 responses.
we reviewed the results of the stakeholder survey in our corporate responsibility working
group, which is comprised of 10 members representing different business areas. the working
group is led by the senior vice president for commercial operations, who is also a member of
altia’s executive management team.

in addition to the results of the stakeholder survey, the core group of the working group
discussed the impacts of global megatrends and trends related to the development of
responsibility in the alcohol industry on the cornerstones of our responsibility, and also
reviewed the categories and aspects of the international gri reporting framework to ensure that
our responsibility cornerstones are sufficiently comprehensive.

the core group of the corporate responsibility working group is led by the senior vice
president for commercial operations, who is also a member of altia’s executive management
team, with the other core team members being the product development and sourcing
director, who is responsible for the altia and customers cornerstone; the category director
for spirits, who is responsible for the altia and society cornerstone; the hseq manager, who
is responsible for altia and the environment; and the director of leadership and culture, who
is responsible for the altia and employees cornerstone.

based on the analysis, we revised our responsibility cornerstones slightly with regard to the titles
and content of their themes, as well as the themes’ grouping and location under the
cornerstones.

we produced also our first responsibility materiality matrix. the material aspects included nine
themes, which are the focus of our report.

our executive management team approved the updated responsibility cornerstones and the
materiality matrix.

background of the responsibility program
in 2013, we conducted our first survey to gauge our stakeholders’ expectations regarding altia’s
responsibility.

the materiality analysis conducted during the same year consisted of the stakeholder survey,
interviews of representatives of altia’s business areas and an evaluation of altia’s responsibility
work in relation to competitors. in the materiality analysis we defined the priorities of altia’s
responsibility work – altia’s responsibility cornerstones.

based on the responsibility cornerstones, we created an action plan in late 2014 for developing
our corporate responsibility in the coming years. we are now reporting on the progress of these
objectives for the first time.

                             water consumption relative to production volume decreased at every

responsibility cornerstones
altia’s responsibility work is guided by four responsibility cornerstones and their associated
themes:

altia and customers, altia and society, altia and employees, and altia and environment.

in this section of the report, we review each of the cornerstones separately. of their themes, we
focus on the nine most material aspects identified on the basis of our materiality analysis.

altia & customers




product quality and safety are crucial priorities for altia. for example, in wine production
operations in rajamäki, the quality of wine is monitored by sensory evaluation as well as
chemical laboratory analyses at different stages of production.

although recalls are relatively rare, altia practices actively for these situations with phantom
testing, among other things. last year there were a total of 15 product recalls in all of altia’s
markets combined. the recalls were mostly related to taste defects, microbiological
fermentation and foreign objects.

focusing on traceability is an important aspect of ensuring the quality and safety of altia’s
products. the products altia manufactures can be traced down to individual batches of
packaging materials and raw materials.

when selecting raw material suppliers, we also evaluate their responsibility by means of our
corporate social responsibility survey. we require that our suppliers are certified or externally
audited with regard to product safety, product quality and social responsibility.

altia’s largest customers, the nordic alcohol monopolies, are members of the european
business social compliance initiative (bsci). the bsci’s ethical principles emphasise working
conditions, human rights and environmental protection. altia is committed to complying with
the bsci’s ethical principles in its own operations and throughout the supply chain. bsci




43

altia’s responsibility report 2015



audits commissioned by the monopolies and focused on risk countries continued in 2015.

altia is developing its portfolio of organic and ethically certified products to respond to the
growing demand for them. in may 2015, the rajamäki bottling plant received permission to
start bottling fair trade products. altia’s first own fair trade wine, patchwork, was launched
in sweden. in finland, altia launched the rooftop garden liqueur, the first product
manufactured from organic grain spirit produced at the koskenkorva plant.

altia’s responsibility report 2015




responsible sourcing
selecting our wines responsibly
at altia, we work with well-known wine producers who are able to supply the volumes we need
for our products. the biggest wine sourcing countries for altia’s proprietary brands are
australia, usa, chile, spain, south africa and hungary.

selecting producers to supply us with wines is done with care. all of our suppliers, whether
from a risk country or not, fill in our csr (corporate social responsibility) questionnaire and
sign a contract which includes a bsci (business social compliance initiative) clause. when
visiting our suppliers, we carry out ocular audits and in countries like south africa, for
example, we visit the vineyards and talk to the farmers and workers supplying the grapes to
check that our standards are met. so far our suppliers have done great work. audits have never
brought up any crucial issue that would have ended the cooperation.

each member of the wine sourcing team is responsible for a group of specific countries, and
apart from having an in-depth knowledge of these countries, have also built up networks of
producers and brokers to cover all needs.

this means that even if we can’t visit a potential supplier on day one, one of our contacts will
be able to make sure that everything is as it should be. in time, we visit all of our suppliers and
producers.

in particular, suppliers to the monopoly countries are very aware of what is expected of them
regarding corporate responsibility. even so, in some countries the situation has been
complicated. huge steps have been made in recent years in the right direction, however. that
said, we must also respect the intricate underlying challenges that many risk countries are faced
with. with our suppliers, we work together.

raw materials – demanding safety and quality
at altia, we expect certificates from our partners regarding the safety and quality of the
products, as well as certificates concerning social responsibility. by communicating openly, we
make sure that our suppliers know all the requirements set for the products. in 2015, we




45

altia’s responsibility report 2015



mapped out the certification situation of our suppliers and discussed development plans to
implement missing audits.

with new potential suppliers, we use a specific evaluation tool to make sure that they meet all
the required aspects. to minimize our carbon footprint, we prefer locally produced products
and materials wherever possible.

through altia’s supply chain, the awareness of csr issues has been rising during the last years.
for example, all actors work towards the efficient use of raw materials and avoid over
packaging.

bsci tests partners’ responsibility in practice
altia’s largest customers, the nordic alcoholic beverage monopolies, are members of the
european bsci. as a supplier to the monopolies, altia and its sales companies are committed
to complying with the bsci’s ethical principles in altia’s own operations and throughout the
supply chain.

the ethical principles are included in the code of conduct which emphasize working
conditions, human rights and environmental issues in the supply chain. these ethical principles
are also based on the most recognized international labor standards such as ilo conventions
and the un global compact.

in 2015, one audit was conducted in trinidad & tobago and two re-audits in south africa.
one supplier with non-conforming results in the first audit in 2014 filled in a self-assessment
report on the progress of correcting the shortcomings.

for 2016, audits have already been agreed to be conducted at our suppliers in guyana and
chile.

at altia, we have continued implementing the bsci by updating contracts to reflect the new
code of conduct and asking our suppliers to sign the bsci terms of implementation.

the bsci audits focus on risk countries as listed by bsci. in 2015, these countries accounted
for only 5 percent of altia’s total purchases. the majority of altia’s purchases are made in the
eu area, with finland representing the single largest sourcing country.

sensory perception and chemistry come
together in quality assurance
in altia’s wine production operations at the rajamäki plant, the quality
of wine is monitored by sensory evaluation as well as chemical
laboratory analyses.
“in recent times, we have particularly focused on developing the sensory evaluation of wines. at
least five people participate in each evaluation session to ensure a reliable result. the evaluators
are trained and their sense of taste is tested,” says hanna jatila, wine quality master at altia.

quality monitoring applies to beverages produced at the rajamäki plant as well as wines
produced elsewhere and bottled at the rajamäki plant. each wine is tested at multiple stages of
the process: upon delivery, during processing, and several times during bottling.

two evaluation sessions are held at the rajamäki plant each day, lasting from ten minutes to
half an hour depending on the number of products being evaluated. approximately 3,100 wine
samples are evaluated each year.

limit values are specified by legislation
in addition to sensory analysis, wines are also subject to chemical analyses in a laboratory. in
the analyses, special attention is paid to sulphur dioxide content. sulphur dioxide is a
preservative that is subject to legal maximum limits.

like sensory analysis, chemical analysis also takes place at several different stages of the wine
production process. sensory and chemical evaluation complement each other.

“the most important stage in the quality assurance of wine is accepting delivery. when a batch
of wine is delivered, samples are taken for the purpose of sensory analysis. if the wine is found
to be defective in taste, for example, the delivery will not be accepted. however, this is quite
rare, as only a few batches of wine are returned per year.

wine quality is also monitored by agreements. the agreements between wine producers and




48

altia’s responsibility report 2015



altia’s wine purchasers include an aqs document that serves as a guideline for the chemical
composition of the wine. cooperation between the parties concerned is essential in quality
assurance.

“in the event of changes, such as the introduction of faster and more accurate chemical or
microbiological methods, altia must develop its methods accordingly. it is very rewarding to
work with major wine and beverage companies, as they give us new perspectives that help us
improve our quality assurance further,” hanna jatila explains.

spreading the fair message
fairtrade wines have become a recognized trend in the beverage
industry, bringing considerable benefits to workers and their families.
making a difference is also what altia is aiming for.
leading the altia fairtrade success is patchwork, a fairtrade wine part of fairhills, one of the
world’s most successful fairtrade projects in the wine business. fairtrade and fairhills are all
about improving the quality of life.

“fairtrade means improved economic conditions for workers and their families. in addition to
higher payments, farmers also receive an added bonus that must be used to make investments
which benefit the entire community,” says carin widoff, senior brand manager at altia
sweden.

this is also the message in altia sweden’s recently released video, which portrays how the
fairhills project and fairtrade have changed the working conditions and lives of workers
involved in the project.

during the ten years that the project has been active, village life has undergone a remarkable
transformation. school and daycare have been introduced, along with functioning medical
services, a computer room, a library and training sessions for adults.

michael bech-jansen, senior vice president, commercial operations at altia, echoes widoff,
saying fairtrade products belong to altia’s corporate responsibility cornerstones.

“altia is driving a responsibility agenda, where investing in long-term responsibility is a way for
altia to develop a sustainable business,” bech-jansen says.

keeping up with rising demand
according to bech-jansen, the role of fairtrade has changed significantly in recent years, with
fairtrade now a true consumer trend.

“both consumers and customers are becoming more conscious and informed about fairtrade.




50

altia’s responsibility report 2015



our biggest customers, alko in finland and systembolaget in sweden, are continuously
increasing their sales of fairtrade and other ethically certified wines,” bech-jansen explains.

widoff also views responsibility as an increasingly important issue in the wine business, with
companies adjusting their portfolios to meet the demands for responsible production.

“naturally, we try to increase our share of these kind of wines because of the rising demand.
we are always part of the blending process, where style and quality are decided. for us,
uniqueness and great value are key,” widoff says.

altia is constantly on the look-out for new sustainable partners. as the demand for fairtrade
wines increases, so does the demand for altia’s fair trade portfolio.

“altia’s product development and producer/partner business is focused on delivering relevant
consumer products which respond to the growing trends in the market. as a natural
consequence, altia works to expand the fairtrade portfolio in all our markets,” bech-jansen
concludes.

altia & society




altia is committed to promoting responsible alcohol consumption. we take a serious stance
towards the problems associated with alcohol abuse and acknowledge the importance of the
appropriate regulation of alcoholic beverages. alcohol is only for adults who consume it
responsibly and in moderation.

we work with other industry operators in our operating region to promote responsible alcohol
consumption in practice. in finland, the industry’s joint nautikohtuudella.fi (“enjoy
responsibly”) website provides information on responsible alcohol consumption, the detrimental
effects of excessive consumption, as well as the risks to different user groups. the “puhutaan
alkoholista” (“let’s talk about alcohol”) programme is aimed at preventing alcohol consumption
by minors and encouraging people to start consuming alcohol at an older age. altia’s other
operating countries, except norway, have similar joint programmes and websites maintained by
industry operators.

the marketing of alcoholic beverages is highly regulated in most of altia’s operating countries.
in addition to legal compliance, we are also committed to complying with the advertising
standards issued by spiritseurope, the european representative body of the alcohol industry.
altia’s marketing communications also advocate moderation in alcohol consumption.

altia is a significant employer in its operating region. in the end of 2015, altia employed 842
people, of whom 470 worked in finland. altia paid eur 474 million in excise and income




52

altia’s responsibility report 2015



taxes in its operating region in 2015. altia is also a significant buyer of domestic barley in
finland. last year, we company spent eur 31.7 million in buying 191 million kilogrammes of
barley, which represents approximately 15 per cent of finland’s total barley harvest.

human rights in the supply chain is a shared interest of altia, customers and consumers. altia
cooperates with its major customers, the nordic alcohol monopolies, to advocate human rights,
and the company also operates according to the same principles.

altia as a taxpayer
altia is a responsible taxpayer in all of its operating countries. the company also aims to
promote the group’s strategic development and support business operations as well as ensure
their proper implementation, including from the tax perspective.

the management of tax-related matters is centralised at the group level, where tax-related
decisions are made. in ambiguous situations, the group consults tax advisors, and verbal or
written guidance may be sought from the tax authorities to clarify tax practices.

it is important for the company to comply with all applicable local and international laws and
regulations in paying, collecting, remitting as well as reporting taxes. altia plc does not operate
in tax havens as defined by the oecd, and the company does not practice tax planning aimed
at artificially decreasing the taxable profit of the group or an individual operating country.
practices such as the granting of group contributions within companies operating in the same
country, or deducting a subsidiary’s tax losses in taxation, are legal and normal tax planning
practices that the company will continue to utilize.

as regards transfer pricing, the company complies with local laws and the oecd transfer
pricing guidelines. the arm’s length principle is applied to intra-group transactions relating to
products, services, intellectual property rights and financing. apa (advance pricing
arrangement) negotiations are still underway between altia and the tax authorities in denmark
and finland concerning the relocation of production from denmark to finland. the
negotiations began in 2014.

in addition to corporate income tax and value-added taxes, altia pays a considerable amount of
excise taxes mainly in sweden and finland. excise taxes are not included in the company’s
reported net sales.

as part of corporate responsibility reporting, altia publishes a summary of taxes and
contributions. the summary is prepared in compliance with the guidelines issued by the
finnish ownership steering department in the prime minister’s office for country-by-country
tax reporting of state-owned companies. the summary is based on information collected from
the group’s accounting systems. the summary includes material taxes and contributions by
type.




55

altia’s responsibility report 2015



pursuant to the guidelines, altia applies the materiality principle in its tax reporting.
accordingly, country-specific information on taxes is presented for finland and sweden. they
constitute the company’s main markets, with approximately 80 percent of its net sales coming
from these two countries. altia’s other operating countries do not meet the materiality
threshold of 10 percent of consolidated net sales for countries to be reported on separately, and
are therefore presented collectively.

views on responsible alcohol consumption
altia published its views on responsible alcohol consumption in 2015.
they are intended to advocate and support a responsible alcohol culture.
     we respect the right of adults to choose to consume alcohol beverages – or choose to not
     consume them.
     the majority of adult consumers enjoy alcohol products responsibly and in moderation in
     their social life.
     we take seriously the harm caused by alcohol misuse and support relevant public health
     measures in preventing and reducing this harm.
     alcohol beverages should be appropriately regulated. we believe that the most effective
     measures for reducing the harmful alcohol consumption are evidence-based, effective and
     they target specific problems.
     we advocate responsible alcohol consumption and market our products in compliance with
     the laws.
     alcohol is only for adults who consume it responsibly. we are strongly against underage
     alcohol use.

altia incorporates these views into its practical work on a daily basis. we have joined other
industry operators in launching websites promoting moderation in alcohol consumption, as well
as programmes aimed at preventing alcohol consumption by minors in our operating region.

the local joint industry “enjoy moderately” websites provide information on responsible alcohol
consumption, the detrimental effects of excessive consumption, as well as the risks to different
user groups, such as young people, pregnant women and those operating vehicles.

altia’s advertising in its operating countries has included various statements advocating
responsible consumption. in late 2015, altia decided to implement statements to promote
responsible consumption or health warning logos for consistent and regular use in its marketing
communications in all of the company’s operating countries.




58

altia’s responsibility report 2015



influencing attitudes among minors through education
the other cornerstone of altia’s advocacy of responsible alcohol consumption is the alcohol
industry’s joint “let’s talk about alcohol” programme. the programme is aimed at preventing
alcohol consumption by minors and encouraging people to start consuming alcohol at an older
age.

the teaching materials are aimed at lower secondary school pupils. they provide a practical tool
for teachers to discuss difficult subjects related to the lives of adolescents. the discussions and
exercises are aimed at influencing adolescents’ attitudes regarding alcohol to promote healthy and
moderate views on alcohol.

the teaching materials were originally developed in sweden in cooperation with the industry and
pedagogic experts, and they are based on international research. the programme was launched in
sweden in 2006.

responsible marketing
altia’s marketing activities are regulated by legislation as well as the
marketing guidelines issued by spiritseurope, the european
representative body of the alcohol industry.
the marketing of alcoholic beverages is highly regulated in most of altia’s operating countries. in
finland, for example, the marketing of spirits is only permitted at retail locations and to industry
professionals. the marketing of alcoholic beverages with an alcohol content of less than 22
percent is also regulated.

in addition to legal compliance, altia is also committed to complying with the marketing
guidelines issued by spiritseurope, the european representative body of the alcohol industry.

in 2015, altia published marketing guidelines and principles internally, along with a description
of the marketing process. training was also organized for personnel on applicable alcohol
legislation and changes thereto.

at the end of 2015, altia decided to implement statements to promote responsible consumption
and/or health warning logos for regular use in its marketing communications in all of the
company’s operating countries.

during the reporting period, altia was the subject of one consumer complaint in estonia
concerning advertising decals on a car owned by the company’s estonian subsidiary. altia
reviewed all company car decals in cooperation with its legal advisors and the consumer
protection board. minor changes were made to the decals of a small number of vehicles as a
result.

responsibility in the alcohol trade
each year, altia organizes a partner seminar for its partners in
conjunction with the mikä viini! (what wine!) event in helsinki. the
theme of the seminar in 2015 was responsibility.
on september 15, 2015, some 35 of altia’s international partners met at a partner seminar in
helsinki. this marked the fourth time altia has organized the seminar for the producers whose
products it imports and represents. in past years, the seminar’s themes have included current
topics related to finnish alcohol law and the alcohol trade. this was again the case in 2015, when
the seminar focused on responsibility in the alcohol industry.

“responsibility is crucial for altia. our most significant customer, alko, requires that producers,
the supply chain and importers operate responsibly,” says nina jansson, partner director
finland at altia.

the speakers at the seminar included minna alitalo, purchasing director at alko; leea
rankinen, vice president of corporate responsibility at sok; tuuli kaskinen, director at
demos helsinki; and maria nymander, corporate responsibility & product regulation
manager at altia.

“alko’s message to its partners typically carries the most weight at these seminars, as alko is our
largest customer in finland.”

altia is committed to the ethical principles of the european business social compliance initiative
(bsci). they are based on key international agreements, such as ilo principles and the un
global compact. the principles emphasize human rights, working conditions and environmental
responsibility.

the monopolies in finland (alko), sweden (systembolaget) and norway (vinmonopolet) are
members of the association. they require that their entire supply chains commit to the principles.

“the majority of altia’s partners are major international companies that have good processes
related to responsibility. partners in so-called risk countries, in particular, generally have a high
level of awareness of the regulations that concern them,” jansson explains.




61

altia’s responsibility report 2015



“responsible business provides the framework for the trade. the most notable advantage of the
partner seminar is that it gives our partners the opportunity to present questions directly to alko
representatives and other key players in the industry. while the theme was familiar to everyone,
the partners considered the seminar useful.”

altia & environment




the most significant environmental impacts of altia’s grain spirit plant in koskenkorva and its
plants in rajamäki and tabasalu consist of energy consumption, water consumption, waste
water and waste generation. environmental impacts are mitigated by annually determined
measures, the effectiveness of which is monitored by means of environmental indicators.

koskenkorva distillery’s bioenergy power plant, which began full-scale operations in january
2015, uses barley husk as its primary fuel. the use of renewable fuel helped the koskenkorva
plant reduce its fossil carbon dioxide emissions by 35 percent and increase its self-sufficiency in
terms of fuel in steam generation to 46 percent in 2015.

altia increases the efficiency of its logistics by combining the volumes of altia’s own products
and its partners’ products as well as by operating close to customers.

altia is a significant buyer of domestic barley in finland. in 2015, altia purchased nearly 191
million kilograms of barley for its koskenkorva distillery, mainly from the 1,500 contract
farmers. this volume represents approximately 15 percent of finland’s total barley harvest.
altia encourages its contract farmers to optimize the efficiency of their operations and use
production inputs sensibly, for example, as part of altia’s bsag commitment made in 2015
aimed at protecting the baltic sea.

the clean groundwater at the rajamäki plant is a key raw material for altia’s alcoholic




63

altia’s responsibility report 2015



beverages. protecting groundwater and the soil is of utmost importance to altia. altia protects
its groundwater intake plants in many ways, including owning land in groundwater areas,
restricting construction in the areas, and establishing conservation areas.

environmental management systems
production volumes 2015
in 2015 (2014), the rajamäki plant in finland produced 64.4 (65.7) million liters of spirits and
wines, the tabasalu plant in estonia 5.0 (5.0) million liters, and the svendborg plant in
denmark 3.4 (8.1) million liters. production in svendborg was discontinued in summer 2015,
with only the logistics center continuing its operations.

the koskenkorva plant used 190.7 (190.6) million kilos of domestic barley to produce 22.6
(23.8) million kilos of grain spirit, 55.3 (54.6) million kilos of starch and 60.3 (62.5) kilos of
animal feed. the production facilities in cognac, france are not included in this report.

certified iso 14001 environmental system
environmental management systems at the koskenkorva plant, the rajamäki plant and in the
technical ethanol unit, as well as in the support functions, sales and marketing at the helsinki
headquarters have been accredited according to the iso 14001 standard. the tabasalu plant
complies with applicable estonian environmental laws and regulations.

environmental systems are developed by means of regular internal and external audits. energy
and environmental considerations are taken into account in planning and executing production
processes and investments in production. senior management meetings regularly review the status
of key environmental issues. environmental awareness among personnel is developed and
maintained through environmental targets, various internal communication channels and
environmental audits.

altia quality, safety and environment principles
management and implementation of quality, safety and environmental values are the most
paramount for altia. we are committed to continuous improvement of our operations
considering the following principle requirements.

environmental impacts
altia’s environmental impacts and proactive measures related
to environmental incidents
altia’s key environmental impacts are defined in assessments of environmental aspects
conducted at three-year intervals. in the assessment conducted in 2015, the most significant
environmental impacts were identified as energy consumption, water consumption, waste
water, waste generation and product wastage leading to quality costs.

environmental indicators were defined to support the reduction of the most significant
environmental impacts, with plant-specific reduction targets set for the three-year period
2016–2018. the achievement of environmental targets is monitored on a monthly basis by
means of environmental indicators. actions to reach the environmental targets are defined for
each production plant in the environmental programs prepared on an annual basis.

the cognac production facility in france is excluded from the environmental targets and
indicators as its production volume and environmental impacts are significantly smaller
compared to the other plants.

an environmental risk assessment was conducted in late 2015 for the rajamäki plant. based on
the assessment, a proactive plan was produced to support the prevention of potential
environmental incidents and emissions.

environmental indicators 2013–2015
in the environmental indicators for 2013, the figures for the koskenkorva plant are presented
separately and the other plants are combined due to the fact that the environmental indicators
for koskenkorva are calculated per tonne of barley, while those of other plants are calculated
per cubic meter of product.

altia’s responsibility report 2015



energy consumption and energy efficiency
the energy consumption indicator decreased from 2014 to 2015 at the koskenkorva plant as
well as at the rajamäki and tabasalu alcoholic beverage plants. energy saving measures are a
major development area for altia both in terms of profitability and environmental
responsibility. altia began energy reviews at the koskenkorva plant and the rajamäki alcoholic
beverage plant in late 2014. the reviews were carried out according to motiva’s instructions.
they provided information on the plants’ energy consumption profiles and helped identify
opportunities for the cost-efficient reduction of energy consumption. the reviews were
completed in late 2015.

in 2008, altia joined the voluntary energy efficiency agreement of the confederation of
finnish industries (ek) and the state of finland. in accordance with the energy efficiency
program, altia is committed to reducing its energy consumption in finland by 9 percent by the
end of 2016, using 2005 as the baseline. in 2015, altia’s energy savings amounted to 237
mwh, or -0.1 percent compared to 2014, and 40,203 mwh, or -17.0 percent compared to
2005.

water consumption and groundwater protection
water consumption relative to production volume has decreased at the koskenkorva plant as
well as altia’s other plants compared to the previous year. water consumption has been
reduced by optimizing washing during production processes and the filtering of products.
protecting groundwater and soil is important to altia, as clean groundwater is a key raw
material in the production of alcoholic beverages. altia protects the quality of water at water
intake plants in finland mainly through the precise monitoring of groundwater quality and
surface levels, ownership of land in the groundwater areas of pumping stations, and also with
building restrictions, protected areas and monitoring the use of the land. altia owns two
protected mires in rajamäki. the company’s operations do not have any negative impacts on
the mires.

altia’s responsibility report 2015



wastewater emissions and exceeding environmental permit
limits
wastewater quality is monitored at koskenkorva and rajamäki on a daily basis by measuring
chemical oxygen demand (cod) in wastewater samples. the environmental target for
improving wastewater quality was not achieved, as the indicators at both plants increased
compared to the previous years. altia will continue its efforts to reduce wastewater emissions.

the rajamäki plant’s monthly average for the biochemical oxygen demand of wastewater
exceeded the limits specified in the environmental permit twice during the year, while the limit
for the amount of solids in wastewater was exceeded three times. following these instances of
environmental permit limits being exceeded, the rajamäki plant has reduced its wastewater
load by improving the biological treatment of wastewater. the environmental permit limits for
biochemical oxygen demand and solids in wastewater were also exceeded once at the
koskenkorva plant due to problems associated with the restarting of the wastewater treatment
plant following a shutdown.

no penalties were imposed for exceeding permit provisions or neglecting environmental laws or
regulations during the reporting period.

waste recycling
altia seeks to decrease waste volume by reducing the amount of disposed packaging material.
the environmental indicator for reducing the waste volume was higher in 2015 than in 2014
due to a change in the reporting method for waste alcohol at the rajamäki plant. due to the
change, the indicator is not comparable with the figures for the previous years. the waste
generated at altia’s plants is almost fully utilized as material or energy. the average waste
reutilization rate for rajamäki, koskenkorva and tabasalu was 98.4 percent.

(5) at the end of 2014, an oil leakage incident occurred at the koskenkorva plant, where a diesel oil-water mixture leaked into the protective pool due to a hole in the tank.

due to the failure of the protective pool, the mixture also leaked into the surrounding soil. the defective tank and the protective pool were removed and the soil was replaced

with new soil.

first year of full-scale operations at the
koskenkorva bioenergy power plant
in its first year of operations, the bioenergy power plant at altia’s
koskenkorva plant reduced the production plant’s carbon dioxide
emissions and increased its self-sufficiency in terms of fuel in steam
generation.
the 10-megawatt bioenergy power plant, which began full-scale operations in january 2015, uses
barley husk as its primary fuel. the bioenergy power plant makes it possible for altia to utilize
practically 100 percent of the barley grain in its year-round production of grain spirit and starch.
in 2015, altia purchased 191 million kilos of domestic barley, or approximately 15 percent of the
finnish barley harvest.

lower carbon dioxide emissions and higher self-sufficiency in
terms of fuel
the use of renewable fuel helped the koskenkorva plant reduce its fossil carbon dioxide emissions
by 35 percent in 2015. the ethanol distillation process requires a significant amount of steam,
and more than 95 percent of the climate impacts of alcohol production are generated during the
distillation of ethanol.

the plant’s self-sufficiency in terms of fuel in steam generation increased to 46 percent for the full
year and reached 61 percent in december. prior to the new bioenergy power plant, the plant’s
fuel self-sufficiency in steam generation stood at approximately 20 percent.

“at the current rate, we will reach our fuel self-sufficiency target of more than 60 percent by
summer 2016. i’m very pleased with the level of commitment and determination our team at
koskenkorva has demonstrated in working to ensure that we reach our shared target,” says plant
manager antti snellman.

in terms of the technology and fuels it uses, the power plant is the first of its kind in finland.

“we want to participate in the development of renewable field biomasses in finnish energy
production and diversify our core competencies as an industrial user of barley,” snellman explains.

promising results in the use of ash
altia has also investigated the use of ash from the new biomass boiler in cooperation with pro
agria.

the first test field was established in spring 2015 by spreading approximately 30 tonnes of ash
from the boiler over an area of 15 hectares. no significant differences were observed during the
growing season between the ash-fertilized field and the control field that used chemical fertilizer.
the crop yields measured at harvest were also very similar.

“these tests provide us with a genuine opportunity to develop the circular economy based on
returning nutrients to the soil to support the growing of barley,” says toni ylinen-luopa,
development manager at the koskenkorva plant.

the promising results mean that the fertilizer tests will continue. a new test field was already
established in fall 2015, and testing will continue in 2016. the tests conducted in the coming
years will provide further information on the effects of the ash fertilizer on the soil, crop yield and
quality.

aiming to optimize the product life cycle
altia’s material efficiency extends from the raw materials used in
manufacturing and production processes to the packaging, transport and
storage of products.
the aim of altia’s development efforts in the area of material efficiency is to achieve an optimized
manufacturing process. packaging is necessary for protecting the product and reducing wastage,
but the excessive use of packaging materials should be avoided. the design of packaging takes
into account the environmental attributes and recyclability of the materials used.

“most of the time, cost-efficiency and environmental friendliness go hand in hand,” says piia
soininen-tengvall, packaging development manager at altia.

the development of material efficiency is part of the value improvement project launched at the
beginning of 2015, the first phase of which will continue until the end of 2016. the project
covers all of altia’s business operations.

“the aim is to achieve significant savings in the use of materials while improving production
efficiency and inventory turnover by creating more modular packaging solutions, centralizing
purchasing and harmonizing the use of packaging materials. this involves cooperation both
within the organization and with external partners, such as the suppliers of packaging materials,”
says mila kuvaja, sourcing and packaging development manager at altia.

one concrete example of these optimization efforts is the harmonization of product structures.
the company has cut back on features such as engraved and embossed logos and texts on bottle
molds, as harmonizing packaging leads to a significant reduction in wasted materials.

for bag-in-box wine packaging, altia has introduced laser printing at the rajamäki plant. the
packaging markings are left blank, for example where the vintage is indicated, and the
information is only printed on the package when it is used. this avoids having to discard the
cardboard packaging of bag-in-box wines when a new vintage is introduced or when the alcohol
content changes, which reduces the amount of cardboard wasted.

altia’s responsibility report 2015



comprehensive development efforts
altia has taken a long-term approach to the development of material efficiency. the shift from
glass bottles to pet bottles, which are approximately 90 percent lighter than glass, began
gradually in 2012 and is still ongoing.

“the rajamäki plant has also switched from aluminum closures to plastic closures for plastic
bottles. following this change, plastic closures are used for 95.5 percent of our pet bottles.
using a plastic closures for a plastic bottle means better recyclability,” soininen-tengvall explains.

the manner in which the product is packed and transported is also significant.

“we have optimized the amount and structure of plastic, glass and corrugated board in our
products to minimize empty space. this means we can transport larger shipments and minimize
traffic emissions,” soininen-tengvall adds.

protecting the baltic sea and other
waterways by making a bsag
commitment
in may 2015, altia signed the baltic sea action group commitment to
mark its dedication to even broader protection of the baltic sea and
other waterways. the focus of the commitment is on environmentally
friendly and high-quality agriculture.
“altia’s operations have a very substantial impact on the baltic sea and other waterways. altia
purchases grain from contract farmers who cultivate some 50,000 hectares of land. the lower the
amount of nutrient emissions from farms to waterways, the better,” says riku venhola, senior
advisor at bsag.

according to venhola, the 1,500 finnish farmers with whom altia cooperates in the area of grain
purchasing are the key to realizing the commitment made by the company.

“if the farmers’ experiences of environmentally friendly agriculture are positive, the information
will spread quickly. it’s also important to keep in mind that altia’s operations affect the food
supply chain as a whole, from farmers to producers, retailers and, ultimately, consumers,”
venhola adds.

bsag is an independent foundation focused on the protection of the baltic sea. it works with
businesses, public officials, policymakers and farmers.

productive and efficient agriculture
according to kari kiltilä, the man responsible for altia’s grain purchasing, the bsag
commitment represents a sensible step forward—from the perspectives of all parties
concerned—in promoting sustainable agriculture.

in practice, this means that altia encourages farmers to maximize the efficiency of their farming
operations, use production inputs sensibly, as well as monitor plant populations during the




80

altia’s responsibility report 2015



growth season and ensure their viability.

“the commitment does not restrict agricultural activity. instead, it promotes efficient and more
environmentally friendly production. we help farmers in areas such as performing plot-specific
nutrient balance calculations to determine the amount of nutrients introduced to fields through
the use of fertilizers, and the amount of nutrients removed during the harvest,” kiltilä explains.

altia also informs the farmers of the nitrogen and phosphorus content of barley delivered to the
koskenkorva plant. farmers can then utilize this information in their nutrient calculations. the
larger the crop yield of a field, the more efficiently the plants tie up nutrients in the harvested
crops. if the nutrients are left in the soil, they will be washed off into waterways, causing
eutrophication.

“a high yield of good-quality crops and environmentally friendly farming go hand in hand. this
is good for business. it also means that the farming operations are environmentally friendly,”
kiltilä concludes.

altia & employees




at altia, we believe that the success of our personnel leads to the success of the company, and
the other way around. we want to build a working community in which our personnel have a
high level of well-being and can perform their work safely. recognizing that each employee
contributes to the atmosphere of the working community, we take pride in our relaxed
company culture that allows everyone to be themselves. we have defined customer orientation,
strategic effectiveness and productive cooperation as the cornerstones of our corporate culture.

planning related to personnel development is part of altia’s strategy process. based on the
company’s strategy, business functions determine their needs annually with regard to
leadership, employee communications and competence development.

dismissals were not avoided in 2015. due to the discontinuation of contract production at
svendborg, statutory negotiations were conducted in denmark in 2015. a total of 26
employees were dismissed, and outplacement services were offered to them.

one of the key objectives related to personnel in 2015 was improving communications related
to strategy. communication was developed both at the company level and locally. all of our
personnel also participated in discussing ideas on what altia’s new purpose means in practice
for our business.

we defined our leadership principles in late 2014 and their implementation in the organization




82

altia’s responsibility report 2015



continued in 2015; for example, the line manager training program launched in the spring was
based on the leadership principles.

altia’s occupational health and safety system in finland has been certified in accordance with
the ohsas 18001:2007 standard. of the 42 measures defined to support the achievement of
sickness absence and accident frequency targets, 67 percent were implemented in 2015. the
indicators for sickness absences and accident frequency remained largely unchanged from 2014.

altia revised its performance-based bonus scheme in 2015. the starting point for the
development effort was to create a more incentivizing model that would allow employees to
more directly influence the size of the bonus through their performance. in addition to
financial rewards, altia also strives to develop other forms of incentives.

altia’s responsibility report 2015




responsible leadership
setting a common direction
one of the key objectives related to personnel in 2015 was improving communications related
to strategy. this was clearly highlighted in the personnel survey conducted early in the year.

communications were improved in many ways, including regular reviews by the ceo that all
members of personnel are invited to participate in, either in person or virtually. the events are
also recorded to allow employees to watch them at a convenient time.

local communications were also an important focus area. the rajamäki plant, for example,
held quarterly reviews by the plant manager that employees were invited to attend, and the
plant management has also organized monthly events in the various departments of the plant.
altia also introduced yammer as a new communications platform to encourage employees to
share their views and best practices.

the implementation of strategy was communicated to employees on a monthly basis by
updating the results of key indicators on the company intranet. one of the indicators is the
“employee pulse”, which measures employee perceptions regarding internal communications.
the personnel pulse showed strong positive development during the year.

late in the year, altia employees worked to come up with new ideas to develop operations
towards making the company’s business operations even more meaningful. this was achieved
by a virtual tool that gave employees the opportunity to post their own ideas as well as
comment and evaluate ideas posted by their colleagues.

the measures led to positive changes, as the results of the altia tasting employee survey
conducted late in the year improved by six percentage points, with higher scores for all 58
questions.

managerial work requires continuous learning
the leadership principles defined in late 2014 were implemented in the company in several
ways, including discussing them in management teams to determine how to put them into




85

altia’s responsibility report 2015



practice in each organization.

the leadership principles were also incorporated into development discussion practices. each
line manager addresses the management principles when holding discussions with their
respective managers regarding managerial work and its development.

a line manager training program was implemented in spring 2015, with managers from various
operating countries participating in the program. the program was largely based on altia’s
leadership principles.

every member of altia’s personnel regularly participates in development discussions. the
development discussions for white-collar employees include two meetings during the year, and
for blue-collar employees, there is one meeting annually. at the development discussions, a
personal development plan is created for each employee that defines the most significant
development measures with regard to competence development and motivation.

leadership principles
show direction
     explore future possibilities and opportunities in the business.
     create plans to achieve company strategy and targets.
     ensure that team members understand how their work is related to the big picture.
     create positive attitude towards our brands and company.

support success
     help people to achieve their goals by advising and coaching.
     show genuine interest in people by listening and asking.
     create learning opportunities for people.
     ensure best practice sharing across the organization.
     be a role model for the altian culture and walk the talk.

responsibility for employee well-being
actions to prevent sickness absences and accidents
altia’s occupational health and safety system has been certified in accordance with the ohsas
18001:2007 standard. the certificate covers the koskenkorva plant, the rajamäki alcoholic
beverage plant, and the technical ethanol business operations, as well as the operations of the
head office in helsinki.

the objectives of the system include the reduction of sickness absence rates and the number of
absences caused by accidents. in order to achieve these objectives, a total of 42 actions have
been determined for the various locations, and 28 of these (67 percent) were implemented in
2015.

action plans have also been created for operating locations that are not within the scope of
certification, namely the tabasalu plant and logistic centers, with the exception of cognac. the
programs include, for example, improving ergonomics and communication regarding safety
and hygiene issues, improving work efficiency with the new shift model, increasing the safety of
forklift traffic, emphasizing the use of personal protective equipment, and speeding up the
return from sick leave through the active use of the early support model.

the accident frequency and sickness absence rates are monitored in all of altia’s operating
countries, with the exception of france. in 2015, the sickness absence rate was 3.0 percent
(2014: 3.0 percent). the logistics center in sweden had the highest rate (4.9 percent), while the
office in denmark had the lowest (0.3 percent). the accident frequency* for accidents
requiring at least one day of absence was 12 (2014: 12).

as in the previous year, the rajamäki plant had the highest number of accidents. the rajamäki
plant continued to develop the identification of hazards and risks, as well as implement
immediate corrective measures. a few isolated accidents occurred in other production locations
(koskenkorva, svendborg, tabasalu and the swedish logistics center in brunna). there were
no fatal work-related accidents in 2015.

remuneration and incentives support the strategy
altia revised its performance-based bonus program in 2015. the starting point for the
development effort was to create a more incentivizing model that would allow employees to
more directly influence the size of the bonus through their performance.

performance-based bonuses are paid once a year or more often in the form of annual result
bonuses or sales bonuses. blue-collar employees are part of a production bonus scheme. all
personnel except those in short fixed-term employment relationships are included in the
performance-based bonus scheme. the objectives of the performance-based bonuses are to
support the implementation of strategy, reward personnel for good results, and share altia’s
financial success.

in addition to financial rewards, altia also strives to develop other forms of incentives. these
include praise and positive feedback, celebrating accomplishments, sharing best practices,
including key talents in strategy and development work, as well as offering small tokens of
appreciation in recognition of jobs well done.

more information about altia’s remuneration policies, including paid remunerations can be
found in the remuneration statement.

“a good line manager is genuinely
concerned about employees”
the altia plant in rajamäki has implemented altia’s leadership
principles –show direction, support success and ensure
implementation – in day-to-day operations. according to plant manager
janne peltoniemi, the most important thing for a line manager is to be
genuine and to ensure that the personnel are committed to shared goals.
the altia plant in rajamäki, nurmijärvi in finland is the workplace of some 250 employees,
most of whom work on the factory’s various production lines and in the logistics center. the
current organization at the rajamäki plant has only been in place for about a year, and the plant’s
operating methods have been revised to a significant extent in recent times.

altia’s new leadership principles have served as a guideline in this process of renewal.

“the leadership principles are the cornerstones of our line management and leadership. we have
set challenging and clear targets, the achievement of which is regularly monitored. this also
means that we want to strengthen our employer image and take more pride in our work,” says
janne peltoniemi, plant manager at the rajamäki plant.

patronage and lowering thresholds
the new leadership principles have been translated to “the plant’s own language” and they are
also included in development discussions with personnel. peltoniemi points out that the
leadership principles must be reflected in all employees.

the aim of all development efforts at the rajamäki plant is to engage people from different areas
of the organization.

“we want to create a more open and interactive work community. we also want to give everyone
the chance to participate in the development of our management, and development in general,”
peltoniemi explains.




95

altia’s responsibility report 2015



the rajamäki plant has also seen strong cooperation in the implementation of new operating
methods. the development of line management, for example, has been geared towards
eliminating psychological barriers between different levels of the organization.

“we have also introduced a patronage initiative, which involves members of the management
team acting as patrons for specific bottling lines. this means that they have regular weekly
meetings with the employees working on the bottling line assigned to them. it also gives them the
opportunity to receive first-hand feedback from the employees,” peltoniemi says.

communication at the rajamäki plant has also been improved by using the yammer platform.
the factory has the most active yammer group in the entire altia organization. peltoniemi says
good communication is key to having a transparent and open organization.

“a good line manager is genuinely concerned about employees. no matter how many decisions
we make at the management level, success always comes down to the commitment of the
personnel. in my world, the key is to focus on individual employees,” peltoniemi concludes.


     “the management culture here at the rajamäki plant is somewhat burdened by
     history, but the situation has improved significantly over the years. in the logistics
     organization i work in, good line management depends on highly competent
     leadership. i appreciate the current approach to management, which involves a strong
     focus on people skills.

     as an employee, i feel that i have the opportunity to generate discussion and influence
     my work. i would like to see even more openness and justified decision-making, as
     transparency makes it easier to understand and accept changes. with regard to
     internal communication, i would like to see summaries of information. at present,
     important messages sometimes end up being fragmented across multiple channels.”

     markus hälikkä, production controller, logistics

     “i have worked at the rajamäki plant for ten years. i am pleased with the current
     management culture here. changes are not made without listening to the employees’
     opinions. new decisions are always discussed with those at the factory floor level.
     corrective adjustments are also made where necessary.

     i am one of four team leaders in the supplies department team, which consists of
     about twenty employees. right now i am feeling a little uncertainty with regard to the
     division of responsibilities, as the organizational changes implemented a year ago left
     our team with less direct managerial supervision. this creates a certain sense of
     detachment, and team leaders now have to look into matters that should be handled
     by a line manager. we have talked about this at length with the management in recent
     times; for example, with regard to occupational safety. i am confident that this issue
     will be discussed at the management level and sorted out soon.”

     piritta mononen, team leader

     “in my opinion, the supervision of work at the rajamäki plant needs to be easy-going,
     firm and realistic. i work on the production line for bag-in-box wines. i deal with my
     line managers almost every day, and sometimes i also work with the managers
     responsible for bottling and maintenance. my experience is that our supervisors and
     managers are very open to ideas and suggestions. i can talk to them in an honest and
     straightforward manner, so i am very pleased with things overall.

     i will take up the position of team leader myself in january 2016. one improvement i
     would like to see is some type of orientation training for new employees with regard
     to the operating methods and framework of supervisory and managerial work at the
     rajamäki plant.”

koskenkorva switches to 12-hour shifts
altia’s koskenkorva plant implemented a 12-hour shift work model in
may 2015. the new system has been met with 100 percent positive
feedback. ’we have a lot of young fathers working at the plant, and the
longer stretches of time off make a big difference in arranging family life’,
says plant manager antti snellman.
the first request to revamp the shift work model came from koskenkorva employees back in
2011. the previous model was the traditional three-shift model consisting of eight-hour shifts.

’our employees wanted to have more time for their hobbies and achieve a better balance between
work and family life’, explains plant manager antti snellman.

the initiative led to a comprehensive change process that took four years. it began with
establishing a working group that visited other companies; for example, in the process industry,
or those working in food and energy, to learn more about alternative approaches to shift work.

the employees in the working group became interested in the 12-hour model. it involves
employees working two morning shifts from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., followed by one day off. the
employees then work two night shifts from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., followed by six days off.

’after receiving the green light from occupational health services, the employers’ federation and
the employee union, we started a one-year pilot in may 2014. all of the feedback we received
during and after the one-year pilot was positive. not a single employee wanted to go back to the
old model. also worth noting is that sickness-related absences declined by 50 percent after the
change’, snellman adds.

altia has about 50 employees at the koskenkorva plant, with approximately half of them working
as operators under the shift work model. the majority of them work in the control room,
monitoring plant processes on computer terminals.

‘there is plenty to do throughout the day, but it is not physically strenuous work’, says process
controller antti latva-hirvelä.

altia’s responsibility report 2015



’i get to spend more time at home with the kids. we don’t need to worry about day-care
arrangements, and we know my work schedule until the end of the year. if i want some variation,
i can trade shifts with my colleagues’, he adds.

fellow process controller sami kokko echoes his colleague’s views.

’i wouldn’t change this new model for anything. this is the best shift model i can imagine. i have
much more free time than i did under the old model, and the 12-hour workdays don’t feel
different than the old 8-hour workdays did’, kokko says.

“finland needs neutral and fact-based
discussion on alcohol”
kristiina hannula, the director of ehyt – finnish association for
substance abuse prevention – would like to see the public discussion
on alcohol become less emotional and more fact-based. this could
make alcohol a neutral topic of discussion in finland.

how would you describe the current discussion on alcohol in our society?
the public discussion on alcohol in finland is highly emotional and sometimes aggravated.
the participants tend to put words in each others’ mouths. public health organizations, for
instance, are assumed to promote total abstinence, while we in the ngo sector talk about the
alcohol industry from our perspective. the discussion should be based on genuinely listening to
the other parties’ words rather than on making assumptions. this would support more effective
interaction between the various parties involved.

how would you like the discussion on alcohol to develop?
i would like to see a balanced discussion on alcohol, along with a balanced alcohol policy and a
balanced drinking culture. alcohol should be discussed in a neutral manner, even though
everyone has emotional experiences related to it. alcohol should be discussed dispassionately to
highlight its advantages and disadvantages in a balanced way.

in your opinion, can cooperation between alcohol industry operators and
ngos influence the prevailing discussion on alcohol and drinking
culture?
it certainly can, but cooperation must be based on genuine and honest interaction. at ehyt,
we have very positive experiences from our cooperation with microbreweries and wine
enthusiasts.




101

altia’s responsibility report 2015



in your view, what is the most important aspect with regard to altia’s
responsibility?
altia’s operations are in good shape with regard to responsibility as long as communications are
based on facts. altia’s responsibility as an industry operator also includes accepting that certain
decisions may be positive for the alcohol industry but not beneficial to the finnish economy as
a whole, and vice versa. i think it would be responsible to put that into words somehow. altia
naturally uses its marketing activities to sell its products, and that’s fine, but the messages it
communicates must not be misleading.

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
responsibility?
above all, i would like the cooperation to be balanced, which is something i have highlighted
in all discussions on alcohol. in future, cooperation between altia and ehyt could involve
joint events, for example. this type of cooperation would require that we are an equal partner
with altia, and both sides would have to make an equal contribution to the financing of any
joint events.

the finnish association for substance abuse prevention (ehyt) operates throughout finland and
with the entire finnish population to promote a healthy lifestyle. in addition to the prevention of
alcohol, tobacco and drug abuse, ehyt promotes the prevention of the negative impacts of gaming
and gambling. ehyt also coordinates the national network of ngos operating in the area of
substance abuse prevention, which is comprised of 40 of finland’s most significant substance abuse
prevention associations. www.ehyt.fi

a consumer’s wish for altia: promote a
drinking culture based on moderation
“as a consumer, i want to believe that companies do everything they
can to operate in a responsible manner, even though aspects such as
monitoring the subcontracting chain can be difficult at times,” says
tommi koivisto, author of the isyyspakkaus (“paternity package”) blog.

what does corporate responsibility mean to you as a consumer?
i think corporate responsibility is an important issue, but i also think that individual consumers
don’t always understand what responsibility means in practice. when i’m buying a product or
service, thinking about the responsibility of the company behind it is not always the first thing
on my mind. however, if it later becomes apparent that the company in question has been
found to have conducted its business in an unethical manner, i will no longer buy their
products or services. conversely, it pleases me to find out that a company i’ve supported has
received praise or awards for its ethical conduct.

do corporate responsibility issues affect your consumption behavior?
most of my purchase decisions are based on needs. as a consumer, i want to believe that
companies do everything they can to operate in a responsible manner, even though aspects such
as monitoring the subcontracting chain can be difficult at times. when it comes to clothing, i
value items that are produced from certified organic cotton, as well as clothing manufacturers
that look after the rights of their employees in the countries their clothes are produced in.
when i’m choosing a wine, i usually check whether it has been produced organically. for
example, if there’s a new range of wines out, i tend to go for the one that’s organic.

what do you believe consumers will expect from companies in the future
with regard to responsibility?
it seems to me that interest in responsibility issues has increased substantially in recent times.
for instance, i’ve read news about the clothing industry indicating that workers in developing
countries suffer from poor working conditions. nevertheless, i don’t believe that consumers




103

altia’s responsibility report 2015



will read through corporate responsibility reports before each purchase decision they make in
the future.

in your view, what is the most important aspect with regard to altia’s
responsibility?
altia could take a stronger role in promoting a drinking culture based on moderation. finnish
society suffers from many alcohol-related problems, and altia could respond to this in the
company’s operations. in my opinion, finnish society should move towards enjoying high-
quality alcoholic beverages in moderation rather than drinking excessive quantities.

message to altia
please continue to provide a diverse selection of products! i hope you will continue to update
your product range and keep it interesting.

life as the father of a young child. tommi is also known for his appreciation of good food and drinks.

“the need to operate in a responsible,
sustainable way will only increase in the
future – for all companies”
constellation brands is an international producer and marketer of
wine, beer, and spirits and one of altia’s regional partners. eric
thomas, csr manager at constellation, tells us that the company is
looking forward to continuing to find areas where their and altia’s
corporate responsibility strategies are aligned. “we focus our corporate
responsibility work in three main areas – sustainability, giving back,
and social responsibility,” he says.

what is the role of corporate responsibility in the beverage and alcohol
industry?
constellation brands, like many companies in the beverage alcohol industry, has strong roots in
agriculture. so being good stewards of the land and water is not just the right thing to do – it is
vital to our long-term growth and viability. in addition to minimizing our environmental
impact, our industry also has an obligation to promote and market our products in a
responsible way and give back to the communities where we operate.

will that role change in the future?
the need to operate in a responsible and sustainable way will only increase in the future for all
companies. constellation has a strong entrepreneurial spirit. we will always be looking for new
and more effective ways to do business responsibly. while our specific corporate responsibility
initiatives or programs may change, the underlying reasoning behind our efforts will not.
constellation’s commitment to cr has been woven into our company’s culture and core values
since it was founded in 1945.




105

altia’s responsibility report 2015



what is the role of corporate responsibility in constellation brands’ work
in particular?
we focus our corporate responsibility work in three main areas – sustainability, giving back,
and social responsibility (responsible consumption). our cr initiatives are truly employee-
driven; employees at every level of our company participate. while we have many facilities,
brands, and employees around the world, we all share a common set of values and commitment
to responsibility.

from your point of view, what is most crucial for altia’s corporate
responsibility work?
it is clear that altia has a strong commitment to promoting responsible drinking. this is
evident in their educational and advocacy initiatives, including their wide range of online
resources for consumers. we rely on altia to keep us up-to-date on industry product
regulations in the nordics and the eu and how we can best comply with any legislative or
regulatory changes.

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
corporate responsibility issues?
we are looking forward to continuing to find areas where our corporate responsibility strategies
are aligned, so that we can improve and enhance each other’s efforts through information and
best practice sharing. we find a great deal of value in taking a collaborative approach to
corporate responsibility with partners like altia and others in our industry.

greetings to altia
it is rewarding to work with altia not just because they are good partners from a day-to-day
business perspective, but also because of their strong commitment to corporate responsibility.

“our goal is to become the leading
supplier of inherently sustainable
packaging”
ardagh group is altia’s long-term packaging supplier and largest
vendor measured in terms of spending. mads elming, sales &
marketing director nordic at ardagh group shares their csr
approach with us.

what is the role of corporate responsibility in ardagh’s business?
we have 89 glass and metal manufacturing production facilities in 21 countries. as a global
packaging producer we are very conscious about our corporate responsibility. effective
sustainability and corporate responsibility mechanisms are critical to our growth strategy.

our goal is to become the leading supplier of inherently sustainable packaging. for instance,
our glass facilities in dongen, the netherlands, and massachusetts, usa, operate furnaces that
use 90 percent recycled glass, which are regarded as a benchmark for glass production
worldwide. i think we are on a right path – as an example we have just achieved an ecovadis
gold level certification for 2015 for our social and environmental performance.

according to your opinion, what kind of responsibility themes will grow
their significance in the future?
in our sustainability strategy we have set ambitious long-term targets in the areas of
environmental and social sustainability, and these will also have our focus in the future. in
2014, for example, we implemented our group code of conduct and our group
sustainability framework policy. both of these initiatives help us to regulate the areas of
environmental, social and ethical sustainability and are important steps in ensuring that the
most effective controlled processes are in place.




107

altia’s responsibility report 2015



from your point of view, what kinds of issues are important for altia’s
responsibility work?
we believe that the same focus areas will be of importance to altia.

do you wish to have cooperation with altia regarding responsibility? if
you already have cooperation with them, how is it like?
we do not have cooperation with altia regarding responsibility but would welcome the
initiative in order to achieve the most beneficial cooperation for both companies.

greetings for altia
we wish altia all the best for the future and look forward to many years of cooperation.

“the important thing to me as a farmer is
that altia wants to be a reliable and
competitive grain buyer”
the contract farmers that supply altia with grain are essential for the
company’s business. according to mäntsälä-based farmer silja vuori,
altia’s role as a nationally significant user of grain means that ensuring
the success of farmers, the agricultural sector and the rural areas of
finland is an important aspect of the company’s responsibility.

what role does responsibility play in the work of a farmer?
responsibility means that the products sold by farms to industry are appropriate in terms of
quality and that they meet the buyer’s needs, are delivered as promised, and that their
production satisfies both general requirements and the customer’s specifications.

for a farmer, responsibility means managing the farm in such a way that it functions well and is
successful in the long term. a responsible farmer looks after the farm on the principle that the
farm is inherited from the previous generation and borrowed from the next generation.
responsibility in farming operations means that the condition of the soil improves, working
methods are enhanced and the farm’s operations and finances develop favorably.

responsibility also means that substances such as fertilizers and pesticides are used
appropriately and with care. altia helps farmers in this regard by providing reports on the
amounts of nutrients removed from the fields during harvest. this is one example of how altia
helps farmers make more efficient use of their resources and minimize the negative
environmental impacts of their operations. this kind of environmental responsibility is
something that today’s society is expecting from farmers to a greater extent than before.

what are your expectations regarding altia’s responsibility efforts going
forward?
i hope that altia will continue to develop its business and production operations to remain the




109

altia’s responsibility report 2015



first choice for its customers. by operating efficiently and finding good markets for its products,
altia can continue to be a good and reliable contractual partner for farmers and the grain trade
in the future.

as a company, altia determines what areas of responsibility it emphasizes. i hope that, as a
responsible company, it will continue to give due consideration to farmers as contractual
partners.

in your view, what is the most important aspect with regard to altia’s
responsibility?
the important thing to me as a farmer is that altia wants to be a reliable and competitive grain
buyer. i hope that altia will define cooperation with farmers as part of its responsibility. altia’s
role as a nationally significant user of grain means that ensuring the success of farmers, the
agricultural sector and the rural areas of finland is an important aspect of the company’s
responsibility.

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
responsibility?
i would like altia to communicate information to farmers on hopes and needs the company
and its customers have with regard to responsibility. they can also communicate information
to farmers based on laboratory analyses, which is something they have already done. i believe
that this will also help altia source better raw materials. at the same time, altia can help
farmers select the right varietals and methods to achieve the best possible results.

message to altia
as a major grain purchaser, altia has the opportunity to influence trading practices and pricing
in the finnish grain market. developing new operating models and utilizing the storage
capacity of farms, for example, can benefit both farmers and altia. they should also promote
the broad use of increasingly diverse price fixing mechanisms and grain varietals that suit their
purposes to the greatest possible extent.

responsible cooperation means helping
each other to lower the environmental
footprint
ssp – the food travel experts, is the leading food and beverage
service provider in travel locations around the globe. ssp operates in
125 airports and 270 railway stations in 32 countries. “we believe that
a company that does not work with sustainability questions will be
having big problems to survive in the future,” says björn lindström,
purchaser and environmental coordinator at ssp.

what is the role of corporate responsibility at restaurant and cafeteria
sector? will that role change in the future?
as one of the biggest restaurant companies in sweden it is very important that we have control
on all parts of the products we buy. all products need to be safe, right quality and more and
more sustainable. to work with sustainability and responsibility is important for our partners,
like airports and railway stations, as well stakeholders.

we believe that a company that does not work with these questions will be having big problems
to survive in the future.

what is the role of corporate responsibility at ssp in particular?
it is a part of our iso 14 001 program and always on the agenda in purchasing. we only work
with suppliers that have a program for corporate responsibility. we prefer suppliers that are
iso 14 001 certified, like altia.

from your point of view, what is most crucial for altia’s corporate
responsibility work?
to secure that all altia’s own production and supplies from all over the world are responsible in
terms of labour, land and environment; to choose the most environmental way for the freight




111

altia’s responsibility report 2015



all over the world and, to have more organic products in the portfolio.

what kind of cooperation would you like to have with altia regarding
corporate responsibility issues?
i wish for more cooperation in helping each other to lower the environmental footprint for
example in packaging, delivery solutions and organic products.

greetings to altia
altia has a very good education program for our employees both on web and face to face. we
really like the good work you do with better packaging that is lighter and easier to recycle.
