                     reaching new heights
                     as a global company

                     sumitomo chemical advances to a new stage in its csr
                     management
                     sumitomo chemical believes that csr (corporate social responsibility) is essential for
                     contributing to the sustainable development of society through our business activities. in
                     the conduct of its business, the company practices csr-based management by working
                     to achieve balance among the three segments of responsible care activities, pursuit of
                     economic needs, and social activities. sumitomo chemical seeks to manifest its csr-based
                     management by realizing sustainable chemistry as the driving force that enables the company
                     to continue to provide products that bring greater benefit to people in their daily lives through
                     technological innovation in a more environmentally and socially friendly manner.

                          sumitomo chemical’s origins date back to 1913, when the company sought to solve
                     the problem of sulfur dioxide emissions from the besshi copper mine in the shikoku region
                     of japan by using them to produce super-phosphate fertilizer, helping to improve living
                     standards of the time by supplying fertilizer that increased crop yields. since the beginning,
                     sumitomo chemical has not only sought to increase its profits, but has also worked to con-
                     tribute to society in the development of its various businesses. thus, it could be said that
                     sumitomo chemical has always followed a philosophy similar to that of modern-day csr.

                          today, with progressive globalization and the diversification of society, csr-based
                     management is becoming increasingly important, and with this in mind, we have developed
                     a new corporate business plan for the three years starting in fiscal 2007. envisioning fur-
                     ther expansion of our business on a global scale, the basic principle we determined for the
                     plan is to achieve and consolidate high profitability and secure sustained growth potential
                     to generate the added value our shareholders expect in our business as we work to reach
                     new heights as a global company. the basic initiatives to be implemented under this plan
                     include rigorous compliance with all laws, regulations and ethical standards, and active
                     promotion of csr, completion of the rabigh project for the construction and operation of
                     an integrated oil refining and petrochemical complex in saudi arabia, and establishing busi-
                     ness foundations & enhancing consolidated global management. by steadily implementing
                     our new three-year corporate business plan, we will firmly anchor and further develop our
                     csr-based management as befits a global company.

                     strengthening and enhancing responsible care while
                     promoting sustainable chemistry
                     sumitomo chemical has long undertaken voluntary responsible care activities to ensure
                     the performance of its products in terms of the environment, safety, health and quality
                     throughout their life cycles. the company takes this beyond the concept of responsible
                     care in its active efforts to promote sustainable chemistry, by which we endeavor to raise
                     the overall value and benefit to society of our products as well as their economic
                     value-added.

                          while the company naturally strives to conserve energy and resources at its produc-
                     tion plants as well as further minimize their environmental impact, we also make a priority
                     of initiatives for global issues such as global warming, adoption of the globally harmonized
                     system of classification and labeling of chemicals (ghs) and compliance with europe’s
                     new reach legislation.

sumitomo chemical’s distinctive csr activities toward
the sustainable development of society
providing support to remedy the extreme poverty in africa is one of the most urgent global
issues facing society today. among the causes of africa’s poverty, the human and social
damage caused by malaria is vast and the economic losses, enormous. therefore, malaria
prevention is essential to the future development of africa.

     sumitomo chemical developed its olyset net, an insecticide-impregnated mosquito net
effective in preventing infection by the mosquitoes that carry malaria, and we are widely sup-
plying these nets centering on africa. we have also enhanced our manufacturing capabilities
by expanding our production capacity in tanzania, china and vietnam in order to meet the
increasing demand for these nets. in addition, we have provided our production technology
free of charge to a manufacturer in africa for local production of the nets, thereby also cre-
ating employment opportunities and contributing, even in some small way, to the economic
development of the region.

    wanting to make a significant contribution by returning a portion of the revenues from
our olyset net business to the local communities, we are supporting education in africa
through the construction of primary schools, while in vietnam we are providing support for
the renovation of medical clinics in order to contribute to the autonomous development of
these regions.

     going forward, the company will continue to take a global perspective with regard to the
environment, economy, society, and indeed in all aspects of its business to conduct csr
activities unique to sumitomo chemical. further, by creating and continuing to provide new
and useful products and technologies, we will contribute to the betterment of people’s lives
and the solution of the global social and environmental problems we all face.

                                                      in this report, we have endeavored to
                                                present a broad picture of our csr activities.
                                                i hope it will give you a good under-

  sumitomo s-sbr (solution polymerization styrene butadiene rubber)

as the worldwide momentum toward resource conservation and environmental preser-
vation grows, consumers’ awareness of the need for energy efficiency and safety in
driving is rising. the performance required of tires has grown increasingly sophisticated
with each passing year. in terms of fuel efficiency and safety, in particular, the role of
road-gripping tire treads is significant and enhanced functions are required.
      sumitomo s-sbr (solution polymerization styrene butadiene rubber) is used for
tire treads as a synthetic rubber material that can simultaneously improve the two often
opposing characteristics of fuel cost saving (energy conservation) and brake
performance (safety).

and commercialization of its new propylene oxide process.
the award ceremony took place at kansai university in
osaka in march 2007.
     propylene oxide is traditionally manufactured using
the propylene oxide-only process using chlorine, which
generates chlorides, or by a co-production process that
generates styrene monomer, making the production of pro-
pylene oxide subject to fluctuations in the styrene market.
the new process adopts the new concept of recycling
cumene, enabling the production of propylene oxide alone
without generating by-products and co-products. the use
of high-performance catalysts in this process has achieved
high product yields. the process is also a green process
that achieves resource and energy conservation through
the effective use of reaction heat recovered in each rele-
vant step of the manufacturing process.

      the company was the first leading manufacturer of diversi-
      fied chemicals to win this prize.
           ceis established the awards program for chemical
      management and risk communication to publicly honor
      companies and facilities that support promotion of the
      prtr system, take the initiative in implementing chemical
      substances management, and are proactive in keeping the
      public informed through communications activities. this
      year is the third time ceis has awarded the prize.
           the first and second times, the grand prize was
      awarded to individual facilities of a company rather than to
      any corporation as a whole. this year, sumitomo chemical
      became the first company to be awarded the grand prize
      as a corporation. furthermore, in an industry consisting of
      many specialized manufacturers, the award to sumitomo
      chemical is particularly noteworthy since our manufactur-
      ing activities encompass diverse fields of chemical products
      rather than a limited variety of products such as those of
      specialized manufacturers.
           for this year’s award, sumitomo chemical and three
      other companies were nominated for the grand prize from
      among 20 entries. the four nominees made final presenta-
      tions at the selection meeting and the committee members
      and judges at the venue voted to determine the grand
      prize winner.                                                    * prtr: pollutant release and transfer register

      experiential fire and explosion training
      sumitomo chemical has been implementing experiential
      training for fire and explosion hazards for certain members
      of the operating staff of its ehime works. beginning in
      january 2007, we innovated this training to start anew our
      experiential fire and explosion training. this training tar-
      gets technicians key to the manufacturing and research
      departments throughout the company, combining prepara-
      tory study of the company guidelines, training (experiential
      training and schooling) along with the submission of follow-

             ing ways of assessing relationships between production efficiency, the cost of environmental activities,
             and environmental impact. through these studies, we are attempting to develop environmental efficiency
             indicators that will enable us to reduce the environmental impact of our activities more effectively.

          sumitomo chemical became the first japanese company to
          introduce safer system’s real-time system in 2003. this
          system retrieves real-time weather observation data (wind
          direction, wind velocity, and temperature, etc.) for the plant
          premises, conducts simulations of the diffusion of targeted
          substances based on the obtained weather condition data,
          and then displays the diffusion conditions and forecasts on the
          map. we adopted this system for our emergency measures
          training, and have been verifying its effectiveness in enabling
          us to use the diffusion forecast displayed on the screen to
          promptly identify vulnerable facilities and areas so as to mini-
          mize the damage from chemical disasters. we will work to
          improve the system by, for example, retrieving gas detector
          information.

      efforts for ensuring customer satisfaction
      with the goal of achieving improved customer satisfaction,
      sumitomo chemical switched to a computerized product
      quality information management system in 2002 to handle
      customer complaints and requests in a more timely and
      reliable manner. this system enabled us to reflect feedback
      about our products from customers more accurately and
      effectively in our quality assurance activities.
            each business sector organizes and analyzes the data
      in the system and takes action to prevent the recurrence of
      problems for each individual product. in addition, com-
      plaints or suggestions for improvement from customers
      regarding product quality are shared among our production,
      research, and sales departments for use as basic data for
      providing systematic responses. in fiscal 2005, under our       anti-contamination promotion project team (osaka works)—winner of the
      quality assurance slogan, “ignoring information on quality      president’s quality award

      will lead to customer complaints, so actively respond to it,”
      we encouraged everyone in the company to be more dili-
      gent in utilizing information on quality from our customers.
            in fiscal 2006, we further promoted our efforts to use
      and share information on quality.

    csr procurement initiatives
    csr procurement is a new concept that requires business partners from whom sumitomo chemical
    purchases raw materials and packaging materials (collectively “raw materials”) to implement csr, and
    companies thus implementing csr activities receive priority in terms of purchasing. as the company
    develops its business globally, it is encouraging its group companies both in japan and overseas to
    implement csr procurement with the aim of globalizing this practice.

chemical’s tokyo head office in february 2007. at the
meeting, the company explained its csr initiatives and the
concept of csr procurement to the purchasing sectors of
five overseas group companies (including those in charge
of sourcing suppliers), and requested their cooperation
going forward.

with the introduction of csr procurement, sumitomo
chemical has, since march 2007, developed various rules,
including purchasing rules, an amendment of the raw
material purchasing operation rules and the csr

       social activities

       as a member of society, sumitomo chemical strives to
       enhance its relationships with local communities and
       employees.




           hand in hand with employees
           sumitomo chemical is working to create a workplace environment in which individual employees can
           make the most of their motivation and skills, and to eliminate discrimination from every aspect of corpo-
           rate activity, in the spirit of the u.n. global compact.

       key human resource objectives

       as its business expands globally, sumitomo chemical has          3) utilizing a diverse workforce suited to operations
       set out three priority human resource objectives: 1) to          the company’s philosophy regarding workforce utilization

       abilities in their work and enjoy a sense of purpose and sat-    force in a planned manner that will enable it to respond

                                                                        to hand down its technology to future generations.
       1) appointing competent personnel to appropriate
           positions
       employee placement is reviewed comprehensively to
       ensure that employees are engaged in work to which they
       are most ideally suited. in addition to accurately identifying
       the aptitude of each employee, the company is making
       institutional improvements so that employees are assigned
       to those areas in which they demonstrate the most apti-
       tude, enabling them to perform their duties with enthusiasm
       and to enjoy a sense of purpose and satisfaction in their
       work and lives, with the result that they enhance the vigor
       of the company as a whole.

       2) operating in an increasingly global business world
       in today’s increasingly global business world, sumitomo
       chemical now has 43 overseas affiliates, with a total over-
       seas workforce of approximately 7,000 persons, a figure          global leader training
       greater than the non-consolidated sumitomo chemical’s
       own total workforce (5,703 employees as of march 31,
       2007). as the company pursues large-scale overseas proj-
       ects such as the rabigh project, the number of employees
       working overseas is destined to increase further, as will the
       percentage of foreign nationals employed by the company.
       sumitomo chemical is also endeavoring to hire and train
       personnel capable of playing an active role on the interna-
       tional stage as it confronts its human resources needs
       stemming from the globalization of its business operations.
