as a life-long peninsula resident, i understand
the important role our bus, paratransit, and
shuttle services play in maintaining our quality
of life and sustaining the economic vitality
of our region. serving over 40,000 riders
each day in san mateo county, samtrans is
committed to supporting a more sustainable
region by providing affordable, accessible,
environmentally-friendly mobility options to
move people where they live, work, and play.

corporate responsibility is vital for any
organization, especially one impacting
thousands of riders and hundreds of buses
a day; its sustainability programs must focus
both on its own operational impacts on the
environment, as well as promoting a similar
ethic within its customers and communities.
i recognize the importance of samtrans’
sustainability efforts to help improve air
quality within the bay area.

in fy2017, samtrans elected to participate in a community choice energy program that will provide samtrans
facilities with electricity from 100 percent renewable sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal. in addition,
the samtrans board-adopted fy2017 capital budget includes investment in a pilot program to procure, operate,
and maintain samtrans’ first fully-electric buses. both actions will reduce pollution and climate-changing
emissions within the bay area.

i am pleased to share this sustainability report, which summarizes our performance between fy2010 and
fy2016, highlights key accomplishments, and identifies planned initiatives.

sincerely,

jim hartnett

  this sustainability inventory and report focuses specifically on the facilities, fixed-route bus, paratransit, and shuttle services under the
operational control of samtrans. this inventory also includes indicators for non-revenue vehicles and employee commuting across all three district
units due to overlapping roles. the district has prepared a separate sustainability inventory and report for caltrain operations that does not include
either non-revenue vehicles or employee commuting to avoid double-counting.

  includes rog, nox, co, pm10, and pm2.5.

  these data were either not available or incomplete. for the purposes of consistency with the rest of the inventory, ghg emissions from waste
between fy2010 and fy2013 were assumed to be the same as data in fy2014.

employee commuting
employee commuting vmt and associated ghg and criteria air pollutant emissions were calculated for the sake of
completeness. as shown in figure 3 above, employee commute contributes approximately 5 percent of total samtrans
ghg emissions. however, because of data limitations, several important assumptions apply: for any samtrans employee in
fy2016, emissions were estimated based on the anonymized zip code for each employee.
the total number of employees per work location were provided for certain years and used to interpolate values for
remaining years. furthermore, it is assumed that all employees were employed full time, and the vehicle mix was based on a
region-average vehicle mix from the california air resources board’s emission factor database (emfac 2014). the american
community survey (acs) was used to estimate the share of employees who drive in single occupancy vehicles, carpool, and
take alternative modes such as transit, walking, or biking. according to a the 2014 acs, 65.7 percent of bay area residents
drive alone and 9.9 percent carpool (acs 2014). for samtrans, the actual percentage of employees driving personal
vehicles may be lower, due to the agency’s transit-oriented workforce and headquarters located in close proximity to transit
stations. in the future, samtrans may choose to use an employee commute survey to improve the agency’s estimate.

in response to california’s historic drought,
samtrans has reduced water use by nearly 50
percent from fy2014 to fy2016, by adjusting
exterior wash schedules, reducing landscape
irrigation, installing high-efficiency faucet
aerators, promptly fixing leaks, and providing
water-savings tips in restaurants and kitchens.
samtrans recycles 70-85 percent of the water
used to wash buses.
