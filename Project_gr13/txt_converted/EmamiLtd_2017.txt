   fairness creams still continue to be the biggest revenue generator in the skin care
   category. the indian skin care segment has grown at a cagr of 16.4% between
   2011 & 2015, and is projected to double by 2021. the total market for fairness
   creams (for men and women) is estimated at h3,000 crore, compared with h1,500
   crore a decade ago. (source: economic times)
   the insight to spin off a brand-new male grooming segment came from one
   product – fairness creams. in 2005, after ﬁnding out that over 30% consumers of
   fairness creams were men, emami launched fair and handsome - a fairness cream
   for men in india, which led to a paradigm shift in the indian fmcg market.

drivers of our business
 sales and distribution
 distribution enhances the
 availability of products and skus
 across relevant trade channels. the
 distribution mechanism acts like
 an ‘internal’ customer who shifts
 the goods from the organisation to
 the seller at a ‘transfer price’. based
 on this understanding, emami has
 worked tirelessly towards creating
 and sustaining a distribution
 network that promises long-term
 business growth.

management
emami institutionalised a strong risk management process to build a strong risk
management culture. the risk management process at emami revolves around
establishing a context, identifying key risks, undertaking mitigation measures,
monitoring their impact and preparing reports.
emami’s risk management team regularly evaluates emerging risks, prioritises them
and works on mitigating them. while deﬁning and developing a formalised risk
management process, leading risk management standards and practices were taken
into account.

     (c) property, plant & equipment
         property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
         impairment loss, if any. the cost of property, plant & equipment comprises of its purchase price, including

         speciﬁcally for acquisition of capital assets are capitalised till the start of commercial production.
         depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets and are in
         line with the requirements of part c of schedule ii of the companies act, 2013. the estimated useful lives
         are as follows:
         building                           30-60 years
         plant & machinery*                     15 years

                                                                                      annual report 2016-17 | 163

accounting policy
       advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each balance
       sheet date is classiﬁed as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not put
       to use before such date are disclosed under ‘capital work in progress’. the cost and related accumulated
       depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset and the
       resultant gains or losses are recognized in the statement of proﬁt & loss. the method of depreciation,
       useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each ﬁnancial year end.

   (d) investment property
       investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs and are stated at cost less
       accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any.

       the cost includes the cost of replacing parts and borrowing costs for long-term construction projects
       if the recognition criteria are met. when signiﬁcant parts of the investment property are required to be
       replaced at intervals, the company depreciates them separately based on their speciﬁc useful lives. all
       other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the statement of proﬁt & loss as incurred.

       the company depreciates building component of investment property on the straight line method over
       the estimated useful life of 60 years from the date of original purchase and are in line with the requirements
       of part c of schedule ii of the companies act, 2013.

   (e) intangible assets
       intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. intangible assets acquired
       in a business combination is valued at their fair value at the date of acquisition. following initial recognition,
       intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if
       any.

       the useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite.

       intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
       whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the amortisation period and
       the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life are reviewed at the end of each
       reporting period. the amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the
       statement of proﬁt & loss. the company amortises intangible assets over their estimated useful lives
       using the straight line method. the estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

       softwares & licences                                    6 years
       brand, trademarks and copy rights                  5 - 10 years

       intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,
       either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. the assessment of indeﬁnite life is reviewed annually
       to determine whether the indeﬁnite life continues to be supportable. if not, the change in useful life from
       indeﬁnite to ﬁnite is made on a prospective basis.

       gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between
       the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of
       proﬁt & loss when the asset is derecognised.

       research and development cost
       expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred.
       development costs are also charged to statement of proﬁt & loss unless a product’s technical feasibility
       studies identify that the project will deliver future economic beneﬁts and these beneﬁts can be measured
       reliably. the amount capitalised comprises expenditure that can be attributed or allocated on a reasonable

                                                 corporate governance report                     financial statements




accounting policy
      and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended use. capitalised
      development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
      losses, if any.

  (f) business combination
      business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions
      of ind as 103, business combinations. the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the
      considerations transferred at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred
      to the company. the cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.
      identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
      measured at their fair value on the date of acquisition. acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

      goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred,
      over the net identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. if the fair value of the net assets acquired is
      in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in oci and accumulated
      in equity as capital reserve.

  (g) financial instruments
      initial recognition
      the company recognizes ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities when it becomes a party to the
      contractual provisions of the instrument. all ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on
      initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. transaction
      costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities, that
      are not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. regular way
      purchase and sale of ﬁnancial assets are accounted for at trade date.

      subsequent measurement
      a. non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments
         (i) financial assets carried at amortised cost -
             a ﬁnancial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model
             whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and the contractual
             terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of
             principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

           (ii) financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income -
                a ﬁnancial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
                if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual
                cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on
                speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal
                amount outstanding. the company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which
                are classiﬁed as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other
                comprehensive income based on its business model.

           (iii) financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss -
                 a ﬁnancial asset which is not classiﬁed in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued
                 through proﬁt or loss.




                                                                                        annual report 2016-17 | 165

accounting policy
              (iv) financial liabilities -
                   financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method,
                   except for contingent consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently
                   measured at fair value through proﬁt and loss. for trade and other payables maturing within one
                   year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short
                   maturity of these instruments.

              (v) investment in subsidiaries-
                  investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate ﬁnancial statements.

         b.   derivative ﬁnancial instruments
              the company holds derivative ﬁnancial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option
              contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. such
              derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative
              contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss and the
              resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income.

              derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments
              the company derecognizes a ﬁnancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the
              ﬁnancial asset expire or it transfers the ﬁnancial asset and the transfer qualiﬁes for derecognition under
              ind as 109. a ﬁnancial liability (or a part of a ﬁnancial liability) is derecognized from the company's
              balance sheet when the obligation speciﬁed in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

   (h) fair value of financial instruments
       the company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient
       data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising
       the use of unobservable inputs. all methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of
       value, and such value may never actually be realized.
         all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are
         categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
         signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
         level 1 — quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
         level 2 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
         measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
         level 3 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
         measurement is unobservable.

   (i)   impairment
         impairment is recognized based on the following principles:
         (i) financial assets: the company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ecl)
             model for the ﬁnancial assets which are not fair valued through proﬁt or loss. loss allowance for trade
             receivables with no signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component is measured at an amount equal to life time ecl.
             for all other ﬁnancial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12 month
             ecl, unless there has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case
             those are measured at life time ecl. the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required
             to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognised as
             an impairment gain or loss in proﬁt or loss.

accounting policy
        (ii) non-financial assets: goodwill and intangible assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject
             to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment , or more frequently if events or changes in
             circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. other assets are tested for impairment whenever
             events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
             an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its
             recoverable amount.the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs of disposal
             and value in use. for the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level
             for which there are separately identiﬁable cash inﬂows which are largely independent of the cash
             inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets (cash- generating unit) non- ﬁnancial assets other than
             goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end
             of reporting period.

  (j)   provisions
        provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation as a result of a past event, for
        which it is probable that a cash outﬂow will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the
        amount of the obligation. contingent liabilities are disclosed when the company has a possible obligation
        or a present obligation and it is probable that a cash outﬂow will not be required to settle the obligation.
        provisions & contingent liabilities are revalued at each balance sheet date.

  (k) inventory
      the inventories are valued at cost or net realisable value whichever is lower except for work in progress
      and advertising material which are valued at cost. the cost is calculated on weighted average method.
      cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to its
      location and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity.

  (l)   foreign currency transactions & translations
        the functional currency of emami limited is indian rupee. these financial statements are presented in
        indian rupee (rounded off to the nearest lacs).
        transactions in foreign currencies entered into by the company are accounted at the exchange rates
        prevailing on the date of the transaction. gains & losses arising on account of realisation are accounted
        for in the statement of proﬁt & loss.
        in accordance with ind as 101, the company has elected to capitalize exchange differences arising
        on long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as on 31st march, 2015 in accordance
        with paragraph 46a of accounting standard 11, ""the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates"".
        accordingly, exchange differences arising from such long term foreign currency monetary items relating
        to the acquisition of a depreciable asset are added to or deducted from the cost of the depreciable capital
        asset. other exchange differences are recognized as income or expenses in the statement of proﬁt &
        loss.
        monetary assets & liabilities in foreign currency that are outstanding at the year end are translated at the
        year end exchange rates and the resultant gain/loss is accounted for in the statement of proﬁt & loss.

       of funds. borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to
       the borrowing costs.

   (o) leases
       leases under which the company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed
       as ﬁnance leases. when acquired, such assets are capitalized at fair value or present value of the minimum
       lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. lease payments under operating leases
       are recognized as an expense on a straight line basis in net proﬁt in the statement of proﬁt & loss over the
       lease term.

      deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the
      tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the
      deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction
      that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss at the time of
      the transaction. deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that
      it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realized.

      deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted
      or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the
      years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of changes
      in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period
      that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. a deferred income tax asset is recognized
      to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the deductible
      temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. deferred income taxes are not provided on the
      undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary
      or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. the company offsets current tax assets and
      current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where
      it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

        ind-as 101 allows ﬁrst-time adopters certain exemptions from thereto respective application of certain
        requirements under ind as. the company has accordingly applied the following exemptions:

       (a) business combination
           in accordance with ind as 101, the company has elected not to restate business combinations that
           occurred before the date of transition i.e 1st april 2015. in view of the same, the indian gaap carrying
           amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under ind as, is their deemed cost
           at the date of the acquisition. after the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with
           respective ind as.

       (b) property plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment properties
           in accordance with ind as 101, the company has elected to continue with the carrying values under
           previous gaap for all the items of property, plant and equipment. the same election has been made
           in respect of intangible assets and investment property also.

           in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements) as at fair value through other comprehensive
           income (fvoci) based on facts and circumstances at the date of transition to ind as (rather than at
           initial recognition). other equity investments are classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt or loss (fvpl).

           the company has opted to avail this exemption to designate certain equity investments as fvoci on
           the date of transition.

       (d) investment in subsidiaries

           under previous gaap, investment in subsidiaries were stated at cost and provisions made to recognise

sensitivity analysis :-
signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation are discount rate, expected
salary increase and mortality. the sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible
changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions
constant. the results of sensitivity analysis is given below:

the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.
there is no change in the method of valuation for the prior period.

effect of plan on entity's future cash flows
a) funding arrangements and funding policy
    the company has purchased an insurance policy to provide for payment of gratuity to the employees. every
    year, the insurance company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by
    the company. any deﬁcit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the company.
for leave, the scheme is partly managed on funded basis.

3.48 financial risk management (contd.)
credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as we generally invest in deposits with banks and ﬁnancial
institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. investments
primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, certiﬁcates of deposit which are funds deposited at a bank
for a speciﬁed time period.

liquidity risk
the company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash ﬂow that is generated
from operations as well as investment in mutual funds. the company believes that the working capital is sufficient
to meet its current requirements. accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.

as of march 31, 2017, the company had a working capital of rs. 7255.24 lacs (p.y. rs. 2747.67 lacs).

      the group depreciates building component of investment property on the straight line method over the
      estimated useful life of 60 years from the date of original purchase and are in line with the requirements
      of part c of schedule ii of the companies act, 2013.

  (f) intangible assets
      intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. intangible assets acquired
      in a business combination is valued at their fair value at the date of acquisition. following initial recognition,
      intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if
      any.

      the useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁnite or indeﬁnite.

      intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment
      whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the amortisation period and
      the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a ﬁnite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of
      each reporting period. the amortisation expense on intangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the
      statement of proﬁt and loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. the
      group amortises intangible assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method. the
      estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

      softwares & licences                                    6 years
      brand, trademarks and copy rights                  5 - 10 years

      intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually,
      either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. the assessment of indeﬁnite life is reviewed annually
      to determine whether the indeﬁnite life continues to be supportable. if not, the change in useful life from
      indeﬁnite to ﬁnite is made on a prospective basis.

      gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between
      the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of
      proﬁt & loss when the asset is derecognised.




                                                                                         annual report 2016-17 | 217

accounting policy
       research and development cost
       expenditure during the research phase of a project is recognised as an expense when incurred.
       development costs are also charged to statement of proﬁt & loss unless a product’s technical feasibility
       studies identify that the project will deliver future economic beneﬁts and these beneﬁts can be measured
       reliably. the amount capitalised comprises expenditure that can be attributed or allocated on a reasonable
       and consistent basis to creating, producing and making the asset ready for its intended use. capitalised
       development costs are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
       losses, if any.

   (g) business combination
       business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions
       of ind as 103, business combinations. the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the
       considerations transferred at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to
       the group. the cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. identiﬁable
       assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured
       at their fair value on the date of acquisition. acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

       goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred,
       over the net identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. if the fair value of the net assets acquired is
       in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in oci and accumulated
       in equity as capital reserve.

   (h) financial instruments
       initial recognition
       the group recognizes ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual
       provisions of the instrument. all ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial
       recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. transaction
       costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities, that
       are not at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. regular way
       purchase and sale of ﬁnancial assets are accounted for at trade date.

       subsequent measurement
       a. non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments
          (i) financial assets carried at amortised cost -
              a ﬁnancial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model
              whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows and the contractual
              terms of the ﬁnancial asset give rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of
              principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

            (ii) financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income -
                 a ﬁnancial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
                 if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual
                 cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancial assets and the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset give
                 rise on speciﬁed dates to cash ﬂows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the
                 principal amount outstanding.the group has made an irrevocable election for its investments
                 which are classiﬁed as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other
                 comprehensive income based on its business model.

accounting policy
             (iii) financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss -
                   a ﬁnancial asset which is not classiﬁed in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued
                   through proﬁt or loss.

             (iv) financial liabilities -
                  financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method,
                  except for contingent consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently
                  measured at fair value through proﬁt and loss. for trade and other payables maturing within one
                  year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short
                  maturity of these instruments.

             (v) investment in subsidiaries-
                 investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate ﬁnancial statements.

        b.   derivative ﬁnancial instruments
             the group holds derivative ﬁnancial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option
             contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. such
             derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative
             contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss and the
             resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income.

             derecognition of ﬁnancial instruments
             the group derecognizes a ﬁnancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the
             ﬁnancial asset expire or it transfers the ﬁnancial asset and the transfer qualiﬁes for derecognition
             under ind as 109. a ﬁnancial liability (or a part of a ﬁnancial liability) is derecognized from the group's
             balance sheet when the obligation speciﬁed in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

  (i)   fair value of financial instruments
        the group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient
        data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising
        the use of unobservable inputs. all methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of
        value, and such value may never actually be realized.
        all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements are
        categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is
        signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
        level 1 — quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
        level 2 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
        measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
        level 3 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signiﬁcant to the fair value
        measurement is unobservable.

  (j)   impairment
        impairment is recognized based on the following principles:
        (i) financial assets: the group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ecl) model
            for the ﬁnancial assets which are not fair valued through proﬁt or loss. loss allowance for trade
            receivables with no signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component is measured at an amount equal to life time ecl.
            for all other ﬁnancial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12 month
            ecl, unless there has been a signiﬁcant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case



                                                                                         annual report 2016-17 | 219

accounting policy
             those are measured at life time ecl. the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required
             to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recognised as
             an impairment gain or loss in proﬁt or loss.

         (ii) non-financial assets: goodwill and intangible assets that have an indeﬁnite useful life are not subject
              to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment , or more frequently if events or changes in
              circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. other assets are tested for impairment whenever
              events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
              an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds
              its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs of
              disposal and value in use. for the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
              level for which there are separately identiﬁable cash inﬂows which are largely independent of the cash
              inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets (cash- generating units) non ﬁnancial assets other than
              goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end
              of reporting period.

   (k) provisions
       provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, for which
       it is probable that a cash outﬂow will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
       the obligation. contingent liabilities are disclosed when the group has a possible obligation or a present
       obligation and it is probable that a cash outﬂow will not be required to settle the obligation. provisions &
       contingent liabilities are revalued at each balance sheet date.

   (l)   inventory
         the inventories are valued at cost or net realisable value whichever is lower except for work
         in progress and advertising material which are valued at cost. the cost is calculated on weighted
         average method. cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such
         inventories to its location and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of
         activity.

         in emami international fze and its subsidiaries cost is determined under fifo method.

       respective local currencies. these financial statements are presented in indian rupee (rounded off to the
       nearest lacs).
         transactions in foreign currencies entered into by the group are accounted at the exchange rates
         prevailing on the date of the transaction. gains & losses arising on account of realisation are accounted
         for in statement of proﬁt & loss.
         in accordance with ind as 101, the group has elected to capitalize exchange differences arising on long-
         term foreign currency monetary items outstanding as on 31st march, 2015 in accordance with paragraph
         46a of accounting standard 11, "the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates". accordingly, exchange
         differences arising from such long term foreign currency monetary items relating to the acquisition of a
         depreciable asset are added to or deducted from the cost of the depreciable capital asset. other exchange
         differences are recognized as income or expenses in the statement of proﬁt & loss.

  (n) employee beneﬁts
      deﬁned contribution plan
      the group makes contributions towards provident fund and superannuation fund to the regulatory
      authorities to a deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plan for qualifying employees, where the group has
      no further obligations. both the employees and the group make monthly contributions to the provident
      fund plan equal to a speciﬁed percentage of the covered employee’s salary.

      in vapi, dongari and masat units the superannuation fund is administered by the life insurance corporation
      of india (lic). under the plan, the group is required to contribute a speciﬁed amount to the retirement
      beneﬁt plan to fund the beneﬁts.

      deﬁned beneﬁt plan
      a. in respect of certain employees, provident fund contributions are made to a trust administered by
         the group. the group's liability is actuarially determined (using the projected unit credit method) at
         the end of the year and any shortfall in the fund size maintained by the trust set up by the group is
         additionally provided for.

           beneﬁts. the company recognizes the net obligation of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan in its balance sheet
           as an asset or liability. gains and losses through re-measurements of the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability/
           (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss in
           subsequent periods. the actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed
           by applying the discount rate used to measure the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is recognized in other
           comprehensive income. the effect of any plan amendments are recognized in the statement of proﬁt
           & loss.

      other long term beneﬁts
      the group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating
      in nature. in vapi, dongari and masat units the leave fund is with life insurance corporation of india.
      the group's liability is actuarially determined using the projected unit credit method at the end of the
      year in accordance with the provision of ind as 19 - employee beneﬁts. the group recognizes the net
      obligation of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan in its balance sheet as an asset or liability. gains and losses through
      re-measurements of the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability/(asset) are recognized in statement of proﬁt & loss.

  (o) borrowing costs
      borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that
      necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as
      part of the cost of the asset. all other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.
      borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing
      of funds. borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to
      the borrowing costs.

  (p) leases
      leases under which the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed




                                                                                    annual report 2016-17 | 221

accounting policy
       as ﬁnance leases. when acquired, such assets are capitalized at fair value or present value of the minimum
       lease payments at the inception of the lease, whichever is lower. lease payments under operating leases
       are recognized as an expense on a straight line basis in net proﬁt in the statement of comprehensive
       income over the lease term.

   (q) government grants
       the group recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions
       attached to them shall be complied with and the grants will be received. grants related to assets are
       treated as deferred income and are recognized as other income in the statement of proﬁt & loss on a
       systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. grants related to income are recognized on a
       systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended
       to compensate and are deducted from the expense in the statement of proﬁt & loss.

   (r) income taxes
       income tax expense is recognized in the statement of proﬁt & loss except to the extent that it relates
       to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.
       provision for current tax is made at the current tax rates based on assessable income.

       deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the
       tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the
       deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction
       that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss at the time of
       the transaction. deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that
       it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realized.

       deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been
       enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income
       in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. the effect of
       changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in
       the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. a deferred income tax asset
       is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the
       deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. deferred income taxes are not provided
       on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the
       subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. the group offsets current tax assets
       and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and
       where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

   (s) cash and cash equivalents
       cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term
       deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of
       changes in value.

       for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash
       and short-term deposits, as deﬁned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are considered an
       integral part of the group’s cash management.

   (t) recent accounting pronouncements
       the ministry of corporate affairs (mca) has issued the company (indian accounting standards) amendment
       rules, 2017 and has amended the following standard,applicable to the group.

accounting policy
   2.1.1 exemptions availed on ﬁrst time adoption of ind-as 101
   ind-as 101 allows ﬁrst-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain
   requirements under ind as. the group has accordingly applied the following exemptions:

   (a) business combination
       in accordance with ind as 101, the group has elected not to restate business combinations that occurred
       before the date of transition i.e 1st april 2015. in view of the same, the indian gaap carrying amounts of
       assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under ind as, is their deemed cost at the date of
       the acquisition. after the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective ind as.

   (b) property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investment properties
       in accordance with ind as 101, the group has elected to continue with the carrying values under previous
       gaap for all the items of property, plant and equipment. the same election has been made in respect of
       intangible assets and investment property also.

   (c) cumulative translation differences
       in accordance with ind as 101, an entity may deem that the cumulative translation differences for all
       foreign operations to be zero as at the date of transition by transferring any such cumulative differences
       to retained earnings. the group has elected to avail of the above exemption.

   (d) designation of previously recognised ﬁnancial instruments
       ind as 101 permits an entity to designate particular equity investments (other than equity investments in
       subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements) as at fair value through other comprehensive income
       (fvoci) based on facts and circumstances at the date of transition to ind as (rather than at initial
       recognition). other equity investments are classiﬁed at fair value through proﬁt or loss (fvpl).

       the group has opted to avail this exemption to designate certain equity investments as fvoci on the date
       of transition.

   (e) non-controlling interests (nci)
       ind as 110 requires that total comprehensive income should be attributed to the owners of the parent
       and the nci even if this results in the nci having a negative balance. ind as 101 requires this requirement
       to be applied prospectively from the date of transition to ind as. the group has elected to apply such
       exemption.

    explanations for reconciliation of proﬁt and loss as previously reported under igaap to ind as
        a. under ind as, revenue from sales of goods is inclusive of excise duty and are net of sales tax, discounts
           and secondary trade promotions. under previous gaap, sales included sales tax but were shown
           net of excise duty. secondary promotions linked to sales were disclosed as part of advertisement &
           promotion under other expenses. field force expenses has been shown as part of employee beneﬁt
           expenses.

        b.    under ind as, grants/subsidy earlier treated as reserve now considered as deferred income and
              amortized to income based on the useful life of assets against which the same was received.

        c.    under ind as, mutual funds, forward & option contracts have been measured at fair valued through
              proﬁt or loss (fvtpl). under ind as, ﬁnancial assets in equity instruments other than investment
              in subsidiaries have been classiﬁed as fair value through other comprehensive income (fvtoci)
              through an irrevocable election at the date of transition.

        d.    under ind as, actuarial gain/loss on gratuity routed through other comprehensive income instead
              of proﬁt or loss.

        e.    acquisition related costs expensed off instead of being capitalized with intangible assets.

        f.    ind as 110 requires that total comprehensive income should be attributed to the owners of the
              parent and the nci even if this results in the nci having a negative balance. ind as 101 requires this
              requirement to be applied prospectively from the date of transition to ind as.

              there were no signiﬁcant reconciliation items between cash ﬂows prepared under igaap and those
              prepared under ind as.

sensitivity analysis :-
signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation are discountrate,expected
salary increase and mortality.the sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible
changes of the assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions
constant. the results of sensitivity analysis is given below:

the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the deﬁned beneﬁt
obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.
there is no change in the method of valuation for the prior period.

effect of plan on entity's future cash flows
a)      funding arrangements and funding policy
the group has purchased an insurance policy to provide for payment of gratuity to the employees. every year,the
insurance company carries out a funding valuation based on the latest employee data provided by the group. any
deﬁcit in the assets arising as a result of such valuation is funded by the group.
for leave , the scheme is partly managed on funded basis.

b)     expected contribution during the next annual reporting period

focus is to foresee the unpredictability of ﬁnancial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its
ﬁnancial performance. the primary market risk to the group is foreign exchange risk. the group uses derivative
ﬁnancial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures.

instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange
rates on foreign currency exposures.

credit risk
credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a ﬁnancial loss. the maximum
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to rs. 9701.27
lacs and rs. 12876.65 lacs as of march 31, 2017 and march 31, 2016, respectively. trade receivables includes
both secured and unsecured receivables and are derived from revenue earned from domestic and overseas
customers. credit risk has always been managed by the group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits
and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the group grants credit terms in the
normal course of business.

credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as we generally invest in deposits with banks and ﬁnancial
institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. investments
primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, certiﬁcates of deposit which are funds deposited at a bank
for a speciﬁed time period.

liquidity risk
the group's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash ﬂow that is generated from
operations as well as investment in mutual funds. the group believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet
its current requirements. accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.

as of march 31, 2017, the group had a working capital of rs. 6993.14 lacs (p.y:- rs. 2166.92 lacs).
