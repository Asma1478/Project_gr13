significant events during the financial year

       transactions
                               the largest transaction during the year was the acquisition of tribona, which was successfully
                                  integrated into catena’s operations. of the acquired operations, eight properties that were
                                    not pure logistics properties or otherwise deemed to have a limited strategic interest were
                                     divested. these divestments, together with the divestment of two finished properties located
                                      in gothenburg, freed up resources for strategic acquisitions of 12 different properties in
                                      attractive locations besides tribona. they have also broadened the company’s customer
                                     base in malmö, östersund and stockholm, among others. the transactions together with
                                   the investments made in property development increased the value of catena’s property
                                 portfolio by around 125 percent to about sek 10.8 billion, with a potential for improved profit
                            from property management.

property development
during the year, catena invested sek 529 million with the aim of continuously improving
its logistics facilities, developing its customer offering and broadening the customer base.
besides customer-specific developments, the year’s investments were steered towards
nässjö among others where a new volume terminal like the one built in katrineholm was
built close to a container terminal. other investments were channelled towards growing
e-commerce in ängelholm among other locations where the construction of e-city engel-
holm was begun, increasingly important food logistics mainly located in the malmö region,
and towards bring’s new crossdocking terminal in mölndal.

       property management
                     as a result of the larger property portfolio and the company’s ambitions regarding closer customer
                         contact, a new business structure was introduced during the year with five regions with local
                           organisations. their task is to monitor the development in their region, maintaining contact
                            with the region’s decision makers and above all assist new and existing customers in the
                            scope of property development and logistics. the latter tends to become increasingly
                            extensive with a broader offering that, for example, includes security solutions, adminis-
                            tration and furnishing that can comprise everything from simple pallet racks to automation
                           of stock management. it is in light of a continued broadening of the offer that the recruitment
                        of a new deputy ceo, benny thögersen, who has extensive experience of logistics and ware-
                    house automation, should be viewed.

       the development of faster, better and smarter logistics is driven by global trends,
       such as the growing urbanisation with more and more people in our urban areas,
       new consumption and purchasing patterns, greater interest in the environment and
       the technical development that allows better transparency and efficiency.

                 urbanisation with ever larger cities and new retailing

         clear trends driving the market forward
         according to the national institute of economic research’s (nier) december forecast,
         swedish gdp increased in fixed prices by 3.4 percent in 2016, driven mainly by private
         and public consumption and investments, especially in homes. in 2017, gdp growth
         is expected to slow to 2.2 percent, mainly as a result of lower investments and public
         consumption. continued good private consumption and the export trend contribute
         positively, which is reflected in a weakly growing industrial production.

         active project development
         catena’s management portfolio continuously generates stable cash flows that strengthen
         the company’s already strong financial position. this together with the new share issues
         conducted during the year provide the company good possibilities for transactions and an
         active project development. this way, catena can meet growing demand, broaden the cus-
         tomer base, establish new locations and realise its expressed ambition of continued growth.

         attractive project portfolio
         following several years of collaboration with qualified
         advisors, catena has a good understanding of where cargo
         from different parts of the world arrives in scandinavia
         and how it is redistributed. catena invests actively in
         both existing and new logistics locations at strategically
         selected points. not infrequently, the first building in a
         logistics location is a terminal from which a large number
         of companies can distribute their products to end users
         via logistics warehouses and distribution centres. catena
         usually establishes city logistics locations and distribution
         warehouses on the outskirts of population centres when
         the detailed development plan is complete. in this way,
         the development process can be focused on solutions to
         further enhance the tenant’s earnings and environmental
         performance. this means that catena has considerable
         opportunities to offer new and existing tenants attractive
         logistics locations.
              today, the company’s project portfolio, either under
         its own auspices or in partnerships with others, land,
         development rights and options with developable space
         for different logistics properties. development rights and
         options represent a capital-efficient method for safeguard-
         ing a project portfolio that can be activated when the time
         is right and the customer is in place.
              the portfolio contains two large part-owned properties:
         one in malmö that offers a total developable property area
         of 270,000 square metres and one in helsingborg, offering
         an equal area. the portfolio also included well-positioned
         projects that have reached various stages ranging from
         rent negotiations to detailed development planning, in                                                      catena’s logistics positions

        improved earnings with
        strong cash flow continue
         the financial effect of the tribona acquisition is clear. the higher rental income
         together with efficiency enhancements had a positive effect on the net operating
         surplus. a higher profit from property management is also reflected in a higher
         cash flow. this gives catena good possibilities to both pay a sound dividend to the
         shareholders and continued active development of the operations.

the following amounts are at the disposal of the annual

total                                     2,001,602,760.67

the board of directors and ceo propose that
the amount be allocated as follows:

total                                     2,001,602,760.67

the board of directors’ statement pursuant to
chapter 18, section 4 of the swedish companies act
the board of directors’ proposal
in the proposed appropriation of earnings, the board of
directors proposes to the 2017 annual general meeting
that catena pay a dividend of sek 3.50 per share for the
2016 financial year, which entails a total dividend pay-
ment of sek 125,074,271 (99,706,518). from the annual
accounts it can be seen that catena’s consolidated equity
ratio amounts to 31.6 percent. following the proposed
dividend, the consolidated equity ratio is expected to be
approximately 30.9 percent. one of catena’s financial
targets is that the consolidated equity ratio should be a
minimum of 30 percent.

explanatory statement by the board
in light of the aforementioned, the board believes that the
proposed dividend to shareholders is warranted consider-
ing the stipulations in chapter 17, section 3, paragraph
2 and 3 of the swedish companies act. the board is of
the opinion that there is full cover for the company’s
restricted equity following the proposed dividend. after the
proposed dividend, the board believes that the company’s
and group’s equity and liquidity will be sufficient con-
sidering the nature, scope and risk of the operations. the
board is of the opinion that the proposed dividend will
not affect catena’s capacity to meet its short or long-term
commitments. moreover, the board believes that the in-
vestments required for the company’s operations will not
be adversely impacted. as regards the company’s earnings
and overall financial position in other regards, please refer
to the financial statements further on in this report and the
notes to the financial statements on pages 68-73.               sothönan 3, katrineholm.

the year was characterised by a significant expansion. in addition to the acquisition of
tribona, we bought 12 other logistics properties. we were able to finance this using divest-
ments of properties that we no longer deemed to be strategic and a new share issue at
terms advantageous to both investors and catena, which was oversubscribed four times.
consistent governance of the company contributed to these transactions being able to be
successfully carried out.

following catena’s development for a decade. the work
of recent years has been a journey, from a company with
one project property, to the leading property company
in logistics properties. a period that was characterised
by a clear focus on value creation. since 2013, we have
streamlined and developed the company’s mixed prop-
erty portfolio, which at the time contained a stock of
logistics properties. the company’s expertise in the field
was already extensive. today, the company is not only
leading, but also the largest in the field. this is a devel-
opment fully in line with the board’s overall mission: to
build a financially strong and profitable company that can
generate a sound and stable return for the shareholders.

          opportunities associated with all commercial operations, and thereby generate value
          for shareholders and other stakeholders at the same time. through transparency and
          availability, our shareholders and other stakeholders are provided insight into decision
          paths, responsibility, powers and control systems.
