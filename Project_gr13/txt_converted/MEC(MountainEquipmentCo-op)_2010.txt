2009 interim report

our report is changing
we are changing our approach to reporting
(which is how we hold ourselves accountable
to our goals). so far, mec has published
two comprehensive accountability reports,
covering 2004  –  05 and 2006  –  07. in the
future, we want our reporting to be more
timely, better influence future change by
aligning with our overarching mec strategy,
and communicate our results in a more
engaging way.

that is why, in 2011, we will move to a
web-based report, along with quarterly
“dashboard” updates. in 2011, you’ll be
able to find all of the information you would
get in past reports, but in a more interactive
and timely way. a group of stakeholders
representing members, staff, environmental
and human rights advocacy groups, supply
chain and industry peers will give input on
our content, as well as the way in which
we present it. we will continue to use the
global reporting initiative and aa1000
for guidance.

in the meantime, this shorter report is
an interim measure covering the years
2008– 09 and is intended to keep you up to
date as we move to our new model. here,
we invite you to explore where we’ve been,
see our progress over the last two years,
and find out where we’re going.

our approach
our charter tells the story of why we exist, who we are, what guides our actions,
and where we want to go. our long-term goals articulate three focus areas where
we want to create long-term change, while being the most vibrant and viable outdoor
retail business in canada:

active canadians
to increase participation in self-propelled wilderness-oriented recreation in canada.
this is our core reason for being.

conservation
to support the creation and stewardship of a comprehensive network of parks,
wilderness, and outdoor recreation opportunities in canada. wild places are where
our members play, and are life support systems for the planet.

marketplace change
to foster change toward environmental, social, and economic sustainability in the
marketplace. this recognizes our role as a business.

                                                  had been audited within the previous 18 months (kpi 2.1). during this time we
                                                  found 229 code violations. seven percent (five factories) were not audited; we will
                                                  undertake these audits in 2010. the remaining 18% were consciously excluded
                                                  because they were either:

kpi 2.2 audited mec-brand factories            are we improving the lives of factory workers?
with black rated violations (#)                in 2008, we developed an approach to prioritize non-compliance issues and
                                               develop strategic responses. to rate factories, we grouped violations into four
             42
                                               categories: black (zero tolerance), red (potential harm), orange (poor practices),
                                               and yellow (minor). our efforts focus on two fronts: eliminating “black” violations,
                                               and building capacity among strategic factories.

                                               in 2009, 21% of our audited factories (12 of 58)1 had black violations (kpi 2.2),
                                               including: using unauthorized subcontractors, mandating workers to work overtime,
                                               and requiring migrant workers to surrender their passports.2 while these violations

                                               our approach to ethical sourcing is becoming deeper and more comprehensive,
                                               based on understanding trends and industry collaboration. we focus on key
                                               factories for intensive remediation, while ensuring a more consistent level of
                                               monitoring across the remaining factories. in 2009, this involved nine major
                                               initiatives (kpi 2.3):

                                               minimizing hazardous conditions
                                               we established intensive environment, health & safety (ehs) projects with two
                                               factories (which make bicycles and wet suits). this involved redesigning key
                                               processes to minimize hazardous conditions and training line managers to
                                               implement better ehs practices.

                                               management capacity building
                                               we worked with two suppliers to actively integrate worker committees into factory
                                               management practices, with oversight by an independent third party (like the fair
                                               labor association).

                                               industry collaboration
                                               we developed joint projects with five other brands to achieve greater impact
                                               on mutual factories. as we add vendors and manufacturing moves offshore, this
                                               becomes a bigger challenge.
