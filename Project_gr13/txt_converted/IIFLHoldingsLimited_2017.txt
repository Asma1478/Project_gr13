mutual fund penetration in india and developing economies is quite low as compared to the developed economies (shown in figure 12).
the global asset management industry is witnessing a gradual shift in flows from traditional mutual funds to alternative products. passive
investing and liquid alternative mutual funds are getting more popular in the western markets. as per a report by consultancy ey, the mutual
fund aum-to-gdp ratio in india is low at 7%; and mutual fund investments accounted for only 3.4% of total investments in financial assets by
individual investors in fy15. this underlines the significant untapped potential for growth in the indian mutual fund industry.
