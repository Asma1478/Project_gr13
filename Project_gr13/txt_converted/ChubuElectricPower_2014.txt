    measures implemented at the hamaoka
    nuclear power station
     as stated in the basic energy plan issued by the cabinet in april 2014, the japanese government regards nuclear power
     as an important base-load power source that contributes to the stability of the energy demand-supply structure. for
     japan, which has scarce energy resources, to ensure stable energy supply on a long-term basis and solve global envi-
     ronmental issues, it is considered indispensable to use nuclear power plants while giving ﬁrst priority to safety.



                                                we have been implementing measures for the hamaoka nuclear power station,
                                                giving ﬁrst priority to nuclear safety.

                                                       to the request, in consideration of the public concerns over nuclear power generation,

                                                           nonetheless, in order to ensure the stability of power supply in japan, which has

                            in nuclear power
      in order to autonomously and continuously improve the safety of nuclear power, we have formulated a ‘road map’ compil-
      ing measures and schedules.
          on july 1, 2014, the chubu electric power company group’s charter on nuclear safety was established, a charter
      that reflects our stance and ethos concerning nuclear safety initiatives. simultaneously, we established the nuclear
      safety improvement committee, which will be led by the president and ceo. in addition, we will attempt to strengthen
      governance through the launch of an advisory board that will put to good use the opinions of external experts, and
      promote initiatives that will provide a pillar for boosting risk management and strengthening risk communication.

implementing measures to further improve the safety of the hamaoka
nuclear power station
 chubu electric power is taking a two-pronged approach to increase the safety of the hamaoka nuclear power station. while
 conducting measures on equipment in line with the new regulatory standards to prevent the occurrence of nuclear accidents
 and to mitigate the impacts and restore the station to its normal status as quickly as possible in the event of a disaster, we are
 also strengthening our anti-disaster measures.
enhancing anti-disaster measures
 in order to prevent abnormal radioactive emissions in the event of an incident at the nuclear power station and to suppress
 and mitigate the impact in the event of such emissions, we are establishing the necessary system and manuals and securing
 the requisite goods and materials. we will also continue to conduct drills to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and
 improve our ability to respond to disasters, while enhancing cooperation with the national and local governments and thereby
 increasing the practicality of our anti-disaster measures.

 disaster management system
 we have a disaster management system, based on which we will establish         ■ disaster management system

    implementing further measures on equipment based on new ﬁndings and
    regulations in addition to conventional measures
      chubu electric power has long been committed to improving the safety of the hamaoka nuclear power station based on new
      ﬁndings. with this strong commitment we are implementing measures on equipment in line with the new regulatory standards
      and based on ﬁndings obtained from the accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station.

                                                   measures against earthquakes
    the hamaoka nuclear power station is designed
    to have high seismic resistance, and we are also
    implementing measures against the triple-interre-
    lated tokai, tonankai and nankai earthquakes.
        further, in line with the new regulatory stan-
    dards set by the nuclear regulation authority
    and also in consideration of the various ground
    motion ampliﬁcations identiﬁed in the premises
    based on the ground motion evaluation, we set
    new ground motion parameters. at present, we
    are working on alterations of the supports for
    conduit pipes and electric cables as well as on                                      support (reinforcement)

 ■ examples of opinions given by customers
 ● all necessary safety measures should be taken at the power station to prevent the
    occurrence of an accident similar to the one caused by the tsunami in the great east
    japan earthquake, even if a tsunami of the same size hits the region.
 ● the electric power company provided me with a good opportunity to think about
    nuclear power. i felt it is essential for the company to further improve its technologies
    and enhance the facilities to ensure 120% safety.                                                           visit to a customer

■ rise of electricity rates for customers in the deregulated sector
for customers in the deregulated sector, we had decided to raise the rates by an average of 8.44% from april 1, 2014, but
changed the markup rate to 7.21% in consideration of the approval given by the government.


                                                  measures to improve management efﬁciency
we are making an all-out effort to reduce the procurement costs for materials, equipment and services, improve the efficiency
of thermal power generation, procure fuels at cheaper prices, and increase operational efficiency, so that we can improve our
management efficiency as we planned in estimating the power supply cost in consideration of the government’s strict assessment
policies for the approval of electricity rates.
    we will continue to implement measures for higher management efficiency to achieve a low-cost structure and increase our
competitiveness in the market.

                            for the measures we are taking to improve heat efficiency, please refer to “aggressive adoption of high-efficiency
                            combined-cycle power generation systems” on page 26, and for the measures to procure fuels at reasonable prices,
                            please refer to “more reliable, economical and flexible fuel procurement” on page 23.


reducing procurement costs by standardizing speciﬁcations
we will standardize machinery specifications, which each electric power company has independently set, thereby reducing
procurement costs.

     improvement of operational efﬁciency through the introduction of smart meters
     chubu electric power has been promoting the prompt introduction of smart meters. we plan to complete the installation of
     smart meters for general households and other low-voltage customers by ﬁscal 2022, two years and three months earlier than
     initially planned.
          the introduction of smart meters will allow us to automate meter reading and switch on/off electricity and change the con-
     tract capacity by remote control, eliminating the need to work onsite. we will make use of the smart meter functions for higher
     operational efﬁciency and will also optimize the transformer capacity to reduce the amount of capital investment.
          the use of smart meter functions will also help us provide customers with more ﬂexible contract types, support customers in mak-
     ing efﬁcient use of electricity and enable them to see the amount of power they are using, thereby improving our services to them.
          in procuring smart meters, we will standardize the speciﬁcations and procure them through competitive bidding. also for the
     procurement of smart meter-related systems, we will make full use of external knowledge and the existing infrastructure of other
     electric power companies to save costs, pursue both higher function and higher quality, and also foster cost reductions through
     competitive bidding.

 our replies to opinions and questions raised by customers
              about the rise of electricity rates                                                                            customers




q1   we are already bearing the growing cost of thermal power fuels under the fuel
     cost adjustment scheme, so surely this rise in electricity rates was unnecessary.



 a     the fuel cost adjustment scheme is designed to incorporate changes in fuel prices into electricity rates;
       however, changes in the amount of fuel consumption are not considered under the system.
           at present, the consumption of fuels for thermal power generation is increasing because of the full
       shutdown of the hamaoka nuclear power station, but electricity charges paid by customers have not been
       increased to cover the additional fuel cost caused by higher fuel consumption.
           in order to ensure the safe and stable supply of electricity as our most important corporate mission, we
       decided with regret to raise our electricity rates.




q2   the rise of electricity rates will have a great impact on households’ ﬁnances.
     have you made any efforts to improve contract types in response?



 a     we have added the “peak shift lighting” type and also relaxed the conditions necessary for customers to
       sign an e life plan contract. we will continue making improvements to contract types to provide customers
       with more options from which they can choose one suitable for their lifestyle.
           on our website, we provide a simulator with which customers can compare various contract types based
       on their actual use of electricity, in order to identify the type that will lead to lower electricity charges.
           in the future we will introduce smart meters, which will clearly show the amount of electricity used by
       customers, and based on the findings we will provide customers with more diversified contract types to
       meet their needs.




q3   since you’ve raised electricity rates, surely we don’t need hamaoka nuclear
     power station anymore.



 a     in japan, with its limited energy resources, in order to deal with rising fossil fuel prices and issues like global
       warming and at the same time secure stable energy into the future, we believe that we must continue to utilize
       nuclear power as a vital energy source whilst making a priority of securing safety and the trust of the public.
            with regard to the hamaoka nuclear power station, we are steadily implementing ‘hardware’ safety
       improvement measures starting with our ongoing tsunami and earthquake countermeasures, preparing
       ‘software’ measures on the disaster prevention side and aiming to adapt as quickly as possible to the new
       regulatory criteria. furthermore, with regard to the initiatives of chubu electric power, we believe that
       nothing is more important than conscientiously explaining our activities to local residents and society at
       large, and gaining their understanding.




                                                                                 chubu electric power company group annual report 2014   18

                                                basic ideas on investments

                          at chubu electric power, we anticipate that our difficult financial situation will continue
                          during the ongoing suspension of the operation of the hamaoka nuclear power plant,
                          although the increase of electricity rates is expected to have a positive impact on our balance
                          sheet and cash flow conditions.
                              to fulfill our primary mission, ensuring a safe and stable electricity supply, we will con-
                          tinue to make the utmost effort to further improve safety of the nuclear power plant and
                          take various measures to ensure a stable power supply. we will also pursue better operational
                          efficiency in order to return to profitability at the earliest possible juncture, and strengthen
                          our financial position.
                              at the same time, we will continue to strengthen our efforts to achieve further business
                          growth and build a stronger foundation for sustained future growth, and communicate the
                          progress and achievements of these efforts with our customers and shareholders.



                      indispensable investments for a safe and stable electricity supply
                      we will promptly and steadily implement necessary safety improvement measures for our facilities,
                      including the hamaoka nuclear power station. we will also build facilities that are indispensable for
                      supplying low-carbon, high-quality energy at reasonable prices in a stable manner.
                          we will design and implement these initiatives in such a way as to ensure investment efficiency.


                      strategic investments for business growth and development
                      to build a stronger foundation for sustained growth in the future, we will make strategic investments
                      for business growth and prosperity while managing the associated risks appropriately.
                          we will carefully select strategic investments by strictly adopting rigorous criteria.


                      shareholder return
                      our policy on shareholder return, effective july 30, 2012, is as follows:



                          the company will work to maintain stable dividends after taking account of financial
                          conditions and other factors, while continuously investing in construction and operation of
                          facilities that are essential for a safe and stable supply of electricity.



                      for fy 2013, no dividends were declared due to the continued severe financial situation. we
                      sincerely regret that we were unable to meet the expectations of our shareholders.
                          for fy 2014, our forecast assumes there will be no interim dividends, given the necessity for
                      further improvement of management efficiency and financial strength. a forecast of final dividends
                      of the fiscal year has not been determined yet because it is difficult to make an accurate or
                      reasonable forecast at this point in time.

chubu electric power group: “what we aim for”
                            chubu electric power group: “what we aim for”

             “to be a corporate group that satisﬁes
         all energy-related needs and keeps growing”

on the reform of electricity systems, specific discussions are underway, including the
establishment of an organization for wide-area power system operation in 2015, the proposed
full liberalization of the electricity retail business by around 2016, and the enhancement of
neutrality of the power transmission/distribution sector by around 2018 to 2020.
   with regard to this, chubu electric power believes that a competitive marketplace where
customers can select freely what service to purchase from whom will encourage electric
business operators to innovate and make greater efforts to achieve a stable and efficient
power supply, which will eventually result in creating an even better and more customer-
friendly power system.
   the business environment of the energy sector in japan will go through a sea change in
the future, because the government is considering the reform of not only power systems but
also gas service systems to facilitate more active competition.
   considering these ongoing and upcoming changes as a great opportunity for us, we
will take aggressive actions to ensure stable power supply, provide a wide range of energy
services through competition, and ultimately translate “what we aim for” into reality.

     ensure stable supply of low-carbon, high quality
     energy at reasonable prices
     chubu electric power makes various efforts to ensure stable supply of low-carbon, high quality energy
     at reasonable prices. speciﬁcally, we aim to ensure reliable fuel procurement at lower costs by acquiring
     upstream interests and taking other measures to strengthen the value chain of fuels. we have also started
     to install highly efﬁcient thermal power stations to curb co2 emissions.

     more reliable, economical and flexible fuel procurement

     to growing demand in emerging countries and other causes.                                    which we aim to strengthen the entire fuel value chain
         to address this situation, we are working to procure                                     spanning fuel acceptance and electricity generation.

 message from general manager of fuels department

  we will strive to improve the reliability, ﬂexibility and economic efﬁciency of our
  fuel procurement.
  chubu electric power is one of japan’s largest fuels buyers with annual coal purchase of
  about 10 million tons and annual lng purchase of about 13 million tons. in ﬁscal 2013, fuel
  costs accounted for approximately 50 percent of ordinary expenses.
      in recent years, procuring fuels for electricity generation in a reliable and flexible
  manner and at internationally competitive prices has become even more important, given
  the necessity of responding to wide swings in fuel volume requirements caused by the
  operational status of the hamaoka nuclear power station, the liberalization of the electricity
  market, and other factors.
      in response to such major challenges to our business, we are moving beyond traditional
  fuel purchasing and entering into new ﬁelds, such as fuel transportation and trading, and
  even lng production.
      to fulﬁll our commitment to ensuring stable supply of electricity at reasonable prices,        yuji kakimi

         example
        achieving higher energy efﬁciency and better working environment with an
        arc-type electric heating system
        aisin takaoka co., ltd., a manufacturer of automotive casting parts, wished to improve the
        energy efﬁciency and work environment in its casting processes. to meet the long-felt need by this
        customer, chubu electric power collaborated with toyota motor corporation and tokuden co.,
        ltd. to develop an arc-type ladle heating system, inspired by a “ladle preheating system,” where a
        ﬁre-resistant container called a ladle is used to convey casting iron from the melting furnace to the
        molding line.
            adopting this arc-type electric heating system to replace the conventional system using gas
        burners has led to a reduction in energy consumption of about 75% and in running costs by some
        60%, as well as the improvement of the working environment.
            in recognition of these achievements, we and other co-developers of the system received an                arc-type ladle heating system
                                                                                                                      adopted by aishin takaoka

 message from general manager of customer service division

   we will continue our efforts to offer even better and diversiﬁed services to meet
   customer needs.
   when the retail electricity market in japan is fully liberalized around 2016, all electricity
   users, including household customers, will be able to select their power companies. this is
   expected to spur greater competition across the country and further blur the boundaries
   between energy service categories, such as electricity, gas, and oil.
        anticipating such a future market landscape, we are strengthening our efforts to deliver
   better and more diversiﬁed services. for instance, we have expanded our total energy service,
   an optimal combination of electricity, gas, lng, on-site energy and other necessary sources,
   developed household-related services and other new services, and commenced electricity
   selling and generation in 50-hz areas. aiming to become a trusted and preferred corporate
   group for our customers, we will continue our utmost efforts to meet customer needs.                                     yutaka watanabe

  message from one of our outside directors

   my expectations toward chubu electric power
   when i took the position of outside director, chubu electric power was in the process of
   implementing a management structure reform that involved the reduction of the number
   of directors and the introduction of an executive ofﬁcer system, while focusing on fairness
   and transparency as central management issues. as the company was undergoing this
   change, i felt that my expected role as an outside director was to provide perspectives as a
   person with a broad international view, as a general citizen, and as a woman. i have been
   supporting the innovation of the company from these perspectives ever since.
       although the electric power industry’s main business arena is japan, chubu electric
   power has been actively expanding its presence overseas with a broad international view.
   this actually helped the company to quickly procure additional liquefied natural gas             hideko katsumata

   has been working to create opportunities for women who wish to work more actively by,
   among many other efforts, establishing the female activities promotion ofﬁce* in 2007.
   when i talk with female employees and when i see women working actively in power stations and other sites, i feel that
   diversity awareness has penetrated the company deeply. it is encouraging to see female employees communicating actively

    from may to june 2014, chubu electric power’s management team visited all the company’s places of business as a part of
    the “executive caravan,” and exchanged opinions with personnel about the company’s efforts for enhancing operational
    efficiency following the hike in electricity charges, initiatives for safety measures at the hamaoka nuclear power station, efforts
    to improve management efficiency, responses to the government’s electricity system reform, and other topics.
         the frank exchanges of opinions between the management and personnel help to reduce the sense of distance between
    the boardroom and the workplace, create a sense of unity between them, and lead
    to better motivation among employees.

      securing of a stable electricity supply, and while we feel these are difficult at the
      same time they give us a sense of fulfillment.

        the company established the chubu electric power environmental
        roundtable in order to receive expert advice and suggestions on its
        planned and implemented environmental measures.
            the 12th and 13th events were organized in june 2013 and june
        2014, respectively. in these sessions, committee members visited
        the tokuyama hydroelectric power station in 2013, and mega solar
        shimizu and the higashi-shimizu substation in 2014; following the
        facility tour, they provided their views and advice on our initiatives for
        promoting renewable energies as well as a stable electricity supply.

     basis for calculation
     investments and expenses related to preventing, reducing and/or avoiding environmental impact, removing the impact, putting right any damage, and other activities instrumental to these are measured.
     • beginning with this report, the calculation methods were changed; for example, depreciation and expenses associated with purchase following the introduction of the feed-in tariff scheme for
       renewable energy (july 2012) are excluded. accordingly, the figures for the previous year were recalculated.
     • for the items in environmental conservation costs, “purchase of low environmental impact products, etc.,” “management programs,” “research and development,” and “countermeasures for
       environmental damage” are included in “others.”

     environmental management
     the chubu electric power group implements environmental management activities based
     on the iso 14001 (2004) standards, in line with the group basic environmental policy and
     the action plan that states its environmental action objectives. hamaoka nuclear power
     station has been externally accredited to the international certification criteria and other
     operating sites pursue their own self-declared environmental management activities adapted
     to each type of business. for these activities, third-party inspections are performed as
     necessary to confirm compliance with applicable laws and regulations. in addition, as a way
     to ensure thoroughness of its environmental management, the company has established an
     environmental education system designed to provide training to all employees through the                                                       third-party inspection performed at the insulation

energy saving initiatives
improving energy-saving functions of the company building
chubu electric power’s atsuta building implemented a plan directed
to establish an energy-efficient facility with superior environmental
features for the building’s secondary large-scale renovation project
after its construction in 1971. specifically, the company employed new
co-developed energy source equipment that is highly efficient within
a wide power range, raised efficiency in thermal storage by improving
existing water heater storage tanks, and reviewed and optimized air
conditioning operations based on operating hours and usage. together
with other improvements, we reduced energy consumption of the energy
source equipment and air conditioning system by 54%, and achieved a
17% reduction for the entire building compared to the pre-renovation
level. these achievements were highly evaluated and the building was
given a renewal award by the society of heating, air-conditioning and
                                                                                                             renovated, energy-efficient, atsuta building (atsuta-ku, nagoya city)

     protecting biodiversity
     chubu electric power is endeavoring to protect biodiversity by implementing a range of initiatives that include developing
     relevant technologies, taking measures to protect wildlife in areas surrounding facility construction sites, removing invasive alien
     species, and supporting forest thinning activities.

      ■ environmental assessment for the nishi-nagoya thermal power station refurbishment plan
      nishi-nagoya thermal power station commenced operation in 1970 with units 1 and 2 (220 mw each in capacity) going into
      commission to supply petroleum-fired steam-power generated electricity. following four decades in service since then, playing
      an essential role in ensuring stable electricity supply in and around nagoya city, the power station’s four old units (1-4, with a
      total capacity of 1,190 mw) are planned to be replaced by high-efficiency, lng-fired combined cycle facilities, with a view to
      contributing to conservation of the global environment. for preservation of the local environment, we examined and planned
      a diverse array of measures relating to methods of constructing and operating power generation facilities, and conducted
      environmental impact assessments in accordance with the environmental impact assessment act and
      the electricity business act before launching this project. determining from assessment results that the
      new facilities would pose a minimal risk of causing impact to the surrounding environment, we started
      construction work in january 2014. prior to initiating the work, the evaluation processes and results were
      summarized into an environmental assessment document, which was submitted in august 2013 to be
      published and examined, thereby completing the environmental assessment procedures.
      [comment from the project leader]
          the nishi-nagoya thermal power station refurbishment plan was chubu electric power’s first
      project subjected to environmental assessments in 15 years and the first-ever project subjected to
      environmental assessments made under the environmental impact assessment act that was enacted
                                                                                                                 takashi nagao
      in 1997 (effective in 1999). although few members of the environmental assessment group had senior staff
      experience in such assessments, the group members and relevant employees made concerted efforts environmental assessment
      and successfully completed the almost two-and-a-half year assessment procedures. i now feel a great group
      sense of accomplishment having engaged in the first step of the new plant construction project and environmental affairs
                                                                                                                 department
      seamlessly moved it to the next stage.

      mie university
chubu electric power has offered education programs on the theme of energy and the
environment since 2007 in cooperation with two scholars at mie university, namely, prof.
hye-sook park, executive vice president, and prof. mamoru matsuoka of the faculty of
education. in fiscal 2013, in a unesco world conference partnership project, we organized a
number of plans, specifically, site tours of energy-related facilities for local university students
and environmental activists as well as a curriculum development project in which a total of 13
primary and junior high school teachers developed energy and environment-themed classes
within the existing subject categories (japanese language, social studies, natural science, arts
and crafts, among others).

    comment from a project partner
    pursuing energy development and environmental protection at the same time is not easy. in
    order to accurately understand this complicated issue, comprehensive study from different               mamoru matsuoka
    angles is important. we cannot present simple answers to children, but should help them                 professor
    learn essential viewpoints and approaches to this critical, long-standing theme.                        faculty of education, mie university



2 energy and the environment course at nagoya open
      university of the environment
the company has offered a course focusing on the issue of energy and the environment since
2004, as a partner of nagoya open university of the environment, a local community-business-
government collaborative education project. in fiscal 2013, a total of 47 university and graduate
students attended the course, within which they visit different types of power stations (thermal,
nuclear, solar) and other energy-related facilities and exchanged opinions and views.

    comment from a participant
    since the occurrence of the 2011 disaster-triggered nuclear accident, i have simply supported
    the policy of fully shifting to renewable energies as soon as possible. the course has made
    me realize that the electricity supply issue is more complicated than i thought, involving
    the need to comprehensively consider multiple aspects such as energy security and safety,
    economic efficiency, and environmental conservation.


3 supporting npo activities through the internal eco
      points program
chubu electric power launched an eco points program in 2006, intending to encourage employees
and their families to voluntarily take environmentally aware actions by providing points for a variety
of eco-friendly activities performed at home and in local communities. in 2009 we began to utilize
accumulated eco points to support external social action programs. in fiscal 2013, we gave donations
to eight npos, contributing to mangrove restoration efforts in vietnam, and environmental education
programs for filipino school children, among others, through their activities.
    comment from an npo representative
    we talked to filipino children about chubu electric power’s sympathetic cooperation in the              aya yoshida
    activities when teaching them using instruction materials donated by the company.                       ican (authorized npo)

       chubu electric power has held a procurement overview brieﬁng session every year since 2007. we
       work to organize the event so it will ensure the satisfaction of participants. part of this effort relates
       to selecting agendas. in addition to essential themes to be discussed by the company, we select
       topics expected to meet the interests of participating business partners, and explain them in an
       easy-to-understand manner. for the ﬁscal 2014 agendas, in relation to our procurement plan for
       materials and equipment, two high-proﬁle issues were chosen to be included: the planned increase
       of electricity rates; and the application with the nuclear regulation authority for conformity
       assessment under the new regulatory standards for the hamaoka nuclear power station unit 4.
            another important participant-oriented measure is to conduct feedback questionnaires as
       a means of mutual communication. collected opinions and requests, including complaints and
       criticisms, are precious information that we examine for each issue in order to take improvement

        of our services, chubu electric power actively creates opportunities to listen
        to objective comments and advice from external parties as an approach to
        understanding the customer viewpoint. in june 2014, we held a session to
        exchange opinions with members of the central japan branch of the nippon
        association of consumer specialists (nacs).
        ■ major opinions of participants
        [regarding the explanation on the electricity rate increase to customers]             exchanging opinions with consumer specialists
        • detailed information is provided in chubu electric power’s leaflets and on website;
          however, most people do not read them carefully. i want chubu electric power to provide information in such a way that
          customers can understand the content better and more easily.
        • chubu electric power should know its information materials and notices contain a large amount of jargon and are hard
          for the general public to understand.
        [regarding club katene, a web service for customers (households)]
        • with regard to this service, there are many issues to be solved. for example, membership registration procedures are too
          complex, and some services are available only for a limited time.
        • the service that enables customers to see their past power consumption in a graph format is very helpful. i think chubu
          electric power should publicize this service in a more proactive way.
        [communication efforts regarding important matters such as a nuclear power station]
        • many people have concerns about unexpected events that might affect the nuclear power station. it is preferable that
          chubu electric power discloses information on the risk factors pertaining to the nuclear power station at the time of an
          emergency. such communication efforts will help people engage in in-depth discussion and gain more understanding
          about the nuclear power station.

 i would like to                 the approach proposed as currently the most workable for disposing of high-level radioactive
 know chubu                      nuclear waste is geological disposal. in japan, supporting this internationally accepted theory, the
 electric power’s                nuclear waste management organization of japan (numo) is working as a leading organization
 views on how to                 to develop projects for geological disposal of high-level radioactive nuclear waste.
 dispose of high-level               also, as stated in the recent basic energy policy, the government is expected to spearhead
 radioactive nuclear             efforts for developing geological disposal projects. we think this approach will lead to safe,
 waste resulting                 secure and effective solutions.
 from nuclear power                  chubu electric power will support the government and numo in promoting these projects

    chubu electric power has launched a female customer monitor program in which the company provides information on
    its business and energy plans to women monitors and receives opinions and requests from them. for this purpose, we
    organize various forms of communication opportunities.
        in a recent dialogue session held in january 2014, we explained our future energy policies and electricity rate schemes
    and options to a total of 53 monitors from five prefectures in our service areas (aichi, shizuoka, mie, gifu, nagano). the
    session included a presentation by ms. yumiko nishimoto, director general of happy road net, an npo that proactively
    works to support the reconstruction of fukushima by promoting local development activities including cherry tree planting
                               campaigns. this was followed by a substantial discussion with the participants.
                                        ■ major opinions of participants
                                        • i was impressed by the sincere attitude and efforts of chubu electric power to ensure stable
                                          power supply. i understand the importance of expanding a network of serious efforts for
                                          solving energy issues.
                                        • i am satisfied that a lot of my questions have been answered today. particularly, the
                                          technicalities of the electricity rate scheme, a focus of my concerns, are clear now.
                                        • i suggest that a similar dialogue session can be offered to invite men and children to join
                                          women to discuss things together.

2) nuclear power back-end costs, etc.
the back-end business of nuclear power takes an extremely long time
period and has many uncertainties. to prepare for the future backend
costs, based on the rules set by the government, chubu electric has set
aside provision for reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel and provision for
preparation of the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel.
    even so, the costs of nuclear fuel cycles, including back-end costs,
may vary depending on regulatory reform, changes in estimates of
future expenses (mandated and voluntary), and the operating status of
reprocessing facilities. as a result, company performance may potentially
be affected.
