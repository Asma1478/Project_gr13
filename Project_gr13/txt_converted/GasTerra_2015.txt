explanatory notes to the annual accounts

1   principles for valuation and determination of results

general
the annual accounts have been drawn up in accordance with the statutory provisions of title 9, book 2 of the
dutch civil code (bw). unless otherwise stated, assets and liabilities are recognised at nominal value. the
principles applied as the general basis for the valuation for assets and liabilities and the determination of
results are the historical costs.

comparative figures have been adjusted where required to improve comparison. inter alia, this is the case for
the costs of software where, in the balance sheet for 2013, the costs of software were classified as tangible
assets instead of intangible assets.

an asset is included in the balance sheet when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
company and its value can be reliably determined. a liability is included in the balance sheet when it is
probable that settlement thereof will entail an outflow of resources that embody economic benefits and the
magnitude of the amount thereof can be reliably determined.

income is included in the profit and loss account when an increase of the economic potential related to an
increase in an asset or a decrease of a liability has taken place, the magnitude of which can be reliably
determined. expenses are accounted for when a decrease of the economic potential related to a decrease in
an asset or an increase of a liability has taken place, the magnitude of which can be reliably determined.

if a transaction results in almost all or all of the future economic benefits and all or almost all of the risks
related to an asset or liability being transferred to a third party, the asset or liability is no longer included in
the balance sheet. furthermore, assets and liabilities are not included in the balance sheet from the time at
which the requirements of probability of future economic benefits and/or reliability of the determination of the
value are no longer met.

the income and costs are allocated to the period to which they relate. income is accounted for when all
significant risks relating to the delivery have been transferred to the counterparty.

continuity
these financial accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.

estimates and uncertainties
in preparing these financial accounts, assessments, estimates and assumptions have been made that affect
the amounts accounted for. in particular, this concerns the net sales and cost of sales (including transport
costs). the assessments, estimates and assumptions made are based on market data, knowledge and
experience, and other factors that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances. the actual
results may differ from these estimates. the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually assessed.
revisions of estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods
on which the revision has an impact. potential special features regarding estimates and assessments, if
significant, are included in the notes to the balance sheet and the profit and loss account. as a consequence
of the agreement between the shareholders of gasterra, as explained under the off-balance sheet assets and
liabilities, the deviations from these estimates do not affect the result.

transaction in foreign currencies
transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate applying on the transaction
date.

cash and bank balances, trade receivables and current liabilities in foreign currency are translated at the
exchange rate applying on the date of the balance sheet.

the exchange rate results on gas exports and gas imports arising through translation are allocated under gas
purchases. the other exchange rate results are accounted for under financial income and expenses.

fixed assets
intangible fixed assets
intangible fixed assets are valued at the historical purchase price or production cost, less straight-line
depreciation over the economic life of the assets.

intangible fixed assets that have not been completed as at the balance sheet date are accounted for under
the category intangible fixed assets under construction. after being put into use, the relevant asset will be
classified under the category intangible fixed assets.

the depreciation period used for intangible fixed assets is 5 years. intangible fixed assets under construction
are not depreciated.

tangible fixed assets
tangible fixed assets are valued at the historical purchase price or production cost, less straight-line
depreciation over the economic life of the assets.

tangible fixed assets that have not been completed as at the balance sheet date are accounted for under the
category tangible fixed assets under construction. after being put into use, the relevant asset will be classified
under the category tangible fixed assets.

the depreciation periods applied to tangible fixed assets are between 5 and 10 years. tangible fixed assets
under construction are not depreciated.

impairment
for intangible and tangible fixed assets an assessment is made at every balance sheet date as to whether
there are any indications that these assets are subject to impairment. if any such indications exist, the
recoverable value of the asset is estimated. the recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and the
realisable value. if it is not possible to estimate the realisable value of an individual asset, the realisable value
is determined from the cash-flow generating unit to which the asset belongs.
when the book value of an asset or a cash-flow generating unit exceeds its recoverable value, the difference
between the book value and the realisable value is accounted for as an impairment loss. if there is an
impairment loss of a cash-flow generating unit, the loss is first allocated to goodwill which is allocated to the
cash-flow generating unit. any residual loss is allocated to the other assets of the unit in proportion to their
book values.
furthermore, at each balance sheet date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that an
impairment loss accounted for in previous years has decreased. if any such indications exist, the recoverable
value of the relevant asset or cash-flow generating unit is estimated.
reversal of an impairment loss previously accounted for takes place only if there is a change in the estimates
used to determine the realisable value since accounting for the last impairment loss. in that case, the book
value of the asset (or cash-flow generating unit) is raised to the estimated realisable value, but not in excess
of the book value that would have been determined (after depreciation) if, in previous years, no impairment
loss for the asset (or cash-flow generating unit) would be accounted for.

current assets
receivables
the receivables are valued at the amortised cost taking collectability risks into account. trade receivables also
include sales that have not yet been invoiced.

pensions
gasterra is affiliated with the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie (gasunie pension fund foundation) together
with n.v. nederlandse gasunie (dutch natural gas infrastructure and transmission company). gasterra’s
employees have a pension scheme administered here.




                                                        -6-

gasterra b.v. annual report 2014




as of 1 january 2014, the scheme has been changed from a final salary scheme to a conditionally indexed
career average scheme. the financial obligations of gasterra in respect of the fund as from 1 january 2014
consist of a fixed premium in combination with the one-time payment to the accrual and supplementary
benefits deposit of the pension fund. when the resources that the fund has available are insufficient, the risk
hereof then lies with the (former) participants.

the pension scheme is characterised by the pensions act as a distribution agreement. the 2014
implementation agreement with the pension fund has a term of 4 years. the main agreements included in this
implementation agreement are the following:

   on 1 january 2014, gasterra shall make a one-time deposit of € 0.6 million into an accrual deposit which
    is intended to prevent accrual discount in case the premium is insufficient in any year.

   on 1 january 2014, gasterra shall make a one-time deposit of €2.3 million into a supplementary benefits
    deposit which is intended for the grant of a bonus on the pension rights of participants in active service.

   gasterra does not have any additional contribution deposit obligation and is not bound to complete any
    gaps in the fund.

   the premium amounts to 22.6% of pensionable earnings. gasterra can neither be compelled to pay a
    higher contribution, nor to fix the contribution at a lower level.

   if in any year the premium is insufficient to fund the pension build-up in that year, additional funding will
    be made available by the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie (gasunie pension fund foundation) from the
    accrual deposit. if the accrual deposit is not sufficient for the additional financing of the pension fund, the
    pension accrual of participants is set at a reduced amount.

the coverage ratio for the pension fund shows the ratio between the fund’s capital and the value of the
pensions (the obligations) that the fund shall have to pay out now and in the future.
the minimum required coverage ratio according to the supervisory authority, the dutch central bank (dnb),
is 104.2%. the coverage ratio for the pensioenfonds gasunie was 110.1% at year-end december 2014
(111.4% at year-end 2013). in addition, the dnb demands the stichting pensioenfonds gasunie to attain a
required equity in the long term, which level depends on the composition of the investments. the long-term
coverage ratio required by dnb for stichting pensioenfonds gasunie is 114.5% at year-end 2014 (115.1% at
year-end 2013).

a provision is also included as at the balance sheet date for existing additional obligations with respect to the
fund and the employees if it is likely that an outflow of resources will be required in order to settle these
obligations, and the amount of the obligations may be reliably estimated. the provision is valued at the best
estimate of the cash value of the amounts that will be required to settle the obligations on the balance sheet
date. to the extent this obligation relates to the upcoming financial year, this is recorded in the current
liabilities account.

the starting point is that pension charges to be processed in the reporting period are equal to the pension
contributions owed to the pension fund during the same period. to the extent that the contributions payable
on the balance sheet date have not yet been met, a liability is included for this. if the contributions already
paid at the balance sheet date exceed the contributions owed, an accrued asset item is recognised to the
extent that there will be repayment by the fund or a set-off against contributions owed in the future.

current liabilities
the current liabilities are valued at the amortised cost, with which the income and
expenditure arising from amortisation are recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest
method. the initial measurement shall be effected at fair value whereby the transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition are included in the measurement. this relates to liabilities with a term of no
more than one year.

amounts payable also include purchases that have not yet been invoiced. amounts received from customers
due to a decreased purchase of gas under ‘take-or-pay’ agreements are recorded under current liabilities as
an obligation to deliver. the obligation to deliver arising from the receipt of gas in the storage service is also
recorded under current liabilities.

gasterra b.v. annual report 2014




financial instruments
financial instruments comprise receivables, cash and bank and current liabilities.

within the course of its normal business activities, the company occasionally uses derivative financial
instruments. this relates to forward exchange contracts and gas price swaps in order to hedge the price risk
of certain gas contracts.

financial instruments also include derivative financial instruments (derivatives) embedded in contracts. the
company shall separate embedded derivates from the host contract and account for these separately if:

   the host contract’s economic characteristics and risks and the embedded derivative are not closely
    related; and

   a separate instrument with the same terms and conditions as the derivative embedded in the contract
    would meet the definition of a derivative; and

   the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.


financial instruments (derivatives) embedded in contracts that are not separated from the host contract,
because the abovementioned conditions are not satisfied, are recognized in accordance with the host contract.

the company applies cost price hedge accounting techniques in order to recognize the results from hedge
instruments including the forward exchange contracts and the gas price swaps and the changes in value of
the hedged positions simultaneously in the profit and loss account. forward exchange contracts and gas price
swaps are initially valued at cost. the effectiveness of the hedge relationship is determined by comparing the
critical characteristics of the hedging instrument and the hedged position in the hedge relationship. if the
critical characteristics of the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap correspond with the expected
future transaction, the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap will not be revalued. if the critical
characteristics, assessed in the context of the hedge relationship, are equal, no ineffectiveness exists. as soon
as the hedged position of the expected future transaction leads to the processing of a financial asset or a
financial obligation, the profits or losses tied to the forward exchange contract or the gas price swap will be
recorded in the profit and loss account during the same period as that wherein the asset obtained or
obligation entered into has an effect on the result.

the company documents the hedge relationships and periodically reviews the effectiveness of the hedge
relationships by establishing that no overhedge exists. a loss due to an over-hedge is recorded at cost or
lower market value directly in the profit and loss account. there are no significant cash flow risks related to
the hedge relationships.


gasterra concludes gas purchase contracts and gas sale contracts as part of its business operations. these
contracts are concluded for the actual physical delivery and receipt of gas in accordance with the company’s
expected purchases or sales levels, or usage requirements. for this reason, these fall outside of the scope of
rj 290 (reporting standard).

gas sales and gas purchases
the pricing of natural gas for both the sales and purchasing sides is influenced to a significant degree by
developments in the gas market prices of natural gas as well as the prices of other energy carriers.

gasterra’s shareholders have concluded an agreement relating to the after-tax profits to be made by
gasterra. this agreement stipulates that the price of the natural gas from groningen sold by the nederlandse
aardolie maatschappij b.v. (nam) to gasterra during the year has been set such that gasterra will retain the
after-tax profits determined for that year by the shareholders.

net turnover
net turnover is divided into gas sales and other net turnover.

gas sales represent the income from the supply of gas and the income from the corresponding services
provided, after deducting the tax assessed on the turnover.

gasterra b.v. annual report 2014




other net turnover is represented primarily by the income from the delivery of services to third parties. this
income results primarily from flexibility services.

the income is recorded during the reporting period in that the gas was delivered and the services were
provided.

a distinction is made between services related to making transport capacity and flexibility available and actual
usage. the services are considered to have been provided if the service was made available to the client
during the period agreed.

cost of sales
in the main, the cost of sales represents the cost of the purchase of gas and the associated services, the
transport costs and the costs related to underground gas storage.

operating expenses
the expenses are determined on a historical basis, taking into account the principles for valuation mentioned
previously, and are allocated to the reporting period to which they relate. losses are recorded during the
reporting period in that provisions for them may be made.

net financial income and expenses
this item includes the income and expenses related to financing.

corporation tax
the amount of corporation tax to be included in the profit and loss account is calculated based on the results
determined according to this account, in due observance of the valid tax-related provisions and rates.

statement of cash flows
this report provides a statement of the cash flows generated. the statement of cash flow is drawn up on the
basis of the indirect method based on the operating results in the profit and loss account.

financial instruments

general
in the course of its normal business activities the company uses financial instruments that exposes the
company to market risk including foreign currency rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk. the
company uses derivative financial instruments to manage risks. the company does not trade in derivative
financial instruments.

credit risk
the credit risk consists of the loss that would be generated if customers or counterparties were to remain in
default and fail to fulfil their contractual obligations. the company has drawn up guidelines with which
customers or counterparties must comply. these guidelines limit the risk associated with possible credit
concentrations and market risks. if customers or counterparties fail to comply with these guidelines, they will
be asked to furnish additional security such as bank guarantees. this prevents the company from running any
major credit risks in respect of any individual customer or counterparty. long-term relations have been built
with the majority of customers and counterparties. they fulfilled their payment obligations in 2014.

interest rate risk
the interest rate risk is limited to potential changes in the market value of funds withdrawn and issued. it is
company policy not to use derivative financial instruments to manage fluctuations in interest rates (on an
interim basis or otherwise). given the short-term nature of deposits, the interest rate risk for the year 2014
did not exceed € 100,000.

liquidity risk
the company monitors its liquidity position through liquidity forecasts. the management ensures that the
company always has sufficient liquidity available to meet its commitments. to limit the liquidity risk, gasterra
has at its disposal a commercial paper programme of €1.0 billion as at year-end 2014 (year-end 2013: € 1.0
billion). this programme ended as at 1 january 2015. gasterra concluded a deposit and loan agreement with
nam and ebn in 2014.

foreign currency risk
from 2013, gasterra is following a policy of controlling currency risks on receivables and payables in the
balance sheet using a bandwidth. currency risks are only – and fully – hedged by short-term foreign currency
contracts, if the unrealised results of those risks fall outside a range set by the company.

market value
the market value of the majority of the financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet, including
receivables, cash and bank and current liabilities, is approximate to the book value of those items as a result
of the short maturities.

the estimated market value and the total book value of the gas price swaps as at 31 december are specified
in the table below:

as of 31 december 2014, no gas price swaps are due to be settled after the balance sheet date. the
estimated market value and the total book value of the gas price swaps as at 31 december 2013 were lower
than € 100.000,-.

by applying cost price hedge accounting as set out in the accounting principles, the book value of derivative
financial instruments included in the above table is nil.

off-balance sheet assets and liabilities
procurement, supply and transport commitments
gasterra has long-term procurement, supply and transport commitments pursuant to gas purchase, gas sales
and transport contracts. the gas purchase and sales prices depend to a large degree on the future market
prices of natural gas, as well as the future market prices of other energy carriers. in addition to this, gasterra
has entered into long-term commitments for office rental and ict service. the financial consequences thereof
are of minor significance for assessing the financial position at the end of the financial year.


€ 28.2 million in bank guarantees (2013: € 22.8 million) have been issued to the benefit of gasterra by third
parties.

the long-term supply commitments are covered by long-term purchase contracts, wherein the planned supply
to gasterra of the natural gas from groningen more than exceeds the long-term supply commitments. the
difference between delivery obligations and the import and domestic procurement obligations, are sold by
gasterra, in particular as short-term, in liquid marketplaces.

gasterra’s shareholders have concluded an agreement relating to the after-tax profits to be made by
gasterra. this agreement stipulates that the price of the natural gas from groningen sold by the nederlandse
aardolie maatschappij b.v. (nam) to gasterra during the year has been set such that gasterra will retain the
after-tax profits of € 36 million determined for that year by the shareholders. as a result of the
implementation of the above agreement, no notes are given on the valuation of the individual gas purchase
and sales contracts.

independent auditor’s report
to: the board of directors of gasterra b.v.

report on the financial statements
we have audited the accompanying financial statements 2014 of gasterra b.v., groningen, which comprise
the balance sheet as at 31 december 2014, the profit and loss account for the year then ended and the notes,
comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.

management’s responsibility
management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements and for the
preparation of the annual report, both in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of the netherlands civil code.
furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the
preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

auditor’s responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. we conducted
our audit in accordance with dutch law, including the dutch standards on auditing. this requires that we
comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation
of the financial statements.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

opinion
in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of gasterra b.v. as
at 31 december 2014 and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of the

requires, amongst others, that the assurance team possesses the specific knowledge, skills and

professional competencies needed to understand the information, identify and collect the
required assurance information, and that they comply with the requirements of the ifac code
of ethics for professional accountants, including independence.


work undertaken
our work included the following activities:
   conducting a risk analysis, including a media search in order to deepen our understanding
    of relevant issues in the reporting period.
   evaluating the design and implementation of the systems and processes for collecting and
    processing of the information in the report.
   interviewing relevant staff responsible for the strategy, policies, communication,
    implementation and reporting.
   interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information in the report.
   evaluating internal and external documentation, based on sampling, to determine whether
    the information in the report is supported by sufficient evidence.


during the assurance process we discussed the necessary changes in the report with gasterra
and reviewed the final version of the report to ensure that it reflects our findings.


conclusion
based on our procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention to
indicate that the information marked with the icon                         in the sections gas,
green and groningen in the report is not presented, in all material respects, in accordance with
the reporting criteria.
