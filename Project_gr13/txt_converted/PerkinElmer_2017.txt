        making a
        global
        impact


2016-2017 corporate social responsibility report

i am proud to share our seventh annual corporate social
responsibility report, reflecting on last year’s achievements,
as well as those to date in 2017. sustainability is one of the
cornerstones of our mission of innovating for a healthier world,
and we continue to look for creative ways to increase our
sustainable impact, while also enhancing our volunteerism.
several highlights from across our three pillars include:

• community impact: evolving our volunteer efforts to bring
  employees together across the globe on one designated day,
  reinforcing the true impact of our work. our contributions in 2016
  included helping local organizations pack, sort and distribute over
  25,000 pounds of food to families in need, and removing over
  two tons of garbage from rivers, beaches and parks.

• eco-innovative products: collaborating internally to advance
  how we design and develop new products to minimize health
  and environmental impacts. for instance, our recently launched
  avio® 200 icp-oes, which is used for multi-elemental
  inorganic analysis, has the lowest argon consumption of any icp on the market.

• sustainable and ethical business practices: brainstorming novel ways to conserve water and energy around the
  world. in 2016, we reduced carbon emissions from fleet vehicles by 8% compared to the previous year.

on perkinelmer’s inaugural impact day, i witnessed first-hand the passion of our employees who participated in an
activity at our seer green, uk site. in support of the british heart foundation, we filled 50 bags of items for their
charity shops during the "bag it, beat it" event. the proceeds from the bags sold helped fund research to improve
the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.

whether through these kinds of charitable endeavors, or through strategic partnerships and customer relationships,
we connect with like-minded organizations that complement our expertise, resources and reach to make the
greatest impact. by working together, we have the profound potential to solve some of the most significant societal
challenges. it’s because of our employees, who are supported by a work environment that encourages them to be
at their best, that these goals are possible.

we also find inspiration at perkinelmer in our legacy of helping improve lives over the past eight decades. while
looking back on our incredible achievements and breakthroughs over the years, we also look ahead to the future. the
issues impacting health and the world around us have become more complex. while we continue to innovate for our
customers to help them address these challenges, it is also more important than ever before that we do our part to
meet these needs within our communities.

as active corporate citizens, our 9,000 employees and counting are committed to working at the forefront of
making a global impact, for the better.

    our mission to innovate for a healthier world guides everything
    we do – from how we conduct our business to the way we engage
    the communities we serve.

    at the konecta foundation for adults with
    intellectual disabilities                    is driven by three pillars:

    by living our core values,                   community impact
    being mindful of our impact,                 we bring positive changes into our communities by acting as responsible corporate neighbors.
    and developing solutions that                through volunteerism and strategic philanthropic partnerships, we team up with each other and
                                                 with our customers to make a difference around the globe.
    support the quality and safety
    of our environment, we ensure                eco-innovative products
    that the way we engage with                  every day, we work to design and develop “eco-innovative” products that address customer needs
                                                 and minimize adverse health and environmental impacts.
    our customers and communities
    is just as impactful as the                  sustainable and ethical business practices
    solutions we provide.                        we operate our facilities in a manner that ensures the health and safety of our employees, the
                                                 public, and the environment. additionally, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethics and
                                                 integrity while remaining in compliance with the law.

community impact

our work to help create a healthier world extends beyond just the solutions we provide. it also applies to how we support local
organizations and communities. we encourage our employees to give back in ways that are meaningful and sustainable.
when we consider the effects of our volunteer efforts, they are more than just the number of employees who helped and the hours
devoted – our work has lasting impacts across our communities. that’s why in 2016 we renamed the former community
involvement pillar of our corporate social responsibility program to community impact.

     impact day
     in 2016, we changed the way we focus our community efforts, reflecting our revamp of the community involvement pillar. most notably, we evolved our
     companywide volunteer program from for the better day to impact day. while we still encourage our employees to get out into their communities throughout
     the year, we introduced impact day as a way for all employees to come together on a single day and collectively give back to local organizations.
     on our inaugural global impact day, over 2,400 employees supported causes in the areas of disease research, food safety, newborn health, and the
     environment. with projects spanning across the eastern and western hemispheres, we proudly touched lives and helped improve the environment.
     we measure the success of impact day through the actual “impact” of our efforts around the globe. highlights from 2016 included:

     disease research:                                                                    newborn health:

eco-innovative products
we design, develop and manufacture innovative products in a manner that minimizes adverse health and environmental
impacts throughout the product lifecycle, while helping customers solve critical health challenges. we do this by enhancing
product efficiencies, reducing materials and waste, and increasing the value of ownership for customers.

designing quality products with integrity
our product design process incorporates a series of checkpoints that
includes a review of energy use, weight, recycled content, consumables
use, and packaging. design engineers receive training on current and
pending regulatory initiatives that may impact product design and use
such as the restriction of hazardous substances (rohs), the registration,
evaluation and authorization of chemicals (reach) and the waste
electrical and electronic equipment directives.
