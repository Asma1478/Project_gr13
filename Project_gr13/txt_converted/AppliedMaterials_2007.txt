   covering performance in fiscal years 2004–2006




                               applied materials is committed to reducing both the direct and
                               indirect impact of our business operations and products on the
                               environment. we’ve reduced our electricity consumption more
                               than 20% over the past two years relative to the growth of our
                               business. we’re a leading purchaser of green energy and we
                               recently announced plans to construct one of the nation’s
                               largest corporate solar installations that will generate about two
                               megawatts on our sunnyvale, california campus.




this is good–really good–
but it’s not enough.
   today, i’m establishing a new goal for the sustainable operation of
   our global business, and a brighter future. by 2012, applied materials
   will reduce its environmental footprint by at least 50,000 tons
   of carbon equivalents or approximately 20% of the company’s
   footprint in 2006. this is a real goal—a simple statement of what
   we want to achieve. it’s a stretch goal and every one of us needs
   to seriously think about the way we operate at work and how
   we can contribute to reducing the impact of our operations on
   the environment. michael r. splinter | president & chief executive officer

                                      hazardous waste as a result of a regulatory
                                      interpretation change. this change resulted in

                                      achieved much of the reduction by using a

                                      premoistened wipes, which also eased our

climate change


applied materials recognizes that climate
change is an urgent problem requiring local,
regional and international action to reduce
ghg emissions. energy consumption and
efficiency are key elements of strategies to
reduce ghg emissions and, as described
in this report, we believe applied materials
has a positive role to play in providing
solutions. our progress over the past three
years in reducing our own carbon dioxide
footprint is described throughout this report.
we are now ready to drive further reductions
by adopting a broader corporate goal and by
developing a more comprehensive strategy
around that goal.
