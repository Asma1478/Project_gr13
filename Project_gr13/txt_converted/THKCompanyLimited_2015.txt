thk csr report
2014/2015

           introduction
           from the very start, the thk group (usually referred to in
           these pages simply as thk) has been mindful of the impor-
           tance of conducting its business operations in a manner that
           yields beneﬁts for society as a whole.
              this year’s csr report includes a feature section examin-
           ing thk’s efforts to honor its corporate social responsibilities
           in two key areas. the ﬁrst part looks at ways in which thk
           technology is being put to use in the ﬁelds of medical care
           and healthcare to help meet the needs of japan’s rapidly
           aging population. the second part focuses on initiatives un-
           derway at thk to enable greater use of renewable energy as
           a countermeasure against global warming.
              the section entitled “management system” includes a dis-
           cussion of risk management efforts, while “involvement in
           society” focuses on thk’s relationships with its various
           stakeholders. “harmony with the environment” offers a look
           at thk’s environmental initiatives in fiscal 2013, including
           some quantitative results.
              the thk csr report is an essential tool for communicat-
           ing with everyone who is connected in any way to thk and
           its activities. please take the time to fill out the enclosed
           questionnaire—your comments and feedback will be greatly
           appreciated.

       pressure sores, or bedsores. to prevent this, we provide
       wheelchairs equipped with a function that enables the en-
       tire chair to be tilted back at an angle.
           to shift the pressure from the backside to the back, you
       have to be able to tilt back at an angle of at least 40 de-
       grees. if the chair’s center of gravity doesn’t move, howev-
       er, you’re in danger of tipping over backward. for this rea-
       son our development team wanted to find a way to move
       the center of gravity forward only when the chair is tilted
       back, and thk’s model ugr utility slide
       enabled them to do so. by incorporating
       the ugr, they were able to arrange for
       the wheelchair’s weight, ordinarily con-
       centrated in the rear of the chair, to be
       redistributed in a forward direction as the
       seat slides forward, allowing the chair to
       tilt back without tipping. previous mod-
       els could only tilt up to 30 degrees, but
       the model equipped with the ugr can
       tilt back safely at a 40-degree angle. in

       enables the backrest to recline to a near-

                                              1. preserving the environment is one of our most important tasks. we will strive to accurately determine the environ-
