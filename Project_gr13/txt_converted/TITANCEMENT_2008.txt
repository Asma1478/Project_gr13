              defining csr priority areas
              in 2007, we engaged in a wide-ranging independent
              assessment of our csr performance starting from the
              greek region. the main objectives were to evaluate our
              csr management and reporting systems with respect to
              titan’s values and commitments as well as stakeholders
              expectations.
              the specific objectives were to:
                          	identify material and relevant csr issues for titan
                            greece
                               identify opportunities and risks
                               link csr issues with titan’s value drivers
              as part of this process, four workshops and a number of
              interviews were conducted with more than 40 peo­
              ple from 15 different departments and functions from
              titan’s operations in greece, as were audits at selected
              sites covering all activities.
              these workshops assessed the relative importance
              placed on various csr issues. all issues have been
              examin­ed and ranked accordingly considering their rele­
              vance to titan’ s business. the outcomes are presented
              in the tables below. more inofrmation are also included
              in dnv’s letter (p.55).

air emissions
dust
at cement plants, major dust emission sources are
kilnstacks and open surfaces creating fugitive dust from
the transportation of materials.
all titan group’ s plants have been equipped with
dust monitoring and recording systems for continuous
measurements in accordance with existing environmen-
tal legislation and our wbcsd/csi commitments.
the group implements a program of periodic measure-
ments of fugitive dust emissions in order to safeguard
the health of its employees as well as to reduce the
impact on neighboring communities and areas.
further care is taken to ensure the proper maintenance
and optimal functioning of machinery and equipment
and the rigorous application of rules covering the trans-
portation of materials both within the plant site as well
as outside.
in 2007 specific emissions of dust were 85g/ton clinker
at the same level as the previous year. this is equivalent
to approximately 928 tons per year.
it should be noted that dust emissions in most of our
plants are two to three times below the limits set by the
environmental terms and conditions of legal require-
ments.

persistent organic pollutants
fuels and raw materials used may include heavy metals
as well as elements leading to the creation of persistent
organic pollutants (pops) such as dioxins and furans.
the cement industry, as shown by scientific studies, has
negligible persistent pop. during the last several years,
titan has measured pop emissions at most of its rotat-
ing kilns. these emissions were also below limits set by
legislation.

liquid spills and solid
materials
last year we had no significant spills of liquid or solid
materials.
there was, however, an incident in alexandria, egypt
caused by dust which was emitted from our plant and
spread into the surrounding wady el-kamar neighbor-
hood. in cooperation with local people and authorities,
plant management arranged for the area to be cleaned
up within a week.




transportation
we recognize that our overall footprint on the environ-
ment is not caused only by our quarrying and manufac-
turing operations. the transportation of raw materials
and products, and even our personnel also affects the
environment through carbon dioxide and other emis-
sions generated by fossil fuels.
measuring this kind of emissions requires a cross-sec-
toral approach. coopareation with various automobile
industries in the framework of the e.u. alliance for csr
(p. 53) will further support our efforts to improve our
know-how in this field and estimate indirect impacts
related to transportation of our products, raw materials,
fuel, personnel and any other.




noise
noise is a by-product of industrial activity. titan has
been taking appropriate measures at plants and quar-
ries to minimize disturbance of neighboring communi-
ties, including, if necessary, the rescheduling of our
activities. noise abatement procedures ensure that noise
stays below maximum permitted levels.

quarry rehabilitation
and biodiversity
titan operations are heavily dependent on the use of
natural resources. comprehensive environmental impact
assessments and rehabilitation plans, cover all aspects of
development, operation as well as decommissioning of
quarries. traditional methods such as reforestation, and
modern methods such as hydro-seeding, are employed
for quarry rehabilitatiion. special measures, further-
more, are taken to protect biodiversity.
the number of our active quarry sites that are inside or
adjacent to protected areas of high biodiversity value
are 4 out of a total of 41, located in the u.s.a. (2), bul-
garia (1) and greece (1).
 	the pennsuco limestone quarry (florida, u.s.a.)
   is located inside a wide area of the miami-dade
   county, known as the “lake belt”. biodiversity issues
   include natural cover types and wetlands, habitat
   units, endangered wood storks, hydrology and
   water quality.
 	center sand aggregates quarry (florida, u.s.a.) is
   adjacent to a state preservation site. a conservation
   area for the endangered species of sand skinks and
   gopher tortoise has been created.
 	part of zlatna panega limestone and marl quarry
   (bulgaria) stands inside a natura 2000 area and
   the zlatna panega cement plant is close to the same
   protection zone.
 	the total area of xilokeratia pozzolana quarry (milos
   island, greece) is inside a natura 2000 area and
   also the coastal area next to the quarry is protected
   by natura. two endangered species are recogni­
   zed in this area: “vipera schweizeri” snake and
   “monachus monachus” seal. special environmental
   care is taken by titan during quarry operations and
   transportation of raw materials and products, in
   order to safeguard the necessary conditions for the
   survival of these species.

shareholders/investors
responsible corporate citizenship is an important driver
used to define strategic corporate priorities. one espe-
cially useful measure of csr effectiveness is recognition
with independent, comparative assessments which
benchmark our performance in relation to our peers.
in 2007 we were pleased to see our csr performance
acknowledged twice by independent assessors. one
was recognition as the “leading company / greece” for
two consecutive years (both 2006 and 2007), according
to a survey carried out by the hay group among 260
companies. the other one we describe in detail below.



stakeholder responsiveness and
accountability: a comparative assessment

the “accountability rating” published by fortune maga-
zine each year, measures the extent to which companies have
built responsible social and environmental practices into the
way they do business and looks at how well they account for
the impact of their actions on their stakeholders.
companies earn a score in each of six main categories: cor-
porate governace, strategy, management systems, reporting,
assessment and verification. each year, fortune magazine
publishes a list of companies assessed according to their
social and environmental accountability.
in 2007 the ranking for the first time included greece whose
50 largest companies (by turnover) were evaluated across a
range of criteria related to abovementioned categories.
on the accountability / rating list for greece, titan was
placed 3rd in overall rating and 1st in the industrial and ce-
ment sectors.

the products delivered by titan companies, properly
used, present negligible health risks. they are accom-
panied by material safety data sheets advising users
on optimal application procedures. the group r&d
department and occupational health and safety specia-

suppliers and responsible
supply chain management
in the context of its centennial celebrations in 2002,
titan decided to share its understanding and commit-
ment of csr with its stakeholders. among the groups
wishing to learn more about csr were our suppliers.
since then we have engaged in a series of initiatives
designed to branch out our philosophy and policies
of responsible corporate citizenship. they range from
discussions and presentations to written materials and
workshops aimed at facilitating knowledge exchange
and sharing of best practices.
biannual surveys conducted among our suppliers give
us valuable feedback and help us to improve our poli-
cies, programs and procedures. the latest 2007 supplier
survey revealed that occupational health and safety and
care for the environment are considered as the most
important csr issues. about 30% of the suppliers sur-
veyed have expressed themselves in favor of joint efforts
at either sectoral or business-to-business levels concern-
ing environmental and social responsibility endeavors.

assurance report by dnv
det norske veritas (hereafter “dnv”) has been commissioned by the management of titan cement company s.a
(hereafter “titan”) to carry out an independent verification of titan corporate social responsibility (csr) and sus-
tainability report 2007 (english version only) (hereafter “the report”).
this is a summarised version of the assurance statement. a full version of the assurance statement including details on
dnv’s scope, approach and specific recommendations is available online. please go to: www.titan-cement.com


scope
titan requested that a staged approach to verification be adopted, focusing initially on its operations in greece and
expanding the coverage to eastern europe and the us in future years. as a result, dnv’s verification was limited to ac-
tivities in greece only. statements regarding titan’s activities outside greece were not verified.the accuracy of selected
quantitative information was verified, namely donations and employee training data. our verification did not include
verification of the accuracy of co2 emissions and h&s data, verified by another third party.
dnv was not involved in the preparation of any information, or collection data included in the report.


approach
dnv, headquartered in oslo, is one of the leading providers of sustainability solutions, including verification of sustain-
ability reports.
the verification was carried out between june 2007 and may 2008, by suitably qualified and experienced professionals,
in accordance with the dnv protocol for verification of sustainability reports, which is based both on the gri g3 and
the aa1000as.


conclusions
in our opinion, titan’s csr report 2007 meets most of the wbcsd/csi, global compact, gri g3 and aa1000as
reporting requirements. our review revealed that titan’s board commitment to sustainability and csr is high. ti-
tan has sought to identify and adopt good csr practices and this is reflected in the high level of investment on csr
management across the company. environmental, community and h&s responsibilities have been allocated across the
company. however, levels of awareness, capability and implementation vary across divisions and regions and business
units, e.g. policies and systems are more effectively implemented in cement divisions than aggregates or ready-mix.
our review confirms that titan has consistently maintained a good dialogue with local community and has responded
well to their concerns. however, a more structured approach to stakeholder engagement at group level is needed.
regarding the content of the report, the following conclusions are made:


materiality
	for the first time, titan has been involved in a materiality assessment whose results have informed the preparation
  of the report;
	at group level, titan has engaged with sri rating agencies, wbcsd/csi and best practice groups, with a view to
  identifying and better understanding the csr / sustainability issues which are most material to the sector.


completeness
	the report includes all entities that meet the criteria of being subject to control or significant influence of the re-
  porting organisation;
	it is our understanding that the report provides a fair and balanced representation of titan’s vision, performance
  and challenges during 2007;


55

	assessment of data gathering processes reveal that the completeness of quantitative data reported needs further
  improvement.
accuracy
	the data measurement techniques and bases for calculations have been adequately described to dnv. although no
  systematic errors have been detected, we have identified some manual errors which have subsequently been cor-
  rected. however, titan is committed to continually improving the quality of data and is in the process of adopting
  a more structured data management system and process for environmental data;
	some data flows are complex and involve a large number of people and tools. titan is currently reviewing its data
  management processes with a view to streamlining of data flows and the improving data quality control systems.


neutrality
	titan’s 2007 materiality assessment has been used as a basis for the production of to the report and identifying the
  issues on which emphasis should be placed and ensuring that statements on the various topics are proportionate
  to their relative materiality.


comparability
	in comparison with the 2006 report, the current report presents information in a format that better allows users to
  see positive and negative trends in performance on a year-to-year basis;
	titan’s internal database system coupled with other on-going improvements in data management processes, are
  expected to enable better comparability of data in future years .


responsiveness
	this year’s report has been prepared taking into consideration the findings of a structured stakeholder consultation
  exercise aimed at clarifying stakeholder opinions regarding the report.
	the stakeholder engagement should be extended to a wider range of stakeholders in 2008.


in dnv’s opinion, titan’s csr report 2007 generally meets the content and quality requirements of the gri g3.
among the different levels defined by the gri, both titan and dnv confirm that the gri “a+ application level” has
been met. dnv has adopted a rigorous approach in conducting the gri application level check, including the use of
related gri protocols. dnv considers that a gri indicator is partially met when just one of its elements is missing. dnv
also checked references to the annual report. weblinks were not checked because at the time of the verification they
were not active. however, dnv states that the documents referenced to in the weblinks exist and are implemented in
the organisation.

assurance report by kpmg
to the readers of the 2007 titan group corporate social responsibility and sustainability report.


introduction
we have been engaged by titan group to provide assurance on the co2 emission data and the safety data in the 2007
titan group corporate social responsibility and sustainability report (further referred to as the report). the report is
the responsibility of the company’s management. our responsibility is to issue an assurance report on the co2 emission
data and the safety data in the report.


context and scope
in the report titan group describes its efforts and progress in relation to sustainability and reporting thereon. our en-
gagement was designed to provide the readers of the report limited assurance on whether the 2007 co2 emission data
presented on page 16 and page 29 in the report and the 2007 safety data presented on page 16 and 23 in the report
are fairly stated. procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed at determining the plausibility
of data and are less extensive than those for a reasonable level of assurance.


reporting criteria
there are no generally accepted standards for reporting sustainability performance. titan group applies its own internal
sustainability performance reporting criteria, derived from the relevant publications of the cement sustainability initia-
tive (wbcsd/csi) of the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd). these publications are the
cement co2 protocol and the wbcsd/csi guidelines for measuring and reporting safety data. it is important to view
the performance data in the context of this explanatory information. we believe that these criteria are suitable in view
of the purpose of our assurance engagement.


standards
we conducted our engagement in accordance with the international standard for assurance engagements (isae) 3000:
assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information, issued by the international
auditing and assurance standards board. amongst others, this standard requires that the assurance team members
possess the specific.
knowledge, skills and professional competencies needed to understand and review the information and that they com-
ply with the requirements of the ifac code of ethics for professional accountants to ensure their independence.


work undertaken
with regard to the information in the report we carried out the following activities:
	reviewing the systems and processes for data management, internal control and processing of the co2 emission
  data and the safety data;
	reviewing the co2 emission data and the safety data reported by the production sites under operational control of
    titan group;
	visiting two selected production sites to assess the data collection and reporting process and review the reliability
   of the reported data;
	reviewing data trends and discussions with management thereto;
	interviewing staff responsible for the analysis and reporting of the data and explanatory notes for co2 emission data
   and safety data.



57

conclusion
based on the work described above, the 2007 co2 emission data presented on page 16 and page 29 in the report,
referring to the cement co2 protocol, and the 2007 safety data presented on page 16 and 23 in the report referring to
the wbcsd/csi guidelines for measuring and reporting safety data do not appear to be unfairly stated.
