joint message of the chairman
of the board of directors
and of the ceo
2015 represented the turning point for the bcp group. after 4 years of losses, the bank attained a net income of
235 million euros and recorded positive results in portugal and in its international operations.
showing a general improvement in the financial indicators and a significant enhancement in operational eﬃciency,
millennium bcp has been consistently adjusting itself to the transformation that is currently underway in the banking
industry and to a new reality - such as the one resulting from the banking union, at a regulatory and supervisory level –,
allowing it to anticipate the compliance with the goals agreed for 2017 with the directorate general for competition of
the european commission and to continue to regain the trust of its customers and remaining stakeholders.
however, and because we are a bank committed to sustainability and responsible business practices, 2015 was also the
year when millennium bcp stood, once again, by the people, the society and local communities.
we kept our commitment towards culture, supporting events addressed to very diﬀerent audiences, set up exhibits on
various themes that allowed us to share the art works owned by the bank in a close and inclusive manner, promoting and
recognising the creative merit and contributing to the recovery of historical assets.
education, science and investigation are also areas where millennium bcp continues to intervene, supporting, in an active and
consequent manner, projects and initiatives that stood out due to their innovative features and ability to add value to society.
in microcredit, an area that completed 10 years in 2015 and that is also an example of social responsibility in millennium
bcp, the bank continued to support the entrepreneurial spirit and self-employment, focusing on disclosing this valuable
instrument to fight poverty and unemployment to the entities closer to socially excluded populations. since 2005,
it adds up to 5,253 jobs resulting from projects funded by millennium bcp's microcredit, 593 of which in 2015.
concerning social support, the bank stood, once again and in all the countries where it operates, by those in need and
underprivileged. in 2015, in portugal, the bank was visibly involved with the food bank, particularly with the campaigns
for the collection of food which counted with the contribution of many hundreds of volunteers from millennium bcp.
it also carried out internal actions in favour of charitable institutions, such as associação acreditar or comunidade vida e
paz. in mozambique, we must point out, within the scope of the social responsibility programme “mais moçambique pra
mim” (more mozambique for me), the aid given to the centre of infulene for orphan children and the campaign launched
in favour of the victims of the severe weather conditions that aﬀected the north of the country. in angola, we must
mention the ongoing support provided to lar de nazaré and, in poland, the involvement with the programme nikifory,
a programme to help disabled artists.
concerning business, the bank endeavoured to support investors, companies and families by the granting of sustainable
loans, adjusted to their financial needs and capacities. within the scope of accessibilities, the electronic banking solutions
that millennium bcp is providing for the trading of products and services represent a strong contribution for the financial
inclusion of all citizens.
within this context, the improvement of the degree of financial literacy is, for group bcp, a primary goal in all its
operations. an example of this commitment are the actions that have been carried out by the bank to increase the
level of financial literacy of the citizens, namely of the youngest, always taking into consideration the importance of
the adoption of adequate banking behaviours and the making of stable and informed decisions.
we must also highlight the commitment to training and personal and professional development of bank employees.
in 2015, it was held over 2,300 training activities in various areas / departments of the bank.
concerning environmental performance, we again underline the sustainability strategy of incorporating and promoting
a culture of responsible consumption and investment, assuming the commitment to continuously reducing the group's
ecological footprint. due to this engagement, the group was able to substantially reduce its consumption of water and
materials in 2015.
lastly, and for the 10th consecutive year, group bcp is engaged in complying with the un global compact’s ten principles
and is investing in actions related to human rights, labour practices, environmental protection and anti-corruption.
the bank plays, through its responsible business practices, a relevant and distinctive role in all countries where it
operates, contributing for the well being of individuals, for the economic and social development of society and for
the protection of the environment. is still a bank committed to gender equality, having come to adopt measures that
allow to approach the management of the bank with the policy of meritocracy, irrespective of gender and having been
developing initiatives to support birth and parenting.
we do believe that, in 2016, we will continue to be able to keep our engagement with the future by creating an agile,
modern, close, simple and sustainable bank. we will continue to pursue the path that gives us the possibility of enhancing
a key asset: the relation of trust we have with our stakeholders.

  group bcp sees mobility as an opportunity for the employees to develop their professional careers and their skills and, therefore,
  fosters their contact with diﬀerent realities of the bank, whenever possible. thus, the employees' internal mobility processes are of
  strategic importance for millennium. in 2015, 16.4% of the group's employees were involved in internal mobility processes, notably in
  portugal and mozambique, where 22.2% and 40.6%, respectively, of the employees changed areas/departments.

  ethics and professional conduct
  material issue: values, ethics and conduct

  millennium bcp considers that the respect for its defined mission and values and also the compliance with its strategy depends, first
  and foremost, on each employee and, therefore, it fosters a culture of rigour and responsibility, based on permanent information
  disclosure, training and monitoring mechanisms able to ensure strict compliance with the established rules of conduct.

                                                                                 2015 sustainability report • economic responsibility 




compliance office
the compliance oﬃce's mission is to assure that all the management bodies, the functional structures and all the group’s employees
comply with the legislation, rules and requirements that guide the activities carried out by the bank and its subsidiary companies in order
to avoid the risk of the institution incurring in legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses or negative eﬀects in terms of reputation,
resulting from non-compliance with the laws, codes of conduct and good business practices and duties that bind the company.

within the scope of the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing, the activities of the compliance area include filtering
operations to comply with the sanctions and embargos regime imposed by the competent national and international authorities,
monitoring them to prevent potentially irregular situations and also the prior validation, substantive and formal, of the opening and
maintenance of entities and accounts and of credit operations. these functions, based on tailored technological solutions, also
include the definition and management of the risk models in view of the evolution shown by the several variables that lead to the
computation of scorings to apply to the operations.

however, avoiding non-compliance by the employees requires not only the implementation and adequacy of the processes in force
within the group to all the regulatory alterations but also training and a permanent flow of information on relevant issues.

this way, in 2015, the performance and intervention in the several business areas enabled the training, in portugal, of 262 employees
on the several issues related with the compliance activity. this training mainly targets the employees' awareness of the need to adopt
an ethical and rigorous professional conduct in their daily functions. this figure has decreased versus 2014, year when transversal
training actions were carried out due to regulatory changes. to provide the employees with the necessary competences to deal with
complex diligence processes, namely those presenting non-negligible risks, in order to decrease operational and fraud risks continues
to be part of the group's activities plan.

      the same employee could have attended several training courses.


moreover, and given the importance of keeping an internal communication flow on compliance issues, the bank continued to provide
the employees, through the bank's intranet, with regular information on how the employees must perform to comply with their duties
of honesty, solvency and financial integrity foreseen in the code of conduct; the violations and non-compliance with those duties are
sanctioned in accordance with the provisos of the internal regulations.

in accordance with the regulations in eﬀect, the bank gave to the compliance oﬃce the function of supervising and validating all
the contents of the advertising items, detached or included in advertising campaigns of products and services commercialized by
the group. the trend, already observed in 2014, of compliance with the duties of information and transparency in the advertising
of financial products and services was consolidated by the marketing and communication divisions and bcp did not have any
administrative proceeding brought against it by banco de portugal or by cmvm.

the bank also maintained a cooperation and loyal relation with the judicial authorities and with the behavioural supervision
authorities, domestic and international. within this scope, and by its own initiative, it made a total of 364 communications to local
judicial entities and replied to 1,106 requests.

  internal audit
  the audit division is a component of the internal control system of bcp whose main mission is to ensure to the bank's stakeholders
  the eﬃciency and adequacy of the bank's internal control system as a whole and also to ensure the adequacy of the governance and
  risk management processes used by the bank and by the group.

  the mission of the audit division is exercised in accordance with the internal audit principles internationally recognized and accepted
  and in accordance with the guidelines approved by the executive committee of the board of directors, with a prior opinion issued by
  the audit committee. the objective of this mission is to ensure the existence of an eﬃcient and appropriate control environment, a
  sounder risk management system and an eﬃcient information and communication system through the establishment of an eﬀective
  monitoring system for the internal control system of the bank and of the group. the functions of the audit division were reinforced
  in 2014 with the transfer of the models validation function to this division.

  the exercise of the internal audit function is paramount amongst the functions attributed to the audit division and has a permanent
  and independent nature.

  the audit programs include the assessment of behavioural issues, the compliance with the legislation and with all the remaining rules
  and codes of conduct, the proper use of the delegated competences and the respect for the performance principles in force in what
  concerns the relations established with the customers, internal and external. pursuant to the strategic guidelines defined for the
  internal audit function, the bank has been intensifying the adoption of the integrated method/end-to-end in audits and processes.

  throughout 2015, as an integrant part of the execution of its activities plan, the audit division also assessed the issues related with
  the management of environmental and social practices resulting from or related with the object of each audit in particular. particularly
  in what concerns the audits made to the networks, one must also point out the mechanisms to prevent and detect practices showing
  that money is being laundered.

  the prevention and mitigation of the risk of fraud, as well as the detection and investigation of fraud attempts or situations, internal
  or external, and the execution and monitoring of the consequent eventual disciplinary or judicial proceedings are also a priority in the
  distribution of resources allocated to the audit division. all the claims, complaints or denouncement of situations that show socially
  inappropriate behaviours by the employees, either among themselves or relating to customers, are also assessed and investigated
  and will originate disciplinary proceedings whenever deemed justified.

  in 2015, the preventive controls carried out and the subsequent individual assessments of potentially irregular situations, as well as of
  situations reported by other organic units of the bank, concluded 429 preliminary investigation proceedings (380 in 2014). in 2015,
  41 disciplinary proceedings brought against employees of the bank in portugal were completed. by the end of 2015 there were 7
  proceedings underway. none of the cases involved situations of corruption.

  the head of the audit division is also responsible for coordinating the audit function in all the subsidiary companies of group bcp,
  promoting the harmonization of procedures and assessment criteria and the sharing of knowledge, namely by assisting them in the
  preparation and execution of audits relating to interests that are common to the several institutions.

  the standardization of the practices in force in the internal audits of the several operations of the group increased throughout the
  years, either by the adoption of joint approach methods, safeguarding eventual diﬀerences due to local regulations, or by the setting
  up of audit teams, at group level, responsible for the execution of audits relating to specific issues in any of the countries where the
  group operates.

  also within the scope of ethics and professional conduct, and to reinforce the commitment of millennium bcp towards individuals
  and society, it subscribed and published the equality and non-discrimination policy and, among other, the sustainability, social,
  environmental and human rights policies.

in 2015, the bank also continued the “mystery client” by
making 4 surveys, totalling more than 2,400 visits to mass
market branches. three of those surveys assessed a scenario of
“account opening” by a potential client.

the two last surveys made in 2015, with 82%, showed a
significant improvement versus previous surveys on the same
issue. even so, this result is below the intended percentage for
the assistance choreography, since the bank intends to achieve
a global fulfilment level above 85%.

in angola, the focus continues to be the actions carried out by the “mystery client”, which visited 82 branches of the networks
individuals and companies, wherein the aspects relating to servicing and products traded were particularly valued. the results of
these evaluations are shared with the areas directly involved, notably the commercial, marketing and operations divisions, and
enable the discussion of improvement opportunities and the definition of action plans.

concerning the surveys to assess the client's satisfaction levels, internal and external, in 2015 only took place the implementation of
corrective actions and improvements defined by the last surveys made. in 2016 the evaluation surveys shall be resumed.

claims
concerning claims on products and services, one of the priorities of group bcp is to ensure the ongoing improvement of its management
in the countries where it operates, either by optimizing, simplifying and accelerating the reply procedures or by the regular assessment and
monitoring of the satisfaction of the claimants with the solution presented to them. the identification and assessment of the origin of the
claims aiming at their correction are also part of an unequivocal orientation of the bank for client servicing.

in portugal, the claims are managed by the customer care centre (cac). the total number of claims showed a slight decrease if
compared with the previous year, showing a total of 27,529. the majority of the claims (80%) are related to entries in the current
account, transactions with cards and with automated services. the eﬀort to rapidly solve the claims has been a constant concern of
the bank, which has been able to ensure an average response time of 6 business days.

bank millennium defined as a goal a 7-day deadline to conclude the process; a deadline that in 2014 was of 11 days and in 2015 of 9 days. in
angola, the number of claims recorded increased 34.4%, an increase justified by the significant expansion of the network and the increasing
level of demand evidenced by the customers. the issues object of more claims were cards and bank products. the average resolution deadline
is 11 days, a significant improvement versus 2014, when the deadline was 27 days. in mozambique, claims evidenced a significant increase of
214.7%, as a result, partially, of the sale of new products and services and a more intensive use of remote channels. the cards and the current
accounts continued to be the object of more claims. in spite of the significant increase in the claims, this operation was able to keep an average
claims resolution deadline of 7 days.

the customers of millennium bcp may bring to the client ombudsman claims due to actions or omissions by the bank's corporate
bodies and employees. all the claims addressed to the ombudsman oﬃce are firstly handled and managed by the cac; the
ombudsman oﬃce analyses and gives a final opinion to claims received in connection with prior claims presented by the customers
that obtained an unfavourable decision.

thus, and considering the activity developed in 2015, the ombudsman oﬃce analysed 43 new claims, with an average time of 17
working days. it also received 844 claims that it forwarded to the bank's services in charge of handling them and of providing a final
response to the claimants. the issues – from a product or financial standpoint – that raised the greatest number of claims from the
customers were those related to “deposit accounts”, "credit recovery” and “insurance policies”, representing an average of 49%
of the claims. when one assesses the business areas with a greater number of claims, the one showing the highest number is retail
banking, with 78%.

about during the olympics, an additional contribution for the
preparation of a new generation, more informed on financial
concepts and services. in 2015, the winning school was escola
secundária santa ana da munhuana, followed by escola
secundária metodista unida and escola secundária albert
einstein.

also in mozambique, and part of the activities promoted by the
central bank in the context of the world savings day, millennium
bim has been launching a number of educational initiatives
in schools but also in the bank's branches to promote the
children's and young people's awareness of the importance of
saving and of financial inclusion. in 2015, teachers and student
attended workshops and lectures, apart from participating in
educational contests.

in angola, bma, in the wake of the agreement established
with banco nacional de angola, targeted at the development
and implementation of the financial education programme,
continues to carry out initiatives that aim to help consumers
to manage their income, their savings and investment
decisions and also increment the adoption of informed
consumer practices. in 2015, it promoted direct actions to
inform and clarify the client's doubts at branches, together
with the promotion of the automated channels therein
available.

in poland, we must point out the finance manager, a free of
charge online service that enables to make a follow-up of the
family budget through the automated classification of the
entries made in the current accounts and of the use of credit
cards and the possibility of creating budgets for the control
of expenses. the bank also provided information and training
contents to its customers, namely to companies, and carried
out seminars on financial literacy.

especially addressed to the younger segment of the population,
one must mention the project “bakcyl – bankers for financial
education of youth”, a joint initiative of the polish bank
sector which, with the volunteer participation of employees
as trainers, aims to transmit to students of the secondary
schools the knowledge which will enable them to make a
more informed and responsible use of financial products and          of projects for the achievement of eﬃciency in the long run

portugal – environmental signs campaign
in portugal, the bank continued the internal communication campaign – reduction of consumption/environmental signs
campaign, an initiative which intends to i) reduce the bank's operating costs, (ii) improve its environmental performance
and e (iii) increase the identification of the employees with the organization.

this initiative aimed at decreasing consumption, especially targeting electricity, water and paper, was part of a broader
programme to cut down on consumption underway at the bank, which translates into upgrading the technological
infrastructures, rationalizing technical, logistic and operating means, monitoring proceedings and other improvements, and
into the involvement of employees and resident outsourcers, as they play a role in the eﬀective behavioural change to how
the resources available are used.

thus, an essential goal underlying this initiative was to encourage and motivate employees to, through their individual
contribution, translating into a strict management of the resources available to undertake the daily activities, be part of the
collective eﬀort to transform millennium bcp into a more environmentally sustainable bank.

    mozambique – support to the environmental awareness of local communities
    in mozambique, millennium bim has been supporting and developing projects to increase the awareness of the local
    communities on environmental issues and initiatives to preserve environment and improve the quality of life of the
    individuals, of which stands out the aid granted to amor – associação moçambicana de reciclagem, an environmental
    association for the development of the selective collection of urban waste. by means of the 10 existing eco-points, an
    average of 120 tons of waste is recycled every month, from 2,400 to 2,600 m3, a figure representing a significant saving in
    natural resources and in co2 emission. figures show that, apart from the fact that this environmental project is contributing
    to improve the management of waste by the municipalities of maputo and matola, one can also observe a change in the
    habits of many families in what concerns recycling and reuse of waste materials.

    in 2015, amor developed the project “uma cidade limpa pra mim – recicla e ganha” to increase the young students
    awareness for the importance of their behaviour towards the adoption of good environmental practices and their role in
    contributing for a change of habits at home showing that, together, they can make a diﬀerence in reducing urban waste
    and contribute for the construction of a better mozambique.

    in the six months of the project, it carried out several activities for the preservation of environment and the promotion
    of sustainability principles: reduce, reuse and recycle. in spaces developed by technicians of amor - environment clubs
    – students and teachers carried out several activities demonstrating the importance of children as citizens in their relation
    with the environment.

    each school has a recycling station where the correct separation of waste is made. the schools were able to collect more
    than 8 tons of paper, plastic and cans.

    still within the scope of this project, they oﬀered to feima – feira de artesanato, flores e gastronomia de maputo, garbage
    cans which were painted by artists belonging to the association who were able to create true works of art.



  environmental footprint

  the bcp group regularly monitors a set of environmental performance indicators that measure the level of eco-eﬃciency of the bank
  vs. the main resources consumption, namely: water, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste and materials.

  globally, the bank's level of eco-eﬃciency continued to improve as a result of the continuous investment in new equipments, better
  procedures and in the changes introduced in the employees' behaviour.

  when the environmental performance indicators of group bcp per employee (indicated in the following table) are assessed, we can
  observe a positive performance by the majority of the indicators. the consumption of paper increased versus 2014, mainly in the
  operations of mozambique and switzerland and the global decrease in the number of employees of group bcp due to the bank's
  internal restructuring process resulted in an increase in the paper consumption ratio per employee.

                                                                                       2015 sustainability report • environmental responsibility 

energy consumption
the bank's consumption of energy is mostly of indirect origin, which corresponds to the electricity and thermal energy acquired and met
60% of the bank's energy needs in 2015. the consumption of indirect and direct energy went down 14% and 11%, respectively vs. 2014.

concerning the domestic activity, millennium bcp reduced its energy consumption by 9%, and exceeded its annual target (-5%). the
consumption of electricity went down 9% vs 2014. this 5.1 gwh reduction avoided around 1,175 tons of co2 and saved more than
700 thousand euros.

the cogeneration central in tagus park produced 19% of the electricity consumed by the bank.

in portugal, there was also a significant reduction in the consumption of direct energy, namely 11% of natural gas and around 6% of
diesel due to the reduction of the car fleet and in the number of employees.

internationally speaking, the reductions verified in the consumption of indirect energy are mostly due to the 25% decrease in the
consumption of electricity in poland as a result of the energy eﬃciency measures implemented and of the closing of some agencies
as well as to the operation in angola which, due to the central services having moved to other premises, was unable to assess the
respective consumption.

there was also a fall in the consumption of petrol in angola (-18%), in mozambique (-10%) and in poland (-7%) due to the reduction
of the car fleet.

material issue: climate change

assuming the commitment of fighting climate changes, group bcp computes and monitors its carbon footprint and takes part every
year in the carbon disclosure project (cdp).

the bank has been implementing a set of actions to reduce energy consumption and minimise greenhouse gas emissions. bcp's
carbon footprint follows the decreasing trend recorded for the consumption of direct and indirect energy, with total greenhouse gas
emissions down 8% vs. 2014.

 the emissions from thermal and electric energy acquired in portugal, angola, mozambique, poland, switzerland and romania (2013).(3) indirect emissions (scope 3) –
 includes the emissions from portugal, poland and romania (2013). mozambique, angola and switzerland are not included.



globally speaking, the emissions associated to the consumption of petrol (scope 1) were down 11%, versus 2014, translating the
11% decrease in the use of indirect energy. concerning the emissions related to the consumption of electricity and services mobility
(scopes 2 and 3), they fell around 7% and 3%, respectively, caused by the 14% decrease in the consumption of indirect energy and
the 7% reduction in plane travels.

concerning waste management, in 2015, in portugal the waste produced increased 19%, mainly due to the deactivation of premises
which forced the elimination of a portion of the existing archives. the bank sent an average of 43% of the paper and cardboard for
recycling.

in poland, the bank follows the applicable environmental regulations (waste act), which orders an appropriate management of waste,
whether through a series of protocols (acceptance protocols, protocols of confirmed utilisation or waste transfer card) or through
the obligation of submitting specifications about the type and volume of waste to the local oﬃces. in 2015, the bank entered into
a contract with a licensed service provider for the collection, transportation and recycling of materials. around 80% of the waste
produced was recycled. moreover, the bank also encourages the reutilisation of oﬃce furnishings and equipment.



  poland – millennium bank uses the wiewiórka plataform
  millennium bank established a cooperation protocol with wiewiórka.pl (www.wiewiorka.pl), the first and a single internet
  platform in poland acting as in intermediary between those who wish to recycle waste and the specialized companies of this
  particular sector.

  with wiewiórka.pl it is possible, in an easy and rapid manner, to recycle clothing, electronic waste, metals and also many
  other obsolete materials, sending them by mail.

  the price of the waste to recycle is established and the amount due is transferred into a pre-paid card issued by bank
  millennium and received by the service user in the welcoming package.

  the participant may also, if he wishes to do so, donate the amount received to a charitable institution.

  in portugal, pursuant to the evaluation carried out by analyst esg (environmental social governance) – vigeo –, european leader in
  assessing sustainability and social responsibility, millennium bcp: i) was listed in the index “ethibel excellence europe", which includes
  the 200 european companies with the best performance in terms of sustainability; ii) was recognised in the “ethibel excellence
  investment register”, translating its high performance in terms of sustainability practices for the market and potential investors.
  as a result of the assessment made by the analyst – sustainalytics –, a benchmark multinational within the scope of sustainable
  development, it was also listed in the "stoxx europe sustainability" and "euro stoxx sustainability" and returned to the indexes esg
  of the analyst ecpi through the “global developed esg best in class – equity”.

  in poland, bank millennium was listed for the eighth consecutive time in the respect index. this assessment project managed by the
  warsaw stock exchange together with the stock exchange association and the audit company deloitte, seeks to recognise companies

 methodology • sustainability report 2015




  methodology
  scope of the report

  the scope of the indicators reported is international and included in 2015 the following operations: portugal, poland, mozambique,
  angola and switzerland.

  report limitations
  most quantitative indicators have records that go back three years. the most significant limitations of the report are related to the
  comparison and analysis of the indicators' evolution.

  in 2010, angola and switzerland were included in the report, in the economic and social indicators, therefore it was not directly
  comparable to the 2009 sustainability report.

  in 2013, all the data for 2012 were recalculated so as to include the data from angola in absolute numbers and this enable comparing
  with the bank's data reported in 2013. in 2013, the report no longer included greece, and in 2014 it no longer included romania,
  as these operations were sold in the meantime. thus, a large part of the annual variations must be seen as possibly altered by the
  greek and romanian operations leaving the bcp group.

  calculation criteria

  social indicators
  rotations
  new hire rate = (number of new employees hired) / (total number of employees) *100

  internal mobility rate = (number of employees in internal mobility processes) / (total number of employees) *100

  turnover rate = (number of employees that left the company) / (total number of employees) *100

  absences
  absenteeism rate = (total number of workdays with absences recorded) / (48*5*total number of employees) *100

  health
  workplace injury rate = (number of employees that were injured while at work) / (total number of employees) *100

  48*5*total number of employees – maximum work potential in the organisation per year, wherein 48 represents the number of work
  weeks and 5 represents the number of working days per week.

  environmental indicators

  g4-en1
  the figures presented include portugal / poland / mozambique / angola / switzerland.

  consumption of paper and cardboard – total estimated based on the purchase of these materials and numbers in stock records. the
  weight of the paper units was found using standard paper measurements issued by the iso 216 standard.

  plastic consumption – total estimated based on the purchase of these materials and numbers in stock records. the calculation of the
  amount of plastic used in bank cards was based on the number of cards issued for customers and on the standard weight of a card.

  consumption of ink and toner cartridges – total estimated based on the purchase of these materials. in portugal, the values reported
  include ink and toner cartridges used by the bank through xerox.

                                                                                          2015 sustainability report • methodology 
