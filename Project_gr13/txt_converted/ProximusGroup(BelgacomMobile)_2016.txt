introduction
at proximus, we want to contribute to a sustainable and safer society,
in which everyone can participate. we want to incorporate ethics and a
responsible approach in everything we and our suppliers undertake.


we operate in fields where we developed longstanding credibility and
recognised expertise because we are passionate about what we do.


we are fighting to close the digital gap by offering training to the elderly,
to jobseekers, children and the public as well as setting up initiatives
designed to improve access to our products and services for the disabled
people and longterm sick children.


we are committed to the environment and are concerned about
climate change, which means that we are trying to reduce our carbon
footprint as well as helping our customers reduce their own impact
by using our products and services.

strategy
our corporate social responsibility (csr) strategy sets out to create shared
value for our company and our stakeholders. we want to make a sustainable
contribution to technological, social and economic progress with our activities.




in 2015, our csr activities were mainly a continuation of the strategy that was revised in 2014 and which is based on three
pillars, i.e., education, communities and green. we also make a point of ensuring that our suppliers and our subcontractors
apply csr standards in their own activities.

towards carbon neutrality




our climate is changing worldwide, resulting in more extreme weather
conditions and rising sea levels. this is largely due to greenhouse gas emissions,
such as co2, which are a contributing factor in global warming. proximus wants
to actively combat climate change and has the ambition to be a climate neutral
company as of 2016.


moreover, proximus will continue to help other industries reduce their carbon
footprint with its products and services.


our action areas are:

  to continue to reduce our            help our customers reduce
  environmental impact and become      their environmental impact.
  climate neutral in 2016. after
  reducing co2 emissions by 70%
  in 2007-2015 for our belgian
  activities we set ourselves an
  additional target of reducing
  carbon emissions by 30% for the
  period from 2015 until 2025 for      talk to our stakeholders, raise
  the entire proximus group. we will   their awareness and increase

  cannot reduce as of 2016.            change and the environment.

scope 3
besides scope 1 and 2 reporting and the partial reporting of three “scope 3”
categories in previous csr reports from 2007 until 2014, proximus has
extended the scope of its ghg reporting to include all relevant categories of
the ghg scope 3 corporate value chain standard, in accordance with
the ghg protocol and bilan carbone.

waste
one hundred percent of all waste generated by proximus is recyclable, 15% of
which is residual waste that is converted into recoverable energy. the largest
proportion of the total, i.e. 48%, is made up of stones and sand from our
network operations. twenty-five percent consists of recyclable material, glass,
plastic paper, wood, batteries, toners and so on. the remaining 12% is electronic
waste which is re-used or recycled.

proximus offers dozens of solutions that can contribute to achieving this mission and building a more sustainable future, by reducing
costs for its customers as well as the company’s own ecological footprint in terms of transport and energy.

the proximus website now offers an overview of the potential contribution of these solutions in order to reduce companies’ carbon
footprint. various categories, such as “energy consumption”, “save on travel”, “dematerialisation” and “environmental footprint”
allow website visitors to easily see at a glance which solutions can help achieve which objectives.

www.proximus.be › large companies › discover › boost your business › innovations › our green solutions

cloud solutions already widely use our optimised datacentres and virtualisation technology, thereby significantly reducing the
energy consumption compared to outdated servers in their own environment. technology such as videoconferencing and unified
communications offer people the ability to work together remotely. they promote homeworking while also reducing travel. our engage
packs and our packs for employees allow companies to promote new ways of working (nwow).




in 2015, the lora™ (low power long
range) network was launched. this
technology allows sensors to work on
batteries for at least five years, and also
contributes to a very energy-efficient
network. proximus thus allows companies
develop new services or be more efficient.

this technology is used among others,
in an experimental manner, to find the
available parking spaces in a city and
reduce the number of cars circulating in
the city as they search for a parking space.

the internet of things (iot) is one of the
most promising economic developments.




   a few other innovations in 2015:

   › pabx in the cloud (“cloud connect”), as well as ucaas
   › we help companies implement a “new way of working” strategy with engage packs and packs for employees.
   › lifecycle management service for detecting outdated material at the customer and help the customer with innovation.
   › dematerialisation: b2b system link for exchanging electronic invoices with business customers.
