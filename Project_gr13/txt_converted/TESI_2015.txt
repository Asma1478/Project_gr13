aim of starting to issue corporate responsibility reports

are addressed, in addition to conventional financial
reporting.


how would you describe corporate
responsibility in finnish fund
management companies?

finnish fund management companies are often more
advanced in esg matters than their foreign peers.
there is much that still needs to be addressed,
however – in particular, how corporate responsibility
aspects can be exploited in portfolio companies as a
factor creating business opportunities, and not simply
for managing risk.


prospects for the corporate
responsibility and responsible
investment of management companies

during 2014, each of fii’s fund management
companies made progress in applying responsible
investment principles to their operations, and portfolio
company managers gave corporate responsibility
issues even more priority on their agendas. in almost
all management companies responsible investment
procedures are becoming entrenched as a continuous
element in the investment process as well as in
developing and adding value to portfolio companies.

what opportunities or benefits does
promoting corporate responsibility
offer companies in the mining sector?

open interaction builds trust between the mining
industry and its stakeholders. this, in turn, strengthens
the framework for sustainable mining.

companies are offered self-motivated reporting and a
supplementary rating system. canada, for example,
uses a similar procedure. reporting and open
interaction bring transparency to companies’
operations, and also facilitate comparison of the
environmental impacts of different sectors.
