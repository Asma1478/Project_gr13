41 capital management
	group’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and
  to sustain future development of the business. management monitors the return on capital, as well as the level of
  dividends to equity shareholders. the board of directors seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns
  that might be possible with higher levels of borrowing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital
  position. group’s target is to achieve a return on capital above 35%; in 2016-17 the return was 41% and in 2015-16 the
  return was 44%.

	group monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘adjusted equity’. for this purpose, adjusted net debt is
  defined as total liabilities, comprising interest-bearing loans and borrowings and obligations under finance leases,
  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. adjusted equity comprises all components of equity.

     group’s policy is to keep the ratio below 1.00 and its adjusted net debt to equity ratio at 31st march 2017 was as follows.

                                                                                                                             ` in cr.

		although the analysis does not take into account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does
   provide an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. the estimate of future increase in compensation levels,
   considered in the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other
   relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.

		       the expected contributions for defined benefit plan for the next financial year will be in line with fy 2016-17.

 44.3 leave encashment:
		the holding company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated
      and encashed as per the company’s rule. the liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has been
      provided based on report of independent actuary using “projected unit credit method”.

  accordingly ` 3.87 cr. (pr. yr. ` 3.29 cr.) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences as per
		
  actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.

		 employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at mauritius:
		for employees who are not covered by a pension plan, the net present value of severance allowances payable
   is provided for ` 0.03 cr. (pr. yr. ` 0.05 cr.).

		 employee retirement and other benefit obligations in respect of the subsidiary at philippines:
		short term benefits includes salaries and wages and other government contributions which are due within 12
   months after the end of the period in which employee renders the related service. the company’s short term
   employee benefits amounted to ` 11.58 cr. (pr. yr. ` 10.22 cr.). the company did not yet set up a retirement plan
   since it does not have more than ten employees who had served at least five years.

	level 1 – the hierarchy in level 1 includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. this includes mutual
  funds that have quoted price. the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav.

	level 2 – the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like forward contracts) is
  determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible
  on entity-specific estimates. if all significant inputs required to fair value as instrument are observable, the instrument
  is included in level 2.

	level 3 – if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in
  level 3. this is the case for unlisted equity securities, etc. included in level 3.

      financing activities at market linked rates, any changes in the interest rates environment may impact
      future rates of borrowing.

58	company had invested in a jv turkmenderman ajanta pharma ltd. (tdapl) about two decade back, where it had
     management control. however later on, company surrendered management control in favour of local partner and
     since then do not have any control on the same. further tdapl operates under severe restriction that significantly
     impairs its ability to transfer the funds. hence, company impaired entire investment in tdapl and considered as
     unrelated party. company has been making efforts to divest this investment since last few years without any success.

  in the preparation of these ind-as financial statements, the group has made several presentation differences
  between previous gaap and ind-as. these differences have no impact on reported profit or total equity.
  accordingly, some assets and liabilities have been reclassified into another line item under ind-as at the date
  of transition. further, in these financial statements, some line items are described differently under ind-as
  compared to previous gaap, although the assets and liabilities included in these line items are unaffected.

40 capital management:
	company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and
  to sustain future development of the business. management monitors the return on capital, as well as the level of
  dividends to equity shareholders. the board of directors seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns
  that might be possible with higher levels of borrowing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital
  position. company’s target is to achieve a return on capital above 35%; in 2016-17 the return was 43% and in 2015-16
  the return was 47%.

	company monitors capital using a ratio of ‘adjusted net debt’ to ‘adjusted equity’. for this purpose, adjusted net debt
  is defined as total liabilities, comprising interest-bearing loans and borrowings and obligations under finance leases,
  less cash and cash equivalents and current investments. adjusted equity comprises all components of equity.

 company’s policy is to keep the ratio below 1.00 and its adjusted net debt to equity ratio at 31st march 2017 was as
	
 follows.

		sensitivity analysis
  reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other
  assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.

                                                                                                                         ` in cr.
          particulars                                                      31 march 2017                   31 march 2016
                                                                         increase      decrease          increase     decrease
          discount rate (0.5% movement)                                      15.81         17.44             13.66         15.01
          salary growth rate (0.5% movement)                                  17.41       15.83             15.00         13.67


          although the analysis does not take into account full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does
          provide an approximation of sensitivity of assumptions. the estimate of future increase in compensation levels,
          considered in the actuarial valuation, have been taken on account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other
          relevant factors such as supply and demand in the employment market.

          the expected contributions for defined benefit plan for the next financial year will be in line with fy 2016-17.

     42.3 leave encashment:
          company’s employees are entitled for compensated absences which are allowed to be accumulated and
          encashed as per company’s rule. the liability of compensated absences, which is non-funded, has been provided
          based on report of independent actuary using “projected unit credit method”.

          accordingly ` 3.87 cr. (pr. yr. ` 3.29 cr.) being liability as at the year-end for compensated absences as per
          actuarial valuation has been provided in the accounts.

43 share based payments
	company has implemented “employees stock options scheme 2011” (‘esos – 2011’) as approved in earlier year by
  the shareholders of company and compensation committee of board of directors.

	during the year 15,500 options have been granted by company under the aforesaid esos – 2011 to the employees
  of company.

     the options are granted at an exercise price which is in accordance with the relevant sebi guidelines in force, at the
     time of such grants. each option entitles the holder to exercise the right to apply for and seek allotment of one equity
     share of ` 2/- each.

		 fair value hierarchy
		this section explains the judgements and estimates made in determining the fair values of the financial instruments
   that are (a) recognised and measured at fair value and (b) measured at amortised cost and for which fair values
   are disclosed in the financial statements. to provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in
   determining fair value, the company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under
   the accounting standard. an explanation of each level follows underneath the table.
                                                                                                                            ` in cr.

		level 1: level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. this includes mutual
   funds that have quoted price. the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav.

		level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (like forward contracts) is
   determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as
   possible on entity-specific estimates. if all significant inputs required to fair value as instrument are observable,
   the instrument is included in level 2.

		level 3: if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included
   in level 3. this is the case for unlisted equity securities etc. included in level 3.

1) fair valuation of investments
	  under the previous gaap, investments in equity instruments and mutual funds were classified as long term
    investments or current investments based on the intended holding period and realisability. long – term
    investments were carried at cost less provision for other than the temporary decline in the value of such
    investments. current investments were carried at lower of cost and fair value. under ind as these investments
    are required to be measured at fair value. the resulting fair value changes of these investments have been
    recognised in retained earnings as at the date of transition and subsequently in the profit or loss for the year
    ended 31st march 2016. this increased the retained earnings by ` 6.79 cr. (net of deffered tax) as at 31st march 2016
    (1st april 2015 – ` 3.75 cr.).

2) proposed dividend
	under previous gaap, proposed dividend including dividend distribution tax (ddt), are recognised as liability in the
   period to which they relate, irrespective of when they are declared. under ind as, proposed dividend is recognised as
   liability in the period in which it is declared by company, usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting,
   or paid.

   5) other comprehensive income
		under ind as, all items of income and expense recognised in a period should be included in profit or loss for the
   period, unless a standard requires or permits otherwise. items of income and expense that are not recognised
   in profit or loss but are shown in the statement of profit and loss as ‘other comprehensive income’ includes
   remeasurements of defined benefit plans. the concept of other comprehensive income did not exist under the
   previous gaap.

		under ind as, bank overdrafts repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the cash management process
   are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of presentation of statement of cash flows. under previous
   gaap, bank overdrafts were considered as part of borrowings and movements in bank overdrafts were shown as part
   of financing activities. consequently, cash and cash equivalents have reduced by ` 11.58 cr. as at 31st march 2016 (1st
   april 2015 – ` 12.82 cr.)

7)   excise duty :

      nder the previous gaap, revenue from sale of products was presented exclusive of excise duty. under ind as, revenue from
     sale of goods is presented inclusive of excise duty. the excise duty paid is presented on the face of the statement of profit and
     loss as part of expenses. this change has resulted in an increase in total revenue and total expenses for the year ended 31st
     march 2016 by inr ` 15.39 cr. there is no impact on the total equity and profit.

8)   cash discount:
      nder previous gaap, cash discount of ` 0.11 cr. was recognised as part of other expenses which has been adjusted
     u
     against the revenue under ind as during the year ended 31st march 2016. there is no impact on the total equity and
     profit.

	in the preparation of these ind-as financial statements, company has made several presentation differences between
  previous gaap and ind-as. these differences have no impact on reported profit or total equity. accordingly, some
  assets and liabilities have been reclassified into another line item under ind-as at the date of transition. further, in
  these financial statements, some line items are described differently under ind-as compared to previous gaap,
  although the assets and liabilities included in these line items are unaffected.
