report on activities
for the year 2013
putting biodiversity
at the heart of
decision-making

about unep world conservation monitoring centre
unep-wcmc is the specialist biodiversity assessment arm of the united nations environment
programme (unep) based in cambridge, uk.

unep works to encourage sustainable development through sound environmental practices, and
has an extensive portfolio of activities around biodiversity. to help deliver these, it collaborates
with wcmc, a not-for-profit organization with staff that includes over a hundred specialists in
the fields of biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as social science, economics, law and
information technology.

working with partners worldwide, the centre provides objective, scientifically rigorous products
and services to help decision makers learn about the value of biodiversity and apply this
knowledge. we not only collate and verify data on biodiversity and ecosystem services but also
analyze and interpret it, making the results available to our partners in accessible forms.

our funding comes from a variety of sources, including unep, international governmental
and non-governmental organizations, national governments, the corporate sector and private
foundations. a wide range of people also donate their time to help the centre, including library
volunteers, postgraduate students, interns and collaborating scientists.

                                      want our support to partners to be outstanding. the launch of

                                      major successes of the year. in 2014, we will continue our
                                      strategic efforts to build on this success, attracting new partners
                                      and investing in other leading edge systems to support decision

                                          such success, welcome of course for its own sake, also
                                      demands that we ask questions about how to achieve most
                                      through our partnership with unep. we have embarked on
                                      a focused exploration of the impacts of our work and how
                                      we measure them. although measurement will not be easily
                                      achieved, this is a worthwhile quest as we set our sights on
                                      future goals and work more directly to position biodiversity at
                                      the heart of decision-making.
                                          we know that our staff enjoy their work and the success that
                                      their efforts bring. it is my pleasure here to express the board’s
                                      sincere appreciation to all our staff. they demonstrate huge
                                      commitment to their work – without them, none of this would
                                      be possible.

  unep divisions and for the     the team taking a leading role in the development of several
     unstinting efforts of our   important project documents where hitherto we had only
        wcmc counterparts”       played a supporting role.
                                     this report highlights a number of the results we delivered
                                 in 2013 to showcase the diversity of our collaboration with unep
                                 colleagues, friends in the biodiversity-related conventions and
                                 partners in governments, non-governmental organizations
                                 and the private sector. i am hugely grateful for the outstanding
                                 level of support we receive from the unep divisions and for the
                                 unstinting efforts of our wcmc counterparts whose scientific
                                 and technical expertise make our work possible.
                                     our achievements in 2013, coupled with our ever increasing
                                 integration into the unep programme of work, should make
                                 it possible for us to explore mechanisms for delivering more
                                 services at the regional and national levels in 2014. hopefully i
                                 will be able to report considerable progress in this direction the
                                 next time i write for the annual report!

     improving quality,
     performance and
     impact
     as a service provider, unep-wcmc’s
     reputation and partner relationships
     are critical to our ongoing success.
     we are judged on the quality of our work, and we are expected to deliver
     timely products that are scientifically rigorous, accurate and impartial, in
     a form that is useful to decision makers.

     quality
     following a wide review of our current practices, we have established a
     set of quality standards for all our products and services. we have also
     developed an internal reporting and disclosure system that will enable
     us to track our adherence to these standards. particularly important
     areas in assuring quality are: peer review at several stages of product
     development, including early planning and final publication; external
     feedback; and maintenance of sufficient supporting information for
     others to query or replicate any aspects of our work.

     performance and impact
     other areas of our performance also require monitoring. our existing
     key performance indicators, shown on pages 6 and 7 of this report, help
     us to keep on top of some of these, but by no means all. during 2013,
     with help from a team of mphil conservation leadership students from
     the judge business school in cambridge, we identified a number of
     areas for improvement. these included the need for a greater breadth
     of feedback from partners and clients, and a focus on the results of our
     capacity development work, which is one of the pillars of our strategy
     and an emerging focus for 2014.
         these areas are important for increasing our impact and achieving
     better performance. to take them forward in 2013, we created two
     new posts. the head of impact strategy is exploring what and
     where unep-wcmc’s impact has been, and what we should strive
     for in coming years. the head of capacity development is taking
     responsibility for developing a longer-term, results-oriented approach
     to capacity development, particularly in our work supporting
     national government partners. the creation of these two new posts

carbon offsetting
the centre has been running a carbon offsetting scheme since 2010, which
compensates for 100 per cent of the emissions resulting from the centre’s
air travel and building emissions. in 2013, a total sum of £6,052 was
allocated to the offsetting scheme. funds to offset building emissions will
support a local project, the wildlife trust west cambridgeshire hundreds
project. funds related to air travel will be donated to the kasigau corridor
redd+ project in kenya.
    we believe it is important to offset both our direct and indirect
emissions, so the offsetting scheme includes an additional 303 tonnes of
co2 attributed to flights booked for external participants attending the
centre’s workshops.

     working at

     we benefit from the work of
     a wide range of high-calibre
     professionals.

     we are very proud of our core team of about 120 scientific and
     support staff, our fellows and our numerous interns. we believe
     that these committed professionals position the centre well for
     strong performance in future years.

     staff survey
     the centre has been running an annual staff survey for the
     last seven years, evaluating our employee motivation levels
     and gathering views on a range of subjects. these include the
     effectiveness of our management, leadership and governance,
     and our organizational arrangements.
         the survey was launched as a forum for feedback within
     the centre, to support our objective of ensuring that staff are
     motivated and engaged. it has proved to be very useful, and
     in 2013 we were once again encouraged by an extremely high
     response rate of 90 per cent. some highlights from this year’s
     survey include:
     • the overwhelming majority of staff viewed the partnership
        between unep and wcmc as beneficial, with 98 per
        cent agreeing that it is a major asset. confidence in our
        partnership has been consistently strong in the survey and
        the current rate is the highest reported level.
     • in addition to 80 per cent of respondents who agreed that
        the centre is a great place to work, 93 per cent agreed that
        it provides exposure to interesting people and new ideas.
        the centre prides itself on providing opportunities for staff
        to engage with a variety of biodiversity professionals and
        innovative concepts. we are pleased that positive responses
        have been in excess of 90 per cent since 2007.
     • our staff appreciate the approach to scientific quality
        embedded within our organizational culture, and 94 per cent
        would recommend our services and products to others.
