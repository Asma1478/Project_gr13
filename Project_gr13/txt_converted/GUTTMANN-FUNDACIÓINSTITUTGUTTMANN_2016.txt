2   institut guttmann. 2016 annual report / corporate social responsibility report

presentation

we are pleased to present the 2016 social report of the institut guttmann which includes, for the
first time, the corporate social responsibility (csr) report, which has been recently recog-
nised by the fundación avedis donabedian for its rigour and transparency.

this report is the result of combining in a single document the “social report” that our foundation
had been publishing annually since 1989, with the csr report based on the gri model that we pub-
lished for the first time last year. the scope and complexity of the information it contains, and the
possibility of offering it in a more agile, interactive and understandable way has led us to opt for a
digital edition, available through our website, and to no longer print a traditional paper version; we
believe that this initiative is more efficient and adapts better to the potential of the modern informa-
tion society and our institution’s environmental commitment.

despite the inherent difficulties and uncertainties of the complex modern society and socio-political
times in which we live, 2016 allowed us to meet most of the care, scientific and social objectives that
we had set ourselves for the financial year; it was a year in which the human factor was key to our
organisation’s success, with an excellent team of highly competent and responsible professionals
who are committed to the institut guttmann, the values it represents and the goals it pursues.

in 2016, we can see how we have been gradually making progress in our ambitious “2014-2020
strategic plan” that has now passed the halfway mark. the strategic objectives of the plan are
being met, demonstrating our foundation’s vitality and rigour, as well as its capacity to innovate. the
organisation gains the necessary strength to advance day by day with enthusiasm and persever-
ance thanks to the recognition and affection that we receive from our patients and their families,
as well as the many “friends of the institut guttmann” who, through their generous and continued
support, help us deliver on our original objectives, especially the most daring and innovative ones.

of all the actions carried out in 2016, we would like to highlight the following for their special signifi-
cance:

(i) we have deepened and strengthened the foundation’s organisational structure in order to deal
with future challenges that we face, especially with regard to the forthcoming implementation of
the “guttmann project - la sagrera”. therefore, in addition to reinforcing the first executive level
of the organisation with the incorporation of a manager, we have redefined the managerial and
governance structure to gain in transversality and greater functionality, whilst providing a small tech-
nical support area. we have also launched the “clinical innovation and applied research com-
mittee” to improve the coordination between knowledge generation and innovation, and its rapid
integration into clinical practice.

(ii) the foundation is committed to corporate social responsibility as a comprehensive, inclusive,
participatory and more transparent policy that is committed to people and the environment and is
oriented towards the sustainability of the organisation.

it should be made absolutely clear from the outset that for the institut guttmann, csr is not a prod-
uct of design, nor a strategic marketing decision, but the logical consequence of a long process of
coherently deepening its social commitment to the values that guide its decision-making. csr has
formed and forms part of the dna of the institut guttmann, inspiring all its actions and permeating
the behaviour and attitudes of its whole personnel team.

in 2016, and in accordance with what we announce, we carried out all the work required to make
effective our membership of the global compact and the economy for the common good; in

    presentation



    2017, we committed to proceeding with sr-10 accreditation and the audited self-evaluation of the
    “economy for the common good” that is found in the last chapter of this document.

    (iii) our total quality policy continued, and the following audits were passed favourably during the
    financial year: the iso 14001 environmental certification, the emas european environmental certifi-
    cation, the spanish law on the protection of personal data (lopd), and the requirements of the
    ministry of health as a csur in spinal cord injury. at the same time, we have made progress in the
    preparation of the fifth re-accreditation of joint commission international, which ensures the safety
    and quality of health organisations.

    (iv) the planned care activity was carried out, with a small increase in demand from other funding
    sources (not catsalut), especially in relation to programmes of the initiative guttmann, neuroperson-
    alclínic®.

    in quantitative terms, a total of 4,769 people was seen, of which 807 were hospitalised. of all the
    patients seen, 1,043 (22%) were attending for the first time; this shows how attractive our hospital is
    to patients. this trend is also evident in the number of foreign patients: a total of 81 chose our hospi-
    tal to receive the specialist care they needed. the children’s rehabilitation unit saw a total of 326
    children and teenagers up to 16 years old.

    on a qualitative level, the pilot of the programme “expert caregiver in acquired brain damage” of
    the department of health was launched as a pioneer on a national level; we also continued the
    “post-discharge support programme for people affected by acquired brain damage and their fam-
    ilies in the community environment”. we also improved the overall rating of quality perceived by
    hospitalised patients, which stood at 9.05 out of 10 (8.8 in 2015).

    (v) we have been able to improve the remuneration of our professionals as agreed with our work
    council., with an increase of 3% on the salary items of the agreement (approximately between 1%
    and 3% for each professional). this is a slight but totally fair salary increase after a period of seven
    years in which it was necessary to freeze it due to the economic crisis and the adjustment of tariffs
    by catsalut.

    (vi) the research and innovation programmes were reformulated, favouring their transversality and
    intensifying their orientation to clinical translation, identifying needs to guide new projects and as-
    sessing the results of the research. specifically, we should highlight the barcelona brain health initia-
    tive (bbhi) programme led by professor álvaro pascual-leone, a harvard professor and scientific
    advisor at the institut guttmann, thanks to funding provided by the social programme of “la caixa”
    and also by the abertis foundation, as well as the methodological support of harvard catalyst re-
    searchers; also of interest is the first implantation of mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic
    spinal cord injury in a study promoted by tv3’s la marató, and joining the neurotec network (re-
    search network on neurotechnologies for care and rehabilitation).

    regarding scientific production, in 2016 we worked on 97 research projects, 11 corresponding to
    public calls and 13 doctoral theses. in total, we published 24 indexed articles, with an accumulated
    impact factor of 66.5 (9 in the first quarter), and presented a total of 52 papers to 31 scientific and
    technical forums in spain and internationally.

    in relation to the teaching activity, a total of 203 students took part in teaching programmes of the
    university institute, of which 25 correspond to new registrations in the “master’s degree in neurore-
    habilitation”, 25 in the “master’s degree in neuropsychological rehabilitation and cognitive stimula-
    tion”, and 72 other postgraduate courses accredited by the uab. additionally, we helped to train
    27 resident intern consultants, mainly in physical medicine and rehabilitation, 1 resident intern psy-
    chologist, and up to 47 undergraduate students in different disciplines linked to the world of neuro-
    rehabilitation.

(vii) the social projects foreseen in the 2016 programme have been carried out, starting with the
continuation of our traditional cooperation with associations for people with disabilities, especially
those that are members of the social and participation council of the institut guttmann. here are
some of the highlights of projects carried out:

• publishing activity, with the publication of three more issues of the magazine “sobre ruedas”, and
 the first edition of the document “social innovation and disability”.
• the “28th technical symposia of the institut guttmann”, which with the support of once and the
  abertis foundation under the title “empowerment, personal autonomy and neuroethics” brought
  together more than 300 professionals and public and private care service managers for people with
  disabilities or dependency.
• accident prevention activities, especially the “game over, don’t risk it all” campaign which, with
  the support of the catalan traffic service, allowed us to conduct 932 talks in 403 schools across
  catalonia to more than 50,000 teenagers and young people, with a message encouraging pru-
  dence mainly when driving vehicles and doing extreme sports. in addition, in the field of road
  safety, we established a collaboration agreement with the racc focusing on researching the
  cognitive functions and learning processes related to safe driving.
• with regard to the promotion of adapted and inclusive sport, we carried out a number of initiatives
  such as the 12th edition of “move and you’ll see”, the “12th edition of the sports games of the
  institut guttmann”, the signing of a collaboration agreement with the fundació tommy robredo
  for the promotion of wheelchair tennis, or the second year of the educational programme “co-
  loured dolphins”.
• finally, we have promoted the “sports & life guttmann club” initiative. this is a new programme
  that offers a space for social, recreational, cultural and sports activities for former patients of our
  hospital who, accompanied by their families and/or friends, want to do participative activities in a
  mainstream environment, with coordination and supervision from our physical education staff.

(viii) once the laborious process of selecting the construction company and signing the contract
was completed, we began work on the “guttmann-la sagrera project”. simultaneously to starting
construction of the new building, we negotiated with different clinical operators to find potential
partners to carry out the care side of the project, whilst starting legal studies to find the best fit of
potential partners and our professionals alike in the activities that are to be carried out. in addition,
the different areas of care and the team of professionals of the guttmann, neuropersonalclínic®
initiative, the activity that is to be transferred to the new centre, were consolidated.

(ix) finally, of note is our participation in tv3’s 25th la marató, which was dedicated to research into
“ictus and spinal cord and acquired brain injuries”, as well as the filming of the filmax production
“100 metres”, directed by marcel barrena and starring dani rovira. the film tells the inspirational story
of a man affected by multiple sclerosis, and involved patients and professionals from the rehabilita-
tion department, in which different sequences of the film were filmed.

so far, a description has been made of the actions summarised in this presentation as being most
representative of all the activities carried out by the institut guttmann throughout 2016. these actions
have allowed us to continue promoting the clinical leadership of our hospital as an international
reference centre for neurorehabilitation, while strengthening the role of our university institute as a
centre for the generation and transfer of knowledge in this scientific field.

this series of actions has also made 2016 a special year. another year in which the institut guttmann
has carried out its work with the strength and passion that characterises us, with the pride of feeling
useful in helping the people who need our services, and with the conviction that we are meeting
our institutional mission and, through this, contributing to the progress of our society and our country.

to everybody who has contributed in one way or another to make this possible: many, many thanks!

12   institut guttmann. 2016 annual report / corporate social responsibility report

the present report

this report reflects the desire of the fundació institut guttmann to continue making progress on
transparency and good governance. for the first time, the social report and corporate social re-
sponsibility annual report are integrated in a single document that systematises all annual activity
developed within the framework of corporate social responsibility, an umbrella under which the
institute works in all its areas.

this document is based on the global reporting initiative model (core version). the working group
that produced the document was made up of people from different areas: care, communication,
human resources, general services, the economics and financial department, quality and manage-
ment of the foundation. the consultancy firm ingecal has supervised the most technical and meth-
odological areas.

the report covers all the activities of the institut guttmann in 2016 without limitation of scope. the
identification of material aspects has always been in accordance with the nature of the activity and
interest groups. the report is based on what was defined in the current “strategic plan of the institut
guttmann 2014–2020”, and has followed social (people and commitment to the community), eco-
nomic and environmental frameworks, complying with the indicators established in the gri model.

     a model of responsible management

     total quality

     the institut guttmann promotes a policy of total quality which, with the involvement of all its employ-
     ees and partners, always orients the organisation towards excellence and meeting its institutional
     goals efficiently and effectively. its quality policy focuses on continuous improvement of the safety
     of its patients, increasing the quality of its care services and favouring its excellence as an organisa-
     tion.


            quality is integral to the institut guttmann, from the scientific and technological
            aspects of its services through the human quality of its professionals and partners,
            and to the quality perceived by its users; this objective encompasses patients and
            their families alike, as well as the whole of the society it serves.




     the organisation’s management model is based on five pillars:

     1. the customer as the centre of organisational management.
     2. involving people.
     3. mainstreaming and process management.
     4. leadership and institutional culture
     5. continuous learning and improvement.

• finally, for the purposes of the csr accreditation, we must indicate that during 2016, the institut
 guttmann has maintained the same dimension, functional organization and ownership in its port-
 folio of services, not having produced any significant change with regard to its structure.

     dialogue and strategic alliances
     external alliances of the fundació institut guttmann include all formal agreements with other institu-
     tions, organisations and/or companies with similar or complementary objectives to its own, to under-
     take and develop their fundamental objectives better. at the last review in 2016, the organisation
     had established a total of 165 agreements distributed among its different areas of action:

     amongst these alliances, we could highlight various cooperation strategies with many associations
     for people with neurological disabilities for whom the institute works. some of them are part of the
     social and participation council of the institut guttmann, and are therefore actively involved in
     defining the institute’s operational objectives and improving internal processes.

              the institut guttmann bases its alliances on the tenets of fairness and transparency that
              pursue the institute’s objectives and seek mutual benefit, refusing any relationship or
              association with other organisations that may cause conflict with its aims, objectives and
              values.




     supplier relationships

     in addition, in all cases suppliers of goods and subcontractors follow the same procedure for selec-
     tion and adjudication within a framework of free competition and excluding any relationship or in-
     terference outside the interests of the organisation. the institut guttmann always demands recipro-
     cal honesty in its commercial relations, full respect for current regulations and, in particular, that
     which refers to the compulsory hiring of people with disabilities; also relevant are those that refer to
     the protection of children, environmental protection and labour protection.

the neurorehabilitation hospital
institut guttmann owes its current fame and prestige above all to the neurorehabilitation hospital,
a hospital specialising in the medical and surgical treatment and comprehensive rehabilitation of
adults, young people and children with spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury or other neurological
disability. its objective is to provide specialised, comprehensive, intensive, continuous and per-
sonalised care, based on scientific evidence and with the highest levels of compassion, sci-
ence and technology.

the neurorehabilitation hospital is part of the catalan health system (siscat), registered under num-
ber h08000723 in the register of health centres, services and establishments, and has an agreement
with catsalut to care for beneficiaries of the public health system. it has also established agreements
with the main occupational accident mutual societies and the largest private medical companies,
and works directly with private patients.

it is accredited as a reference hospital by the department of health of the government of catalo-
nia, and as a “centro de referencia nacional - csur - para el tratamiento del lesionado medular
complejo” (national reference centre - csur - for the treatment of complex spinal cord injury) by
the ministerio de sanidad, servicios sociales e igualdad de españa (spanish ministry of health, social
services and equality).

joint commission international certifies that the institut guttmann meets international stan-
dards of quality in care and organisational management.

its characteristic care model is based on the intervention of an expert multidisciplinary team put
together for each patient, the compassion and technical skills of its professionals, and the scientific
rigour with which it operates; these factors, along with modern facilities and the continuous incorpo-
ration of the latest technology, make the institut guttmann one of the world’s leading hospitals in its
field today.




      over 50 years of experience

      the institut guttmann neurorehabilitation hospital has treated people affected by neu-
      rological disabilities for more than 50 years, promoting and providing specialised and
      innovative services of personal, health and social care mainly aimed at these individuals
      and their families. this provides them with the appropriate support and services needed
      to help enhance their personal autonomy and improve their quality of life, according
      to the principles of recognising functional diversity, independent living and social inclu-
      sion.

      the hospital opened in barcelona in 1965, and was spain’s first centre for spinal cord
      injuries. its name is a tribute to dr sir ludwig guttmann, who changed the prognosis of
      this disease around the world and is now considered the father of modern rehabilitation;
      we also know him as the driving force behind the paralympic games.

training for patients and their families

the support, guidance and information programmes aimed at patients under treatment and their
families are tools applied by the institut guttmann to help minimise the perceived threat of losses
suffered after a neurological inj ury and leverage resources available to address the new situation,
facilitating their process of recovery and adaptation.


training sessions for patients

the institut guttmann offers patients a place to receive basic information on health issues related to
disability and how to approach it emotionally. conducted by a neuropsychologist, they combine
educational and therapeutic aspects along with mutual support for people who have j ust suffered
a severe neurological inj ury.


training sessions for families

relatives of people with neurological disabilities suffer a major impact and must deal with the phys-
ical and neuropsychological changes (emotional, psychological, cognitive and behavioural) arising
from the neurological inj ury. the relationships that had been established between its members are
modified and the expectations and objectives of the family unit are disrupted. the family should
therefore be considered, aided, accompanied and assisted both in the early stages of rehabilitation
and in the later stages.

the family is seen as a key element in the rehabilitation of the person affected by a disability of neu-
rological origin, therefore the institut guttmann offers educational, support, guidance and informa-
tion programmes aimed at patients’ families.

     02 commitment to patients and their families

     measuring outcomes of the rehabilitation process

     we objectively and systematically assess the short, medium and long-term outcomes of the reha-
     bilitation process to determine the benefits of our therapeutic process on the functionality, quality
     of life and participation in the community of the patients we see, and evaluate the effectiveness of
     the working methodology used.

     our own commitment to patients and families allows us to determine the evolution of our outcomes
     and compare them with those of other centres specialising in neurorehabilitation that are leaders
     on an international level, always with the aim of continuing to improve and provide the best special-
     ist medical and rehabilitative care.

     different internationally approved scales are used on each patient, based on the aetiology and
     severity of the injury: on admission, throughout the therapeutic process, on clinical discharge and in
     regular subsequent assessments.

                          data obtained from a laboratory for studies on quality of life and disability.

     patients with spinal cord injury (sci)

     in 2016, 159 adult patients completed their intensive and specialised neurorehabilitation process,
     66% of whom had paraplegia and 34% of whom had tetraplegia; in 68.5% of cases the injury was
     incomplete. their mean age was 50.

     • at the end of the care process, 91% of patients returned to their usual residence, whilst 9% required
       an institutional alternative on a temporary or permanent basis. over the past 10 years, this percen-
       tage has remained steady with minimal variations (mean 89.8%).

independence measure (scim iii), the functional assessment scale used by the european multi-
center study about spinal cord injury (emsci), an association featuring the best european rehabilita-
tion hospitals, including ours. as the figure below shows, patients at the institut guttmann achieve
outcomes equivalent to those of the other hospitals studied.

     of the 85 patients having sustained a tbi who received treatment and specialised and intensive
     rehabilitation, 82% were seriously impaired on admission according to the glasgow coma scale.
     their mean age was 40.

     one of the assessment scales administered to allow us to compare ourselves with the u.s. traumatic
     brain injury model systems (tbims) was the disability rating scale (drs), with which we found that we
     had comparable evolutions. our patients went from serious disability on admission to moderately
     serious disability on discharge, with a mean improvement of 4.4 points.

maximise their functional autonomy and go about their lives with dignity, independence, quality of
life and active social participation, despite their limitations and functional differences. for this to be
possible, it must be ensured that everyone receives excellent, high-quality rehabilitation, although it
is essential to have an inclusive society with inclusive laws that respect differences and actively help
create genuinely equal opportunities.

that is what we strive to measure through the regular assessments that we perform on all our patients
(sci and abd) two and five years after they complete their rehabilitation process at our hospital.
these regular assessments not only rule out any disease resulting from their injury that might go un-
detected, they also assess the patient’s autonomy, quality of life and degree of social participation,
among other aspects.

the community integration questionnaire (ciq), which helps measure the level of community in-
tegration after an injury, was administered in this context. it consists of 15 points related to compe-
tence at home, social integration and productive activities. a compilation of our patients’ outcomes
on some of its items appears below.

     the opinions of our patients

     the client care unit makes improvements intended to benefit our patients, always considering these
     individuals’ perceptions of our centre and their degree of satisfaction with the care received. we
     used opinion surveys to collect assessments of quality perceived by hospitalised patients, and found
     that the quality of our care was given an overall score of 9.05 out of 10. the following are of note
     after analysing the surveys:

      99%    sympathetic treatment received from staff
     100%    confidentiality of personal data
     100%    feeling of being in good hands
     100%    would return to this hospital
     100%    cleanliness of the facilities

     in total, 15 complaints were received in 2016. concerning the reasons for them, 6 were related to
     care and 9 were related to organisational management. in all cases, a written response was pro-
     vided within an average of 4 days.

social and health care
the domestic and social reintegration of people affected by a spinal cord inj ury, traumatic brain
inj ury or any other disability that is neurological in origin is often difficult as a result of the high degree
of complexity that their care represents for the patients themselves, their family, carers and health
and social care professionals who are not used to dealing with the particular needs of these patients.

thanks to the neurorehabilitation support and specialised consulting team (specialised ease)
we can act in all levels of care within the national health and social care networks for the more ef-
fective reintegration of the patients in their own social and domestic context, ensure that they are
receiving the correct continuing care, favour the highest quality comprehensive and personalised
care, and provide flexible and effective coordination with the specialist reference hospital, transmit-
ting specific knowledge and skills in the neurorehabilitation process.

in 20 16, the team’s activity increased, redefining programmes already in place and working to de-
sign new ones to cover more people with disabilities and their families.

the home care service is a programme that includes a number of services that meet the social
and health care needs of people with disabilities or other forms of dependency and their families, in
order to promote personal independence and help increase their quality of life within their own
social and domestic context.

in 20 16, we saw 69 patients, to whom we dedicated a total of 621 hours of home care.

     guttmann, neuropersonalclinic®
     “gutmann, neuropersonalclínic® ” (gnpc) is an initiative that responds to current challenges in neu-
     rorehabilitation and cognitive neuroscience with the aim of promoting clinical innovation and bring-
     ing it to patients through our therapeutic solutions that have a proven scientific basis.

     it is designed to provide comprehensive diagnosis and coordinated treatment of the main causes
     of disability and is organised around functional clinical neuroscience programmes and personalised
     services.

     gnpc is aimed at people who want to pursue an intensive and personalised treatment programme
     to optimise their functional capacity or address specific problems resulting from their neurological
     impairment.


            in 2016, guttmann, neuropersonalclinic® saw a total of 210 patients with a total
            of 16,443 hours.

                  272     maintenance programmes
                   52     specific treatment programmes

                   15     music therapy treatments

            • the total number of patients and prog rammes does not coincide, as a single patient
              may have taken part in more than one programme.


     gnpc is also a charitable initiative that fulfils a social commitment of the institute by creating “treat-
     ment grants” for patients who do not have sufficient financial resources or do not have health insur-
     ance to meet all their health care costs. the grants are awarded for procedures and techniques that
     represent the only possible therapeutic alternative, either due to patient characteristics or because
     other alternatives have been unsuccessful.

volve around academic, scientific and research issues in neuroscience in general and in neuroreha-
bilitation and technology applied to personal autonomy in particular.

the foundation’s academic orientation is aimed at the transfer of knowledge and quality multidisci-
plinary training in the field of neurorehabilitation for students and clinicians who want to deepen their
knowledge and skills in this discipline.


      quality is one of the institute’s firm commitments in all its training programmes. the inter-
      nal academic quality system is therefore accredited by the agència de qualitat uni-
      versitària aqu (aqu university quality assurance agency) of the government of cata-
      lonia, and is structured around a series of processes starting from the audit guidelines
      of the agència nacional d’avaluació de la qualitat i acreditació (national agency for
      quality assessment and accreditation), and the recommendations of the european
      association for quality assurance (enqa).


research and innovation activities promote the generation of new knowledge and continuous in-
novation in techniques, procedures and technologies in neurorehabilitation and neuroscience in
general, by driving a cooperation network that is open to the participation of other spanish and
international centres of excellence, universities, research institutes, companies and organisations
who want to combine their efforts to improve prevention and results in the treatment of diseases that
affect the central nervous system.

     04 commitment to the community




     new guttmann centre – la sagrera
     the most significant event in 2016 was the start of work on the new guttmann centre– la sagrera in
     march. the proj ect is certified according to the breeam® (building research establishment environ-
     mental assessment methodology) standard of sustainable construction with a rating of “very good”.
     breeam® is the world’s most technically advanced method of assessing and certifying the sustainabil-
     ity of the building. this system gives a more sustainable construction that translates into a higher per-
     formance for those who build, operate and/or maintain the building; the reduction of its impact on
     the environment; and greater comfort and health for those who live in, work in and use the building.

     the new guttmann centre will be the setting for all care activities that currently take place in gutt-
     mann, neuropersonalclínic® .




     responsible communication
     the institut guttmann translates its responsibility and willingness for transparency to all the communi-
     cation processes that govern its activity in relation to messages, channels and supports directed at
     the public with whom it relates, both in the institute and outside.

     in 20 16, the institut guttmann published its corporate social responsibility report for the first time and
     launched the transparency and good governance portal of the institut guttmann on the web portal.


            the 1st corporate social responsibility report of the institut guttmann has been
            recognised by the fundación a vedis donabedian with its award for the best infor-
            mation on social responsibility activities in health institutions.


     this year, and in line with our desire and commitment to always go one step further, we are publish-
     ing the report you are now reading, which includes both the organisation’s corporate social respon-
     sibility report and its social report. therefore, in a single document, the institution accounts for all its
     care, scientific, educational, social and environmental activities, as well as activity related to trans-
     parency and good governance.

     the report includes details on activities related to the commitments made due to our membership
     of the economy for the common good and the global compact. this is an essential requirement to
     achieve sr- 10 accreditation, which the organisation is working on throughout 20 17.

income from the institut guttmann care services is 21.5 million euros, of which 15.5 million, 68%, cor-
responds to the catsalut contract and up to 7 million euros, 32% off other financiers (traffic insurance
companies, mutual insurance companies, insurers, private individuals, both national and interna-
tional, other public entities ...). the rest of the income corresponds to income, scientific activity, social
activities, fundraising and economic activities. the economic activities include 136 thousand euros
corresponding to leases of spaces in the hospital center of badalona for 122 thousand euros and of
the spaces annexed to the lands of barcelona for 14 thousand euros.

the economic sustainability of the institut guttmann, with the quantity and quality of the specialised
clinical services it offers, has always needed private activity, in addition to the public, roughly equiv-
alent to a quarter of its total capacity for care which over more than fifty years has allowed it to
survive as an institution, build the new hospital, push forward innovation in this specialised area of
medicine, be an international leader in its field, and provide the best and most efficient clinical ser-
vices for the catalan public health system. we understand our practice to be exemplary, in which
both sides gain and this explains the benefits of a public-private or public-social partnership.

07                  the environment

one of the main commitments of the institut guttmann, as reflected in its mission, vision and values,
is to be an organisation of excellence that is sustainable and respects the environment. to this end,
it has an exacting environment policy that includes the strategies and values that should govern the
institute with regard to the environment, based on the 2014-2020 strategic plan and of which its high-
est exponents are the iso 14001 international certification and emas european certification. the
environmental plan and the programme of annual environmental objectives derive from the envi-
ronmental policy.

the successive operational objectives included in the institute’s annual general programme, which
is approved annually by the directors, with its main guidelines also being subject to the consideration
of the board of trustees, derive from the environmental plan.

the institut guttmann has a manual of good environmental practices with the best environmental
practices that can be performed in each process or area of the institution.


with regard to the objectives of environment
protection and energy saving

• we have replaced the 36 outdoor points of the garden lightning with leds, representing a saving in
 electricity consumption and longer life for consumables.
• we have continued to seek and study locations which, due to their use, allow the installation of
 automatically lighting systems (twilight movement sensors, timers, etc.) to save on electricity con-
 sumption, and movement detectors in one part of the dirty corridor, and adjusting the number of
 lit fluorescents in the rest.
• the team of professionals of infrastructure, services and environment carried out breeam new cons-
 truction training in order to monitor the implementation of breeam certification at the new centre
 of guttmann - meridiana.
• a study has been made to replace the lighting system with leds, and gradual replacement in the
 whole centre is planned. the whole of hospitalization units 1 and 2, main lobby and main entrance
 canopy, and central corridor of level 0, including elevator lobbies.
• we have carried out the energy audit according to rd 56/2016.

• work continued in the following areas: awareness campaigns to promote water saving, reduction
 of energy consumption, waste reduction, both for consumption and for volume, with leaflets being
 provided on best practices for different users; in addition, different reminders were made to raise
 awareness of the environment according to established universal dates.

     materials and consumption
     the consumption of products and materials in the institut guttmann is based on the basic raw ma-
     terials used in a hospital. here are the amounts consumed of the main materials in 2016:


       • medicinal gases. oxygen: 8,401.77 m3.                 • syringes: 0.291 tn.
       • medicinal air: 14,937.90 m .
                                   3
                                                               • sodium hypochlorite drinking water: 0.320 tn.
       • office paper: 3.907 tn.                               • sodium hypochlorite soap: 1.0940 tn.
       • paper hand towels: 5.3992 tn.                         • water softener salt: 1.325 tn.
       • toilet paper: 2.683 tn.                               • dishwasher detergent: 1.071 tn.
       • nappies: 6.026 tn.                                    • degreaser: 0.53 tn



     the historic evolution of this consumption is given in the environmental declaration 2016 as are the
     weighted values with regard to the number of people working there.

     with regard to energy consumption, the institut guttmann encourages the responsible use of the
     three energy sources that supply the hospital which are all provided by external companies.

                    electricity                                     2.725,33 mwh = 9.811.188 mj

                    natural gas                                     2.269,06 mwh = 8.168.616 mj

                    diesel                                            9,8971 mwh = 35.629,56 mj

                    total                                           5.004,29 mwh = 18.015.444 mj


     energy intensity is one of the indicators of an organisation’s energy efficiency. the institut guttmann
     calculates it as the relationship between energy consumption and annual turnover:

                    • ei: 5,004.29 mwh / 21,491,431.90 €: 0.000233 mwh/€.
                    • we need 0.233 mwh to bill 1,000.00 €.


     in 2016, the institut guttmann carried out its energy audit according to spanish royal decree 56/2016,
     obtaining useful information on the building’s energy performance and offering targets for possible
     improvements in energy efficiency through the recommendations presented in the report, accord-
     ing to our environmental certifications, iso 14001 and emas.

     the comparison of energy consumption was:


                    • 2015: 5,352.24 mwh // 15.88 mwh per person employed.
                    • 2016: 5,004.29 mwh // 14.33 mwh per person employed.



     the main reason behind this reduction was that the lighting system was changed to led in several
     areas of the centre.

     emissions and waste

     emissions into the atmosphere from institut guttmann come from:

     • electricity consumption.
     • fuel consumption: natural gas and diesel.
     • fuel consumption from personal means of transport.
     • waste generated.
     • water consumption in the building and garden areas


     total emissions: 1,371.42 tn co2 eq.

     co2 emissions are calculated using the calculation tool from the oficina catalana del canvi
     climàtic (catalan office for climate change).

     the intensity of emissions is an indicator used to analyse the evolution of the efficiency of measures
     adopted to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and is calculated using the ratio between emis-
     sions generated and annual turnover:

                    • ei geh: 1,371.42 tn co2 eq. / 21,491,431.90 €: 0.0000638 tn co2 eq/€.
                    • our emissions were 0.0638 tn co2 eq per 1,000.00€ of turnover.



     waste. a comprehensive control of the waste generated by the hospital was performed and there
     was no significant accidental spillage during 2016.

     the wastewater discharge is all the sewage produced by the organisation that goes into the sew-
     age network of the city of badalona.

     institut guttmann does not recycle or reuse water consumed.

     selection criteria

     the services in charge are responsible for choosing between the options offered by the market for
     goods and services according to the institut guttmann’s code of ethics, using mainly financial and
     quality criteria.

     the possibility of taking environmental purchasing criteria into account can reduce costs, improve the
     image that the institution offers patients, suppliers and professionals, and contribute to protecting
     the environment.

     sustainable purchasing criteria are:
     • selecting suppliers that have environmental certification (iso 14.00 1, emas, etc.).
     • choosing eco-certified products:
       – european union ecolabel.
       – aenor brand - environment.
       – german “blue angel”.
       – norwegian “nordic swan”.
       – dgda - distintiu de garantia de qualitat ambiental (emblem of environmental quality guaran-
         tee) from the government of catalonia.
       – eu label - european union, environmentally-friendly products.
       – anab-ibo-ibn, italian brand of bio-ecological products.
     • favouring the purchase of biodegradable or environmentally-friendly cleaning products.
     • choosing products with little packaging or that are recyclable to reduce waste.
     • opting for items packaged in glass or cardboard that are easily recycled, such as paper and other
       office supplies.
     • comply ing with our iso 14.00 1 environmental certification and emas certification


     in addition, suppliers of the institut guttmann are subjected to an initial evaluation, before their ap-
     proval, and to a subsequent periodic evaluation, based on, among other criteria, environmental
     aspects.
