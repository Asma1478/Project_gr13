we have had a challenging year in 2014 marked by slow investment growth, somewhat unstable
capital market, intensified competition, increasing pressure from customers for rate reduction and
political uncertainty. however, improving fundamentals, especially giving more focus on our
strategy throughout the year, we could maintain the growth momentum. ucl has managed well

as the assets side of our balance sheet, has helped deliver another year of consistent performance.

to improve operating efficiency and manage costs through capacity building and process
improvements. moreover, we did well by fostering an ownership culture, placing our clients at the
center of everything we do.

and the environment. we also believe that actions speak louder than words, by
establishing green initiatives within our organization we hope to do our part to create an
even brighter future for our organization and the communities we serve. when we think
about green, we think about three r’s: reduce, reuse and recycle. this is the first step
of living green.

market value added            external performance indicator of value creation




 while economic value added (eva) measures internal performance, market value added (mva) is a
 measure of external performance that indicates how the market has evaluated the company's performance
 in terms of market value of share compared to book value of shares. mva is the difference between the
 market value of equity of a company and the book value of equity invested in the company. market value
 added is one of the market indicators of value creation. mva, and particularly any change in mva,
 constitutes a more relevant measure of value than just developments in share price. the following
 statement indicates the mva as at 31 december 2014 compared to the mva of prior year:

                                          generation potential of the company. eva is an internal management performance measure that
                                          compares net operating profit to total cost of capital. economic value added is also referred to
                                          as economic profit. the eva is defined as:

                                          eva = net operating profit after tax minus cost of capital

                                          economic value added is important because it is used as an indicator of how profitable company
                                          projects are and it therefore serves as a reflection of management performance.

                                          the idea behind eva is that businesses are only truly profitable when they create wealth for
                                          their shareholders, and the measure of this goes beyond calculating net income. economic

                                          value added asserts that businesses should create returns at a rate above their cost of capital.

                                          it succinctly summerises how much and from where a company created wealth. it includes the
                                          balance sheet in the calculation and encourages managers to think about assets as well as
                                          expenses in their decisions.

                                          it forces that economy to shift away from managing its profits to managing its wealth by
                                          permitting the company to monitor and measure wealth generation. the following table indicates

                   independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of
                                union capital limited

we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of union capital limited and its
subsidiaries (the “group”) as well as the separate financial statements of union capital limited (“the
company”) which comprise the consolidated and the separate balance sheet as at 31 december 2014, and
the profit and loss account, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended
and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

management’s responsibility for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with bangladesh financial reporting standards (bfrs) as explained in note 2, the financial
institutions act 1993, the rules and regulations issued by the bangladesh bank, the companies act 1994,
the securities and exchange rules 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations, and for such internal
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

auditors’ responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the group and the
separate financial statements of the company based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance
with bangladesh standards on auditing. those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements of the group and the separate financial statements of the company are free from
material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements of the group and the separate financial statements of the company. the
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments,
we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

basis for qualified opinion
while consolidating the financial statements of the group, it has been observed that the auditors of unicap
investments limited, one of the subsidiaries of the group, have qualified their opinion referring to note 27
of its financial statements. it appears from that note, the subsidiary has created provision of tk.165,000,000
equivalent to @ 23% against margin loan, on the basis of net negative equity of tk. 717,551,651 instead of
gross negative equity. had the subsidiary provided provision on gross negative equity, there would have
been a requirement of further provision of tk. 256,197,413. furthermore, the same subsidiary has also

                       independent auditor’s report to the shareholders of
                                  unicap securities limited

we have audited the accompanying financial statements of unicap securities limited (the “company”)
which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 december 2014, and the related statement
of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

management’s responsibility for the financial statements
management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with bangladesh financial reporting standards (bfrs), the companies act 1994, the
securities and exchange rules 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations and for such internal
control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

auditors’ responsibility
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. we
conducted our audit in accordance with bangladesh standards on auditing (bsa). those standards
require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

opinion
in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the
company as at 31 december 2014 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with the bangladesh financial reporting standards (“bfrs”) and comply with the
companies act 1994, the securities and exchange rules 1987 and other applicable laws and
regulations.

report on other legal and regulatory requirements
we also report that:
(i) we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and
    belief were necessary for the purpose of our audit and made due verification thereof;
(ii) in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the company so far
     as it appeared from our examination of those books;
(iii) the company’s balance sheet and profit and loss account dealt with by the report are in
      agreement with the books of account; and
(iv) the expenditure incurred were for the purpose of the company’s business.
