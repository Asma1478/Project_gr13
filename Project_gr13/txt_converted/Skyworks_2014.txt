of things ecosystems accelerated, creating further opportunity for
skyworks. driven by our ability to innovate and deliver high-performance
analog and rf solutions to our customers, unit sales and revenue reached
all-time highs.
in reaching these new heights, skyworks never wavered in our commitment
to sustainability, ensuring our focus on meeting the needs of today without
compromising the future. our team achieved new records in environmental
resource conservation and waste minimization, while adding three new
factories, each taking on the same sustainability systems and practices
that have proven successful in our existing world-class facilities.
we further expanded our scope across our vendor base by enhancing
supplier sustainability requirements and worker protections,
simultaneously strengthening our oversight and visibility. we continued
our diligent focus on creating safe and healthy work environments free
from harassment and discrimination. in addition, our employees engaged
in numerous outreach efforts to help care for the worldwide communities
we call home.

accomplishments and some of the challenges that remain in our journey
toward continuous improvement.
we are connecting everyone and everything, all the time – sustainably!

of labor, environment, health and safety, ethics, and management systems. a cross-functional management

throughout the organization. performance is evaluated and reported regularly and actions are taken wherever
objectives are not being met. throughout this report you will find details of these improvements. below are a
few of the highlights.

skyworks' global supply chain affords us the opportunity to positively influence business
practices on a large scale, outside of our own facilities. supplier requirements are outlined
within our supplier sustainability specification, which aligns with the electronic industry
citizenship coalition® (eicc) code of conduct. our suppliers are required to incorporate these
provisions as their own, while further establishing the code as a minimum requirement across
their own supply chain. this includes the call for supply chain labor programs prohibiting child

5        supplier facilities that are ranked as high risk, in addition to any others specifically
         requested by skyworks, must complete an on-site industry standard eicc® validated
         audit process (vap). vap is a third-party risk-based audit process where suppliers are
         objectively evaluated and their sustainability performance is scored.


6        suppliers initiate corrective action plans (caps) for any issues identified in the vap.
         skyworks collaborates with its suppliers in tracking the caps to closure and further
         provides assistance for capability building at our supplier locations as needed.
