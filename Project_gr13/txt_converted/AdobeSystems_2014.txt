adobe corporate responsibility
year in review 2013

whether it’s a student raising awareness
through the power of video, or a facilities
engineer transforming a building into its
own power plant, the adobe corporate
responsibility program touches people from
different countries, cultures, and age groups.
what unites them is their desire to create
positive change through creativity. here’s a
glance at the strides made during 2013 in
adobe’s three corporate responsibility pillars:
community, education, and sustainability.

                                                 a home, and more.
                                                 every year we set aside 1%
                                                 of our pre-tax profits to
                                                 invest in communities.
                                                 we encourage our employees
                                                 to donate their time and
                                                 talent to non-profits.
                                                 we also donate our products
                                                 to non-profits and schools,
                                                 arming them with the same
                                                 best-in-class tools used by the
                                                 world’s creative industries.

adobe corporate responsibility 2013: education

                                                 inspiring dreams,
                                                 opening futures.
                                                 as digital experiences become
                                                 more prevalent in our world,
                                                 understanding them is
                                                 necessary for a bright future.
                                                 this is the mission of adobe
                                                 youth voices, our educational
                                                 initiative that works to inspire
                                                 youth, teaching them the
                                                 art of design, filmmaking,
                                                 photography, and more, not
                                                 only in the service of expressing
                                                 themselves, but as a means to
                                                 launching fulfilling careers.
