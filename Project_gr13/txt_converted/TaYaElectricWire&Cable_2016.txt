chairman’s statement
  60 is more than just a number:
   october 2015 marked the 60th anniversary of ta ya. on the anniversary day, we arranged to have 60 ta ya couples walk down a red carpet
to embrace blessings from long-time customers, friends and the neighborhood. it was an especially touching and proud day for me.
   in the last 60 years, we started as an ordinary wire manufacturer and gradually expanded our expertise towards magnet wires, high-
voltage power cables, solar power plants, and even venture capital; location-wise, we have expanded our presence into hong kong, china
and vietnam. as a cable manufacturer, we have claimed many“no. 1”titles in the local industry, including the first to be certified by taiwan
power company for the supply of 69kv, 161kv and 345kv high-voltage cables, the first to voluntarily adopt lead-free production for all cable
products, the first to obtain carbon footprint label, the first to publish a csr report, the first foreign company to list for trading in vietnam, and
the first cable manufacturer to establish a foundation that is dedicated to building pristine homeland. during the corporate governance evalua-
tion organized by financial supervisory commission in 2015, ta ya was ranked among the top 20% of all twse-listed companies.
   i remember having been told by our seniors that“corporations exist for society,”which is part of the reason that we have dedicated
ourselves to fulfilling our mission of“enlightened employees, satisfied customers, positive shareholders, and pristine homeland.”a few
years ago, a trend towards corporate social responsibility started taking shape, which eventually prompted us to think one step ahead about
environmental and climate issues, and redefine the industry we are in and the corporate role we play. we realized that ta ya, being a member
of the energy business, is about to be liberated from a highly regulated industry; and while we have long played our role as a connector of
energy, we have the potential to become the supplier, keeper, administrator and service provider of energy.
  energy is more than just connecting two ends;
   this level of thinking brought feasible and progressive change to ta ya’s business. we first began by focusing on our core business, and
developed a new product called green wire that won ourselves the“green classics award.”with respect to product line, ta ya continues to
develop specialized cables for solar power, offshore wind power and tidal power applications, and has readied itself to assist in the construc-
tion of renewable energy facilities in the future. furthermore, we have invested into the upstream of the energy industry, installing solar power
equipment at rented factories, institutions and campus rooftops. we expect to achieve 50mw of total capacity in the next 5 years.
  green means more than just opportunities;
   in addition to protecting the environment, ta ya pays great attention to maintaining a green lifestyle that is friendly to the environment.
we have made social investments and organized corporate volunteers to introduce the green initiative into food, clothing, accommodation,
transportation, education, entertainment and virtually all aspects of our daily lives. we have envisioned a future where mankind can coexist in
harmony with the environment.
   we have escalated the management and disclosure of our csr efforts through the assembly of group csr committee. we have set our goal
to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 1% per year, begun supplier csr assessment at affiliated enterprises, adopted electronic industry
code of conduct (eicc), and expanded the boundaries of our csr report to cover overseas factories starting from this year.
   these attempts and efforts are similar to the new corporate identity we have made for the 60th anniversary. based on existing impression of
the dragon brand, we drew the logo taya in a single stroke in the color of copper, while turning and twisting along the stroke to resemble the
impression of a rising dragon. the conventional red color inherits ta ya’s transcendent spirit, and a metallic, copper-ish color was added to
stress ta ya’s specialty in cable manufacturing, while at the same time present a more modern and professional corporate spirit.
   ta ya has redefined its corporate vision to become“a leading brand for new energy, a creator of harmonious environment and pristine
homeland, and a business trusted by employees, customers, shareholders and society.”the change was made not only to capitalize on
opportunities of climate change, but also to symbolize how the company has evolved to date. we hope to write ta ya’s future as an unfold-
ing story of creative thinking, team work, and a better home, for which we welcome stakeholders’and the public’s continual support and
guidance towards our goal.

holders. we are committed to exercising good
corporate governance and providing transparent
financial information to protect the interests of
our investors. our business focus is dedicated

   in addition to stabilizing our existing markets and
expanding global sales to promote overall business
performance, we place great emphasis on internal manage-
ment. regulating business operations, managing processes
via written documents, as well as prompt evaluations and
optimizations are crucial to the long-term value of the corpora-

position our activities in new markets, help to differentiate our
products, contribute to short- and long-term business strategic
planning, and enhance the group’s overall operational efficiency.

   corporate governance rating
      in december 2013, the financial supervisory com-
   mission published a 5-year“corporate governance
   enhancement roadmap”and introduced a corporate
   governance evaluation system. the evaluation
   system is a comparison of corporate governance
   practices across the entire market and is aimed to help
   investors and businesses understand how effective a
   company’s governance practices are. it is intended
   to inspire progressive competition and motivate com-
   panies to take the initiative in enhancing and improving
   their corporate governance culture.
      the“first corporate governance evaluation”
   took place in 2015, during which companies were
   assessed using a total of 92 indicators covering five
   main aspects: protection of shareholders’interests,
   fair treatment for shareholders, board structure and
   functionality, information transparency, protection
   of stakeholders’interests, and corporate social
   responsibilities. the evaluation process first requires
   the company to complete a self assessment; the cor-
   porate governance center then assigns its review team
   to assess performance category-by-category before
   submitting its result for discussion by the evaluation
   committee. the evaluation placed ta ya in the top 20%
   of all twse-listed companies; in addition, the company
   was rated“a”during the 12th information disclosure
   evaluation for twse/tpex listed companies.
      in 2015, ta ya’s board of directors amended
   the company’s“corporate governance code of
   practice”and“code of ethics,”and established
  “corporate social responsibility code of practice”and
  “board of directors performance assessment policy”
   as a means of enhancing corporate governance prac-
   tice and protecting stakeholders’interest. in the future,
   ta ya will adhere to its integrity principles and commit
   to sound corporate governance for the protection of
   shareholders’interests. it will also strive to maintain
   top 5% ranking in the corporate governance evaluation.

                                                                            17




enlightened employees
   employees are the most valued assets of ta
ya group. the group understands that happy
and healthy employees are the driving force for
improvements that maintain the company’s com-
petitive strength. only happy and healthy employ-
ees would have the endless energy for innovations.
we value the relationship between our employees as
more than mere contractual relationships. we see them
as family members, so we take the initiative to care for
their work environment. harmonious labor relations are the
cornerstone of our continued growth.

    the group proactively promotes every kind of welfare
measure for its employees. the established trade union and
laborers’conference effectively serves as the channel of com-
munications between the two sides. we periodically hold educa-
tional trainings and professional skill evaluations for the staff and
encourage our employees to serve as corporate volunteers for the
company, promoting inner and outer growth. our goal for employees
is to assist them in obtaining a good balance between work and family
life. by providing a conducive environment for such a lifestyle, we bring
forth continuous quality work performance.

   succession planning
      in view of the group’s 60-year history, ta ya has
   initiated succession planning since 2014 to nurture
   capable successors for the sustainability of the business.
   the group’s succession planning comprises of two main
   systems,“job rotation”and“learning passport”:

     shift-rotation system
     i n line with the company’s long-term plans and
      reserve personnel requirements, rotation allows for the
      understanding of work details of each department to be
      managed in the future. the company’s competitive
      strength and cultivation of future talent is achieved
      through systemizing projects, allowing manpower
      allocation to be more systematic so as to provide a
      comprehensive horizontal experience and to develop
      vertically to improve organizational efficiency.
     learning passport
     t
      he learning passport is a plan derived through analyz-
     ing the requirements of a job, and establishing the
     learning modules and basics required for evaluations.
      he content of the plan is discussed with the current job
     t
     holder and the potential successor and uses the job-
     related abilities of the employee as the basis to find the
     direction of learning. results of the plan’s execution
     factor in the performance evaluations for discussion and
     feedback to ensure effective control.

      in 2015, ta ya continued its succession planning and
   arranged a series of advance management courses to
   expand the knowledge and thinking process of its candi-
   dates. through a combination of classroom teachings and
   mentorship, succession candidates were able to apply
   their learning in practice and keep up with the program as
   planned. affiliated enterprises, on the other hand, adopted
   the learning passport system and utilized training courses
   to develop the capacity needed to deliver the group’s
   missions, visions and business philosophy.

                                                                         31




satisfied customers
   the group believes that superior product
service is the basis for supporting satisfied
customers. quality products use quality raw
materials as a starting point. we carefully select
the upstream factories for our materials and ad-
equately implement local procurement. we choose
to reduce the environmental impact of our products
and minimize the consumption of natural resources
in the course of our manufacturing procedures. to
protect public health and safety, we adopt environmental
protection laws as the basis for assessing the possible
environmental impact of our manufacturing process prior to
implementation.
  the group dedicates in product innovation and quality
improvement. in response to climate change, the group promotes
energy-saving and carbon-reduction practices. the group pro-
motes customer satisfactory surveys to discover topics of attentions
and expectations in order to incorporate them as part of our corporate
growth.

als are required to be reviewed regularly.

   there are 14 criteria in the csr review, each accounting for five
points. suppliers with an average of less than four points are consid-
ered unqualified. the criteria include: human rights, workplace safety,
anti-corruption, anti-bribery, regular work hours, minimum wage compli-
ance, active environmental responsibilities, environmental protection,
and prevention of occupational hazards.

   for suppliers with an average score of less than 4, the procurement
staff is required to investigate individual areas where suppliers failed to
score 4 or higher. furthermore, suppliers are given relevant information
and proper guidance to improve. these suppliers have demonstrated
improvement after our guidance efforts. although contractors are
not subject to regular assessment at this point, ta ya would invite
contractors to participate in general safety trainings from time to time
as a means of promoting proper safety and health awareness. ta ya
encourages all its business partners to voluntarily contribute to the
sustainability of our society and environment during their pursuit for
economic gains.

   ta ya assessed 31 suppliers in 2015, of which 26 were hsf
suppliers. no supplier had averaged a score of less than 4 in terms of
corporate social responsibilities. the company expects to assess 33
suppliers in 2016, including 25 hsf suppliers. since 2015, the procure-
ment staff have been offering csr guidance to suppliers that failed to
achieve a score of 4, and providing them with a copy of ta ya’s csr
report as reference. no supplier had scored less than 4 during the 2015
assessment.

  as for other affiliated enterprises, cuprime will also begin supplier
csr management starting in 2016.

function-wise, the cable does more than just transmit electricity, but can
also be used for wind turbine control, data transmission, and real-time
capacity monitoring. with regards to submarine power grid, the company
had completed three break-through projects in 2014, namely:“three-
phase double armor submarine cable design and offshore submarine
power grid planning,”     “submarine cable connection technology and
installation,”and“submarine cable connector development.”ta ya has
taken this initiative further to develop a malfunction detection and real-
time monitoring system for offshore power grids.
   in 2014, ta ya assigned employees to study“submarine cable design
and dynamic simulation analysis”at itri (industrial technology research
institute), which involved the use of advanced software to simulate
and analyze dynamic movements of submarine cables. the company
continued working with itri in 2015 to design, manufacture, test and
validate dynamic (umbilical) submarine cables for tidal power generation.
the dynamic (umbilical) submarine cable is expected to be connected to
itri’s keelung tidal power generator in 2016, in order to verify whether
the dynamic submarine cable is able to handle power transmission in
rough seas.
   in addition to developing submarine cables for various uses, ta ya
also joins ta ho in the planning and construction of offshore power grids
and the deployment of submarine cables. in view of increasing demand
for marine engineering in the future, ta heng has actively invested into
the research of boat cables and assists customers in obtaining the
necessary certification.

   helping hands to green
   products
      electricity powers all industries. now, with the rapid
   increase of environmental issues, green energy has
   attracted plenty of development interest in every country.
   ta ya is playing its part by providing high-quality basic
   materials and products for the green energy industry.
   our tin-coated pv ribbons and bare pv ribbons are the
   best quality in the industry when measured for tensile
   strength, yield strength, and elongation. meanwhile, our
   solar cell dc cable is near mass production. for electric
   vehicle motors and inverter motors, ta ya offers anti-surge
   enameled copper wire products and was the first wire and
   cable manufacturer in taiwan to acquire the iso/ts 16949
   certification.
      when it comes to energy conservation, the company
   developed, ahead of its rivals, the 345kv xlpe power ca-
   bles and 400kv stranded conductor power cables, which
   assist in reducing the consumption of electricity during
   transmissions. and in response to the increasing demands
   for internet speed and bandwidth, ta ya successfully de-
   veloped a complete series of fiber optic cables, reducing
   the energy required in data transmissions. looking ahead,
   the company will expand its efforts into clean renewable
   energy in response to the“solar panels on all rooftops,
   wind turbines on seas and lands”policy objectives of
   the government, and continue doing its part for our pristine
   homeland.

pristine homeland
   as a company, we believe that the environ-
ment is the basis for business operation.
through our commitment to csr and taking en-
vironmental, social, and economical aspects into
consideration, we adopt the best environmental
management guidelines, minimize the environmental
impact of production, engage in carbon management,
and contribute to the mitigation of global warming.

  with the greeninside blog and the green inside
project, ta ya hopes to inspire green thinking in our staff
and the public. toward that end, we founded the pristine
homeland foundation to address issues in local communities
and the environment and demonstrate our long-term social

    social investment
      with respect to the increasingly popular issue of social
    enterprise, the group holds the opinion that all social invest-
    ments should be encouraged, whether in the narrow sense or
    in the broad sense.

      social enterprises, in the narrow sense, exist not only
    to solve problems in society, but also reserves 30% of its
    earnings for charity purpose. for a professional investor, it is
    difficult enough to find an opportunity that delivers adequate
    roi (return on investment), let alone a social enterprise. ta
    ya’s green inside project takes a different approach, as it
    neither requires nor encourages the sponsored subjects to
    operate in corporate form, and expects no return from the
    issues it cares for. in other words, social investment in the
    broad sense is equivalent to a social sponsorship, and aims
    to achieve another form of roi, namely: return on impact.
