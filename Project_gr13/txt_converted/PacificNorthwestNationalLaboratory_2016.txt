message from the director
for more than 50 years, the department of energy’s (doe)
pacific northwest national laboratory (pnnl) has advanced the
frontiers of science and technology through courageous discov-
ery and innovation. our fundamental scientific endeavors
enhance our understanding of the world around us—and our
applied research and development activities help to create a
safer, more secure, and sustainable future.
with respect to sustainability, pnnl is committed to continu-
ously improving our triple-bottom-line of environmental, social,      highlights
and economic responsibility. across all levels of our organization,
we strive to be good stewards of our resources and to share our       environmental

introduction
this executive summary of pnnl’s fy2015 sustainability report provides performance highlights
across the environmental, social, and economic dimensions of our operations. the full report is
available online at the website http://sustainable.pnnl.gov. the web site also features our annual
site sustainability plan, detailed priorities and performance goals, news about pnnl’s sustainability
practices, and resources for reducing environmental impacts at work.
pnnl recognizes the value of using an external standard for sustainability reporting to enable a bal-
anced, transparent, and comparable representation of our organizational performance toward the goal
of sustainable development. our performance assessment and reporting approach aligns with the
global reporting initiative (gri) guidelines, which enable organizations of all types to disclose results
in a similar way. the gri provides an integrated view of the environmental, social, and economic
impacts that are important to our stakeholders and pnnl’s long-term success.

     much like a honeycomb with its
     interlocking pieces that gain strength
     through mutual support and integra-
     tion—our three pillars and 12 focus
     areas create a sustainability program
     that is greater than the sum of its parts.
     this is our triple bottom line.




about pnnl
located in richland, washington, pnnl is one of 17 doe national laboratories and one of 10 overseen
by doe’s office of science. interdisciplinary teams at pnnl address many of america’s most pressing
issues in energy, the environment, and national security through advances in basic and applied science.
in addition to work for doe, pnnl conducts research for other government agencies including the
u.s. department of defense and the national institutes of health, as well as private industry. we
manage a large campus with approximately 80 facilities. at the end of fy2015, pnnl employed
approximately 4,400 people and had an annual budget of nearly $1 billion. pnnl has been managed
for doe by ohio-based battelle since the laboratory’s inception in 1965.

award-winning technologies
in its annual r&d 100 awards, r&d magazine
honored five advancements developed by pnnl
researchers, including a few that are providing
the nation with more sustainable, resilient
energy sources.

power model integrator
energy forecasters working for utilities and other
power organizations currently rely on a combination
of personal experience, historical data, and their
own preferred forecasting model. each model tends
to excel at capturing certain grid behaviors, but not
necessarily the whole picture. the power model
integrator is a new forecasting tool that delivers up
to a 50% increase in accuracy and the potential to    pnnl’s power grid integrator has demonstrated up to a

                                                          over several commonly used tools.

hydrothermal processing
a new chemical processing system can convert natural substances as diverse as waste treatment sludge,
food scraps, and algae into a variety of useful fuels. the system is remarkably efficient, in many cases
converting 99% of a feedstock like algae into fuels, including biocrude oil, which can then be refined into
aviation fuel,
gasoline, and
diesel fuel.
the process
also produces
another fuel
— methane
gas — as well
as clean water
and useful
plant nutrients
such as nitro-
gen, phospho-
rous, and
potassium.




                 a new hydrothermal process uses heat and pressure to chemically and physically change algae into
                 biocrude in a matter of minutes.

          •    initiate an assessment of actions to work toward new executive order 13693 goals for
               net zero buildings.
          •    update the site water management plan to identify new opportunities for water savings.
          •    commission and safely move staff into the new general purpose chemistry laboratory,
               a building that meets the guiding principles for high performance and sustainable
               buildings.
          •    leverage the success of the rock the watt energy conservation campaign in 2015
               to engage building-level advocates in sustainability throughout the year.
          •    update the pnnl sustainability website to provide a central source of information
               on actions staff members can take to green their laboratory operations, workspace,
               and commute.
          •    designate an alternative commute coordinator to educate and promote alternative
               commute options to pnnl employees, including biking, public transit, and carpooling.




looking forward, we will continue to integrate best practices for sustainable buildings into the day-to-day operations
of our campus.
