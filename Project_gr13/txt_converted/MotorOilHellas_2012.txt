creating value with outward-looking
attitudes and responsible growth
2011 was a year full of challenges, both for the global and the greek economy. innovation, outward-looking
attitudes and investments are key to the country’s development and the motor oil group is fully
aligned with these elements both in business philosophy and in practice.

our principles and the respect for our country and our people are non-negotiable. we care for our
people, invest for health and safety and continuously improve our environmental performance. we
contribute to the society in a sustainable and consistent manner and help our fellow-citizens lead a
better life.

in this difficult economic climate, motor oil has proved its great strength by setting new, all-time fuel
sales and production records. 2011 was a year of maturing of the investments and acquisitions made in the
previous years. it was the first year we saw a full-year’s yield coming from the new crude distillation unit
in the area of investments, as well as from shell’s activities in greece in the area of acquisitions. despite
the pressure in the fuels market, our increase of domestic market share, through the retail networks of
coral and avin oil, is indicative of our successful strategy.

we have put special emphasis on our employees’ training, while at the same time we constantly provide
a modern business environment, thus responding to various technological and labor challenges. moreover,
we have further enhanced health and safety through targeted investments, continuous training programs
and by adopting good practices, among others. overall, we have invested 15.8 million euros in projects and
programs relating to workplace safety.

we have adopted new techniques and completed investments, aiming at markedly reducing our
environmental footprint. motor oil has developed an integrated environmental management system,
which aims at the company’s constant improvement in terms of energy efficiency and emission control
and, as a result, at the reduction of its environmental and energy-related footprint.

we have invested in social responsibility projects by financially supporting cultural organizations and
unions, sports events, social care bodies, educational organizations, as well as the work of municipalities in
the vicinity of the refinery.

the “sustainability report 2011”, you are holding in your hands, is the tenth consecutive edition and is
indicative of motor oil group’s firm commitment to implement best practices based on the principles
of the corporate social responsibility and corporate governance, as well as the principles of sustainable
development. motor oil group practices responsible entrepreneurship, aiming at the constant support
of our overall contribution to society at large.

this year is also of a special, symbolic value to the group, as it has been 40 years since motor oil
begun its operations. during all these years, we have shown business consistency, based on the vision
and the strategy we designed. with pride and optimism for the future, we will vigorously continue with
investments and with social contribution projects, ensuring a sustainable growth and development for the
benefit our all our stakeholders.

                                                                              motor oil group management

on the sustainability report 2011
the sustainability report 2011 is the tenth such record of the annual activities of the
motor oil group (1 january 2011 - 31 december 2011), reflecting the company’s vision, strategic
objectives, values and principles. the primary concern of the report is to provide comprehensive
information for all stakeholders in the group: workforce, customers, suppliers, shareholders,
investors, creditors and local communities.

the report underlines the group’s sincere commitment to the principles of corporate
social responsibility. as an active member of the community, the motor oil group strives
to achieve sustainable development and sound management, and in its everyday operations
responds to environmental challenges and the needs of society as a whole.

the structure of the sustainability report 2011 is designed to cover all aspects of corporate
responsibility. it focuses, therefore, on actions demonstrating respect for human values and the
environment, the implementation of an effective health and safety policy, and support for efforts
to achieve sustainable social development. the various sections of the report describe in detail
the group’s activities, with presentations of the latest quantitative figures and data.

the terms ‘group’ and ‘motor oil group’ refer to the motor oil group and its
constituent subsidiary groups and companies, avin oil, coral, coral gas and ofc. the term
‘company’ refers to the parent company ‘motor oil’; the terms ‘other companies’ and
‘remaining companies’ refer to the aforesaid set of companies, while the term ‘commercial
companies’ refers, once again, to the aforesaid set of companies, not - however - including ofc.


global reporting initiative - un global compact
the selection of topics for the sustainability report 2011 was based on the g3.1 guidelines of
the global reporting initiative (gri), and on the ten principles of the united nations global
compact. at the end of the report there is a summary table matching the contents of the
report to the gri indicators and global compact principles. in this sense the environmental
and social report 2011 also serves as a communication on progress for the global compact,
setting out the way in which its ten principles have been implemented.

supplementary data can be found in the annual financial report 2011 and the environmental
statement 2011, as well as at the company’s website, www.moh.gr.

motor oil’s management and control is based on the current principles of good corporate governance, as
prescribed by legislation and the relevant regulations, and by other international codes of best practice and auditing
standards. its strategy and daily operations are deployed within the framework of corporate governance principles,
which govern issues such as:

• the appropriate structure of its board of directors,
• respect for, equal treatment and protection of the interests and the rights of all shareholders,
• compliance with legal and regulatory provisions,
• transparency in decision-making procedures,
• the reliability and adequacy of all disseminated information, regarding the group’s strategy and financial results, or its
  financial transactions,
• the management of personnel and remuneration matters, and
• the identification, assessment and control of all inherent risks.

an important tool in this endeavour is the measurement, regular evaluation of results, and the systematic assessment
of the environmental impacts at all stages of the production process. this assessment is based on a set of criteria
-including legislative requirements and stakeholder views- which lead to the classification of impacts according to their
significance and their characterisation as significant or non-significant. this classification procedure is also carried out
whenever there are any changes to the refinery’s configuration, re-evaluating the classification and characterisation of
the impacts.
