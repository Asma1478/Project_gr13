about sustainability report 2014


editorial policy
in consideration of the increasing importance of sustainability management, panasonic publishes the sustainability report
to comprehensively introduce our initiatives towards the society and environment as well as annual relevant data.

we used the international standard, iso26000:2010, guidance on social responsibility, specifically the seven core subjects,
as well as the global reporting initiative (gri) sustainability reporting guidelines g4 and its principles of sustainability
context, stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, and completeness, to determine the universe of issues relevant to social
responsibility. in addition, to determine priority issues, we conducted materiality assessment (see pages 9-12), as well as
focusing our environmental reporting on the issues as set forth in the environmental action plan — green plan 2018.

data reported in this report refers to a global result and the name of a country or region is indicated when disclosing data
specific to a particular country or region. more detailed information or those by region is disclosed in the sustainability
page on our website.
 http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/sustainability/

this report is published alongside our annual report 2014, which contains detailed information about our business and
financial performance.

              realizing “a better life, a better world”

              fiscal year 2015 marks the second year of panasonic’s current mid-term management
              plan, which covers the three years to march 2016. now we are at the stage to bring our
              growth strategies to fruition.

              ever since our founding, we at panasonic have been carrying out our activities following
              our basic management philosophy: to make a contribution through our business
              operations to improving the lives of people around the world, as well as to the further
              progress of society. and, over the years, we have always been conscious of the changes
              of the times. our aim is to contribute to the development of a sustainable future and to
              be in harmony with the global environment and society.

              based on this philosophy, we have nurtured our core values, which we call “our
              consumer electronics dna.” with this dna central to all of our activities, we will
              pursue our corporate slogan “a better life, a better world” by meeting the needs of
              all our customers, as individuals and in almost every aspect of their lives. our scope of
              business ranges from inside the home, the office, and the store to the automobile, the
              airplane and around the town.

              as an example of our residential business, we are accelerating the development of
              a smart city. we are engaged in building a sustainable environment in the fujisawa
              sustainable smart town, which opened in april 2014. in this endeavor, we aim to reduce
              co2 emissions by 70 percent, cut daily water consumption by 30 percent, and reach a
              renewable energy utilization ratio of 30 percent or more – all without lowering the quality
              of life. concerning safety and security, our target is to ensure utilities for three days
              following any contingency. going forward, we will actively share what we have learned
              here, thus spreading “a better life” throughout the world.

              in our automotive business, we play an active role in providing automobile batteries that
              are highly regarded for their excellent environmental performance and reliability. we
              work along with our partners – who are addressing issues such as global warming and
              various energy-related problems – with their electric cars and vehicles equipped with
              idle-reduction systems.

              meanwhile, the world faces pressing issues such as water shortages, increasing greenhouse
              gases, and air pollution. to address these issues, we are engaged in the research and
              development of technologies such as water purification systems that use photocatalysis,
              as well as artificial photosynthesis systems. we hope to leverage leading-edge
              technologies such as these so that we can contribute to “a better world” for the future.

              in order to accomplish our aims, we must first implement the business activities for
              which we bear responsibility. complying with laws, regulations and business ethics is the
              foundation of our management. on top of this, we respect fundamental human rights,
              ensure a safe and comfortable work environment, and give the utmost consideration to
              the health of our employees. in addition, we will actively address environmental issues
              related to co2 emissions, resource recycling, water, chemical substances management,
              and biodiversity. in making progress in dealing with such issues, cooperation with our
              suppliers is crucial, as we consider the total picture of the global supply chain.

              at panasonic, we are fully committed to realizing “a better life, a better world.” we
              would like to ask for your continued understanding and support moving forward.

                                                                                               july 2014

our unchanging management philosophy and sustainability


our mission at panasonic is to contribute to the advance of world
culture by working to improve society through the products we
produce and sell. panasonic’s basic management objective clearly
expresses the purpose of our business activities as well as the
purpose of our existence.

since the company’s founding in 1918, this management philosophy
has formed the foundation of all our business activities. as the
key element of this philosophy, we have the basic concept of
the “company as a public entity of society.” all the management
resources of a company-including the people, money, and
commodities-all come from society.

while the company engages in business activities using the
resources entrusted by society, it also develops along with society,
and so the company’s activities must be transparent, fair, and just.

the entire panasonic group takes care to ensure that our management and business activities are appropriate for “a public
entity of society,” and we will continue to implement this management philosophy through manufacturing as our primary
business. this is also the very essence of the panasonic group's sustainability. as we stand at historical turning points
in many areas today-society, economy, global environment-the panasonic group will continue to promote sustainability
management globally and to contribute to the future of society and the world by proposing the lifestyles of tomorrow.

                                     (issued in june 1978)
                                     “there is much discussion today regarding ‘social responsibility,’ but while the meaning of
                                     that concept can be wide-ranging depending on social conditions at a particular time, the
                                     fundamental social responsibility of a corporation, in any era, should be to improve society
                                     through its business activities. it is extremely important to manage all business activities based
                                     on this sense of mission.”

system for the promotion of csr activities


systematic management for sustained progress to address challenges tied to sustainability
panasonic places a responsible executive and a responsible functional department to take charge of each field of the core
subjects (human rights, labor practices, environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and community) covered
under iso26000 as well as the supply chain. on a divisional company, business division, region and function basis, steps
are taken to put in place a variety of meeting structures and to engage with stakeholders with feedback incorporated into
daily activities. autonomous efforts are promoted while confirming progress through the use of a pdca cycle.

decisions are also made for corporate-wide issues through the group strategy meeting, group executive committee for
deliberating important matters, and the board of directors.

materiality is selected and decided upon based on daily activities in each field of operation and is factored into operational policy.

moreover, csr activities are promoted in line with a fundamental idea of respecting domestic and international guidelines,
as well as the concerns of stakeholders.



                                                                               board of directors

corporate governance, etc.


this section includes the matters of consolidated companies. this section refers to the matters as of june 27, 2014, unless
otherwise indicated.



1. corporate governance
(1) basic policy of corporate governance
under its basic philosophy “a company is a public entity of society,” the company has long been committed to corporate
governance. the company’s corporate governance system is based on the board of directors, which is responsible for
deciding important operational matters for the whole group and monitoring the execution of business by directors, and
audit & supervisory board members (a&sbms) and the audit & supervisory board (a&sb), which are independent from
the board of directors and responsible for auditing the performance of duties by directors.

in october, 2012, the company established the corporate strategy head office, which is responsible for formulating and
promoting group-wide strategies and other matters from the perspective of an investor. at the same time, the company
divided parts of functions such as the corporate r&d group and the corporate legal affairs division, which had previously
been functions of the head office, and incorporated those functions into the professional business support sector in order
to support the performance of business operations by the divisional companies and the business divisions.

in april, 2013, the company introduced the business division system and positioned business divisions as basic
management units. in fy2014, the company has forty-three (43) business divisions and each of the business divisions is
autonomously managed to formulate its respective midterm management plans and business plans, and is responsible
for r&d, production and sales as well as its cash and profit management on a global basis. in addition, four (4) divisional
companies (appliances, eco solutions, avc networks and automotive & industrial systems), the aggregation of
the business divisions, support the business division system. the company has established the following corporate
governance system suitable for the company’s business structure based on the four (4) divisional companies and forty-
three (43) business divisions.



(2) corporate governance structure
the board of directors and executive officer system
the company’s board of directors is composed of seventeen (17) directors including three (3) outside directors. in
accordance with the company law of japan and related laws and ordinances (collectively, the “company law”), the
board of directors has ultimate responsibility for administration of the company’s affairs and monitoring of the execution of
business by directors.

the company has an optimum management and governance structure tailored to four (4) divisional company-based
management structures. under this structure, the company has empowered each of four (4) divisional companies and
business divisions through delegation of authority. at the same time, the company employs an executive officer system
to provide for the execution of business at its various domestic and overseas group companies. this system facilitates
the development of optimum corporate strategies that integrate the group’s comprehensive strengths. the company has
twenty (20) executive officers (excluding those who concurrently serve as directors), which include senior managements
of each of four (4) divisional companies, senior officers responsible for certain foreign regions and officers responsible for
corporate functions.

in addition, in order to ensure swift and strategic decision-making, along with sound and appropriate monitoring at the
same time, the board of directors, as a decision-making body for group-wide matters, concentrates on decisions about
the corporate strategies and the supervision of the four (4) divisional companies, while executive officers have been
delegated with the authority to handle responsibilities relating to day-to-day operations at each of the four (4) divisional
companies. taking into consideration the diversified scope of its business operations, the company has opted to maintain
a system where executive officers, who are most familiar with the specifics of the operations, take an active part in the
board of directors. moreover, to clarify the responsibilities of directors and create a more dynamic organization of the
board of directors, the company has limited the term of each director to one year.


                                                              13

audit & supervisory board members (a&sbms) and audit & supervisory board (a&sb)
pursuant to the company law, the company has elected a&sbms and established a&sb, made up of a&sbms. the
a&sbms and a&sb monitor the status of corporate governance and audit the day-to-day activities of management,
including the performance of duties by directors. the company has five (5) a&sbms, including three (3) outside a&sbms.
additionally, the company elected a&sbms who have substantial finance and accounting knowledge. a&sbms participate
in the general meetings of shareholders and the board of directors, receive reports from directors, executive officers,
employees and accounting auditors, and exercise other auditing authority granted to a&sbms under the law. full-
time senior a&sbms also attend important meetings and conduct visiting audits to business offices in order to ensure
effective audits. in order to augment the internal auditing functions in the group, the company assigns nine (9) full-time
audit & supervisory officers (a&sos), who directly report to the senior a&sbms of the company, to the four (4) divisional
companies. the company also inaugurated regular panasonic divisional companies audit & supervisory officers’ meeting
(comprising a total of eleven (11) members, of which two (2) are senior a&sbms of the company and nine (9) are a&sos
of the divisional companies ) chaired by the senior a&sbm of the company and the panasonic group audit & supervisory
board members’ meeting (comprising a total of thirty-two (32) members, of which two (2) are senior a&sbms of the
company, nine (9) are a&sos of each divisional company and twenty-one (21) are a&sbms of the group companies) to
enhance coordination among the company’s a&sbms, a&sos of the divisional companies and audit & supervisory board
members of the group companies, for effective functioning of the entire group corporate governance structure. in addition,
in the course of the performance of their duties, a&sbms maintain close contacts with the internal audit department and
other departments, which perform business audits and internal control audits, to ensure the efficiency of audits. a&sbms
regularly receive from the internal audit department and other sections regular reports regarding the status involving the
internal control system and results of audits. a&sbms may request the internal audit group or accounting auditors to
conduct an investigation, if necessary. also, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the audits conducted by a&sbms and
to ensure the smooth implementation of audits, the company has established a a&sbm’s office with six (6) full-time staff
under the direct control of the a&sb.

mr. yoshihiro furuta, a senior a&sbm of the company, has substantial finance and accounting knowledge, having held
the position of general manager, accounting, at matsushita electric works, ltd. mr. toshio kinoshita, outside a&sbm of
the company, has substantial finance and accounting knowledge, having held the career experiences with a corporate
accounting in global companies in japan and overseas for long periods as a certified public accountant.

all of the outside directors and outside a&sbms are notified to the japanese stock exchanges as “independent directors/
audit & supervisory board members” defined in article 436, paragraph 2 of securities listing regulations of the tokyo
stock exchange and are unlikely to have any conflict of interests with panasonic's shareholders.




group executive committee for deliberating important matters
in october 2012, the company established and has operated the group executive committee for deliberating important
matters, where discussions are conducted prior to the board of directors, with the aim of ensuring productive deliberations
at the board of directors. at the group executive committee for deliberating important matters, matters deemed to
be important, such as investments over a certain amount and group-wide management systems and measures are
deliberated. the members of the committee are the president and executive officers whose job functions are related to
the matters to be discussed. the officers responsible for businesses or job functions related to the matters also join the
meeting, if necessary.


group strategy meeting
in july 2012, the company established the group strategy meeting to discuss the company’s mid-term and long-
term strategies and certain important issues. the meeting is generally held twice a month. the attendees consist of
approximately ten (10) people in managerial positions called as the group management team and include the president
and the presidents of four (4) divisional companies. the officers of related businesses and functions also join the meeting,
depending on the matter to be discussed. by integrating meetings for discussing and sharing information regarding group-
wide issues into the group strategy meeting, the company is capable of prioritizing and promptly discussing important
group-wide issues.

risk management


fundamental stance
panasonic promotes company-wide risk management activities that cover operations around the world. the aim is to
take preemptive actions to eliminate “sources of failure,” which means anything that could impede the accomplishment
of business goals. underpinning this risk management are principles of panasonic founder konosuke matsushita: “worry
earlier and enjoy later than people,” “cause of failures lie within oneself,” “there is always a “sign” for everything,” and “small
things can create big problems; you must be alert for signs of change and act accordingly.”

at panasonic, risk management functions in tandem with the establishment and execution of management strategies.
combining these two functions better enables us to accomplish business objectives and increase our corporate value.
disclosing risk information in public in an appropriate way and improving the transparency of our activities, as well as
reducing risk by taking preemptive countermeasures gives customers and other stakeholders as well as communities and
the public greater confidence in the panasonic organization.

promotion organization
panasonic has a global & group (g&g) risk management committee since april 2005 to promote group wide risk
management that is chaired by the corporate risk management executive officer and includes company cros (chief
risk officer), regional headquarters, and managers from corporate strategy head office and functions, and the risk
management office serves as its secretariat. in addition, the committee coordinates its efforts with other committees
associated with risk management. this provides a basis to promote measures throughout the company to deal with risks
and to give assistance to companies and regional headquarters. risk management committees are also established by
these companies and regional headquarters. collectively, these units create a global risk management system that spans
the entire panasonic group.

basic framework
panasonic has three levels of management cycles for risk management: the g&g risk management committee, divisional
companies, and business divisions. each year, an assessment of the impact of risks that could affect the business
management of divisional companies and affiliated business divisions is undertaken using a single, global set of standards
incorporating the potential impact on business operations, probability of risk occurring, and other factors. steps are then
taken to identify major divisional company risks and appropriate countermeasures implemented. taking into consideration
these major divisional company risks, the g&g risk management committee considers and identifies those major risks
that require attention from a group-wide perspective. the g&g risk management committee also monitors progress made
concerning countermeasures as a means to improve and strengthen group-wide risk management.

business continuity management (bcm) initiatives
guided by its management philosophy, and through its production and sales activities, panasonic, as a public entity of
society, is devoted to the progress and development of society and the well-being of people. in this manner, the company
is working to enhance the quality of life throughout the world. since 2005, panasonic has in particular recognized the
importance of engaging in continuous business activities as a part of efforts to fulfill its corporate social responsibility.
accordingly, the company is promoting activities that will ensure the uninterrupted supply of products and services even
in the event of an emergency. should delivery be suspended for some unforeseeable circumstance, however, panasonic is
also focusing on activities that will bring about the quick resumption of supply.

looking at projections of a major earthquake directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area as well as the nankai trough,
panasonic has established a companywide task force. this task force is taking the lead in promoting countermeasures
based on the government’s updated estimates of damage as well as reviewing the company’s bcm.




risk factors
annually, panasonic conducts a risk assessment by which it surveys to identify potential risks which affect its business
activities, evaluates such risks based on its common global standards mainly focusing on the impact to the management
of panasonic and the probability of the materialization of the risks, and prioritizes the risks against which measures should
be taken. for the risks identified as material in these processes, each level of panasonic group, such as the corporate,
divisional companies and business divisions, forms and takes countermeasures that correspond to the characteristics
of the risks, monitors the progress of such countermeasures, and seeks continuous improvements. primarily because of
the business areas and geographical areas where it operates, and the highly competitive nature of the industry to which it
belongs, panasonic is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties in conducting its businesses, including, but not limited
to, the following. these risks may adversely affect panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition. this
section includes forward-looking statements and future expectations as of june 27, 2014.


1. risks related to economic conditions
continued or further weakness in japanese and global economies
demand for panasonic’s products and services may be affected by general economic trends in the countries or regions in
which panasonic’s products and services are sold. economic downturns and resulting declines in demand in panasonic’s
major markets worldwide may thus adversely affect the company’s business, operating results and financial condition.
for fiscal 2015, ending march 31, 2015, the company anticipates that the overall global economy is expected to grow
moderately due to economic recoveries and progress in europe and u.s., and the economic growth in emerging countries
as well as a high level capital investment and public investment in japan. on the other hand, destabilizing factors such
as a geopolitical risk, an effect of contraction of monetary easing in u.s. and a consumption tax increase in japan may
adversely affect its business environment. panasonic may incur increased costs for additional business restructuring
in order to cope with such business environment. if global economy worsens contrary to its expectations, the business
environment of panasonic may deteriorate more than currently anticipated, which may adversely affect the company’s
business, operating results and financial condition.



currency exchange rate fluctuations
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition,
because costs and prices of its products and services and certain other transactions that are denominated in a foreign
currency are affected by foreign exchange rate changes. in addition, foreign exchange rate changes also affect the yen
value of panasonic’s overseas assets and liabilities because they are translated in japanese yen when panasonic’s
consolidated financial statements are presented. generally, an appreciation of the yen against other major currencies in
countries in which panasonic operates may adversely affect panasonic’s operating results. meanwhile, a depreciation
of the yen against the aforementioned major currencies may have a favorable impact on panasonic’s operating results.
however, in certain business divisions which have shifted the manufacturing sites to overseas, the depreciation of the yen
may adversely affect their operating results on a japanese yen basis due to price increase of the imported products. after
the extreme appreciation of the yen against the usd had been put brakes and the euro in the previous fiscal year, for fiscal
2014 in general, although the depreciation of the yen continued, the impact from the foreign currency movements to the



                                                             25

consolidated panasonic’s operating results has been decreasing partially due to the aforementioned measures, such as
shifting manufacturing sites to overseas. however, excessive foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the
company’s business, operating results and financial condition.



interest rate fluctuations
panasonic is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks which may affect the company’s operating costs, interest expenses,
interest income and the value of financial assets and liabilities. accordingly, interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect
the company’s business, operating results and financial condition.



continuation or deterioration of financial market instability
panasonic raises funds for its business through methods such as borrowing from financial institutions and issuance of
bonds and commercial papers. where, among other events, financial market continues to be unstable or deteriorates,
financial institutions reduce lending to panasonic, or rating agencies downgrade panasonic’s credit ratings, panasonic
may not be able to raise funds in the time and amount necessary for panasonic, or under conditions which panasonic
deems appropriate, and panasonic may incur additional costs of raising funds, which may adversely affect the company’s
business, operating results and financial condition.



decreases in the value of stocks
panasonic holds both japanese and overseas stocks as part of its investment securities. decreases in the value of the
stocks may cause losses due to a decrease the valuation of investment securities, thereby adversely affecting panasonic’s
operating results and financial condition. in the case of listed stocks, decreases in the value of the stocks may also reduce
stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet, as unrealized holding gains (losses) of available-for-sale securities are included
as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).


2. risks related to panasonic’s business
competition in the industry
panasonic develops, produces and sells a broad range of products and services and therefore faces many different types
of competitors, from large international companies to relatively small, rapidly growing, and highly specialized organizations.
panasonic may choose not to fund or invest in one or more of its businesses to the same degree as its competitors in
those businesses do, or it may not be able to do so in a timely manner or even at all. these competitors may have greater
financial strength, technological capability, and marketing resources than panasonic in the respective businesses in which
they compete.


declines in product price and relationship with business partners which the company highly depends on
panasonic’s business is subject to intense price competition worldwide, which makes it difficult for the company
to determine product prices and maintain adequate profits. such intensified price competition may adversely affect
panasonic’s profits, especially in times of possible decreases in product demand. in btoc (business-to-consumer) business
areas, amid accelerating changes in the structure of markets, such as a demand shift to emerging markets and lower-
priced products, panasonic’s product prices in digital electronics and other business areas may continue to decline. on
the other hand, in btob (business-to-business) business areas, the company’s business, operating results and financial
condition may be adversely affected by the downward price pressure exceeding which can be achieved by the company’s
effort, decrease in demand for products, or pressure for capital investment from business partners which the company
highly depends on.


risks generally associated with international business operations
one of panasonic’s business strategies is business expansion in overseas markets. in many of these markets, panasonic
may face risks generally associated with international manufacturing and other business operations, such as political
instability, including war, civil war, conflict, riot and terrorist attacks, cultural and religious differences and labor relations,
as well as economic uncertainty and foreign currency exchange risks. panasonic may also face barriers in commercial
and business customs in foreign countries, including difficulties in timely collection of accounts receivable or in building


                                                                 26

and expanding relationships with customers, subcontractors or parts suppliers. panasonic may also experience various
political, legal or other restrictions in investment, trade, manufacturing, labor or other aspects of operations, including
restrictions on foreign investment or the repatriation of profits on invested capital, nationalization of local industry, changes
in export or import restrictions or foreign exchange controls, and changes in the tax system or the rate of taxation in
countries where panasonic operates businesses. with respect to products exported overseas, tariffs, other barriers or
shipping costs may make panasonic’s products less competitive in terms of price. expanding its overseas businesses may
require significant investments long before panasonic realizes returns on such investments, and increased investments
may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues.


competition in technological changes and product formats as de facto standards
panasonic may fail to introduce new products or services in response to technological changes in a timely manner.
some of panasonic’s core businesses in both btoc (business-to-consumer) and btob (business-to-business) areas are
concentrated in industries where technological innovation is the central competitive factor. panasonic continuously faces
the challenge of developing and introducing viable and innovative new products. panasonic must predict with reasonable
accuracy both future demand and new technologies that will be available to meet such demand. in cases where the
technology developed or provided by panasonic does not lead the market and, instead, the technology developed by its
competitors are recognized as de facto standards, the company may lose its competitiveness in the new markets.


competition in recruiting and retaining skilled employees
panasonic’s future success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain certain key personnel, including professionals
in the fields of research, development, technology and management. however, the number of qualified personnel is limited,
and the competition for attracting and retaining these employees is intense. because of this intense competition for skilled
employees, panasonic may be unable to retain its existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees to keep up
with future business needs. if this should happen, panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition could be
adversely affected.


alliances with, and strategic investments in, third parties, and mergers and acquisitions
panasonic develops its businesses by forming alliances or joint ventures with, making strategic investments in, other
companies, including investments in start-up companies, and implementing injection of external capital. furthermore,
the importance of strategic alliance with third parties is increasing. although, in some cases, such alliances are crucial
to panasonic’s goal of introducing new products and services, panasonic may not be able to successfully collaborate or
achieve expected synergies with its alliance partners. furthermore, the alliance partners may make decisions regarding
their business undertakings with panasonic that may be contrary to panasonic’s interests. in addition, if these partners
change their business strategies, panasonic may fail to maintain these partnerships. on april 1, 2011, panasonic made
panasonic electric works co., ltd. and sanyo electric co., ltd. its wholly-owned subsidiaries, both through share
exchanges, and have restructured its groupwide business organization. however, panasonic may fail to fully achieve the
expected results.


shortage of supply of parts, components and services, as well as electricity
panasonic’s manufacturing operations depend on obtaining raw materials, parts and components, equipment and other
supplies including services from reliable suppliers at adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner. it may be difficult for
panasonic to substitute one supplier for another, increase the number of suppliers or change one component for another
in a timely manner or at all due to the shortage or interruption of supply caused by, among other things, natural disasters,
accidents, the bankruptcy of suppliers or increased industry demand. this may adversely affect the panasonic group’s
operations. although panasonic decides purchase prices by contract, the prices of raw materials, including iron and steel,
resin, non-ferrous metals, and parts and components may increase due to changes in demand and supply conditions and
the inflow of investment funds. some components are only available from a limited number of suppliers, which also may
adversely affect panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition. furthermore, if limitations on electricity
use or rolling blackouts are implemented due to the shortage in the electricity supply caused by the closedown of certain
nuclear power stations in japan, the production at certain panasonic’s manufacturing plants in japan may decline or be
suspended. the rise in electricity costs may be leading to an increase in procurement cost for electricity. the production
and sales activities of panasonic may be adversely and significantly affected by the aforementioned matters.



                                                               27

customers’ financial difficulties
many of panasonic’s customers purchase products and services from panasonic on payment terms that do not provide for
immediate payment. if customers from whom panasonic has substantial accounts receivable encounter financial difficulties
and are unable to make payments on time, panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition could be
adversely affected.

3. risks related to panasonic’s management plans
panasonic announced a midterm management plan called “cross-value innovation 2015” (cv2015), on march 28,
2013, which runs from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2016 and implements specific measures to achieve the targets. however,
panasonic may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits because of various external and internal factors such
as deterioration of the business environment and increased costs of business restructuring such as additional business
reorganization, the impairment of fixed assets and employment adjustment in order to cope with the business environment.

4. risks related to legal restrictions and litigations
significant direct or indirect costs resulting from product liability or warranty claims
the occurrence of quality problems due to product defects, including safety incidents, relating to panasonic products
could make panasonic liable for damages not covered by product and completed operation liability insurance, whereby the
company could incur significant expenses. due to negative publicity arising due to these problems, panasonic’s business,
operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

damages related to intellectual properties
panasonic’s success depends on its ability to obtain intellectual property rights covering its products and product design.
patents may not be granted or may not be of sufficient scope or force to provide panasonic with adequate protection or
commercial advantage. in addition, effective copyright and trade secret protections may be unavailable or limited in some
countries in which panasonic operates. competitors or other third parties may also develop technologies that are protected
by patents and other intellectual property rights, which make such technologies unavailable or available only on terms
unfavorable to panasonic. the company obtains licenses for intellectual property rights from other parties; however, such
licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and the terms of such licenses may be modified unfavorably.
litigation may also be necessary to enforce panasonic’s intellectual property rights or to defend against intellectual property
infringement claims brought against panasonic by third parties. in such cases, panasonic may incur significant expenses
and management resources in connection with such lawsuits. furthermore, panasonic may be prohibited from using certain
important technologies or be found liable for damages in cases of admitted violations of intellectual property rights of others.

changes in accounting standards and tax systems
introduction of new accounting standards or tax systems, or changes thereof, which panasonic cannot predict, may have
a material adverse effect on the company’s operating results and financial condition. in addition, if tax authorities have
different opinions from panasonic on the company’s tax declarations, panasonic may need to make larger tax payments
than estimated.

payments or compensation related to environmental regulations or issues
panasonic is subject to environmental regulations such as those relating to climate change, air pollution, water pollution,
hazardous substances, waste materials, product recycling, and soil and groundwater contamination, and may be held
responsible for certain related payments or compensation. furthermore, if these regulations become stricter and an additional
duty with the aim of eliminating the use of environmentally hazardous materials is imposed, or if panasonic group determines
that it is necessary and appropriate, from the viewpoint of corporate social responsibility, to respond to environmental issues,
the payment of penalties for the violation of these regulations or the payment of compensation for consolation to parties
affected by such issues may adversely affect panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition.

leaks of confidential information, including personal information, or trade secrets
in the normal course of business, panasonic holds confidential information mainly about customers regarding credit
worthiness and other information, as well as confidential information about companies and other third parties. such
information may be leaked due to an accident or other inevitable cause or other third parties’ actions including fraudulent
access to the systems, and any material leakage of confidential information may result in significant expense for related
lawsuits and adversely affect panasonic’s business and image. moreover, other than customer information, there is a risk
that panasonic’s trade secrets, such as technology information, may be leaked due to illegal conduct of external parties,



                                                               28

mere negligence or other causes. if such is the case, panasonic’s business, operating results and financial condition may
be adversely affected.

inconveniences or legal liability due to governmental laws and regulations
panasonic is subject to governmental regulations in japan and other countries in which it conducts its business, including
obtaining governmental approvals required for conducting business and investments, laws and regulations governing the
telecommunications businesses and electric product safety, national security-related laws and regulations and export/import
laws and regulations, as well as commercial, antitrust, patent, product liability, environmental laws and regulations, consumer
protection, labor relations, financial and business taxation laws and regulations, and internal control regulations. if, due to the
implementation of stricter laws and regulations and stricter interpretations, panasonic cannot comply with these laws and
regulations from technical and economic perspectives, or panasonic determines that it will not be economical to continue to
comply with them, panasonic will need to limit its activities in the affected business areas. these laws and regulations could
increase panasonic’s operating costs. in addition, in the event that governmental authorities find or determine that panasonic
has violated these laws and regulations, panasonic could become subject to regulatory sanctions, including monetary
penalties, as well as criminal sanctions or civil lawsuits for damages, and could also suffer reputational harm.




5. risks related to disasters and accidents or unpredictable events
panasonic expands its manufacturing sales, and research and development activities globally and has facilities all over the
world. if major disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, floods, including those caused by climate change, wars,
terrorist attacks, computer viruses or other events occur, or panasonic’s information system or communications network
breaks down or operates improperly as a result of such events, panasonic’s facilities and other assets may be seriously
damaged, or the company may have to stop or delay production and shipment. panasonic may incur expenses relating
to such damages. in addition, if an infectious disease, such as a new highly-pathogenic flu strain, becomes prevalent
throughout the world, panasonic’s manufacturing and sales may be materially disrupted. in addition, in the case where
these natural disasters and accidents or other unpredictable events disrupt the supply chain of panasonic including
suppliers of parts or components and manufacturers to which panasonic sells its products, the production and sales
activities of panasonic may be adversely and significantly affected due to the shortage or interruption in the supply of parts
or components from such suppliers, or suspension of or decline in production activities of such manufacturers.




6. other risks
panasonic’s pension plan benefit obligations
panasonic group has contributory, funded benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees in japan who meet
eligibility requirements. the company and certain domestic subsidiaries made a transition from the defined benefit pension
plan to the defined contribution pension plan for the contributions made on or after july 1, 2013. regarding the past
contribution, a decline in interest rates may cause a decrease in the discount rate on benefit obligations. a decrease in the
value of stocks may also affect the return on plan assets. as a result, the actuarial loss may increase, leading to an increase
in future net periodic benefit costs of these pension plans.



impairment of some long-lived assets
panasonic has many long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and goodwill, that generate returns. the
company periodically reviews the recorded value of its long-lived assets to determine if the fair value will be sufficient to
support the asset book values. if these long-lived assets do not generate sufficient cash flows, impairment losses will have
to be recognized, adversely affecting panasonic’s results of operations and financial condition.



realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions based on the expected future generation
of taxable income or assessed sustainability of uncertain tax positions, panasonic considers whether it is more likely than
not that any portion or all of the deferred tax assets or recognized tax position benefit will not be realized. if panasonic
determines that recognized tax benefits on temporary differences and loss carryforwards cannot be realized upon the
generation of future taxable income during the deductible periods due to deteriorating business conditions or tax position


                                                                29

benefits may not be realized upon settlement, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets or unrecognized tax benefit
reserves could be recognized and panasonic’s provision for income tax may increase.



financial results and condition of associated companies under the equity method
panasonic holds equities of several associated companies under the equity method. panasonic can exercise influence
over operating and financing policies of these companies. however, panasonic does not have the right to make decisions
for them since the companies operate independently. some of these companies may record losses. if these associated
companies do not generate profits, panasonic’s business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.




                                                           30

environment: policy

environmental policy
contributing to society has been the management philosophy for panasonic ever since its founding, and we have been
taking measures against pollution since the 1970s. we announced the environmental statement in june 5, 1991, clarifying
our approaches to address global environmental issues as a public entity of society. since then we have been carrying
out initiatives including matters on global warming prevention and resources recycling corporate-wide, aiming to attain a
sustainable, safe, and secure society.

with the panasonic group’s new brand slogan introduced in fiscal 2014, “a better life, a better world,” we are promoting
environmental initiatives as an important element in achieving this goal. in production activities, exhaustive energy-saving
measures have been implemented in all factories worldwide, pushing for further co2 reduction in our production activities.
at the same time, panasonic has introduced its own indicator called “the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions”
to strengthen co2 reduction efforts during product use as well. we have increased the number of products boasting top
environmental performance levels in the industry. furthermore, we are cutting down co2 emissions from product use at
home by expanding the scope of products equipped with the econavi function, which uses sensor technology etc. to
detect wasteful electricity and cut down consumption automatically. moreover, actions are being taken to expand the
use of recycled resources in our pursuit of recycle-oriented manufacturing, such as through the launch of resources
recycling-oriented products which use recycled resources.

environmental action plan “green plan 2018”
after the completion of the green plan 2010 which was established in 2001, the green plan 2018 was established in 2010
to clarify our targets for fiscal 2019 (from april 1, 2018 to march 31, 2019) and actions to be taken in order to achieve the
targets. furthermore, the green plan 2018 was revised in july 2013, followed by the newly-established environmental
action guideline.

the green plan 2018 will continue our initiatives in five areas: mainly co2 reduction and resources recycling, and water,
chemical substances, and biodiversity. we are focusing on maximizing the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions,
which is an indicator that represents our efforts for co2 reduction, to contribute to making net co2 emissions from the
international community peak and decline thereafter at an earlier timing. as for resources recycling, we promote higher
recycled resource utilization ratio and factory waste recycling rate, as well as create more resources recycling-oriented
products to materialize recycling-oriented manufacturing. in addition, with respect to eco-conscious products and
businesses, we will expand the range of activities to products, services, and solutions in the btob sector while keeping
strengths in the home appliances field, to provide products and services that create environmental value for our customers.
panasonic will deepen the collaboration with various partners across the supply chain and accelerate environmental
initiatives to extend better impacts on the society.

  would have been emitted without the improvements by the energy-saving performance of our products and productivity from fiscal 2006, and
  this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation by energy-creating products. (see pages 43-44)

environment: special feature—globalization of the
housing business

panahome corporation

business expansion in malaysia
in a drive to expand its housing business,
panahome corporation built its first
detached-type show house outside japan
(under southeast asian specifications) in
malaysia’s capital, kuala lumpur in march
2013. the show house is operated as a
panasonic group sales center for all-round
housing proposals to prospective buyers, to
resolve housing-related issues in malaysia as
well as to offer a healthy, comfortable, and
eco-conscious living.

learning about problems of local customers
panahome participated in the international greentech & ecoproducts exhibition & conferences malaysia (igem), the largest
environmental exhibition in southeast asia, in 2011 and 2012, to pave the way for its business operations in malaysia. local
consumers were interviewed on the problems and inconveniences they face in their lifestyles and in the houses they live in.

various other field surveys were conducted to fully investigate the housing problems in malaysia.

in malaysia, houses are usually made of bricks and hence take a long time to build. at the same time, insulation is poor,
resulting in huge power consumption from air conditioning overuse. health concerns were also mentioned, such as dust
particles from forests and fields burned in neighboring countries and flow of exhaust and other pollutants from motor
vehicles and factories. in view of such circumstances, the show house, built with construction methods cultivated in
japan over a span of fifty years, offers a range of environmental technology applications. these include exterior walls with
internal thermal insulation, insulation
utilizing geothermal energy, insulation
technology for walls and roofs,
ventilation equipment for controlling
polluted air, windows with multilayered
insulating glass, and photocatalytic
tiles, as well as solar panels for
creating energy and home appliances

president toshiro baba of panahome malaysia sdn bhd, which manages the
show house says, “we hope to solve the problems of our customers in malaysia
through home-building from the perspective upheld by our founder, kounosuke
matsushita, of what represents a superior house for its dwellers.”

business expansion from home-building to town development
in addition to home-building in malaysia, panahome is expanding its business into the development of smart cities. based
on its expertise accumulated in japan with fujisawa sustainable smart town (fujisawa city, kanagawa prefecture), smart
city shioashiya (ashiya city, hyogo prefecture), and smart city kusatsu (kusatsu city, shiga prefecture)(see page 53), the
company is planning a development project at an ocean-side resort named kuantan, approx. 200 km from kuala lumpur.
in cooperation with partner business enterprises, panahome is participating from the land development stage to home-
building, aiming to create a town harmonized with the environment.

as in previous smart city projects, the company plans to install “cool tubes” utilizing geothermal energy, photocatalytic tiles,
and energy-saving home appliances and equipment in each home in kuantan, as well as photovoltaic power generation
panels and led street lamps in common spaces, from the aspects of eco-consciousness. for safety and security, security
systems covering the entire town and gated community development are also being scheduled to ensure higher security.

panahome hopes to work on the
continuing improvement of residential
environment quality—from home-
building to town development—based
on its work in malaysia, for consumers
in various other southeast asian
countries.

(hevs) as well as vehicles employing idle-stop systems in the pursuit of improved fuel economy. however, because idle-
stop systems depend on a single lead-acid battery to take care of all electrical needs of the vehicle, from restarting the
engine to running the air-conditioner and other electrical components with the engine off, the battery is in frequent use. the
12v energy recovery system was developed for higher functionality of idle-stop systems, including better fuel economy
and longer service life of the main lead-acid battery.

this system allows the energy generated during braking to be stored in the batteries and use the stored energy to power
the vehicle’s electrical components. based on our unique technology accumulated in the development of batteries for
hevs, the new battery cells offer higher charging efficiency and durability under high temperatures. this increases flexibility
in the installation of the system, as it can be placed in the engine compartment.


better fuel efficiency by supplying recovered energy to electrical components
the 12v energy recovery system for idle-stop vehicles converts deceleration energy into electrical energy so that it is able
to reduce the need of power generation by the gasoline engine. this system is designed to complement the performance
of main lead-acid battery by supplying power to the vehicle’s electrical components, thus increasing the functionality of
idle-stop systems and improving fuel economy.

fits to existing systems without the use of a transformer
installable in the engine compartment
the 12v energy recovery system, which is designed to be connected in parallel with
the main lead-acid battery, has the same 12v voltage as the main battery. unlike
some systems that require a transformer to regulate voltage, depending on the type of
batteries used, our 12v system uses ten 1.2v ni-mh battery cells, eliminating the need
for voltage transformation. this helps lower the system costs and use energy more
efficiently.
                                                                                              ni-mh battery cell for automobiles
while the main lead-acid battery is often placed in the engine compartment, the
temperature inside the engine compartment becomes high, requiring batteries to have strong durability. using technology
acquired in developing hev batteries, we improved the battery design, such as the polar plates, electrolytic solution, and
other battery parts, to increase charging efficiency and improve durability in high temperature environments. as a result,
the cell’s maximum charging/discharging temperature has significantly improved from 60°c to 75°c*1 compared to existing
cells. this enables installation in the engine compartment, and provides a high degree of design flexibility for the system’s
installation.

contribution to longer life of the main lead-acid battery
idle-stop systems depend on the main battery to power the air-conditioner and other electrical components of the vehicle
when the vehicle is in idle-stop mode with the engine off. the battery is in frequent use because the engine is repeatedly
turned on and off. when the 12v energy recovery system is connected in parallel with the lead-acid battery, the current
flows preferentially to the ni-mh battery with a smaller battery resistance, lessening the load on the lead-acid battery.

tests conducted by panasonic, using a 12v energy recovery system together with a lead-acid battery, have confirmed
that the service life of the main battery was extended by approximately six times*2 compared to when a lead battery was
used alone.

environment: eco-conscious products and factories

initiatives for eco-conscious products (green products)
panasonic uses a product assessment system that evaluates the environmental impacts of our products and services
starting at the planning and design stages. based on our criteria, we accredit our products and services that achieved high
environmental performance as green products (gps). at the same time, starting in fiscal 2014, the existing superior gps*1
has been enhanced to designate products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society as strategic
gps. of these products, products that particularly create new consumer trends are certified as super gps.

in the gp accreditation criteria, we assess the performance of our products in terms of prevention of global warming,
effective utilization of resources, and management of chemical substances by comparing not only among our own products
but also with competitors’ products. in fiscal 2012, we took steps to further enhance our accreditation criteria by adding
biodiversity and water conservation to existing items. this has in turn enabled the creation of a wider range of gps.

expanding the scope of strategic gps
panasonic has been devoting much of its energies into the creation of no. 1 eco-conscious products (superior gps) until
fiscal 2013. in the course of business reorganizations such as expansion of btob businesses, panasonic has decided not
only to pursue environmental performance of consumer products but also to work on further expansion of products and
services that lead to the mitigation of environmental impact. starting in fiscal 2014, the concept of strategic gps has been
introduced for the creation of such products and services. in addition to alleviating impact on the global environment with
top-level environmental performance, we aim to accelerate the drive to shift to a sustainable society through a variety of
business operations, including those that are expected to reduce impacts through wider dissemination and those directly
cutting impact in specified regions. the ratio of strategic gps in fiscal 2014 sales had been approx. 22%. we will work to
further push up this ratio in the future.

of the strategic gps, the following three were named super gps for fiscal 2014–namely, cfc-free freezer system, for
its environmental performance ranking at the top class in the industry, casart eco cordis, a detached house that is
able to cut down environmental impact dramatically, and f-vxj90c air purifier for china for its support in dealing with
environmental impact in china.

the cfc-free freezer system succeeded in using co2, which has a smaller impact on global warming and the ozone layer
than cfc (see page 82). casart eco cordis has succeeded in creating a net-zero energy house (zeh), which is
expected to be promoted widely especially in japan (see page 53).

the f-vxj90c air purifier supports the comfort and security of everyday living in china where
air pollution has become a serious social issue, by improving the indoor air quality. specifically,
the hepa dust collector & filter is used to remove microparticles included in pm 2.5. at the same
time, its econavi function (see page 45) and other features have realized industry’s top-class
energy-saving performance. in the future, we plan to further offer air purifiers such as f-vxj90c
not only in china but also in other regions that require support and countermeasures for air
pollution resulting from rapid economic growth.

initiatives for eco-conscious factories (green factories)
panasonic is working on green factories (gf) activities in its efforts to cut down environmental impact in manufacturing
at all of its factories worldwide while contributing to business management. specifically, each factory develops a plan
for environmental impact reduction in production activities, focusing on co2 emissions, total waste generation, water
consumption, and chemical substance releases and transfers, and is engaged in its implementation, progress management,
and improvement.

the gf assessment system was introduced in fiscal 2011 to further improve the standard of measures implemented across
our factories. under the system, the factories evaluate themselves on a one-to-five scale across 19 environmental activity
items classified into six basic groups of emissions reduction, environmental performance enhancement, reduction activities,
risk reduction, hr development, and management, and visualize the progress to address issues and make improvements.
in fiscal 2014, the system was upgraded to enable each company to assess itself from its own unique perspective,
allowing the addition of items based on the company’s needs to the 19 gf assessment items. in addition, case studies
on reductions implemented at factories are registered in the before/after (ba) chart search system, which is updated for
application in other factories. presently, more than 2,300 cases are registered.

other gf promotion activities include the establishment of sessions for information exchanges among factories within
each country, extending beyond factory self-assessment, as well as human resource development and activities focused
on their respective regional issues. through the manufacturing environmental information sharing group, information
on global activities for environmental impact reduction, legislation, and social trends are shred, discussions are held to
resolve issues in gf promotion. outside japan, information exchanges are being promoted within each country or region
where panasonic factories are located, such as in europe, southeast asia, and china. especially in southeast asia, where
there are many panasonic plants and diverse legislative frameworks and issues that vary by country, competitions of
best practices for environmental impact reduction (presentation of awards to best practices and activities for horizontal
promotion) for all factories in the region is held. in addition, information exchange within each country is being promoted to
boost and accelerate actions in this direction.

furthermore, in order to support these gf activities, respective regional headquarters, company, and related functional
divisions in each region are working on various human resource development programs every year in their respective
regions. training programs are being organized, including those on energy conservation, management of chemical
substances, and waste management, which are in great demand in china and southeast asia where panasonic has
many sites. special training programs on environmental laws and regulations are being held especially in china, to ensure
compliance with the legislation being strengthened at great speed.

advanced examples of eco-conscious factories
kasugai factory of panasonic ecology systems co., ltd., integrated its production
sites in april 2007 and renovated itself into an energy-saving plant. by (1) introducing
insulation-oriented factory building, photovoltaic power generation, and air-
conditioning system using ground heat; (2) developing improved coordination of
power supply equipment and production processes through visualization of energy
use; and (3) a resin forming process, forming of efficient cooling water pipes was
enabled, which led to adopting a laser metal sintered mold that can dramatically
reduce cooling time. as a result of these efforts, energy consumption was cut                  kasugai factory, panasonic ecology
by 31% (2,550 kl in crude oil) from fiscal 2008 to 2013. additionally, the energy              systems co., ltd.

conservation expertise within the factory has been showcased and shared in the
eco visualization room. by making the showroom open to the public at large, it has
stimulated greater eco-consciousness among the employees and contributed to the
growth of energy-saving activities in society.

at the kobe plant of the appliances company, significant energy saving was
realized through improvements in the assembly process for the top unit of an ih
cooking heater. specifically, adhesion of glass, stainless frame, and zinc-plated steel
plates of the top unit conventionally required heating in a high-temperature furnace
for curing after application of adhesive. however, development of room-temperature
curing adhesives and improvements in various processes such as glass treatment
before adhesion, have made assembly without the heating process possible. as a
result, electric power consumption was cut by 96% (approx. 310,000 kwh/year) and
                                                                                                 ih cooking heater manufactured at kobe
co2 emissions reduced from 136 tons to 6 tons per year in the assembly process.                  plant appliances company

the achievements of these two factories were recognized, and were awarded
the fiscal 2014 energy conservation grand prize for the energy-saving activities
category. panasonic won two more awards in the product and business model
category as well.

environment: co2 reduction

size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
one of the long-term environmental targets set by the international community is to reduce emissions of co2 and other
ghgs by 50% from the 2005 level by the year 2050. to achieve this, co2 emissions should “peak out” (reach a peak
and decline thereafter) during the period from 2020 to 2030. with this background, companies are asked to contribute to
reducing co2 more than ever.

panasonic has introduced a unique indicator “size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions” to accelerate emissions
reduction, targeting both our products (for energy saving and energy creation) and production activities. the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the
amount that would have been emitted without the improvements by the energy-saving performance of our products and
productivity from fiscal 2006, and this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation by
energy-creating products. in other words, it reflects the continuous efforts being made to reduce co2 emissions. panasonic
will continue to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions.



we will improve the energy-saving performance of our products to reduce the energy consumed in using the products.
the more energy-saving products are introduced and promoted, the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions will
further increase.

lining insulation panels for easy home renovation
renovating the home for better heat insulation not only lowers
the room temperature and enhances comfort but also saves
energy by reducing the load on air-conditioning systems. our
proposals of insulation panels can be installed simply by lining
existing floors, walls, and ceiling with the panels. in contrast to
a conventional insulation method where walls are opened and
filled with insulation material inside, these panels do not require
large-scale work and reduces the time necessary for installation.
in addition, the insulation panels use vacuum insulation material
used in refrigerators and other devices, achieving an insulation
                                                                                                            insulation panel lining for walls
capability equal to a 200-mm-thick conventional glass wool

photovoltaic power generation system
photovoltaic power is generated by transforming solar light energy into electricity
by semiconductors. the amount of power generation depends on season, weather,
and time, but unlike thermal power generation in which fossil fuels are burned to
generate electricity, no co2, exhaust gas, or ash is emitted during photovoltaic
power generation.

our solar module hit™ *13 used in this photovoltaic power generation system
has the industry’s top-level real power output,*14 owing to its outstanding power
generation efficiency and resistance to heat.                                                              hit™ delivered to the new offices of the

our hit™ were delivered to the new offices of the german federal environment
agency which opened on august 30, 2013. the new office building is built in
accordance with article 9 of the eu directive on the energy performance of buildings, which stipulates that buildings
owned by public organizations and agencies must become nearly-zero energy buildings (buildings that hardly consume any
energy) by 2019. due to the rigorous requirement to generate more than about 46,000 kwh annually with solar modules
with the limited rooftop space, the high-efficiency, high-quality hit™ was chosen. the 281 hit™ installed on the rooftop
provide a total capacity of 70 kw.

household fuel cell cogeneration system
fuel cell cogeneration systems provide high-power energy efficiency and
conservation by generating electricity through an electrochemical reaction between
oxygen in the atmosphere and hydrogen extracted from town gas, and can heat
water with the heat generated from the reaction at the same time.

in may 2009, we launched our household fuel cell cogeneration system named ene-
farm in partnership with domestic gas companies to lead the world in bringing fuel
cell cogeneration technology into the home for residential use. by the end of march
2014, we shipped a total of approx. 38,000 units.

additionally, in cooperation with tokyo gas co., ltd., panasonic developed the
ene-farm home fuel cell for apartments in fiscal 2014, in the drive to promote
wider dissemination in urban areas. the product was designed for apartment                   image of a fuel cell installed inside an

buildings that have stricter installation requirements compared to detached houses.
installation into the pipe shaft on the open corridor side*15 was made possible by
increasing the airtightness of the unit itself. also, seismic resistance was improved by reinforcing the legs that anchor the
unit to comply with apartment installation standards. at the same time, wind resistance for operation even in strong wind
conditions was improved with changes in the exhaust structure, enabling installation on upper floors of the building.

compared to hot water supply through electric power from thermal power stations and a town-gas water heater,*16 this
system reduces co2 emissions by roughly 49% and primary energy consumption by approx. 37% when operating at a
rated power generation level.*17 annual electric power and heating expenses in a model case can be reduced by roughly
30,000 to 40,000 yen, and annual co2 emissions can be cut down by roughly 1 ton.*18 the effort extends beyond japan,
with the joint development of a household fuel cell cogeneration system for the european market with viessman group
and its launch in germany in april 2014. this will be the first commercial launch in europe for a household fuel cell system
employing polymer electrolyte fuel cells (pefc).

initiatives for energy-storing products
energy-storing products such as lithium-ion batteries can be used in various situations for electric power storage and
contribute to co2 reduction through installation in offices, homes, electric vehicles (evs), etc. panasonic is actively engaged
in the development of energy-storing products.


lithium-ion storage battery system
an energy-storing system is a device for supplying stored energy when necessary, and plays
an important role in ensuring stable use of power generated with recyclable energies such
as photovoltaic power generation systems. in recent years, energy-storing systems have
been in great demand with the rise in awareness toward energy conservation as well as in
business continuity planning (bcp) activities. however, installation of these systems has
faced issues such as pricing, capacity, and installation space.

batteries for ev
spurred by rising awareness of protecting the global environment such as preventing air pollution,
panasonic is strengthening development and commercialization of rechargeable batteries for eco-
cars, the demand for which is expected to grow rapidly in the future. panasonic has been supplying
lithium-ion cells for tesla models, starting with the luxury roadster sports car and currently for the
luxury sedan ev, model s. joint development with tesla motors is also presently underway for
next-generation ev lithium-ion battery cells.

the cells used for model s have been designed optimally for the quality and life required for ev
applications, based on industry’s top-level *23 energy density and performance realized with our

environment: energy solutions

for a zero-energy and zero-co2 life
while people try to realize a higher standard of living, the increase of co2 emissions from households is becoming
a concern. as a company that provides a range of products deeply rooted in people’s lives, panasonic works to
comprehensively reduce co2 emissions from stand-alone home appliances to the whole house itself, with the four concepts
of “saving energy,” “creating energy,” “storing energy,” and “managing energy.” first, we reduce energy consumption of
the whole house by increasing the energy efficiency through reduction of power consumption of appliances during use
and higher insulation efficiency of the house itself. energy yet necessary even after saving is covered by combining energy
created by photovoltaic power generation and fuel cells with energy stored by household lithium-ion accumulator batteries.
through an energy management system which links appliances and equipment that controls energy overall, we can have
virtually zero co2 emissions.

to date, we have developed a range of energy management products and introduced them to the market. these products
include the energy creation-storage linked system, which enables smart utilization of electricity by linking a photovoltaic
power generator with storage batteries, and smart hems—a home energy management system. smart hems has
been particularly praised for its capability to visualize electricity usage through a monitor as well as its automatic control
functions over electric appliances to save energy. smart hems bundled with aiseg (mkn7321he and mkn7322he)
released on october 21, 2012, achieved more than 40,000 sales in total in fiscal 2014.

further, in order to increase the penetration of hems in the market towards the realization of a smart grid society, we
developed smart cosmo, a power distribution board that plays a central role in power distribution and information
management in the home and is capable of supporting various functions for future scalability. this new product became
available from may 21, 2014. in addition to visualizing energy usage in the home including electricity, gas, and water, smart
cosmo offers a safe and comfortable lifestyle for users through new services, such as life support or encouraging energy
saving, created by utilizing energy data measured in the home. because smart cosmo is designed to fit with various
changes in the environment and services in the future smart grid society, it not only supports installation of photovoltaic
power generation systems, household fuel cell cogeneration systems, and our energy creation-storage linked system at
the time of house construction, it also allows adding equipment in later years simply by installing necessary measurement
devices in the distribution board, reducing required work and space. further, smart cosmo will also be compatible with
demand response control as well as adjustments for cutting or shifting the peak demand considered for introduction by
power companies, by linking to a smart meter. this will enable contributing to a stable electricity demand/supply balance
and prevention of large-scale blackouts.

we also introduced casart eco cordis, a net-zero energy house (zeh),
to the market in fiscal 2014. the house is equipped with a full-pv roof, born
from pursuing the functionality that makes the best of naturally-available energy
and advanced design. the entire roof is composed of solar cell panels that can
generate more than 10 kw of power. the house also utilizes geothermal heat,
which is cooler than the external air in the summer and warmer during the winter,
in combination with improved heat insulation in order to reduce the energy load
                                                                                          appearance of casart eco cordis
for air conditioning. the hybrid ventilation system with econavi installed in the
house takes in the clean air under the floor and automatically controls the interior
air flow. the entire energy saving performance of the house was also improved by carefully designing the house layout with
large eaves that give less heat loss, and wide opening windows that maximize the natural light and breeze. net-zero energy
consumption is enabled by a building design that reduces energy usage and a roof that creates energy. the house also
brings financial benefits by enabling the residents to sell excess energy to power companies. it is possible to make around
10 million yen-worth income over 20 years, depending on conditions, utilizing the feed-in tariff scheme for renewable
energy. this house realizes a lifestyle that is beneficial to the earth and to people’s finances.


for a sustainable town
in panahome smart city shioashiya (also named sorashima) in ashiya, hyogo
prefecture, japan, with a total of 500 households including both houses and
apartments, panasonic realizes japan’s first*1 net-zero energy town. this
will be achieved by smart houses that have a high self-sufficiency rate of
energy through a variety of advanced facilities, including a photovoltaic power
generation system and the panasonic energy creation-storage linked system, as
well as excellent insulation performance owing to its efficient building structure.
another contributor to the net-zero energy town is parknade shioashiya, an
                                                                                          smart apartment, parknade shioashiya
apartment block where each of the 83 households are fully equipped with a
solar generation system and a household fuel cell ene-farm—a first in japan.*2
sales of the houses commenced in july 2012, and the apartments were made available from september 2013.

panahome smart city kusatsu is another net-zero energy town, located in kusatsu city, shiga prefecture. all 87 houses
are smart houses, casart eco cordis, equipped with high-capacity photovoltaic power generation systems and
enabling the town to be self-sufficient in energy. the sales of the first block started on september 14, 2013.

panasonic also promotes the fujisawa sustainable smart town (fujisawa sst).
fujisawa sst is a large-scale development project being built on our previous
factory site located in fujisawa city, kanagawa prefecture. the premises, with
an area of approximately 19 ha, include some 1,000 dwellings, commercial
properties, and healthcare, welfare, and educational facilities. the town is
expected to be completed in fiscal 2019. to lead the sustainable development
of the town, a town management company, fujisawa sst management
company, was established. the company maintains the town together with
                                                                                     bird’s eye view of fujisawa sst
a next-generation autonomous organization, the fujisawa sst committee.
each of the detached houses built in the first block is equipped with the energy
creation-storage linked system and this was the first case in japan for a large-
scale development project. the system not only realizes zero co2 emissions
in these houses but enables power supply in the event of power cut. in order
to realize an eco-conscious, comfortable, safe, and secure life, the town has
set its environmental targets as follows: (1) reduction of co2 emissions by
70% (compared to 1990); (2) reduction of water usage by 30% (compared
to 2006); (3) renewable energy usage rate of at least 30%; and (4) ensuring a
3-day lifeline. in september 2013, fujisawa sst was certified as a housing/          detached houses in fujisawa sst available for
                                                                                     sale
buildings co2 reduction leading project, subsidized by the ministry of land,
infrastructure, transport and tourism, and also as a co2 emissions reduction project to increase the low-carbon value
by the ministry of the environment in december 2013. the sales of the first block of detached houses commenced on
february 15, 2014.



                                                                53

in china, we are participating in the town planning of the dalian best-city. based on an effective energy-saving
approach, we designed interior and living spaces for apartments, and proposed a range of energy-saving products,
including kitchen equipment, air conditioners, ventilation systems, and flat-screen tvs. through networking the appliances
together, we also implemented energy visualization in conjunction with use of hems. further, we have developed
technology that incorporates visualization of air quality into hems. air quality is assessed by temperature-humidity sensors
and co2 sensors installed in major rooms. based on the measured humidity and co2 amount, the equipment automatically
starts humidity control or suggests ventilation.

in singapore in january 2013, we began participating in a year-long field-trial project of total energy solutions. the project
took place in public housing apartments in punggol under a partnership with local government agencies. the trial resulted
in the achievement of at least 20% energy saving on average across 10 households who took part in the project by using a
panasonic air conditioner with the econavi (see page 45) function and hems. further, our hit™ photovoltaic generation
system (40 kwp) installed on the building’s roof supplied power for lighting in common areas and elevators, reducing the
electricity consumption of the entire building. this realized near zero energy for the common areas. the trial also proved
that the panasonic lithium-ion storage battery system can operate the elevators during a power cut. we will continue our
collaboration with governmental agencies for business expansion of these solutions.

environment: global warming prevention at factories and offices

contribution in reducing co2 emissions through production activities
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in factories with the aim of contributing to global warming prevention as
well as improving production efficiency in factories and reducing energy costs.

in fiscal 2008, we set a company-wide business goal to reduce co2 emissions by 0.3 million tons in fiscal 2010 compared
to fiscal 2007. as a result of our unified efforts, we achieved 0.84 million tons in co2 emissions reduction, surpassing our
target figure. since fiscal 2011, we have been using our unique indicator, the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
(see pages 43-44), to further improve our energy management capabilities and reduce the co2 emissions per basic unit,
aiming towards maximizing the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities. in addition to
individual efforts implemented in each factory, energy-saving and co2 emission reduction measures including horizontal
introduction of good examples across the company, specialist training, and co2 itakona initiatives *1 are promoted.
the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities achieved in fiscal 2014 was 2.76 million tons
(compared with the fiscal 2006 level). the co2 emissions per basic unit in fiscal 2014 decreased from the previous fiscal
year due to reduced production influenced by structural reforms.

we also take part in the keidanren’s commitment to a low carbon society, a voluntary action plan for global warming
prevention targeted at 2020. specifically, we commit to achieving the goals set by the electrical and electronics industry in
japan that aims “improvement in energy consumption rate in factories and large offices at an annual rate of 1% on average
towards 2020.” we ensure that we will achieve this goal by steadily continuing energy-saving activities and co2 emissions
reduction in factories and offices, as well as enhancing our range of low-carbon products and services, and contribute to
reducing co2 emissions in the entire society.
*1 itakona is a term unique to panasonic which refers to a process by which we review stages prior to production to study raw materials to
  ensure waste is minimized and quality is maintained. we apply a similar review process for our co2 emissions reduction efforts and call these our
  co2 itakona initiatives. the activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation measures from a new viewpoint through continuous display of
  energy consumption levels (energy consumption per basic unit), and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit.

*2 calculated with the weighted average of the improvement rate for co2 emissions per basic unit of nominal production for each factory. the
  amount of co2 emitted from each factory was used for weighting cases that had no improvements. basic unit of fiscal 2006 was converted into
  an index as 100.
*3 increase in co2 emissions per basic unit in fiscal 2012, 2013, and 2014 is due to the decline in production volume.

  ministry of the environment. the co2 emission factor for electricity purchased in japan (kg-co2/kwh) is fixed at 0.410. if the factors set for
  each fiscal year are used instead (0.425 for fiscal 2006, 0.350 for fiscal 2011, 0.476 for fiscal 2012, and 0.487 for fiscal 2013 and 2014), total co2
  emissions will be 4.63 million tons for fiscal 2006, 3.74 million tons for fiscal 2011, 3.81 million tons for fiscal 2012, 3.35 million tons for fiscal
  2013, and 3.12 million tons for fiscal 2014. the factors above are also used for electricity purchased from power producers and suppliers (pps).
  the ghg protocol factors for each country are used for electricity purchased outside japan.

reduction effects. to date, we have introduced more
than 40,000 measurement systems and factory
energy management systems (fems) at all of our
global manufacturing sites, and we have continued to
promote our co2 metageji *5 initiative.

based on this scheme, the co2 itakona initiative                                minimum energy consumption per basic unit
has been implemented since fiscal 2011. the
activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation                                                                  time

measures from a new viewpoint through continuous
display of energy consumption per basic unit of production, and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each
basic unit.

in order to accelerate action under the co2 itakona initiative, we developed the se-navi software that displays energy
and production data simultaneously and analyze energy consumption per basic unit. in fiscal 2014, we enhanced the
“energy-saving navigation function” to enable quantitatively extracting energy loss per device as well as energy loss per
factor based on the automatic energy loss analysis results through co2 itakona analysis. with this function, energy-
saving efforts prioritizing processes with large energy loss have been made easier. this function will become commercially
available in the public market in 2014 (see page 59).

conventionally, energy consumption and other data had been analyzed manually by specialists in order to develop energy
conservation measures. this function automatically analyzes data and enables users to consider energy conservation
measures based on the energy-saving measure database. not only did this contribute to a reduction in working time but
also to the identification of energy-saving measures without the assistance of specialists in fiscal 2014 we expanded the
energy-saving navigation function to our sites outside japan. the employees at a refrigerator factory in wuxi, china, actively
implemented energy-saving activities utilizing this function mainly in processes with large energy consumption such as the
sheet extrusion process, resulting in an improvement by 5% in specific energy consumption / energy volume per basic unit.



                                                                             56

we will disseminate the usage of the above-mentioned functions of determining energy loss per device or factor into
frontline workplaces and further promote efficient energy-saving activities and enhance the effects.
*5 metageji is a term unique to panasonic which refers to visualizing energy consumption and implementing measurable reduction initiatives by
  introducing measurement instruments, such as meters and gauges.

environment: business of factory energy conservation support service

environmental support for the entire factory
panasonic launched its factory energy conservation
                                                                   image of our total environmental package solutions

reducing co2 emissions in production activities in the
three years of fiscal 2008–2010. this service provides
all-round support in energy-saving activities at factories,
from visualization of energy use and energy conservation
diagnoses to execution of concrete energy-saving
measures, comprehensively covering the aspects of
technology, equipment, human resources, and finance.

as part of this service, we developed se-navi, a
condensed system containing our energy management
expertise and know-how to visualize energy consumption
at factories. this system identifies the level of energy

this system also provides graphic displays of long-
term efficiency fluctuations for equipment, including
compressors, boilers, and freezers, to identify equipment deterioration and necessary maintenance—all of which serve to
reduce wasted energy consumption. furthermore, in fiscal 2014, the output unit automatically calculated from production
output and energy consumption level was diagnosed and assessed using our own unique energy-saving determination
method for the development of the “energy-saving navigation” function, which identifies problems in manufacturing lines
and facilities on a timely basis. this automatically identifies the source of energy loss. with such losses expressed in
numerical terms, the points requiring energy conservation can be easily identified. this function was launched in june 2014.

we have created a packaged service of technologies, knowledge, and experience related to the environment cultivated
within our group in the form of total environmental package solutions for entire factories. this offers a total solution,
covering not only energy conservation but also environmental and energy technologies in effluent treatment and water
recycling, exhaust treatment, resources recycling, soil and groundwater purification, and photovoltaic power generation,
contributing to the comprehensive environmental actions being undertaken by enterprises outside panasonic.

energy conservation support for tdk ugo corporation
panasonic has been providing continuous support to tdk ugo corporation for its
factory energy-saving activities since fiscal 2012, catering to the company’s request
for uninterrupted energy conservation while maintaining stable operations. at their
ouchi plant, where we first started the service, we conducted an energy conservation
diagnosis, and proposed improvement in operation including optimization of settings
(tuning) as well as energy-saving measures such as use of inverters. in the tuning
activity for the clean room conducted at first, the temperature and ventilation frequency
were optimized (tuned) within the range allowing to maintain a level of cleanliness that   energy-saving tuning of tdk ugo
                                                                                           corporation equipment
would not impact production, while constantly checking the atmospheric environment
with temperature/humidity meters installed inside the clean room. this led to an
approx. 3% reduction in electric power consumption across the entire factory in fiscal 2012, without additional facility
investment. for energy-saving measures that require capital spending, such as air conditioning system updates and use
of pump inverters, we proposed a solution combined with tuning so as to achieve higher investment efficiency. in the
future, we will provide comprehensive support to the company’s energy-saving activities, including specific measures for
production facilities.


  customer comment (tdk ugo corporation)
  as the cutting edge energy-saving factory representing tdk ugo corporation, the ouchi plant has been working
  on greater energy visibility and other energy conservation measures from the design stage. with demand to save
  electricity after the great earthquake disaster, however, even greater conservation became essential. for this reason,
  we decided to collaborate with outside experts to work on electric power reduction efforts, even reaching into
  production conditions of our products. in particular, panasonic offered a practical approach of gradually changing
  the manufacturing environment without stopping the 24/7 plant operation. this led to concerted action by the plant,
  the safety and environment office at the tdk head office, and panasonic, which enabled implementation of energy
  conservation with confidence.

environment: green logistics

reducing co2 emissions in logistics
to contribute to the prevention of global warming as well as to improve transportation efficiency while reducing costs,
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in logistics. we have set the targets of reducing co2 emissions per basic
unit *1 by at least 1% year-on-year, and by 46% from the fiscal 2006 level by fiscal 2019, focusing on modal shift, introduction
of low-emission vehicles and biodiesel fuel, reduction in transportation distances, and improvement in load factor.

in fiscal 2014, our global co2 emissions from logistics activities came to 0.81 million tons across the world, of which
international transportation was 0.36 million tons (44%), and domestic transportation within japan was 0.15 million tons
(19%). due to the efforts described above, co2 emissions per basic unit *1 were reduced by 8% from the previous fiscal
year, and by 40% from fiscal 2006.
*1 co2 emissions per transportation weight; the scope covers both international and domestic transportation.

collaboration with logistics partners
we are working to increase transportation efficiency in collaboration with our logistics partners. in fiscal 2014, we formed
a joint scheme with local logistic operators as a part of our efforts in secondary transport *2 within japan. specifically, we
outsourced secondary transport, which was conventionally conducted in-house, to local logistic operators. this aims to
improve load factor and reduce co2 emissions by having our products transported together with other consignments that
the operators regularly transport. as a part of this partnership support, we offered the logistics operators an it system that
we developed to help improve the efficiency of transportation to stores. these efforts resulted in an annual co2 emissions
reduction of 2,181 tons.
*2 transportation of panasonic products from a distribution center to stores such as dealers in each region.



modal shift *3 initiatives
panasonic promotes modal shift in transportation from trucks to railroad
in order to reduce co2 emissions. our railroad freight transportation
within japan in fiscal 2014 totaled 15,859 five-ton containers, which
resulted in 7,705 tons of co2 emissions reduction.

for example, imported air conditioners to be sold in the north of japan
were conventionally transported to tokyo port by ship and then to
sendai by truck. in fiscal 2014, this system was partially changed
so that some of the products were shipped directly to the nearest
port, sendai port. although there was an issue that transportation
took longer than before, it was overcome by combining this with the
                                                                                             handmade battery class in collaboration with mlit
transportation method of unloading the ship at tokyo port and then
using railroad freight to sendai.

in addition, our active efforts in promoting modal shift were recognized, and the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport
and tourism (mlit) newly certified eneloop to bear the eco rail mark *4. this made a total of eight panasonic products
eco rail mark certified. in september 2013, our eco rail mark-certified energy device business division and mlit jointly
promoted the eco rail mark and eco-conscious logistics for higher awareness, in a panasonic handmade battery class
which was held for about fifty 5th-grade students at a primary school in osaka city.
*3 switch from truck and air transport to railroad and sea vessel transport that has less environmental impact.
*4 a mark to identify businesses and products that use a certain level of railroad transportation with little impact on the environment.

recycling wooden shipping pallets used for transportation
as an effort to reduce logistics waste, we jointly entered            recycling scheme for wooden shipping pallet
into a full recycling scheme for used wooden shipping                 with eidai
pallets with eidai co., ltd. in fiscal 2014. wooden
shipping pallets used for our transport were previously
discarded, but they are now recycled as particle board
material by eidai, which we then purchase to use in our
construction products. we also started similar schemes                                          provides used wooden pallets
with other companies, thereby recycling 496 tons of used
wooden shipping pallets in total in fiscal 2014.                                  eidai                          panasonic

pallets are repaired for reuse. we reused 136 tons of such
second-hand wooden pallets in fiscal 2014.

we will continue to make effective use of the used
wooden shipping pallets and reduce logistics waste.

environment: resources recycling

recycling-oriented manufacturing
with swift economic growth advancing worldwide and bringing heightened attention to concerns over resources, the
sourcing of new resources and materials not only impact our global environment, but minerals resource depletion and
materials pricing run-up have also become big issues that impact company management.

to address these concerns, we selected resources recycling as an underlying theme along with co2 emissions reduction,
promoting our recycling-oriented manufacturing concept. under this concept, we minimize the amount of total resources
used and maximize the amount of recycled resources, aim towards zero waste emissions by reducing our final disposal of
waste from production activities, and recycle used products.

we have already been working to make our products lighter and smaller to reduce our total resources used, and we employ
new technologies that maximize the collection of recycled resources and expand the use of recycled resources. we also
look to eliminate the waste we send to landfills to as close to zero by reducing the waste generated at our factories and
promoting the use of recycled resources. in addition to our efforts to reuse resources and eliminate waste in production
processes, we have established a cycle that enables our customers to use products made from the resources collected
from used products. guided by these efforts, we will endeavor to contribute to a sustainable society while achieving
continuous business growth.

we use many kinds of resources, including iron (27% of total resources used) and plastic (10% of total resources used),
due to our wide range of products and businesses, from home appliances, components such as semiconductors and
batteries, to housing. in recycling-oriented manufacturing, it is important to promote the reduction of total resources used,
and at the same time develop a recycling process according to the specific characteristics of each resource for expansion
of our usage of recycled resources.

furthermore, we clarify recycled resource utilization issues by identifying the volume of each type of resource used across
the panasonic group. for example, in the case of recycled plastic, we used approx. 15,000 tons of recycled plastic in our
products in fiscal 2014 by identifying the characteristics required in the materials to be used, securing a stable supply,
researching how to recycle it in production, and developing new recycling technologies. by promoting the use of recycled
resources in products, a number of various products that incorporate recycled resources have been launched since 2012.

recycled resources increased in volume with growth of lumber use, as a result of demand for construction materials, etc.,
combined with increase in use of recycled plastics. as a result, the recycled resource utilization ratio *1 rose to 17.2%,
surpassing the 16% target for fiscal 2019. we plan to work on the further reduction of total resources used and maximum
utilization of recycled resources, to maintain and improve the recycled resource utilization ratio.

in addition, as for the recycling rate of waste at factories, we had traditionally set different targets for japan and countries
outside japan according to the relevant local infrastructures. however, with the recent global awareness of the importance
of zero waste emission activities, we have been taking steps to improve the standard level of waste recycling across the
entire group since fiscal 2011. the factory waste recycling rate *2 was 98.7% for fiscal 2014 against the target of 99.5% or
more in fiscal 2019. (see page 74)
*1 recycled resource utilization ratio = recycled resources used/total resources used
*2 factory waste recycling rate = amount of resources recycled/(amount of resources recycled + amount of final disposal)

environment: reduction in resources used

reducing product mass
to reduce the use of resources for production, we continuously look to reduce the weight of our products. we promote
resource-saving activities such as making our products thinner and lighter and using less components. our activities for
designing better recyclable products will gain speed, from the standpoint of further resource recycling in the future.

environment: recovery of resources


global initiatives for used product recycling
aiming toward the effective use of natural resources and the prevention of environmental pollution, a growing number
of recycling laws have been enacted in various countries throughout the world. examples include the home appliance
recycling law and the law for promotion of effective utilization of resources in japan, the weee directive in the
european union, and recycling laws in many states in the united states. in china as well, a similar law has been taking
effect since 2011. in addition to complying with relative laws in respective countries, we strive to establish the most efficient
recycling system in each country in view of its local recycling infrastructure.

europe
prior to the enforcement of the weee directive in europe in august 2005,
ecology net europe gmbh (ene) was established by panasonic in germany
in april of that year to build a high-quality and efficient recycling system in
cooperation with a number of outstanding recycling companies. in march 2013,
eleksa was established in wiesbaden as our site for collecting used electronic
products, in an effort to further increase collection volumes. in addition, jointly
with its recycling partners, ene has developed an efficient lcd panel cutting
method which leads to a significant reduction in disassembly time, and has filed                    ene’s own collection site eleksa established in
                                                                                                    germany

north america
following the start-up of the state recycling law in the state of minnesota in july 2007, we established electronic
manufacturers recycling management company, llc (mrm), jointly with toshiba corporation and sharp corporation in
september of the same year, and began recycling tvs, pcs, and other electronics. with collaborative ties to nine recycling
companies, each with a nationwide network, we are running a recycling program that covers the entire united states. at
more than 1,800 collection bases, panasonic collected approx. 20,000 tons *4 of used electronic products in 2013.

in september 2012, we joined in a program run by the us environmental protection agency aimed at optimizing recycling,
known as the sustainable material management challenge, and declared that 100% of used products collected will
be recycled by third-party certified recyclers within three years. as of the end of 2013, 100% of our recycling service
contractors have acquired third-party certification.

in canada, there are currently nine provinces with weee recycling programs corresponding to respective provincial weee
regulations. together with the industry, we are working towards standardization between provinces for managing weee.

china
the regulation for the management of recycling and disposal of waste
electrical and electronic products was enforced in january 2011. under this
regulation, we established a joint recycling company in hangzhou in november
2011 named panasonic dadi dowa summit recycling hangzhou co., ltd.,
with chinese and japanese companies, and its operation started in february
2014. this new company aims at becoming an advanced model for home
appliance recycling in china in accordance with the above regulations. utilizing
                                                                                  pdsh
the methods of advanced and practical technology and a contemporary control
system that have developed through our recycling business in japan for more
than a decade, the company engages in collecting and disassemblling used appliances as well as selling resources from
used appliances. through these businesses, the company will contribute to environmental conservation and the effective
use of resources in the country.


asia pacific
movement towards legislation governing recycling is being accelerated also in various asian countries.

in india, where a recycling law was enforced in may 2012, we have built a network of collection sites using brand shops
and authorized service centers. in addition, following the enforcement of relevant laws in australia in july 2012, we are
engaged in the recycling of tvs and pcs through an organization jointly established with major manufacturers as a part of
producer responsibility.

electronic waste laws are expected to be enforced in vietnam in the near future, and we are working in close liaison with
the government to form the foundation of an efficient recycling system by planning an industry-led trial waste collection
program.

similarly, we are continuing to talk with the governments and industrial sectors of malaysia, thailand, and indonesia, where
legislation is in discussion, towards having optimized law establishment in each respective country.


latin america
with the strengthening of environmental legislation in latin american countries, enforcement of recycling laws are being
considered and introduced.

in brazil, together with industrial associations, the retailing industry and the like, we are holding consultations with the
government on building a recycling system. we also actively take part in waste collection campaigns in major cities and
towns.

additionally, we are continuing discussions to realize optimum legislation in mexico, costa rica, peru, argentina, and chile.




                                                                       68

initiative to improve the home appliance recycling rate*5
coinciding with the act on recycling of specified kinds of home appliances (the home appliance recycling law) enforced
in april 2001, we started operation of petec in kato city, hyogo prefecture, and propelled recycling of four kinds of home
appliances under the concept of “product to product.” in april 2005, we commenced operations of peteck in inashiki
city, ibaragi prefecture, and cetec in yokkaichi city, mie prefecture, to increase the volume of resource recovery and
to improve the purity of recovered resources. our home appliances recycling rates have improved considerably over the
last 13 years since 2001; the recycling rate of air conditioners increased from 75% to 88%, crt tvs from 66% to 79%,
refrigerators and freezers from 57% to 78%, and washing machines and clothes dryers from 56% to 84%. the recycling
rate of flat televisions that became subject to law in fiscal 2010 was originally 60%, but improved to 86% in fiscal 2014.
these figures are significantly higher than the legally-specified recycling rate *6 for each appliance.

in order to achieve such substantial improvements in the recycling rate and further enhancing the same, we continue to
adopt and promote a range of measures, including developing new technology and introducing new processing lines and
facilities.

for example, in fiscal 2014 petec newly added a disassembly line compatible with tilted drum washing machines, which is
increasing each year. this has enabled both top-load fully automatic washing machines and tilted-drum washing machines
to be disassembled in the same processing line, thereby significantly improving work efficiency.

at peteck, an organic decomposition treatment equipment was introduced in march 2014. although it has conventionally
been difficult to sort parts and materials where the metal is glued with resin, such as copper pipes in air conditioners, the
equipment can thermally decompose such resin into non-toxic gas which is then removed, leaving only the metals to be
recovered. this improves the purity of the sorting process.

we are expecting to reach 20 million recycled home appliances in total in 2014 (petec processing a total of 11 million
appliances, peteck 5 million, and cetec 4 million). the total recovered resources would be equivalent to 430,000 cars’
worth of iron, copper equal to 200 statues of the great buddha of nara, and 250 airplanes’ worth of aluminum *7. we will
continue our recycling efforts, striving to achieve further increase in the volume of resource recovery and higher recycling
rates.
*5 home appliance recycling rate = valuable resource weight / total weight of used home appliances
*6 the legally-specified recycling rates for used home appliances are at least: 70% for air conditioners, 55% for crt tvs, 50% for lcd or plasma
  tvs, 60% for refrigerators and freezers, and 60% for washing machines and clothes dryers.
*7 base figures for the calculation are as follows: iron required for a car is 820 kg; copper required for the great buddha of nara is 250 tons; and
  aluminum required for an airplane is 115 tons.

petec is capable of sorting three major types of resins with different purposes
and properties—polypropylene (pp), polystyrene (ps), and acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene (abs)—from shredder residue of waste home appliances, with an
accuracy of at least 99%. this precision separation is realized by our original
near-infrared identification technology. conventionally, shredder residues were
generally discarded or used as fuel, however, this technology has enabled sorting
and recovering of single resins. the technology also detects specific hazardous
substances and removes them during sorting, which keeps the substance content                                   petec resin selection machine using near-

because no water is necessary for this sorting process and there is no need for
effluent treatment, it contributes to reducing environmental impact caused by
wastewater after the recycling process.

the recycled single resins sorted and recovered at petec are then transferred
to the adjacent kato plastic recycling factory to be washed and processed to
recover their chemical properties. kato plastic recycling factory is a manufacturing
and development site that demonstrates promotion of use of recycled resin at our
appliances company, a home appliance manufacturer and seller. the factory plays
an important role in enhancing recycled resin utilization by developing recycling
technologies, such as a more efficient method for cleaning recycled resins. recycled
resin is generally weaker in strength and has a shorter life than new resin. this is                            staff members at work
why its chemical properties have to be recovered to the level of new resin to make
them usable as materials and components in new products. different properties are
required for different resins. we have established techniques that make full use of
the properties optimal to each resin such as pp, ps, and abs, which include adding
antioxidants or mixing recycled and new resins.

use of pet bottle caps
panasonic participates in the ecocap movement.*1 in addition to the conventional ecocap collection activity, we started
a new ecocap movement from fiscal 2013, in which we utilize the collected pet bottle caps as a recycled resource for
our own products. the pet bottles discarded in our 100 business sites across japan are separated into bottles and caps.
the caps are recycled as plastic by our partner companies and we utilize it in the vegetable compartment ceiling in our
refrigerator.
*1 although the recycling of pet bottles is now well established, the caps tend to be discarded as trash. an npo, ecocap movement promotes cap
  recycling across japan. the organization collects pet bottle caps from homes, schools, and companies, and sells them to recycling companies.
  the profit made from the sales is donated to the japan committee for vaccines for the world’s children (jcv).

building a recycling scheme for scrap iron
jointly with tokyo steel co., ltd., we started a recycling scheme for scrap iron in july 2013. in this scheme, we recover the
scrap iron from used home appliances and tokyo steel makes it into steel sheets. we then purchase the sheets back as
a material for our products. supplying scrap iron for recycling and repurchasing the recycled iron is the first scheme of its
kind in the japanese electrical manufacturing industry.

                                     tokyo steel


specifically, scrap iron from home appliances collected and treated at petec is supplied to tokyo steel’s okayama plant,
where the scrap iron is processed into electric steel plates.*2 panasonic procures the recycled steel plates and utilizes
them in products. discussions with tokyo steel commenced in 2010, and we have worked together since then to improve
the quality of recycled iron to a level sufficient for production use, as well as developing the technology to improve the
applicability of the recycled iron. from this we identified the optimum application of the electric steel plates, and refined
its specific features (e.g. shape, strength, and weldability) to meet application-specific requirements. use of thin electric
steel plates in our products was first made possible in 2011. through this close collaboration, we materialized this recycling
scheme in 2013, a scheme where a home appliance recycling company that we own supplies scrap iron to be used to make
electric steel plates.

the amount of scrap iron we initially supplied to tokyo steel was about 50 tons per month. in march 2014, it reached over
100 tons, and the recycled steel is being used in our products, including washing machines and ceiling materials for housing.

the increase in electric steel plate usage leads to an increase in the usage of scrap iron, which is one of the most important
resources in japan. in addition, producing steel plates from scrap iron emits much less co2 compared with producing
steel plates from scratch. this scheme also stabilizes the procurement price, because the price of scrap iron supplied from
petec and the price of electric steel plates procured from tokyo steel are determined by the scrap iron fluctuation rate
agreed between the two companies. we will further expand this recycling scheme for more efficient resource utilization,
co2 emissions reduction, and stabilization of procurement prices.

environment: zero waste emissions from factories

improving factory waste recycling rate
waste generated at our factories is classified into: (1) recyclable waste (including those that can be sold and those which
can be transferred free of charge or by paying a fee), (2) waste that can be reduced by incineration or dehydration, and (3)
final disposal (waste with no option other than being sent to landfills). we reduce the emission of waste by boosting yield
in our production process and increasing the recycle rate of our waste materials. accordingly, we strive globally toward
achieving our zero waste emissions from factories *1 goal by reducing the amount of final disposal to nearly zero by
fiscal 2013.

although we strengthened our efforts in china, other asian countries, and europe, the rate in fiscal 2014 decreased to
98.7%, due to a new factory whose recycling scheme was still in the establishing process. we will continue our initiatives
to achieve the factory waste recycling rate target of 99.5% by fiscal 2019.

as a means to reduce the generation of waste, we are fostering resource-saving product design. in our production
activities, we are engaging in resource loss reduction, employing our own unique material flow analysis methods. we
consider materials that do not become products and excessive use of consumables as resource losses, and make the
material flow and lost values for each process visible in order to resolve the issues with the involvement of the design,
manufacturing, and other relevant business divisions. in the future, we will promote further reductions in resource losses
through the resource loss navigation, our original system developed to automatically display information to help reduce
resource losses.

we are working diligently to constrain the level of revenue-generating waste and waste materials disposed of in landfills by
further expansion of the reuse of resources. to achieve this waste reduction, we are focusing cutting down waste that is
difficult to recycle, such as thermosetting resin, and strictly adhere to waste sorting practices in each production process.

we are working diligently to constrain the level of waste materials that are particularly difficult to recycle, including
thermosetting resin. we are also strictly adhering to waste sorting practices in production processes to further expand the
reuse of resources.

because waste recycling rates in our overseas factories lag behind those in japan, we have worked to improve the average
level of recycling activities by sharing information within and between regions outside japan. specifically, in addition to
accelerating the information sharing on waste recycling issues between our local factories and group companies in japan,
we also promote the sharing of excellent examples and know-how among our factories across regions by utilizing ba
charts *2 prepared by each region, following our long-standing approach toward co2 reduction activities.
*1 definition by panasonic: recycling rate of 99% or higher. recycling rate = amount of resources recycled/(amount of resources recycled +
  amount of final disposal).

runner recycling
we have uniquely developed a technology to recycle resin runners*3 that were conventionally discarded, in order to reduce
waste, revenue-generating waste, and material procurement costs, as well as for efficient use of resources. the property
of runners (resin) deteriorates through repeated melting and solidifying, therefore, recycling them as molding material
affects the quality of the finished product. for this reason, the maximum percentage of recycled resin that can be added
to molding materials is usually 20–30%. however, we developed a technique of adding to the runners a moderate amount
of additives corresponding to the type of resin to prevent property deterioration, and succeeded in increasing this ratio as
high as about 50%. from fiscal 2014 panasonic avc networks xiamen has been working towards eliminating runner waste
by applying this technology to the runners in the molding process of parts such as lens barrels for digital still cameras.
*3 resin scraps unusable as products, generated from a molding process where a product is molded by pouring heat-melted resin into a mold and
  then cooled. the resin hardened at the filler inlet part and the like during this process becomes waste.

environment: water resource conservation

approach for water resource conservation
it is said that available fresh water is only about 0.01% of the earth’s total water resources. to save this resource, we
provide products that help conserve water. we also use recycled water over and over in our production activities.



water resource conservation through products
by thoroughly analyzing the use of water through our products, we have developed functionalities that allow a considerable
amount of water conservation by utilizing water at a maximum level through improvement of water flow control and
cyclic use. in fiscal 2012, we enhanced one of the criteria, water conservation, in our green product (see pages 38-40)
accreditation criteria, and are speeding up the development of industry-leading products that contribute to water saving.


dish washer and dryer
the panasonic dish washer and dryer np-tr6 only uses one-eighth of the water used for washing hands *1, as it utilizes
retained water to wash and rinse dishes efficiently by circulating only a small amount of water. further, its econavi
function offers a range of energy and resource-saving features. the dirt sensor detects the amount of dirt on the dishes and
reduces the number of rinsing cycles accordingly. the bubble sensor determines the volume of rinsing water depending
on the soap lather made in reaction to the dirt. a combination of dish volume and dryness sensors control the temperature
of the rinsing water, drying duration, and heater usage for drying dishes, depending on the amount of dishes as well as the
room temperature. these features together realize up to a 20% reduction in water and electricity consumption.*2

  manufacturers’ association).
*2 measured in the condition using 21 items of tableware for 3 people applied with soiling equivalent to 0.5 person’s usage at a room temperature
  of 25°c.

touchless faucet
with the panasonic touchless faucet sugupita, which is commonly used with bathroom
vanities, users can turn the water on and off without touching anything but rather
simply by placing a hand close to the sensor under the faucet. this sensor-operated
mechanism was conventionally used for professional purposes such as in hotels and
public toilets. now the touchless faucet is available for home bathrooms, enabling
people to contribute to water conservation. the faucet can save approx. 2 liters of
water compared with the conventional method when washing hands with soap.*3

panasonic technopark in india is designed to recycle 100% of the water used at the plant as part of the sustainable use
of water resources. ground water is used inside the plant and undergoes wastewater treatment after use. rather than
discharging the water into sewage or rivers, it is reused as toilet flushing water and for lawn sprinkling, and is recirculated
again as ground water. also, the necessary ground water level for the land area has been calculated to prevent water
consumption beyond what is necessary, thereby contributing to ground water preservation.

we will continue to reduce our water use despite increasing production volumes, foster increased water recycling, and
reduce water usage at more of our factories in priority regions such as china and other asian countries and across the
world.

environment: chemical substance management

initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of chemical substances
as represented by the enforcement of the reach regulation*1 in the european union, the world is moving toward the goals
agreed at the world summit on sustainable development (wssd) held in 2002, which is to produce and use all chemical
substances in a manner that minimizes their impact on human health and the environment by 2020. in support of the
precautionary approach proposed in the rio declaration made at the earth summit in 1992, we have been manufacturing
products in line with our basic policy of reducing the use of chemical substances that might adversely affect human health
and the environment throughout their lifecycles. as specific initiatives, we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our
products by (1) identifying hazardous substances contained in our products, (2) evaluating these substances on their
environmental impact, and (3) voluntarily reducing or discontinuing their use in case of any environmental risks.
*1 regulations on the registration, evaluation, authorization, and restriction of chemical substances.

   thoroughly identify chemical substances contained
                reach compliance measures
                rohs compliance measures

to promote our initiatives clearly, we set forth our chemical substances management rank guidelines, which prohibit or
specify certain substances for management in terms of our products and factory activities. companies in the panasonic
group are requested to follow the guidelines, and suppliers are also requested for support as necessary. in fiscal 2013,
we added level 3 to the chemical substances management rank guidelines (for products) to review the timing for the
prohibition of further substances that may adversely affect humans and the environment, in addition to the current and
forthcoming prohibitions.

management of chemical substances in products
to minimize the environmental impact of chemical substances contained in products, we endeavor to identify chemical
substances used in the components and materials of our products. in addition, for substances that are prohibited in
products in major developed countries due to legislation such as the european rohs directive, we specify prohibited
substances to globally ensure that they are not used or contained in our products, except in certain cases where
substitution of the substances are infeasible. moving forward, we will conduct environmental impact assessments for
managed substances contained in our products, take steps to reduce the use of substances where the impact on human
health and the environment cannot be ignored, and create plans to eventually prohibit the use.


identifying chemical substances in products
to contribute to the achievement of the global goals set at the wssd, it is important for us to disclose and communicate
information on the chemical substances used in our products across the supply chain, for which we must promote cross-
industrial initiatives to establish and disseminate an effective system. we are a member of the joint article management
promotion consortium (jamp) together with about 400 major companies from various industries, such as chemical,



                                                                                     81

component, and equipment manufacturers. we are proactively formulating, utilizing, and disseminating chemical
substance management standards and systems through this organization. since fiscal 2005, we have been using a
chemical substance management system, gp-web, to gather data concerning the chemical substances contained in the
components and materials for our products from our suppliers. in july 2009 we asked our suppliers to submit the data
in a common format by the joint article management promotion consortium (jamp), and approx. 10,000 suppliers are
currently using this format.

because only the manufacturer of a certain part knows what substances are contained therein, it is necessary to request
information not only to our suppliers but also to further upstream suppliers who do not have direct transactions with
panasonic. in order to ensure that the communication of this information flows efficiently, we have created an online
e-learning site regarding chemical substance management in japanese, chinese, and english. in february 2014 we
discontinued the authorization process required to use the e-learning site to make the site more conveniently available to a
wider audience, including our suppliers and their customers.

in addition, to deepen the understanding on the handling of chemical substances among our suppliers outside japan, we
have conducted practical seminars to provide attendees with a general overview as well as training on the preparation and
submission of data since fiscal 2011 in china, southeast asia and europe.

 jamp http://www.jamp-info.com/english

companies that procure electronic components may need to have a full understanding of the substances contained in
the components at the point of selection or usage in order to adhere to the eu rohs directive and reach regulation.
particularly, as the reach substances of very high concern (svhc) list is updated every six months, those companies
expect their suppliers to provide the latest substance data to demonstrate compliance with the list.

also, as a company supplying electronic components to other companies, we have published a table of rohs and reach
compliance status on our website since november 2012 so that our clients can obtain relevant chemical substance
information from us quickly and efficiently. the table covers our rohs directive compliance information and the substances
designated in the reach svhc list for all our major generic electronic components.

assessing the impact of chemical substances
scientifically identifying the impact on human health and the environment of products containing chemical substances is vital
to the development of products with low environmental impact. we are engaging in activities designed to assess the levels
to which customers are exposed to substances of very high concern (svhc), as well as safety at the time of product use.

to date, we have undertaken assessments on the impact of phthalate ester contained in power supply cables and
ceramic fibers used in some models of professional microwave ovens. as part of our efforts to comply with the eu reach
regulation which requires preparing information for the safe use of products containing svhc we have created and
disclosed a safety assessment document for both cases. in each case, exposure was considered to be nominal with little
concern for any impact on human health.

reduction in usage and emissions of chemical substances
chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) used as a heat insulator and a refrigerant for freezers and air conditioners can damage the
ozone layer and cause global warming. we developed the technology to utilize co2, which has much smaller impact
than cfcs, as a refrigerant and have been supplying a
home boiler using co2 refrigerant since 2001. although
the co2 refrigerant is suitable for heating purposes, it was
difficult to apply to refrigerators and freezers, especially
in large professional equipment due to insufficient cooling
efficiency and size problems. however, with support from
the new energy and industrial technology development
organization (nedo), we developed a freezer system using
co2 refrigerant and now supply these cfc-free freezers and
refrigerated display cases to supermarkets and convenience
stores in japan.                                                  ocu-cr1000vf, a cfc-free      ras-v673, a display case

reducing the use of pvc resin
polyvinyl chloride (pvc) is a material of concerns to the generation of hazardous substances from inappropriate disposal,
as well as the harmful effects of certain additive agents (phthalate ester) used to render pvc more pliable. in light of
the significant potential for inappropriate disposal of the pvc resin used in the internal wiring of products-due mainly to
difficulties associated with the sorting of this resin from used products-we have switched our new products launched from
april 2011 to non-pvc.


management of chemical substances at factories
since 1999, we have been conducting the 33/50 reduction activity to materialize reduction by 33% in three years and by
50% in six years. in japan, we started promoting cutbacks in the use, release, and transfer of chemical substances at our
factories in fiscal 2000. against the target in our voluntary action plan, a reduction by 50% from the fiscal 1999 level, we
achieved a 75% reduction in chemical substance use and a 62% reduction in release and transfer in fiscal 2005. since
then we have been continuing the activity, focusing on substances with particularly large amounts of release and transfer,
setting a voluntary action target of reduction by 30% compared to the fiscal 2006 level. as a result, we achieved a 46%
reduction in the amounts of release and transfer of specified key reduction-target substances across all factories worldwide
in fiscal 2011.

reflecting international trends in chemical substance management, our reduction measures have focused increasingly on
particularly hazardous substances from fiscal 2011. under our chemical substances management rank guidelines (for
factories), we have focused our management on select chemical substances that are hazardous to human health and the
environment. in addition to this, we have classified chemical substances based on the hazardousness and created a unique
indicator, human environmental impact *4 which focuses on reducing substances with a higher hazard level, by specifying a
“hazardousness factor” for each substance. this is also used globally in all factories.

we implemented the plan to reduce the human environmental impact by 27.4% by fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2011.
the final result in fiscal 2014 was a successful 37.4% reduction, achieved through replacing highly toxic substances
in paints, improving yields, promoting recycling, introducing substances with low solvents and hazards, and improving
processes—including reviewing the amount of substances used or the number of washing cycles, as well as improving the
efficiency of removal/deodorization equipment. we will continue our initiatives to minimize the amount of substances with
environmental impact released through our production activities.

environment: biodiversity conservation

approach to biodiversity
business management and human life in our society is founded on the ecosystem services—a multitude of nature’s
blessings provided by our natural capital, including soil, air, water, and animals and plants. it is important to preserve
biodiversity to sustain the benefits derived from this natural capital towards the future; however, this biodiversity is
experiencing significant damage at an unprecedented speed. accordingly, corporate enterprises are now expected to
address the issues of conservation and sustainable use of resources.

we are committed to properly understanding the impact of our business activities on biodiversity and contributing to
conservation. to this end, we are promoting initiatives in cooperation with local governments, environmental conservation
ngos, and specialized agencies. specifically, since 2009, we have identified and are promoting action in three areas where
our business activities affect biodiversity: land use, procurement, and products.


initiatives in land use
green areas in our business sites can potentially contribute to conserving biodiversity in that area. in particular, hardly
any natural environments where wild animals can live and breed remain in urban areas. therefore, even small areas of
green in corporate premises can become a precious environment for a variety of living organisms if they retain indigenous
vegetation and a watery environment, since such areas are often closed from the outside world and hard for foreign
species to blend in.

in terms of biodiversity, these green areas take on the roles of reinforcing the ecological network and the protecting
threatened wild fauna and flora. an ecological network refers to the organic relationship between ecological spaces such
as the greenery and waters where a variety of creatures live and breed. the greenery in our sites helps expand the overall
space where wild animals including birds, butterflies, and dragonflies live, as they can hop between the green areas dotted
in the area. in addition, protecting wild fauna and flora in local areas is an activity with the help and advice of experts, to
preserve endangered species designated by the ministry of the environment or local government that are deemed to be
disappearing from that area. the following articles introduce the activities being carried out in our business sites.


wide-area ecological network initiative
the kusatsu factory of appliances company is the major manufacturing site of our
home appliances, including refrigerators and air conditioners. since the factory’s
declaration to lead the way in ‘eco ideas’ for products, manufacturing, and society
as ‘eco ideas’ factory biwako in june 2008, it has been undertaking environmental
initiatives as the group’s model eco-conscious factory. in the ‘eco ideas’ declaration
october 2011, the factory announced it would contribute in conserving biodiversity
as its key environmental effort. re-arranging the pond and green areas within the
factory premises as the kyozon-no-mori forest (forest of coexistence) to suit the
wild fauna ecology in the area, we are attempting to create an organic link with
                                                                                            appliances company’s kusatsu factory in
the surrounding woodlands and rivers to form a wide-area ecological network that            shiga prefecture
covers lake biwa and the woodlands surrounding the nearby residential area.

from fiscal 2012 to 2013, surveys by experts were conducted to identify the living organisms within the premises. as a
result, it was found that a total of 585 species of organisms were identified, including 338 species of plants, 8 species of
mammals, 35 species of birds, 1 species of amphibian, 4 species of reptiles, 177 species of insects, and 22 species of
aquatic animals. the surveys revealed the following three particularly important points:

• the green areas and pond in the kusatsu factory are organically linked with the surrounding woodlands and rivers.
• many rare living organisms were found within the premises, including those in the red list of the japanese ministry of the
  environment and shiga prefecture.
• raptors and large mammals that are ranked in the higher levels of the ecological pyramid were also observed. this
  suggests that the forest contributes to sustaining a relatively large-scale ecosystem.

the surveys observed foxes and raccoon dogs, which mainly live in woodland, move within a wider area. they also
discovered rhinogobius kurodai, a type of domestic goby fish, living in the waters within the kusatsu factory premises.


                                                              85

these observations prove that the forest has established a link with the surrounding woodlands and rivers. another
threatened species observed in the surveys was the green-backed heron. not only were the herons observed, it was found
that they even breed in a green area near the kyozon-no-mori forest, which again shows that these woodlands play a very
important role in biodiversity conservation. the surveys identified a wide range of animals that spans different levels of the
ecosystem. those in the higher ranking levels include falcons and other large birds such as grey herons and green-backed
herons, as well as large mammals such as raccoon dogs and foxes. the middle ranking animals recorded are japanese rat
snakes and small raptorial birds such as the shrike, followed by lizards, frogs, and insects as the lower ranking organisms.
finally, more than 300 species of plants were observed. these plants support all the living organisms directly and
indirectly. the kyozon-no-mori forest is the green that provides the rich ecosystem cradling many creatures. more detailed
information is disclosed in the kusatsu factory’s biodiversity report.

since fiscal 2012, we have been conducting a series of surveys on the nesting
habits of great tits, one of the indicator species in urban and suburban greenery
(woodlands). the survey aims to produce an environmental assessment of green
areas in our premises and to understand the scope of “green corridors.” we installed
nest boxes on trees and bushes near paths, and continuously monitor nesting of
great tits and greenery conditions at the same time.

we are well aware of the significant role of the green space in kusatsu factory in
the biodiversity of the area, and will continue to strive for biodiversity conservation,                nest boxes in the green area
working closely as part of the regional ecological strategy carried out by shiga
prefecture and kusatsu city.

protecting rare fish and plants disappearing in osaka
in march 2009, we built hanei no hiroba (square of affluence), an area of about
11,000 m2 of greenery in eco solutions company in the kadoma site and a corner
of the greenery was made into a biotope of 300 m2. to make the best of its location
positioned between the yodogawa river and tsurumi ryokuchi park in osaka
prefecture, we have been monitoring its living organisms following the expert advice
and instructions of osaka prefecture university from the stage of planning for the
biotope. the biotope has been maintained by volunteering employees from its start.
each early spring, spot-billed ducks nest and hatch their eggs in the biotope. delightful
                                                                                                        biotope at eco solutions company
little ducklings contribute to raising the environmental awareness among employees.

in june 2012, with the proposal and instructions from the aquatic life conservation
research center of the research institute of environment, agriculture and fisheries,
osaka prefecture, we introduced hemigrammocypris rasborella (a fresh water
fish belonging to the carp family) and monochoria korsakowii (a marsh plant) in
the biotope. we have been protecting these species, which are both specified as
threatened species in the red list by the ministry of the environment and osaka
prefecture. in september 2013, we conducted our first population survey of
hemigrammocypris rasborella by volunteering employees and counted as many as
                                                                                                        population survey of hemigrammocypris
1,500 of the fish living in the pond, grown from 40 at the time of introduction. we                     rasborella by volunteering employees
also started publishing a newsletter, monthly biotope, in october 2013 to introduce
the organisms living in our biotope to a public audience.

 in recognition of our efforts in biodiversity conservation, we concluded the osaka
partnership agreement on biodiversity with osaka prefecture, osaka prefecture
university, and the research institute of environment, agriculture and fisheries
in november 2013. this agreement has been established by osaka prefecture to
support companies that strive for biodiversity conservation through partnerships
with specialized institutions. the aim of the partnership is to promote voluntary
contributions to biodiversity conservation among companies through osaka
prefecture publicizing the activities of the partner companies. at the time of the
                                                                                                        releasing japanese medaka from
agreement signing ceremony, we newly introduced 100 japanese medaka fish                                kitakawachi at the signing ceremony
(oryzias latipes) born in kitakawachi in osaka prefecture. japanese medaka fish are



                                                                      86

also designated as a threatened species in the red list by the ministry of the environment and osaka prefecture.

through these activities, we continue to preserve the local biodiversity and raise environmental awareness among our
employees.


square of connection to preserve the local ecological network
panahome corporation built a green area called tsunagari no hiroba (square of
connection) within the premises of its headquarters building and opened it to the
public. tsunagari no hiroba is a green zone designed to preserve of the ecosystem
network in the community, or support people unable to go home or to enable
business in a major disaster, with the support of projects by osaka prefecture,
including green breeze flow building project and the anti-disaster safe road
construction project. the zone consists of a biotope, trees suited to the local climate
and weather, a photovoltaic power generation system, a wind power generation
                                                                                             an aerial view of tsunagari no hiroba
system, etc. the name of the square reflects the concept of connecting the trust
from society—including our customers and local community—to our business
activities, and then further expanding it to the global environment and its future through local biodiversity conservation.

also, the company followed the eco solutions company in signing the osaka partnership agreement on biodiversity with
osaka prefecture, toyonaka city, osaka prefecture university, and the research institute of environment, agriculture and
fisheries in february 2014.

initiatives in products
together with the ngo birdlife international, we have established a third-party assessment system to provide customers
with information about product contributions to biodiversity. through this system, we have assessed products which are
closely linked to biodiversity.

we have also enhanced our green product accreditation criteria (see pages 38-40) by adding biodiversity to the existing
items. we define products that contribute to biodiversity conservation as those that use biodiversity-conscious materials in
their major components and those that include functions to help biodiversity conservation.

in fiscal 2014, panasonic environmental systems & engineering co., ltd. developed atps-bluesys, a ballast water
management system (bwms) to reduce disturbance from maritime transportation of the marine ecology of local sea
areas. ballast water is sea water used to retain the balance of a freight vessel at sea when it is not carrying shipment.
because the ship travels across the sea taking sea water from one port and then draining the water into another port, the
impact of foreign organisms such as plankton and bacteria on the local ecology, environment, and resources is becoming
an increasingly serious problem. atps-bluesys treats microorganisms in the water with inline electrolysis without using
filters, which is the first in japan. the system can treat the water to a level lower than the standards by the international
maritime organization imo), and successfully acquired the imo g9 basic approval (g9ba). the system is expected to be
launched in the market in 2015.

partnership with the world wide fund for nature (wwf)
since 2007, we have been promoting the yellow sea ecoregion support project, a seven-
year partnership with wwf japan. the project aims to implement measures required for
the sustainable use and conservation of the yellow sea ecoregion, a body of sea water
enclosed by china and the korean peninsula, in which high biodiversity value exists.

environment: collaboration across the supply chain

collaboration with suppliers and transportation partners
as a company backed by a number of suppliers, we must consider the environmental impacts of our entire supply chain,
and not just of our own operations. through our coordination efforts with suppliers and transportation partners, who form an
integral part of our business operations, we strive to minimize our environmental impact across the entire supply chain, focusing
on the reduction of co2 emissions, resource recycling, chemical substance management, and biodiversity conservation.


measures for green procurement
since the publication of the green procurement standards in 1999, we have been promoting the manufacture of eco-
conscious products in partnership with our suppliers. furthermore, in the green procurement standards, we set out the
establishment of a group of suppliers who support our environmental policy in supplying products and goods in order
to materialize the targets in supplier collaboration stated in our green plan 2018. in addition to cooperation in “reducing
environmental impact in supplier business operations” and “sharing achievements through collaboration,” we are asking
our suppliers to “seek the cooperation of upstream business partners” to expand the scope of activities of reducing
environmental impact throughout the entire supply chain.

also, based on the green procurement standards, we have been conducting the green procurement survey, where we
monitor the implementation status of our suppliers regarding our requests, to promote environmental impact reduction
activities more effectively with our suppliers. in fiscal 2013, we conducted a trial survey targeted at our major global
suppliers. we received responses from 415 companies, and were able to confirm the level of activity in areas such as
“environmental management system development,” “thorough implementation of chemical substance management,”
“reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,” “promotion of resource recycling,” and “biodiversity conservation.”

from fiscal 2014, we have replaced surveys conducted on a group-wide scale with surveys at a site level as a means of
communication with our suppliers.

in response to the enhancement of regulations such as eu rohs directive, we have been engaging in continual
environmental quality assurance audits of our suppliers since 2005 to improve the management level throughout the entire
supply chain. in fiscal 2014, we assessed the environmental quality assurance systems of some 2,400 suppliers and have
supported their efforts to upgrade their management levels.
 green procurement standards http://panasonic.net/procurement/green/


calling on suppliers to reduce their environmental impacts
in order to assess greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions across the entire supply
chain (scope 3 *1), we made our original calculations based on the greenhouse
gas protocol, the international accounting standard for ghg emissions. since
fiscal 2012 we have conducted assessment surveys on four occasions, with the
cooperation of 185 suppliers in the areas of raw materials, electrical and electronic
components, and processed parts. in fiscal 2014, we conducted our fourth
survey, for 37 suppliers of raw materials and electrical and electronic components
who had cooperated with us in fiscal 2012, to check the changes between the
first data (for fiscal 2011) and the fourth data (for fiscal 2013) in ghg emissions
                                                                                         seminar on trial of identifying ghg emissions
and ghg emissions purchasing price per unit *2. as a result of calculations by the       in the supply chain
37 cooperating suppliers, the total ghg emissions in business with panasonic
from the supplier range, upstream range (raw material suppliers and component manufacturers), and downstream range
(domestic import and logistics companies) were reduced by about 1.80 million tons (co2-equivalent), and 0.38 million tons
respectively since the first study. in addition, the basic unit improved by 2.8% from the first study. in the future, we plan
to make further advances with attention to economic rationality and comprehensiveness of gathered data for both our
suppliers and panasonic.

additionally, our ghg emissions in the upstream range were estimated using the ghg emissions per basic unit by resource
type, based on the volume of materials purchased and on the input-output table published by the japanese government.
the estimation results based on fiscal 2013 data is 13.27 million tons, roughly quadruple the ghg emissions of our own
production activities.


                                                                  89

sharing achievements through collaboration
since fiscal 2010, we have been implementing the eco-vc *3 activity with our suppliers. this program seeks out ways in
our parts procurement activities to save energy and resources or use recycled materials, which at the same time aims to
rationalize costs. in fiscal 2011, we expanded the focus on recycling-oriented manufacturing in addition to the original
objective of reducing co2 emissions. actions in china and other asian countries have been accelerated from fiscal 2013. in
fiscal 2014, suppliers from around the world submitted a total of 1,077 ideas on energy saving for products and factories,
or proposals on how to make smaller and lighter goods or using fewer parts. to share the best of these proposals with all
our suppliers, we established the panasonic excellent partners meeting, which is attended by our suppliers worldwide.

in the future, we will implement this eco-vc activity throughout the supply chain—from procurement to distribution—
to reach many more suppliers and reduce co2, lower costs, and promote recycling-oriented manufacturing (minimizing
resources used, recycling, and switching to nonpetroleum materials).

environment: environmental sustainability management
across the world

global eco projects
we launched the global eco project in fiscal 2008 to enhance concrete activities in line with the actual situations in
respective regions in the world, with a focus on the global promotion of environmental sustainability management.
following the policy of the panasonic group, each region publicly announced its commitment as ‘eco ideas’ declarations,
and has actively implemented efforts via their own approaches to achieve the goals of the group.

these activities started first in china, and by fiscal 2011 declarations were announced in all regions where we manage
business, and the structures to promote environmental sustainability management in line with each region were
strengthened. at present, independent activities are being planned and executed in light of regional environmental issues.


southeast asia & pacific

‘eco ideas’ declaration and activity results
nine panasonic group companies in taiwan announced the taiwan ‘eco ideas’ declaration in october 2011 and are
presently directing their energies to achieve the targets in products, manufacturing and employee activities for fiscal 2016.

for products, we are working on improving the sales ratio for products with top-class environmental performance through
consecutive releases of econavi (see page 45) products. with the enhancement in the variety of econavi products, the
sales ratio improved from 37% (in fiscal 2012) to 48% (in fiscal 2014). as a result, the size of contribution to reducing co2
emissions through energy-saving products (see page 43) has reached 260,000 tons.

in manufacturing, activities such as improvements in production facilities and the wider use of inverters in regulating energy
consumption corresponding with production levels helped reduce co2 emission in fiscal 2014 by 29.8% (over fiscal 2006).
waste reduction and exhaustive sorting has led to improving the waste recycling rate to 99.4%. in the area of employee
activities, environmental action such as tree planting and beach cleaning has been expanded to upgrade the contribution
to local communities.

environmental education for children
pe and its subsidiaries are engaged in environmental education for children in a variety
of ways, once again in fiscal 2014. workshop programs popular with children, such as
making hybrid cars and solar lanterns, have been held in germany, the netherlands,
uk, slovakia, greece, and other countries. through making such devices, children gain
hands-on experience that demonstrates that clean energy is generated with solar power
(energy creation), that the energy created is stored in accumulator batteries (energy
storage), and that wasteful electric power use must be reduced (energy saving), thus
learning the importance of energy.

the panasonic group and unesco world heritage centre jointly organized
environmental education activities for children, based on strategic partnership (see page
102). in the global eco picture diary contest, children’s drawings of eco-friendly activities
that they planned and executed, done in rich colors, were submitted. at the global award

headquarters building acquires leed platinum certification
panasonic north america’s new headquarters building, which opened in july 2013,
acquired leed (leadership in energy & environmental design) platinum certification
for its interior. this is granted to structures that satisfy the highest requirements in
energy conservation, co2 reduction, water conservation, etc. the new building has
large windowpanes stretching from the floor to the ceiling, enabling many of the
employees to work at their desks in natural light without needing to turn on so many
light fixtures, thus conserving energy.
                                                                                                the new pna headquarters with large
                                                                                                windows

environmental action in offices and the cafeteria
pna consolidated all of its printing needs at the document center and created a
scheme in which employees are asked to confirm whether printing is truly necessary.
with these actions, the company was able to cut down printing by 30% and to
conserve consumption of paper, ink and energy.

eco-awareness has extended beyond pna employees to include cafeteria service
operators in the building. the compass group, the food service operator providing
cafeteria meals, distributed among the employees reusable lunch tote bags that can
                                                                                                food takeout with reusable lunch tote bag
be used for takeouts. this is expected to reduce the consumption of disposable
paper containers and cut down garbage by roughly nine tons a year.


latin america
energy solutions for customers
the companies of the panasonic latin america group provide eco-conscious
products and solutions to create “a better world” for its customers.

panasonic sales latin america (plat) proposes to corporate clients facing the
problem of high electricity costs that they introduce a photovoltaic power generation
system both for cost-cutting and environmental appeal. plat presents the period
of investment recovery based on actual measurement of sunlight radiation, and
proposes a comprehensive solution including assurance of power output after
installation. in fiscal 2014, plat installed a megawatt-scale photovoltaic power                panasonic photovoltaic power generation
                                                                                                system installed in a hilcasa factory
generation system for a factory of hilcasa, a major apparel company.

panasonic de mexico, s.a. de c.v. (panamax) is supporting efforts by the mexican state of aguascalientes to become the
number-one state in eco-consciousness, and has installed a photovoltaic power generation system and led lighting in the
governor’s official residence and the state guesthouse.

support for poject to protect endangered wildfowl species in brazil
panasonic do brasil limitada (panabras) supports save brasil, a wildfowl
protection ngo, to promote the protection of illegally traded wild birds and their
return to nature.

the number of wildlife poached in brazil and returned for protection is reported at
30,000 a year. of these, wildfowl account for 90%. due to the absence of facilities
to care for creatures weakened by injury or disease, roughly 70% of the recaptured
wildfowl are returned to nature without care. therefore there is no data for the
number of birds that have survived.                                                       workshop on bird-release procedure

for this reason, panabras and save brasil formed a three-year partnership named
plano de voo (flight project) to provide care for recaptured birds and organize surveillance of birds after their return to
the wild. in fiscal 2014, the second year of the partnership, a workshop was held to study with experts the procedure for
releasing birds and to specify locations where release is possible.

environment: contribution to local communities and
education for the next generation

panasonic eco relay for sustainable earth
in order to encourage employees and their families to actively engage in environmental
activities at home and in their local communities, panasonic has been promoting love the
earth citizens’ campaign (le campaign) in japan since 1998, believing that only truly green-
minded employees can manufacture truly green products. in 2008 we introduced panasonic
eco relay, where business sites around the world plan local environmental activities and
implement them with their employees, along with adults and children from the community.
these activities have really expanded on a global basis and developed in many different ways.                logo
we strive to contribute to establishing a sustainable global environment and society as global
citizens through activities under panasonic eco relay for sustainable earth, which was named
in october 2010 to reflect our desire to make a connection across the generations.

panasonic eco relay japan (perj), in cooperation with the panasonic labor
union, has been working on the restoration of woodlands in sasayama, hyogo
prefecture, with the support of local governments and environmental npos
since 2011. a vacation center belonging to the panasonic group workers union
association is located in the area, serving as a venue for visitors to refresh the
body and mind as well as for communicating the group’s activities in nature
preservation and environmental education. presently, activities are being
organized each month, chiefly in the restoration of terraced rice paddies and
bamboo charcoal making. also, reports on the current state of sasayama’s                  employees, retirees, and their families
                                                                                          participating in woodland restoration at sasayama
ecosystem, along with photos of activities, are being compiled and published
on our website.


environmental education for children
in hope of the sound growth and development of children who are to become
the driving force of our planet’s future, as well as to maximize their potential, we
believe in the importance of providing them with opportunities for learning. as
such, we have been accelerating our activities for environmental education for
children on a global scale since fiscal 2010.

in september 2013, as part of our activities, we organized workshops for some
120 students aged 13 to 18 for four days at ifa, an exhibition held in berlin,
germany. at the workshop, panasonic employees taught the students about                   students participating in a workshop in berlin
environmental technologies. later, the students worked on assembling hybrid
cars and led lanterns powered with alkaline and solar batteries, and gained
hands-on experience of technologies in energy creation and storage.

in february 2014, a next-generation educational event was organized in
cooperation with the university of california, san diego (ucsd) and gates
millennium scholars, an ngo scholarship fund for talented students from
immigrant families. more than 100 fourth-graders from foothill oak (fho)
elementary school and their guardians participated in the event at the ucsd
campus. the campus is equipped with panasonic solar cells and large-scale
storage batteries, and an environmental learning session was conducted
through presentation of the technologies behind these products. many of the
                                                                                      fho elementary school students at the event
fho students are second-generation immigrants, and the rate of those who go
on to college is low. through the event, we presented the children with a chance
to think how college education is important for their future and also about a sustainable society as leaders in the future.

we have set our goal to provide such educational programs to 2 million children worldwide by 2018, when panasonic
celebrates its 100th anniversary. as of fiscal 2014, the number stands at roughly 528,000, and the cumulative total at
approx. 1.993 million since fiscal 2010.


                                                                99

tree planting activities
we implement tree planting activities in our drive to preserve nature as well as
to boost environmental awareness both within and outside panasonic, and have
further expanded the activities to a global scale from fiscal 2008.

in fiscal 2014, employees of the panasonic group in china started a large-scale
tree planting project in the inner mongolia autonomous region. this is part of
the panasonic china public forestation project and aims at planting 100,000
trees in an area equivalent to the tiananmen square in beijing. its kickoff
event took place on april 12, 2013, drawing the participation of more than
                                                                                   tree planting in the inner mongolia autonomous
100 executives and employees of the panasonic group companies in china.            region
roughly 600 trees were planted. the project is expected to foster improvements
in the local ecosystem and to prevent desertification.

on august 3, 2013, 606 people consisting of panasonic group employees in
thailand, their families, and former panasonic scholarship students engaged in
volunteer work under the panasonic mangrove restoration project, a campaign
organized jointly with the local bang saen government, in the mangroves of
chonburi province. the project aims at the restoration of the mangrove forests
towards the recovery of the coastal ecosystem and environmental preservation.
some 2,500 saplings were planted on that day.

through these activities, roughly 119,000 trees were planted globally in fiscal    mangrove planting in thailand
2014. the cumulative total from fiscal 2008 has now reached approx. 3.147
million.

environment: human resource development

encouraging all employees to become environmental innovators
we believe that the development of human resources is important in laying the foundations and promoting environmental
sustainability management. to put this into action, a training curriculum is in place for each specialty and position. general
programs are organized for all employees to acquire environmental knowledge as well as learn about our environmental
policy and activities. specialized programs are designed to bring employees’ environmental skills to an advanced level.

general programs are held every year at each business site for employees to acquire a wide range of knowledge, such
as energy problems, trends in global society, and environmental activities by panasonic. additionally, training catered to
the distinctive features of each operation is organized to provide information directly linked to business and operational
activities. other creative initiatives that we continue include environmental sustainability education to new employees and
engineering-related employees using exclusive textbooks specific to their respective job experiences and skills to enable
them to practice environmental action in their job activities.

specialized programs feature courses on environmental legislation, chemical substances management, waste management,
as well as factory energy conservation diagnosis. in fiscal 2014, a total of 126 employees underwent training. the programs
are not limited to employees in environment-related job functions and allow participation of related divisions in an effort to
expand the scope of environmental innovators.

environment: environmental communication

promoting environmental communication
panasonic has been focusing on maintaining close communications with stakeholders. we are actively engaged in
environmental communication with our customers, business partners, local communities, governments, investors,
employees, ngos, experts, etc., through a variety of perspectives, including products and services, factories, and
cooperation in environmental activities, as well as advertising, exhibitions, and website communication.


proposals on environmental policy
in addition to publicity through keidanren (japanese business federation) and other industrial organizations, we submit
environmental policy proposals not only to the japanese government but also to governments of other countries through
a wide range of opportunities. we joined in policy deliberations on environmental issues that the society is facing today:
a future vision for national governments, industry, and people’s lives aimed at the creation of a sustainable society, and
information sharing and exchange related to international activities. through this approach we established a deeper
understanding of government policy. based on this, we are engaging in a drive to promote environmental management with
an awareness of preventing business risks as well as creating opportunities, through actively presenting proposals from the
standpoint of manufacturing, marketing, and technology development.


environmental promotion through program sponsorship
in june 2011, we concluded a strategic partnership agreement with the unesco                                                            ri

engagement with third parties
panasonic actively conducts a number of dialogues with experts from both within
and outside japan, and utilizes their comments in its environmental strategies.

with the natural step, in particular, we have built a partnership since 2001. we
hold an annual meeting with them to share the most advanced environmental
information in europe and seek their opinions on our environmental strategies and
activities to assist us in further improvements.


communicating through showrooms and exhibitions                                                 meeting with the natural step

panasonic hosts a range of exhibitions across internal and external facilities to
disseminate its vision through products and services, and to receive voices and
requests directly from its customers.

at panasonic center tokyo, one of our general information bases, we offer a wide
range of solutions realizing lifestyles that are sustainable, safe, and comfortable,
together with actual practices based on our research on consumer living.

also, we participated in eco products 2013, japan’s largest environmental
exhibition to present our eco-conscious products and environmental technologies
                                                                                     eco products 2013: at our booth
for better living, under the theme “a better life, a better world.” specifically, in
the products zone of our booth we installed our panahome model home casart
eco cordis (see page 53) with a photovoltaic power generation system hit™ installed on the entire roof. the full lineup
of econavi products (see page 45) was displayed, with the purpose of promoting the concept of net-zero energy house

publishing environmental information on the website
although panasonic had been publishing its environmental reports in paper format since 1997, these reports were shifted
to solely web-based publication in 2010. in fiscal 2014, our environmental activity website was integrated with the csr
website for all-round and exhaustive corporate communication from the standpoint of sustainability. additionally, to provide
our global stakeholders with a deeper understanding of our environmental activities, special contents featuring panasonic
group activities were created in fiscal 2014. it has been featured in 71 websites and in 37 languages. at the same time,
independent initiatives undertaken in each region are also introduced in websites.

environment: environmental governance

corporate-wide environmental sustainability management and promotion system
the pdca cycle for corporate-wide environmental sustainability management is implemented by each company and
business division through setting its own environmental targets, and planning and promoting its activities in accordance
with the annual environmental management policy, which is developed under the panasonic group business policy
and the environmental action plan “green plan 2018.” the annual environmental policy is shared across the entire
organization through the “global manufacturing division operation policy meeting” led by the executive officer in charge of
environmental management. issues in promoting key environmental activities are deliberated and thoroughly communicated
at the environmental working committee etc., which consists of environmental compliance administrators at companies
and regional headquarters outside japan. environmental performance data representing activity results is gathered and
assessed on a monthly basis as a general rule to identify the achievements, and additional measures are executed as
needed. feedback of key annual performance data is given internally and disclosed externally after review, onsite audits,
and independent assurance by a third-party, kpmg azsa sustainability co., ltd. (see page 220). moreover, reviews and
feedback from stakeholders are utilized in subsequent measures to ensure further and continuous improvement.

in addition, committees and working groups (wgs) focusing on key measures are formed, establishing a promotional
structure to resolve challenges jointly with members across companies, job functions, and regional headquarters that
govern regions outside japan. specific examples include the product chemical substance management committee which
deliberates and ensures the implementation of chemical substance management guidelines, and the product environmental
law working group which engages in information sharing regarding product-related legislation and reviews actions to be
taken.

environment: environmental management systems

environmental sustainability management founded on environmental
management systems (ems)
as the foundation of environmental sustainability management, panasonic established ems in all of our manufacturing sites
across the world in fiscal 1999, and has continued to have the sites iso14001 certified since then.

in order to further reinforce environmental sustainability management globally, we have established ems in all our sites
including non-manufacturing sites across the world, and these sites have certified iso14001 in principle. in october
2011, we published the environmental management system establishment guidelines that summarize ems concepts for
different business forms such as manufacturing, sales and services, and head office administration, aiming to build ems in
accordance with the basic rules for environmental affairs on a global scale. based on the guidelines, group-wide action is
underway to achieve the goals set out in the green plan 2018.

environment: environmental risk management

group-wide systems to manage environmental risks
as a tool to continuously reduce environmental risks, panasonic has established an environmental risk management
system specific to each company. in accordance with the basic risk management policy for all companies (see page 23),
we promote (1) identification of environmental risks and group-wide risk management each year, and (2) ensuring quick
responses to reported environmental risks.

to identify environmental risks and implement the management system, environmental risks are identified for each
company and for each region in the world each year. from these risks, environmental risks on a group-wide level are
selected. the risks that show a high level of frequency or seriously impact business management are designated as major
risks and prioritized in planning and executing risk-reducing measures. these measures are implemented for each major
risk, and progress is monitored and followed up on a quarterly basis in the pdca cycle.

when an environmental risk is found, the relevant company, related job functions, and regional headquarters collaborate
to promptly implement emergency measures and recurrence prevention measures adapted to the risk level. also, the
management flow in case of risk discovery is standardized to prevent the occurrence of secondary risks as a result of
confusion.

environmental compliance management at factories
panasonic manages its environmental systems in full compliance with laws and regulations. we regularly measure emissions
of gas, wastewater, noise, odor, etc., and introduce preventative measures for cases that may lead to serious violations.

furthermore, key human resources are developed for information sharing among the companies/business divisions,
environment-related job functions, and regional headquarters, to ensure exhaustive compliance with legislation related to
factory environment management in respective countries where panasonic manufacturing sites are located. specifically,
activities to share information as well as specialized training is conducted for factory management officers in charge of the
management of chemical substances, waste, wastewater and exhaust gas, either by country or by region in japan, europe,
china, and southeast asia.

in fiscal 2014, there were 2 violations of environment-related legislation in japan and 2 outside japan. in response, they
were reported promptly to the administrative authorities, and measures to address the causes were implemented. we will
continue to ensure compliance with legislation as well as prevent recurrence.

measures against soil and groundwater contamination
in the latter half of the 1980s, soil and groundwater contamination due to chlorinated organic solvents was detected at
some panasonic sites. in response, we have conducted anti-contamination activities across the company. in fiscal 2003 we
began enhancing our surveys and measures to comply with relevant laws and regulations, including the soil contamination
countermeasures act, which was enforced in japan in 2003, and in fiscal 2004 started implementing measures to place all
our bases across the globe under the management supervision of panasonic with regard to soil and groundwater.

specifically, we conduct onsite inspections and interviews at the bases, in addition to surveying their use of vocs and
heavy metals. furthermore, we implement surface soil surveys within the premises. for the sites where contamination was
detected beyond the regulatory pollution standards, we conduct detailed borehole surveys to identify the boundaries of the
contaminated areas and take remedial measures.

as a result of these efforts, we were able to place all our bases under management supervision in fiscal 2009. furthermore,
in fiscal 2011, the management supervision scheme was purpose-specifically reorganized and reinforced to establish a new
management supervision scheme. with the highest priority given to preventing dispersion of pollution beyond our premises,
this new scheme is implemented across all operating sites to further improve the level of measures against contamination.

initiatives for pcb pollution
panasonic discontinued the production of equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) in japan in 1972
and has since been strictly managing its pcb waste. with the enforcement of the act on special measures concerning
promotion of proper treatment of pcb waste in july 2001, optimized storage, decontamination, and notifications are being
practiced in compliance with the law. 1,919 of 2,281 units (84% completed) including transformers and capacitors using
pcbs submitted under the early registration scheme were treated as of march 31, 2014 by japan environmental safety
corporation as our subcontracted pcb waste disposal operator. we will continue to treat pcb waste towards march 31,
2027, which is the legally designated deadline by which decontamination is to be completed.

environment: overview of environmental impact and
environmental accounting

overview of environmental impact from business operation
in order to mainly manufacture and market electrical and electronic products, panasonic consumes petroleum and
electricity as energy sources and resources as raw materials of parts and components. as a result, we emit co2 and
wastes to the environment. this diagram maps the environmental impact from our business operation from a procurement
stage to recycling activities. also, ghg throughout the entire supply chain is classified into scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3
and assessed according to the ghg protocol, the international calculation standard.

environmental accounting
panasonic globally collects data on its environmental conservation costs and economic benefits obtained through its
environmental activities in relation to generated/controlled environmental impact. this data is internally utilized as basic
information for our continuing environmental sustainability management.

*16 where an entire amount of investment and expenses cannot be regarded as environmental conservation costs alone, the difference or
   appropriate portions (divided proportionally) are not calculated. for example, if latest manufacturing facilities are installed to improve energy
   efficiency and productivity, the full amount of the investment for said facilities is entered as investment value.
*17 expenses include a cost of capital investment depreciation. for example, if latest energy-saving facilities were installed, the value includes
   depreciation for the first year but not for the second year and later.

customers: management approach

constantly improving various systems and mechanisms under the themes of “improving
quality,” “maintaining product safety” and “enhancing customer satisfaction”
aiming to provide “better living” for customers, panasonic is diversifying its business model not only from the perspective
of homes, but also offices, stores, automobiles, airplanes and communities, by extending beyond offering individual
hardware products to deliver total solutions including software and services. beyond home appliance users, our
customers are growing dramatically through our businesses in various global industries, including automobiles and
housing, which extend from advanced countries to emerging markets.

against this backdrop, panasonic has been improving various systems and mechanisms under the themes of “improving
quality,” “maintaining product safety,” and “enhancing customer satisfaction” while engaging in manufacturing based on
the management philosophy promoted by its founder konosuke matsushita “to contribute to society through its products
and services while always placing the customer first” and the concept of “making quality top priority.” in particular, we are
making product safety a top management priority, having reflected on incidents involving ff-type kerosene heaters.

regarding quality, panasonic’s chief quality officer (cqo) is responsible for establishing quality control officers
throughout the company, at each divisional company and business division and in overseas companies in accordance
with its basic policy on quality. in addition, we undertake initiatives to continuously improve quality by operating the
panasonic quality management system. in order to improve the level of product safety even higher, panasonic
undertakes related initiatives centered on the group-wide general product safety committee.

to improve customer satisfaction, we are establishing specialized organizations in japan and overseas while expanding
the voice of customers (voc) system globally. moreover, we are installing mechanisms that provide information security
to ensure that customer, personal, financial and other categories of information are protected. consequently, we are
earning the satisfaction and trust of customers while making every possible effort to help maintain the integrity of today’s
information-based society.

customers: product quality and safety

policy
product quality basic concepts
in an effort to embody its management philosophy, panasonic regards its product quality policy as being to "serve our true
customers throughout the supply of products and services that will meet and satisfy the needs both of our customers and
of society at large."


to realize that product quality policy, we are committed to the measures set out below.
1. accurately matching product quality to the needs of customers and society
2. establishing a consistent product quality management system-from product planning, design and manufacture to use
   and consumption through to disposal-deploying product quality improvement activities based on collaboration and
   cooperation between all divisions
3. accurately and sensitively ascertaining the real needs of customers and society and, possessing the technologies and
  skills to proactively incorporate those real needs into the manufacturing process, working to cultivate personnel who
  have the mindset of adhering to what is of benefit for customers and society.
4. complying with laws, related legislation and regulations and the various standards appertaining to product quality.

rules and system
quality management system
we prepared a publication called quality management system development guidelines in 2004 so that all panasonic
group companies can build their own self-contained quality assurance programs. each group company has formulated a
panasonic quality management system (p-qms).* based on these p-qms promotion efforts, we are strengthening
initiatives to bring about ongoing quality improvements, the prevention of quality problems and a reduction in quality

 ▶ panasonic code of conduct: "product safety"       http://panasonic.net/corporate/philosophy/code/11.html


basic policy regarding autonomous code of conduct for product safety (excerpts)
* this basic policy was approved in a resolution of the board of directors at a meeting held on june 27, 2007, at matsushita electric industrial co.,
 ltd. (the company's name at that time).
 based on the basic management philosophy, panasonic and its group companies believe that reassuring customers
 on the safety of the products it produces and sells is a key management issue. recognizing our social responsibility,
 we have formulated the basic policy regarding autonomous code of conduct for product safety, as shown below. we
 make every effort to make sure our products are safe, putting the customer first and ensuring the utmost in integrity.
 1. strictly follow laws and regulations
 2. establish a corporate culture of ensuring product safety
 3. create inherently safe product designs
 4. prevent accidents caused by improper use
 5. maintain quality assurance system to ensure product safety
 6. compile and disclose data on product accidents
 7. respond to product accidents

                                                                        118

strengthening the group-wide basis for product safety
for manufacturing that prioritizes product safety, we reorganized the group-wide general product safety committee in
2012, under which a safety technology working group and a safety standards working group were established.
through these working groups, the development of safety technologies that were worked on out of remorse over the ff-
type kerosene heater incidents in 2005, and the activities to maintain product safety standards, will firmly take hold and
become permanent.

amid increasing needs for safety performance for such items as automobiles and robots, we are making coordinated
efforts group-wide to acquire safety standard certifications in order to ensure safety.


1. activities of the safety technology working group
to take into account cases where customers use a product beyond its intended usage in the design stage, the safety
technology working group developed scientific evaluation methods, such as accelerated aging tests to determine the
durability of the materials, and collected data from which they produced a database. in fiscal 2014, they developed
evaluation technology to estimate with a high degree of accuracy the deterioration and lifespan of resin. they also
promoted the development of methods for testing high- voltage, high- current direct current (dc) tracking in order to
prevent fires from occurring in solar photovoltaic systems and other dc equipment.

in addition, we have reached the stage where not only av equipment but also white goods, such as room air conditioners
and refrigerators, are beginning to be internet-connected. ensuring product security has become increasingly more
important to safeguard the information assets held in those products. regarding product security as part of product safety,
panasonic developed guidelines through, for example, threat analyses and enhanced its product security training, which
is provided to manufacturing personnel. at the same time, bases for gathering risk information were set up not only in
japan but also in europe, and a system built that enables quick measures to be taken the moment any vulnerability is
detected.


2. activities of the safety standards working group
complying with public safety standards goes without saying, but to increase safety, the safety standards working group
established panasonic corporation safety standards (pcss) in 1999 as design rules that provide safeguards during
product r&d.

the knowledge gained from r&d conducted into prolonged reliability technology is reflected in pcss, which are making
standards more stringent with regard to a number of important safety matters, including prolonged use, measures to make
materials nonflammable, and preventing products from toppling over. the group is working to improve product safety
standards in order to prevent the risks that are expected to arise in new business fields. for example, the group has
formulated the panasonic corporation system safety standards (pcsss), primarily targeting energy creation and storage
management systems, in order to ensure the safety of storage battery systems, one of panasonic’s growth businesses. to
ensure the safety of personal-care robots, a promising field of technology, the group formulated the panasonic personal-
care robot safety standards (prss) prior to the establishment of the international safety standard, iso 13482.

in fiscal 2014, panasonic strengthened its risk assessment* initiatives and completely revised internal risk assessment
guidelines in order to further enhance product safety levels.

* risk assessment: a method for appropriately creating safe product designs based on identifying and quantifying product risks.


3. acquiring certifications for international safety standards (case studies)
panasonic acquires personal-care robot iso 13482 standard in february 2014

panasonic’s risyone, which features combined bed and wheelchair functions, became the world’s first personal-care
robot to be certified under the international safety standard, iso 13482. panasonic is contributing to the development of
international safety standards through its participation in projects undertaken by the new energy and industrial
technology development organization (nedo). looking ahead, we will develop life-assistance robots that customers can
feel secure using.

panasonic acquires automotive function safety standard iso 26262 certification in february 2012

panasonic acquired process certification for the automotive function safety standard iso 26262 through the german third-
party organization, tüv süd. consequently, our automotive equipment and device software development processes are



                                                                      119

certified up to asil-d, the highest safety level under this standard.

taking advantage of this process certification, we will contribute to the development of safe, reliable, eco-friendly,
convenient and comfortable automobile society by creating even safer products.

*glossary
(1) iso 13482
iso 13482 is a unique international safety standard for personal care robots issued by the international organization for standardization (iso)
that covers three categories: physical assistant robots, mobile servant robots and person carrier robots.


(2) function safety
function safety is safety realized through the activation (function) of electric/electronic devices such as microcomputers. examples include
malfunction detection, safety shutdown controls and user warnings.


(3) iso 26262
iso 26262 is an international automotive function safety standard issued on november 15, 2011. this standard prescribes four automotive safety
integrity levels (asil): a, b, c and d.


product safety training
to assist in entrenching a culture that makes product safety the utmost
manufacturing priority, panasonic provides product safety training including the e-
learning course basics of product safety to employees and organizes the product
safety forum to enable engineers to engage in self-study among themselves on
this topic.

in 2013, panasonic worked to ensure safety worldwide by strengthening                                southeast asia-based training being
independent region-based training activities centered on panasonic asia pacific                      undertaken in thailand
(singapore) in south east asia and the china manufacturing center in china.


quality improvement initiatives in emerging countries
we are working to increase the compatibility of panasonic products in emerging countries, which have differing
infrastructure-related conditions in such areas as lifestyles, power sources and waterlines. to this end, we conduct fact-
finding surveys of those aspects of infrastructure that easily impact quality—particularly power source quality and water
quality/pressure—as well as climate conditions while establishing benchmarks by investigating the quality-related
adaptability of competitor products.

aiming to provide quality products that satisfy customers in emerging countries in the years ahead, we will build an even
stronger foundation for quality companywide.

accident report
progress in response to incidents related to ff-type kerosene heaters
in 2005, five product safety incidents occurred involving ff-type kerosene heaters manufactured by panasonic from 1985
to 1992, exposing customers to carbon monoxide poisoning that resulted in hospitalization and accidental death.
panasonic has taken these incidents very seriously and has continued to take every possible measure and precaution to
prevent their reoccurrence.

following these incidents, we commenced emergency measures and have been working to discover, repair, and replace
these products. we have also been continuing a program of comprehensive public announcements through television and
leaflets and by making door-to-door visits to households and businesses that may be using these corresponding heaters.

continuing in fiscal 2014, led by the staff of the corporate ff customer support & management division, we engaged in
search activities ("local search activities") to find products that have not yet been located, to step up the recovery of
products from customers who had their units inspected or repaired in the past, and to confirm the condition of products
before the winter arrived.

the local search activities focused on the following:
1. surveys of stores that handled these products;
2. door-to-door surveys of all residences in the specified areas; and 3. reexamine past survey data.

we also continued to run comprehensive public announcements, particularly at the beginning and at the end of winter,
which included nationwide newspaper inserts and the utilization of town plus, a direct mailing service, to approximately
2.13 million households in cold weather districts.

in fiscal 2014, we added 469 units to our list of products discovered or confirmed to have been discarded. in total, 116,826
units were recorded, bringing the percentage of total units recalled to 76.8% as of march 31, 2014.

we are still finding products every month, some of which are units that customers have continued to use unrepaired and
without realizing their potential harm. with the help and cooperation of those involved, we will continue our search until we
find every last unit.

customers: customer satisfaction

policy
our basic approach to customer satisfaction
since its foundation, panasonic's management philosophy has been to contribute to society through its products and
services while always placing the customer first. based on this philosophy, we aim for higher customer satisfaction by
developing and offering products, solutions and services that benefit the lifestyles of customers around the world.

our customer service is based on the principles of true service that have been handed down from the founder of
panasonic－to sincerely, accurately and swiftly address customer needs with humility and appreciation. the goal of
customer service is to earn the trust and confidence of the customer while providing them with happiness and peace of
mind.

 the fundamental concept of customer satisfaction(the pursuit of customer satisfaction)
 the only way for those of us engaged in business to earn trust is to have everyone, regardless of whether they are
 working in the manufacturing division or the sales division, cater completely to the demands of the customers on all
 points and work strictly under the basic rule of producing or selling not even one product that cannot perform its
 function well.
 perfection can be reached only by paying careful attention not only to the manufacturing details but also to where our
 products are going and making efforts to completely satisfy the customers and provide flawless service.

 service philosophy(true service)
 the customer's satisfaction is our satisfaction.
 true service resides in mutual satisfaction.
 service is an integral part of any business. a business that does not provide service is no business at all.
 service, therefore, is the duty and obligation of any business person. but, there's nothing more aggravating than
 service provided only out of a sense of duty. customers can sense it.
 service means satisfying customers, and when we satisfy our customers, we in turn find satisfaction in a job well done.
 satisfied customers and satisfied employees. this is what constitutes true service.

rules and system
measures to improve quality of our customer relations
basic regulations for customer relations
based on its customer first management philosophy, panasonic responds to all customers with the same high level of
service quality in accordance with its established standards. in order to increase customer satisfaction and win their trust,
panasonic has drawn up basic regulations for customer relations (based on the jis q 10002 standard) that detail how

quality of its responsiveness to customer concerns.


fostering a customer-oriented corporate culture
panasonic is proactive about obtaining advisory specialist for consumers' affairs* qualifications for the purpose of
fostering a corporate culture of putting the customer first. as of april 1, 2014, 414 employees of the panasonic group had
obtained this qualification, the highest number among japanese companies for the fifth straight year.


* advisory specialist for consumers' affairs system
this qualification is a business certification from the offices of the prime minister and minister of economy, trade and industry, with assessments
and verifications undertaken by the japan industrial association. the system aims to foster people able to act as a bridge between consumers,
companies and government, by being able to quickly give the appropriate advice to consumers in response to their inquiries and complaints, and
then convey their opinions in proposals to corporate management and government officials. (source: the japan industrial association homepage
(in japanese only).)


trends in the number of advisory specialists for consumers’ affairs system accreditation




learning from customer opinions (voc activity)
at panasonic, we view the voice of customers (voc), which are assembled from customers feedback received by the
customer care center as well as contact with salespeople and partners, showrooms and service companies, as priceless
sources of information for developing products, improving product functions, enhancing quality, updating user manuals
and catalogs, and enhancing marketing activities.

using a range of methods, we analyze voc to detect areas in need of continuous improvement, and this data is fed back
to product planning, design, engineering, and quality divisions, as well as marketing and sales divisions.

these voc activities are a key element of the panasonic management philosophy of improving customer satisfaction,
and we are moving toward having all of our employees be conscious of the voc in all of their work activities.

customers: corporate communications in advertising

policy
specifically, our aim is to provide fair and accurate information to our customers and various other stakeholders, and at
the same time continually listen to and observe the public to learn from them and reflect their opinions in our business,
marketing, and sales activities. we will also not make representations that are deceptive, misleading, fraudulent, or unfair.
our advertisements shall not be defamatory or of a political or religious nature. finally, we aim to develop and
demonstrate both our creativity and innovation in our corporate communication activities and impress on consumers that
they can trust our brands.

basic approach to advertising
advertising activities reflect the belief of founder konosuke matsushita that "we contribute to society through our business
activities." the fundamental stance taken from this is that manufacturers producing quality products have a responsibility
to disseminate information about those products broadly, accurately, and as quickly as possible.

this responsibility is even greater today. giving the public information about all corporate activities, in addition to products,
has become an important social responsibility. panasonic's advertising activities fully reflect this broader responsibility.

compliance with advertising laws and regulations
panasonic conducts advertising activities in compliance with local laws, regulations, industry rules and other guidelines in
every region to prevent any misunderstandings and misconceptions.

in japan, for instance, our advertisements conform to provisions of the law for preventing unjustifiable lagniappes and
misleading representation and other advertising laws and regulations.

we also comply with the "advertisers' ethical code" of the japan advertisers association, standards established by media
companies and other guidelines. to comply with laws and guidelines, we have on-the-job training programs for employees
and hold seminars and other events for significant revisions to advertising laws and regulations. this ensures that
advertising personnel have a thorough understanding of how to perform their jobs.

panasonic companies also take part in classes and seminars held by other companies and organizations and, when
necessary, seek the input of specialists from outside the group.

guidelines and approaches to production of advertisements
panasonic uses the following guidelines and approaches for television commercials, newspaper advertisements and other
advertising activities.

• advertising should convey the true spirit of a company
• provide information that is accurate and easy to understand
• never use inappropriate or annoying advertisements

that permit the efficient use of advertising budgets.

fair operating practices: management approach

working to improve ethical consciousness of employees in adhering to the antitrust act
and preventing corruption
with brisk corporate activities on a global scale crossing national borders, scandals have frequently occurred due to
insufficient awareness and oversight among related parties, in addition to intentional illicit and criminal behavior.
meanwhile, some countries and regions do not have robust legal systems, and employees working at companies that
conduct important transactions in these countries and regions must remain highly conscious about these issues.

on a worldwide basis, panasonic enforces strict adherence to laws, regulations and corporate ethics, centered on the
panasonic code of conduct, which covers the essentials such as the organisation for economic co-operation and
development (oecd) guidelines for multinational enterprises, in order to promote fair business practices and realize a
sustainable society in countries and regions around the world.

compliance to the code of conduct is overseen globally through collaboration among legal affairs departments
established at each divisional company, business division, and overseas regional headquarters, directors and executive
officers in charge of adherence to the code of conduct, as well as managers in charge of fair trade, export control, and
functional groups.

the compliance committee, composed of directors, executive officers and corporate auditors, steers deliberations on
measures to ensure compliance with the antitrust act and to prevent corruption.

panasonic has designated september as compliance awareness month, during which it strives to embed awareness of
ethical and legal compliance issues among employees. we also conduct a compliance awareness survey during the
month to assess the level of awareness of our employees around the world. panasonic confirms once a year that the
code of conduct is being followed and applied as intended at all of its sites around the world.

in addition, panasonic has set up hotlines at its sites inside and outside japan, as well as a whistleblowing system for
business partners, in order to prevent and quickly resolve scandals.

 institution," that must strive to fulfill its social responsibilities. in addition to listening to stakeholders' opinions, we must conduct
 our business activities transparently in order to be accountable. in short, we must continue to be fair, truthful, honest and swift
 in taking action to comply with our social responsibilities.

 (1) compliance with laws, regulations and business ethics
 we will conduct business with integrity, a law-abiding spirit, and the highest ethical standards.

 moreover, we remain steadfast in our attitude to oppose any illegal group or organization.


 (3) thorough observation of relevant laws and regulations to ensure that all employees observe applicable laws and
 regulations and respect their spirit, we will establish appropriate in-house codes and promote employee understanding through
 seminars and training.

 superior, or to the legal affairs section or other relevant section, or via an in-house notification hotline. whistleblowers shall be
 protected from dismissal, demotion, or any other retaliatory treatment because of their well-intentioned reporting of possible
 violations of any law or regulation. we will ensure thorough and confidential treatment of information reported.

charge of adherence to the code of conduct, as well as managers in charge of fair trade, export control, and functional
groups.

fair operating practices: rules and system

fair trade
rules concerning activities and relationships with competitors
panasonic has rules concerning activities with competitors that were drawn up in 2008 to prevent cartels, bid rigging and
behavior that invites suspicion of these activities. these rules apply to all group employees.

the rules encompass the following.
• prohibition of cartels, bid rigging and behavior that invites suspicion of these activities, such as exchanging information
  and making arrangements for product prices, quantities, performance and specifications
• mandatory rejection of inappropriate behavior and reporting of possible violations of these rules
• actions to take if there is a violation, and an internal leniency policy


prior informed consent
panasonic has a prior informed consent system in place, mandating that division directors and legal managers are
informed prior to directors and employees establishing contact with competitors.


prevention of corruption
prohibition of bribery of public officials
panasonic has had rules in place since 2010 concerning interactions with public officials that prohibit the bribery of public
officials and behavior that arouses suspicion of gift-giving.

these rules state that employees must not offer, promise, propose, or consent to anything that may benefit public officials
in order to obtain or retain a business transaction.

the rules also lay out specific standards and approval processes for meals/entertainment and other benefits while
meeting with public officials. the rules prohibit direct payoffs to public officials, as well as indirect payoffs to public officials
through consultants, agencies, lobbyists and other business partners. accordingly, the utmost care must be taken when
evaluating and selecting business partners, and provisions prohibiting such bribery must be included in contracts with
business partners.

if behavior in violation of these rules is discovered, the behavior is strictly dealt with while actions are swiftly taken to
remedy the situation.


entertainment expenses
expenditures for gifts to customers and business entertainment must follow a process that requires prior authorization,
follow-up reports and confirmation that the expense was not for a public official. these rules are a part of our thorough
efforts to prevent corruptive behavior before it can happen.


ensuring transparency in political contributions
following nippon keidanren (japan economic federation) 's perspective on political contributions, our purpose is to
encourage policy integrity, the healthy development of representative democracy, and transparency in political donations,
in the establishment of strict rules on political contributions.

our political donations follow the rule of relevant laws, such as the political funds control act. at the same time, we
undertake appropriate screening measures to confirm in advance that the recipients of donations are engaging in
legitimate political activities and belong to organizations with which we can concur.

in japan, political organizations are required by law to disclose income and expenditures of political funds. this
information can be found in official gazettes, prefectural government publications, and websites.


fair procurement activities
in rules concerning business entertainment provided by suppliers, etc., panasonic has strict rules governing business
transactions that prohibit the acceptance of after-hours dining and entertainment, monetary gifts, merchandise, real
estate, accommodations and other forms of payoffs from current or potential future business partners from which



                                                                137

panasonic purchases goods or services.

in the event that a violation of these rules is discovered, it must be reported to one’s manager and relevant divisions such
as the personnel and legal affairs departments, or through a hotline established in accordance with internal reporting
rules. disciplinary action is also taken with persons found to have violated the rules.




                                                            138

fair operating practices: performance evaluation and development

appointing directors and executive officers responsible for ensuring compliance
with the panasonic code of conduct and obtaining written pledges
directors and executive officers are appointed at each divisional company, business division, subsidiary, as well as head
office division and overseas subsidiary to ensure thoroughgoing compliance with the company’s code of conduct. at the
same time, steps are taken to carry out appropriate education and training.

the code of conduct is distributed to all employees and is always available for reading. a written pledge to follow the
code is obtained from directors, executive officers and employees regarding observance of the code of conduct when
he/she enters the company, assumes an executive position or the code of conduct is revised. if a countries’ laws,
regulations or other restrictions make it difficult or improper for panasonic to obtain a written pledge, we make sure
employees have received a copy of the code of conduct and related training.


compliance awareness month and the compliance committee
the panasonic group has designated september as compliance awareness month, during which it addresses risks and
strives to embed awareness of ethical and legal compliance issues among employees around the world. amid changes in
business conditions and our operations over the past few years, compliance awareness month has provided an
opportunity to sharpen our efforts as we get an accurate grasp of evolving risks in specific business fields, divisions,
countries and regions, as well as uncover signs of possible legal violations and misconduct.

during the month, we emphasize the importance of compliance throughout the organization through the communication of
ethical and legal compliance policies as well as our stance by core management, including company presidents, business
division directors and regional representatives.

we also conduct a compliance awareness survey for employees during the month.

since it was established in fiscal 2004, the compliance committee has been headed by the president and comprised of
directors, executive officers and corporate auditors. the compliance committee ensures the thorough implementation of
companywide compliance measures, such as compliance with the antitrust act as well as the prevention of corruption,
and checks on the current status of efforts at relevant business divisions.


compliance training
employees undergo training on the panasonic code of conduct when they enter the company, receive a promotion, and
on other occasions.

in addition, panasonic publishes the compliance guidebook as a tool for the practical application of the code of conduct.
having undergone several revisions since it was first published in october 2006, the compliance guidebook explains in
easy-to-understand examples how employees should conduct their daily work activities, comply with laws and regulations,
and meet the expectations of society. it includes 54 subjects considered especially important from a compliance
standpoint.

in addition to the panasonic code of conduct, we provide e-learning courses about compliance, including compliance
with various laws and regulations.


examination and reporting of annual adherence to and application of the
code of conduct
in order to embed a plan-do-check-act (pdca) cycle into compliance, it is important to constantly monitor the
effectiveness of implemented measures and the degree to which they have become established practices. for this
reason, panasonic confirms once a year that the code of conduct is being followed and applied as intended at all of its
sites around the world.

specifically, panasonic confirms that directors and executive officers have been appointed to ensure adherence to the



                                                             139

code of conduct, education and training is given on matters related to the code of conduct, and written pledges to follow
the code of conduct are obtained from employees. these findings are reported to the auditing company as a part of
internal control audits.



whistleblowing system
panasonic has put in place the following systems for handling the internal reporting of compliance issues.

panasonic has a business ethics hotline for both japan and overseas; an equal employment opportunity office for
reporting gender-related matters and sexual harassment; a fair trade hotline for reporting monopolistic behavior; an
internal control promotion office hotline for improper accounting practices; and a fair business hotline for our suppliers
and customers. moreover, there is a procedure to report financial and accounting matters to the board of corporate
auditors.

the panasonic code of conduct states that whistleblowers shall be protected from dismissal, demotion, or any other
retaliatory treatment because of their well-intentioned reporting of possible violations of any law or regulation. we will
ensure thorough and confidential treatment of all information reported. employees can raise concerns through any of
these hotlines confidentially without fear of retaliation. the company accepts anonymous reporting if a response is
unnecessary (this excludes some hotlines).

overseas, in addition to an overseas business ethics hotline, panasonic also has regional reporting systems in north
america, europe, asia and latin america.

panasonic strives to create an environment that facilitates the use of hotlines, and has contracted with external,
independent service companies to provide 24-hour hotlines 365 days a year in europe.




                                                             140

fair operating practices: performance

compliance evaluations
implementation of compliance awareness survey
panasonic conducts a compliance awareness survey once a year on its employees, questioning them about globally
shared topics such as compliance, information security and risk management, as well as unique subjects based on
conditions at each divisional company, business site and region. the results of the surveys are analyzed by region,
company and employee's position/title, and the outcome is used in the planning of compliance-related measures as well
as in solving challenges.

in fiscal 2014, we had 118,000 respondents to the survey in japan and 37,000 overseas, for a total of 155,000 people in
over 45 countries/regions that speak 18 different languages.

for example, panasonic formulated a medium-term action plan through fiscal 2016 based on the results of the survey
conducted in fiscal 2014 for asia, which has been positioned as a strategic overseas region for the company. legal
systems are at different stages of maturity depending on the country and region within asia, making it a region with a high
risk of corruption. in this business environment, panasonic has strengthened operations and engaged in fair operating
practices in its solutions business, including btob and btog areas. the compliance awareness survey in asia served to
confirm 1) an ongoing fostering of awareness of compliance, 2) a need to reinforce compliance education, and 3)
differences in compliance awareness by country. based on these results, panasonic has decided to incorporate into its
medium-term action plan and daily business activities 1) the creation of compliance action guidelines and implementation
of education campaigns at regional head offices, 2) initiatives to improve e-learning and training programs in the language
of each country, and 3) measures to strengthen ties among the legal affairs divisions in the region while raising
performance through compliance audits.


implementation of compliance e-learning
in fiscal 2014, employees that attended compliance-related e-learning courses numbered 23,000 in japan and 14,000
overseas, for a grand total of 37,000 people in 27 countries/regions with 17 different languages spoken.


report on violations in fiscal 2014
panasonic agreed with the u.s. department of justice and the competition bureau canada to pay fines for violating
antitrust laws regarding certain automotive components for certain customers. in addition, panasonic also agreed to pay
fines to the u.s. department of justice for a subsidiary that violated u.s. antitrust laws relating to the cylindrical lithium ion
battery cells used in notebook computer battery packs.

the panasonic group takes these matters seriously and has taken steps to strengthen its compliance programs. it is the
policy of all companies within the panasonic group to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including u.s.
antitrust laws.

human rights: management approach

treating not just our employees, but our customers and stakeholders with the utmost
concern and respect is the underlying principle of our business activities
business and human rights issues have attracted vigorous debate since the surge in economic activities that extend well
beyond traditional national boundaries in the 1990s. more recently in 2011, the united nations issued its “guiding
principles on business and human rights” (generally referred to as the ruggie framework). a substantial number of
companies around the world have incorporated this framework into their efforts to promote business development.

against this backdrop, panasonic also engages in business activities that place the utmost emphasis on respecting
human rights. this emphasis extends across every facet of the company’s global business endeavors from the
recruitment of personnel from around the world to the worldwide supply of a wealth of products and services in
partnerships with worldwide suppliers.

panasonic has clearly stipulated the need to respect human rights and do its best to understand, acknowledge and
respect the diverse cultures, religions, mindsets, laws and regulations of people in the different countries and regions
where the company conducts its business in the panasonic code of conduct. moreover, panasonic supports the basic
principles of the universal declaration of human rights, the international labour organization declaration on
fundamental principles and rights at work, the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd)
guidelines for multinational enterprises as well as other guidelines. the essence of these principles has also been
incorporated into the company's code of conduct.

meanwhile, panasonic consults with the guiding principles on business and human rights endorsed by the united
nations human rights council in june 2011. as a member of the japan business council in europe (jbce), panasonic
also submits public comments regarding the ict sector guidance being drafted by the european commission. based on
these initiatives, the company is adopting the proactive approach of accurately reflecting global trends and conditions into
its management and operating activities.

in concert with its employees as well as its worldwide network of suppliers and business partners, panasonic is looking to
gain an accurate understanding of the laws and labor practices of each country. at the same time, the company will
pursue business activities while working to consistently improve labor-management relations.

human rights: rules and system

prohibition of child labor and forced labor
prohibition of child labor
in its employee hiring process, panasonic follows the laws and regulations of the country and strictly monitors compliance
with respect to fundamental human rights.

the company takes comprehensive steps to verify the ages of employees in china and asia to avoid any possibility of
employing child labor.


respect for human rights of immigrant workers
panasonic hires immigrant workers both on a full-time and temporary staffing basis in accordance with the laws and
regulations of each country. this is to ensure that work is not undertaken against an individual’s will and that work
conditions remain fair and equal.


prohibition of discrimination and humane treatment
hiring rules
panasonic has stipulated in its hiring rules and regulations that its hiring process will be based on the qualifications, skills
and ambitions of applicants, without regard to their age, gender or nationality. to ensure strict adherence to the provisions
of these rules, interviewers are trained to select applicants in a fair manner based on the hiring and human rights
manual published by the employment security bureau of the ministry of health, labour and welfare.

employee work rules
panasonic has clearly stipulated in its employee work rules that employees must respect human rights and that illegal
behavior is strictly prohibited. the rules also strictly prohibit sexual harassment and other inhumane behavior at the
workplace. employees that violate these and other rules are subject to disciplinary action.


initiatives aimed at ensuring equal employment
panasonic is dedicated to maintaining working environments where people from diverse backgrounds in terms of gender,
age and nationality can easily work together in a spirit of mutual respect, treating each other as valued partners. we
therefore will not tolerate gender discrimination or sexual harassment, and power harassment, and use the following
measures to prevent these problems.
• establishment of sexual harassment policies and programs to explain these policies to employees
• distribution of sexual harassment leaflets and manuals
• seminars and training sessions about workplace culture, sexual harassment and power harassment


operation of an equal employment opportunity office
panasonic established an equal employment opportunity office as a point of contact for employees to seek advice
regarding issues relating to human rights including sexual discrimination. in addition to assigning full-time consultants,
consultation desks have been established at each divisional company and business division in an effort to provide a
place for employees to go and discuss their concerns about equal employment opportunities, sexual harassment, power
harassment and a wide range of other topics.


stance toward financial penalties in connection with disciplinary rules
if financial penalties are allowed under the laws or regulations of a country or region, panasonic views them as an
optional disciplinary measure, in so far as the penalty procedures and amount are within the scope of the laws, do not
overly impair the livelihood of the employee, are clearly described in the corporate rules and standards or the employee
handbook, and are widely known and understood by the employees.




                                                              146

management of work hours and wages
employee work rules
based on the labor standards act and union agreements, panasonic has clarified core employment terms and conditions
including work hours, break times, overtime work, holidays and vacations in its rules of employment.


rules about employee compensation
based on the labor standards act and union agreements, panasonic has put in place employee salary regulations that
clarify core issues relating to compensation including wages and salaries, allowances for commuting expenses, etc.,
bonuses and other forms of one-time compensation, and retirement benefits.


management of work hours
panasonic diligently follows the laws and regulations of each country with regard to working hours, holidays and break
times, and has a work hour management system for administrative purposes. panasonic also takes a comprehensive
approach to managing the health of its employees.

our overseas affiliates operate their own work management systems.

in china for example, employees punch timecards and management double checks the data to make sure the correct
number of hours worked is recorded. we use the system to make sure employees do not work excessively long hours,
optimally allocate human resources, and encourage employees to take better care of their health.


management of wages
to ensure the proper payment of salaries and wages to employees, labor unions in japan survey their members once a
year about their wages to make sure the results of wage negotiations between labor and management are correctly
reflected in the paychecks of their members.

outside japan, panasonic has established rules to ensure strict adherence to all wage-related laws and regulations,
including those related to the minimum wage, statutory benefits, and excessive work, on an individual country basis.
managing wages in accordance with these rules, the company directly pays its employees according to a set schedule
and notifies them of the payment via pay statements and electronic data.


respect for freedom of association, right to collective bargaining
our policy and supplier requirements
as a corporation, panasonic respects freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, which it regards as
essential components of fundamental human rights.

in countries and regions that recognize the formation of labor unions, such as japan for example, panasonic corporation
and the panasonic group workers unions association are bound by labor agreements that recognize the unions' right to
organize, right to collective bargaining, and right to dispute.

in countries and regions that do not recognize the formation of labor unions either by law or in actual practice, panasonic
works to practically resolve issues in dialogue between labor and management, in the spirit of the freedom of association
and right to collective bargaining and in accordance with our code of conduct. we also clearly state in standard
purchase agreement with suppliers that we require them to follow the same principles.

standard purchase agreement
 (requirement for suppliers to respect human rights)
 the company works to resolve issues and build sound relationships with its own employees through proactive and
 sincere dialogue.


initiatives in various regions and countries
japan
panasonic has a union shop system where new employees are automatically registered as members of labor unions. the
panasonic group workers unions association and panasonic corporation have signed labor agreements and basic
contracts.

as of march 31, 2014, the panasonic group workers unions association had a total of 98,653 members.

in the context of employee participation in management’s decision-making process, important management issues at
panasonic are discussed in advance with the labor union, and management-labor committees are established as forums
for people to express their opinions on these issues. important decisions are explained to labor union leaders, and labor-
management councils are held to provide an opportunity for people to express their approval or dissent.

both the management-labor committees and labor-management councils are held regularly at the corporate level,
company level, and business division level. the top management level management-labor committee is held once a
month and is attended by the president, executive officer in charge of personnel, and the head of the labor union's
central executive committee. the top-management level labor-management council is held twice a year and is attended
by all executive officers at the level of managing director or above and the members of the labor union's central
executive committee.

while a minimum notification period has not been stipulated, in the event that an important matter such as the
implementation of a structural reform requiring deliberation should arise, thoroughgoing deliberations shall be undertaken
at each level on a daily basis until a reasonable settlement is reached between management and labor after the
application is made.


europe
following an eu directive* adopted in 1994, the company established the panasonic european employee congress and
reached a voluntary labor-management agreement to maintain sound relations between labor and management.

in fiscal 2014, 35 representatives from labor and 14 representatives from management gathered in amsterdam, the
netherlands, and had lively discussions about management strategy and business issues, exchanging information and
opinions.

* eu directive: a directive that obliges all companies employing 1,000 or more employees in two or more countries of the european union to
 establish a pan-european labor-management consultation committee.


china
in china, the ratio of labor unions at private-sector companies is widely dispersed, but most panasonic group companies
there have organized labor groups (associations). while these labor associations have not been organized on an
integrated group-wide basis, efforts are being made to establish amicable relations between labor and management on a
company unit basis.

this mainly entails periodic discussions between labor and management and recreational activities among labor and
management. important management decisions by the company are implemented after an explanatory briefing with
employees, which facilitates business development and better relations between labor and management.




                                                                     148

our approach to the california transparency in supply chains act of 2010
in 2010, the state of california passed the california transparency in supply chains act of 2010. the law came into effect
in january 2012 with the aim of improving for consumers the visibility of corporate efforts to eradicate slavery and human
trafficking. the law applies to retailers and manufacturers that do business in california and have global sales of over
$100 million annually, obligating these companies to disclose on their websites their efforts to prevent human trafficking.

panasonic has affirmed that it is adhering to this law and has ascertained the status of its efforts on this front, as a part of
the panasonic code of conduct. we have also required our suppliers to do the same in our standard purchase
agreements with them.

in addition to conducting an annual review of the details that have been confirmed through assessments undertaken prior
to the commencement of transactions, steps are taken to issue remedial instructions or review or cancel transactions
depending on the severity of any breach by a supplier.

 standard purchase agreement (requirement that suppliers respect human rights)
 our standard purchase agreement requires that suppliers will comply with the laws and regulations of countries and
 regions in which business activities are undertaken, and that suppliers will not engage in forced labor, child labor,
 illegal employment of foreign workers or other unlawful/inappropriate labor practices. the agreement also has
 stipulations about employment conditions, including wages and work hours.

international, an ngo in the united states. it details the criteria that employers must satisfy on their own to comply with
the standard, including the rights of workers and labor conditions at the workplace, and related management systems.
panasonic has worked actively to address each of the eight criteria required by the sa8000 standard and implemented
related management systems. information on the status of the company’s efforts is posted on the following website.

human rights: performance evaluation and development

code of conduct training
panasonic conducts training on the issue of human rights as stipulated in its code of conduct. in addition to training for
employees who have newly entered the company, staff participate in periodic training at the time of each promotion.

▶ fair operating practices; performance evaluation and development http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/sustainability/fair_practices/assessment/



overseas human resources and labor assessment
in promoting its business in each country throughout the world, panasonic demonstrates its respect for human rights by
adhering strictly to the laws and regulations of each country and ensuring a thorough understanding of its code of
conduct.

in addition, panasonic introduced its overseas human resources and labor assessment system in 2007 to identify,
understand and resolve issues relating to overseas human resources and labor management. as a part of this
assessment system, a survey, which contains a checklist of approximately 300 items, is undertaken to ascertain whether
labor management is properly conducted and consistent with local labor laws as well as local employment systems and
practices. the survey also helps to identify whether there are any potential labor-related risk factors that may have a
detrimental effect on business or give rise to trouble.

after local companies undertake a self-assessment based on this checklist, assessors or officers charged with
assessment responsibility from the relevant company or business division in japan completes a final check with the
support of regional headquarters. assessor leaders (generally personnel officers) play a leading role in resolving any
issues that are identified by the assessment. every effort is made to enhance the level of labor management. assessor
training courses are held regularly to develop assessors and systematically improve their checking skills.

assessments have been conducted at 20 companies in china, 13 companies in asia and four companies in other regions
for a total of 37 bases up to fiscal 2014.

looking ahead, we will enhance our labor management capabilities by promoting close collaboration between japan and
overseas countries. in this manner, we will further deepen the respect we hold for human rights throughout our business
as a whole.




                                                                         151

equal employment opportunity office
the equal employment opportunity office fields the inquiries and concerns of employees concerning equal employment
opportunities and a wide range of related issues. at the same time, the office conducts surveys and analyzes information
as the basis of efforts aimed at resolving workplace issues and creating a comfortable working environment. for example,
the company conducted a training session for managers in fiscal 2014 in an effort to reinvigorate panasonic’s workplace
culture. after completing the session, 97% of participants commented in a post-seminar survey that the training helped to
raise awareness. in addition to such positive comments from respondents as “i was able to again recognize the
importance of the initial response and to better understand the details of essential measures,” “the seminar was an
excellent opportunity to reassess my own language and behavior” and “i would like to work with colleagues put in place a
workplace environment of mutual respect and communication,” the company received various proposals to improve the
activities of the office. proposals included the need to expand the scope of training and to increase the frequency of
seminars held.

labor practices: management approach

based on our management philosophy, “develop people before making products,” we
promote a corporate culture in which every employee can display his or her abilities.
 “people” are the source of growth for all companies. accordingly, without a trained staff, business expansion is impossible.
panasonic gathers together men and women of differing ages and nationalities, and fosters an atmosphere to enable them
to reach their full potential, which is indispensable for ceaselessly creating innovative value.

panasonic maintains the management philosophy "people are the foundation of business. develop people before making
products." recognizing the importance of human resource development since its foundation, panasonic opened the
matsushita electric staff training school in 1934. this recognition is currently specified in the panasonic code of conduct:
"the basis of management is people," we are committed to developing human resources with outstanding specialties,
creativity and a challenging spirit, as well as to developing our own abilities through personnel systems, employee education
and training.” we make every effort to promote this principle in group companies both in japan and overseas.

based on this concept, we apply our worldwide “human resources development policy” to promote specific personnel
training programs. included in this policy, “requirements for all panasonic group employees” and “basic guidelines for
managers” clearly specify helpful hints to managers in this area.

in addition, panasonic has positioned “promoting diversity” as an important management policy and established the “global
diversity policy” in order to create new value by enabling its diverse global personnel to fully utilize their various talents.
putting these policies into action, we seek the best qualified people for each of our businesses irrespective of age, gender,
nationality, and then provide training, systematic career development and appointment, while promoting the global
unification of panasonic’s personnel systems.

maintaining safe workplaces in which employees feel comfortable is a key responsibility of companies. panasonic has
established the activity guidelines for occupational safety and health program. included in this is the “occupational safety
and health declaration,” which states: “based on the basic management philosophy of respecting people, panasonic
corporation is committed to creating safe and healthy workplaces, both physically and mentally, through appropriate and
careful attention and consistent effort.” in addition, panasonic is developing on a global scale an occupational safety and
health management system that adopts ohsas 18001, the international standard for occupational health and safety, as
its applicable standard, as well as obtaining external ohsas 18001 certification where applicable.

labor practices: policy

basic approach of human resources
"people are the foundation of business. develop people before making products." throughout its history, panasonic has
consistently placed priority on human resource development based on this philosophy.

the core element of our human resources policy is building win-win relationships between the company and employees
through a variety of initiatives based on the principles of participative management, evaluations based on performance,
and respect for employees. in essence, this approach means that we are simultaneously pursuing two objectives:
sustaining growth in business performance and allowing employees to achieve their self-fulfillment through their work.

this is how we go about making panasonic worker-friendly, more fulfilling work environment.


our approach to human resources is based on one of the elements of our management philosophy: "people are
the foundation of business. develop people before making products"

policy
panasonic code of conduct (excerpt)
panasonic outlines its approach to human resources development in chapter 3: employee relations of the panasonic
code of conduct.
 chapter 3: employee relations
 the company will respect human dignity and strive to provide an environment that encourages employees to realize their full
 potential. the company will respect each employee's personality and motivation and, in appropriate circumstances, try to offer
 matching opportunities in other regions. by building such mutually benefiting relations between the company and its
 employees, we will carry out the basic business philosophy.

   with outstanding specialties, creativity and a challenging spirit, as well as to developing our own abilities through personnel
   systems, employee education and training.
 2. we will respect each individual's personality and individuality, while at the same time working to maintain and improve a
   system that develops the diverse qualities of employees.

 4. managers will fulfill their tasks based on the recognition that personnel development is their most important responsibility.


 ▶ click here for more information on chapter 3:employee relations http://panasonic.net/corporate/philosophy/code/17.html


basic approach of human resources development
as indicated by the phrase "business lies in people," growth and development of business cannot be realized without the
development of people.

human resource development should be carried out through daily management and it is one of the most fundamental
responsibilities of managers. managers should keep in mind that in order to bring innovation to others, the manager must
take the initiative to bring innovation to oneself. it is important to carry out human resource development appropriately to
enhance the quality of staff members and to stimulate their personal growth.

therefore panasonic created its "human resources policy" in 1957, which includes "basic purpose of human resources
development," "requirements for all panasonic group employees," and "basic guideline for managers." in order to apply
these policies globally, we created "human resources development policy" in 2012, which contains the basic philosophy
in more understandable phrases and has been made more concise.

panasonic provides helpful hints to managers through the "requirements for all panasonic group employees"—which
includes “always show challenging spirit,” “keep thinking and acting innovatively” and “respect diversity and inclusion”—
and the “basic guidelines for managers”—which includes “show clear leadership based on strong beliefs,” “encourage
others to develop themselves,” “create workplaces where diversity is valued and respected” and “appreciate staff
members for their efforts.”

the human resources development policy is informed to all employees in the panasonic group to promote the growth of
each individual and create a climate conducive to personal growth.

as part of our efforts, we established the career creation program to assist in internal recruitment and offer employees
challenging opportunities. this program includes e-challenge (skill-based recruiting) for business divisions in need of
new personnel to recruit people with the necessary skills from within the company, and e-appeal challenge (direct appeal
system) for employees to directly apply to the business divisions in which they would like to work. these programs serve
as a career creation scheme to support motivated individuals regardless of age, gender, or nationality.


measuring the effects of training
hrdc tries to gauge course effectiveness by skill testing before employees attend training courses and after each course
unit; to gauge effectiveness in terms of employee satisfaction and business utilization level by questionnaire; and to gauge
educational effectiveness by combining skills visualization by in-house and national certification.

for example, in order to strengthen panasonic’s manufacturing capabilities, follow-up surveys are conducted at
manufacturing facilities that participated in manufacturing assessor training courses to quantitatively calculate reductions
in production lead times and subsequent decreases in inventories. this is one method we use to measure the
effectiveness of our training programs.

for medium- to long-term training, hrdc tries to link promotion and performance indices by feeding back to the
workplace information on the number of days lectures were attended, training achievements, and reports.


reflecting employee awareness
as part of its efforts to improve employee satisfaction, panasonic implements annual employee opinion surveys, the
results of which are reflected in its training programs. for instance, the fiscal 2014 survey revealed a decline in employee
confidence regarding the skills necessary to carry out their duties amid changing business operations and increasing
globalization. against this backdrop, panasonic is developing and implementing training programs that enable employees
to continue carrying out their duties with a sense of enthusiasm, even in new fields that require experience and skills
different from before.

global diversity policy
to develop the business as a global corporation, we recognize the importance of human resource development as well as
promoting a corporate culture in which every employee can promote the growth of individual without regard for age,
gender, or nationality. so panasonic positioned "promoting diversity" as one of the core management initiatives and
promote for creating worker-friendly environment as well as providing opportunities to the personnel who has his/her
willingness and ability.

in fiscal 2011, this approach was summarized in our global diversity policy. we are engaging in activities both globally
and group-wide.


 global diversity policy
 panasonic group is now one of the world's leading business groups which offer a wide variety of products in electronic
 business areas related to our daily lives. with an aim to contribute to progress in society and to enrich people's lives
 through manufacturing, every employee plays a leading role in their job and promoting business activities of panasonic.
 panasonic is a group of people who have various regional, cultural and historical backgrounds. although all people are
 different in nationality, age and gender, they all have their own individuality and abilities. each person has various
 different ideas, and by sharing these ideas across countries and business areas, we can create more innovative
 values. thus, panasonic will continue to be a group which always gathers wisdom and spurs innovation with the
 concerned efforts of all. we have a strong hope that using our diverse mindsets and viewpoints we can deliver
 products and services like no other in the world to our customers.
 in order to achieve this, it is important to give a chance for success to motivated people of all countries and regions,
 regardless of their gender, nationality or any other characteristics. we have expanded our diversity activities to make
 the best of the individuality and abilities of each employee and to support their success towards the group on a global
 basis. we will continue to take up the challenge of becoming "no.1 in diversity promoting activities in each country and
 region."

diversity promotion manager
in 1999 panasonic began its equal partnership initiative, and since this time, we have been promoting the creation of an
open, fair, work environment－one that does not discriminate based on gender, age, or nationality-through the



                                                                    160

establishment of the panasonic positive action program, special training programs for women, and the establishment of
the equal opportunity employment officer.

then in 2001, the initiative to appoint women to positions of responsibility－previously the crusade of the personnel
groups－was recognized as an engine of diversity for the entire organization. subsequently, as one of the management
policies to change the corporate climate by facilitating the participation of women in management, the corporate equal
partnership division (currently the corporate diversity promotion office) was established directly under the office of the
president.

in 2006, the corporate diversity promotion division was established and since then its focus areas have become wide
ranging, extending beyond gender to include differences in age and nationality. currently, the human resources &
industrial relations group maintains a diversity promotion manager who implements measures intended to create a
highly diversified workplace culture centered on supporting active roles for female employees.


rules and system
initiatives to maintain a good work-life balance that supports diverse working styles
as part of panasonic's efforts to create an environment that enables diverse personnel to play an active role, we are
implementing initiatives to support a good work-life balance for employees.

in addition, panasonic has created an environment that allows employees easy access to programs that support parents
in managing both work and child-rearing. this includes measures complying with japan's law for measures to support
the development of the next generation. examples include sections on the company intranet that supply information to
help men who are raising children, and provide useful information on maintaining the proper balance between job and
household responsibilities.


<examples of work-life balance support systems>
child care leave
a total of two years of leave is available until the end of april immediately after the child begins elementary school.

work and life support duty
a flexible work system for those raising children or caring for the elderly, which includes shortened work hours, half-days,
alternate days, and other schedules.

family support leave
a vacation system that can be used for a wide range of needs, including caring for a sick or elderly family member, or
participating in a child's school events.

child plan leave
a system allowing leave for infertility treatment.

care for the elderly leave
possible to take up to 365 days off for each person that needs nursing care

promoting diverse work styles e-work program
panasonic is promoting the e-work program, which uses information and communications technology to enable people to
work from anywhere, with the full e-work@home system being introduced to around 40,000 employees.

panasonic has also set up "spot offices" - fully equipped and networked places where employees can work when traveling
on business - at 17 locations in total (16 in japan). the spot offices have been shown to reduce travel time and speed up
customer service, and we plan to continue our efforts to create a working environment that allows people to work even
more efficiently.

panasonic will increase productivity and continue to improve the work-life balance for its employees by accelerating
implementation of more diverse, flexible work styles.

global personnel appointment and promotion initiatives
global unification of the executive development system
panasonic globally standardized the executive development system including the personnel selection criteria for executive
candidates and executive development training. irrespective of age, gender, nationality, panasonic recruits and trains the
best qualified people, and then engages in systematic career development as well as offers opportunities for promotion.

henceforward, a condition governing an executive's appointment is assumed to be experience, such as management
experience in multiple businesses and work experience outside his or her home country. to that end, we will fast track
career development by such methods as strategic human resource rotation.

in addition, we conduct surveys to gain an objective understanding of each management candidate’s individual strengths
and weaknesses in leadership and ability. in so doing, we are focusing on issues and education recognized by both the
company and individual to overcome any deficiencies with an eye toward bolstering measures aimed appointing
individuals to a senior management post. such measures will enable us to develop personnel who possess a high degree
of awareness and motivation.


strengthening the review process for getting to know, train and appoint human resources
with regard to career development for successor candidates for important posts, we have set up an objective and
transparent system (talent management committee). this committee strengthens the process for getting to know, training
and appointing human resources regardless of age, gender or nationality.


implementation of post evaluation
panasonic maintains systems to quantitatively evaluate important global and group posts using common group criteria
and manages corporate-level incumbents and successor candidates of a certain grade or higher as corporate
management posts.


worldwide introduction of panasonic leadership competences (plc)
with a view to changing the behavior and strengthening the work practices of each and every leader, we have set up and
are sharing globally the panasonic leadership competences (plc) that demonstrates a leadership concept grounded in
panasonic's management philosophy.

in the years to come, we plan to continue to utilize this plc in all aspects, such as getting to know, training and appointing
human resources, as the criteria for appointing senior management.


initiatives to create mutual understanding and understanding of social issues
panasonic is vigorously promoting working in other countries, with a view to strengthening the education of leaders that
represent the core in coordinating the promotion of business that transcends borders. these efforts include implementing
programs such as working in japan, and maintaining inter-regional personnel changes in regulations.

leveraging training related to panasonic’s management philosophy and business policy conducted in all countries and
regions, we will continue to promote and enhance employee training programs that deepen mutual understanding on a
global scale. in europe, we are conducting the two-year talent for tomorrow (tft) personnel training program. as one part
of this program, participating employees engage in social issues that utilize the skills and experience gained through
business activities by participating in csr-related projects and corporate citizenship activities. in addition, they use this
experience in the creation of new businesses that make products.

performance evaluation and development
“wage by job” system
in 1966, we adopted the "wage by job" system based on work ratings. our reward structure does not discriminate by
gender.

diversity promotion indicators derived from employee opinion surveys
we measure the progress of our diversity promotion initiatives from the perspectives of two indicators: "diversity of human
resources," and "a workplace culture brimming over with diversity." for the former, we collect data on the number of
women holding management positions. for the latter, we utilize the results of group-wide employee opinion surveys.
more specifically, we survey items to establish priorities such as open communication and mutual learning from others as
important items for creating a culture over-brimming with diversity from the survey items and work to ensure
improvements to any points.


participation of women in management
we recognize that improving our gender diversity is necessary to maximize the intellectual capital of society. in japan,
increasing the number of women at the managerial and decision-making levels is both a challenge and a priority at senior
levels.

we at panasonic are committed to doing our part and meet the expectations of society. in the case of our management
team, the first female director was appointed in fiscal 2014. to accelerate the participation of women in management, we
are holding training programs for female employees and career improvement seminars for women managers as well as
working to create opportunities for them to come into contact with role model values and professional views.

to improve awareness among all employees of the active role played by female employees and the promotion of diversity,
we have designated july as diversity promotion month, hold forums and create opportunities to discuss diversity
promotion topics in the workplace.

diversity in the united states
panasonic provides mutual respect training for newly hired employees. this face to face training is designed to prevent
harassment in the workplace and help employees understand what the company means by an open and fair workplace
environment. participants learn to build relationships of respect with colleagues, customers and business partners. the
equal employment opportunity policies are covered extensively during the training. additionally, employees are required
to complete a slate of compliance related online training classes (panasonic legal awareness on the net “plan”). this
training deepens knowledge of laws related to discrimination in employment.

to achieve a competitive advantage, panasonic depends on the diverse ideas and collective talents of its employees.                               in
understanding that inclusion and diversity naturally generate creativity and innovation, the company is committed to
maintaining a workforce that is as diverse as it customers, business partners and the communities in which it services.

in addition, in collaboration with communities and local governments, panasonic operates seven subsidiaries that are
owned jointly with public sector partners for the purpose of employing those with severe disabilities.

the facilities at these subsidiaries are designed for those with disabilities, and include placement of parts and materials
and adjustments to work surfaces to suit the physical needs of wheelchair users, and we actively welcome participants in
trainee programs and employees from other companies to learn from our experience.

in addition to these subsidiaries, at the eco solutions company, they promote the development of workplaces that enable
people with disabilities to flourish in by implementing training by job position classification for people with hearing
impairment, use sign-language interpreters at skill development training programs, provide classes in signing, and have a
communications manual for educating people about how best to communicate with people with hearing impairment.

going forward, the panasonic group is committed to promoting the independence of those with disabilities and their
active participation in society.

our response to an ageing society and hiring of the elderly
panasonic has been consistently ahead of the times in japanese society with regard to policies and support structure
related to the elderly, as exemplified by the extension of the mandatory retirement age to 60 in 1972, introduction of its
senior life plan in 1980 and launch of its next stage program in 2001.

in 2001, panasonic created the next stage partner system within its next stage program, under which employees who
have retired at the mandatory age of 60 are allowed to continue working until the age of 65 if they desire. moreover,
guided by the basic principle of helping people lead independent lives, panasonic updated this system with the launch of
the new next stage program in april 2008, making it simpler to understand, more flexible and easier for employees to
use. in addition to continued employment options at panasonic, the company has established new systems help
employees achieve their next life stage in various ways, such as by having a staff registration system at group-affiliated
temporary staffing companies for senior citizens seeking to get involved elsewhere and to facilitate their transition to
activities outside of panasonic, and by creating a support system for employees that seek a transfer to a place of their
choosing outside the panasonic group prior to mandatory retirement.

organizes the occupational health and safety committee, which comprises an equal number of members representing
unions and the company.


division occupational health and safety management organization (japan)




rules and system
occupational safety and health management system
the purpose of the panasonic group's occupational safety and health management activities is to promote the
achievement of a comfortable, safe workplace, which will contribute to the welfare of our employees and the development
of our business. in addition, it establishes regulations that take into consideration to the safety and health of contractors
working on company premises.

in order to maintain and continuously improve our occupational safety and health, all manufacturing locations and major
affiliates in japan have implemented the occupational safety and health management system.

this management system defines the roles of and responsibilities for safe and healthy activities, while promoting them
systematically through continuous improvement and regular inspections by respective division directors.

in order to raise safety and health standards globally, we are implementing similar initiatives in places outside of japan.

we have also continued to support our occupational health and safety committee, consisting of members from both
labor and management at each business location to investigate and discuss health and safety management issues that
affect all employees at workplaces throughout japan. the occupational health and safety council was also established
for contractors working on-site, and to ensure compliance with health and safety policies and disseminate information,
among other activities.

in japan, the persons in charge of health and safety matters at each site of the panasonic group attend a health and
safety forum that meets once a year. by learning from case studies from each business location and hearing lectures by
outside speakers, the attendees increase their knowledge, which they then link to activities at each business location.

in addition, awards are presented to business locations that consistently achieve accident-free records or conduct safety,
hygiene, and health promotion activities that can serve as a model for other business locations.




                                                              167

correlation between panasonic occupational safety and health management system
and ohsas 18001
the panasonic occupational safety and health management system adopts ohsas 18001-2007 (occupational health
and safety assessment series 18001）* as its applicable standard. in addition, we are introducing an in-house
accreditation system that verifies the effectiveness of the implementation of the management system by means of group
audits (second-party audits) conducted at levels equal to or higher than those obtainable from external certification.

in the meantime, to meet requests from customer companies, including overseas sites in china and other countries, there
are business sites that are obtaining external ohsas 18001 certification.


* ohsas 18001: an international standard that establishes regulatory obligations for occupational health and safety management systems.


ohsas-certified chinese and japanese business sites are as follows.

mental health
panasonic established the following consultants to address the topic of preventing or dealing with mental or physical
stress among its employees.

employee consultant (or the personnel department associated with the employee's place of work)
the employee consultant system was introduced in 1957 to serve as the main channel for helping to resolve the
concerns of employees with regards to work and the welfare system, as well as with trouble at home.

company clinic
panasonic established the company clinic staffed with a full-time industrial physician and nurse personnel to hear
concerns about mental and physical health and help people live healthier lives.

panasonic group eap consultant
the company established eap (employee assistance program) as a program that provides specialist counselors to hear
the concerns of individuals without the company or the health insurance organization finding out about it.


preventing hiv/aids, protecting the rights of hiv/aids victims, assistance for the
families
panasonic believes that, armed with the proper knowledge, hiv/aids can be prevented and unnecessary confusion and
worry avoided in the work place. thus, panasonic has undertaken to educate all its employees about hiv/aids as the
cornerstone of its initiatives in this area. we are also taking steps to protect the human rights of employees with hiv/aids
with the following four rules: (1) confidentiality of personal information, (2) prohibiting discrimination in employment, (3)
prohibiting the testing for hiv antibodies without consent, and (4) promoting awareness activities

labor practices: performance

employee satisfaction
employee opinion surveys
we believe it is vital that we continue to focus on listening to and addressing the needs and concerns of our employees.
every year in july (held in november in fiscal 2013 and 2014), panasonic undertakes an employee opinion survey in
japan.

overseas, platforms for employee opinion surveys are opened every year in june in collaboration with consulting
companies that are familiar with global human resource practices to correctly understand and respond to the various
cultures and values of each country. panasonic is building a system in which those overseas companies that want to can
freely participate. the surveys could serve as the benchmark among other companies, and the survey results are
connected to problem solving at each company as any issues that are brought to light are incorporated in action plans.

the fiscal 2014 survey revealed a major increase in the percentage of positive opinions regarding questions on
management and organizational strength in light of the recovery in performance. from the standpoints of customer
satisfaction and strong product manufacturing, the survey also revealed that there is a strong awareness of the
aggressive actions being taken to build linkage between organizations and solve prevailing issues. conversely, impacted
by last year’s sluggish results, the survey showed a drop in satisfaction in such areas as working conditions and
motivation as well as viewpoints utilizing diversity.

based on these results, panasonic is examining measures at various levels—from reforming systems such as the
personnel workplace system to improving workplace environments—in order to motivate all employees and encourage
them to carry out their daily duties with an awareness of the issues the company faces.


creating an environment for global communications
communication is critical to enabling our approx. 270,000 global employees to make full use of their diversity in helping us
to realize our goal of developing global network management.

our innovations in communication aim to create an environment in which employees worldwide can share information,
and exchange knowledge and expertise on a daily basis, regardless of regional or national boundaries.

all panasonic employees across the world share management information and the thoughts of senior management by
being able to access an intranet network. in addition, to promote the execution of business tasks through global
collaboration, we are providing platforms that enable employees and business partners in every part of the world to hold
web conferencing and share information.

supply chain: management approach

panasonic aims to build sustainable supply chains with its suppliers based on its
standard purchase agreement, which clearly states its principles for respecting human
rights, maintaining safe working environments, prohibiting discriminatory behavior, and
actions in other areas.
many companies have concentrated on optimizing their supply chains with suppliers around the world in addition to
themselves, in order to stably and rapidly provide products and services to customers with better quality and cost
performance.

against a backdrop of increasing awareness of compliance, human rights, and the environment around the world, in
addition to respecting the rights of their own group employees, companies are now expected to responsibly survey the
state of labor conditions, compliance with laws and regulations, and environmental measures at their suppliers, and take
action if necessary to remedy any shortcomings. a company that continues to conduct business with secondary or even
tertiary suppliers discovered to have shortcomings in these areas will be criticized by society, which may impede the
company’s ability to manufacture products and otherwise conduct business.

panasonic’s standard purchase agreement clearly explains its principles regarding respect for human rights, keeping
working environments safe, prohibiting discriminatory behavior, and actions in other areas. our suppliers, as well as their
subcontractors and suppliers, are required to adhere to these principles. panasonic aims to build a sustainable supply
chain with its suppliers by updating and distributing information about the principles it wants its suppliers to observe from a
csr perspective as well.

in order to fulfill its social responsibility in its procurement practices, panasonic has adopted a basic policy of not using
conflict minerals as raw materials, because conflict minerals are a source of funding for organizations that are involved in
human rights abuses, environmental destruction, bribery, and other unlawful activities in regions of conflict.

specifically, panasonic participated in the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals in
conflict-affected and high-risk areas project that the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd)
began in august 2011. in fiscal 2014, panasonic began investigating its smelters for evidence of conflict minerals in
collaboration with the japan electronics and information technology industries association (jeita).

▶ procurement activities "procurement policy" http://panasonic.net/procurement/procurement_policy.html



basic stance on csr procurement
amid growing demands for social responsibility in procurement activities, especially with regard to the environment and
human rights, panasonic is collaborating with its suppliers to improve csr procurement and transparency. not only does
panasonic provide outstanding technologies and quality, it also promotes transactions with suppliers that are socially
responsible in five categories: clean procurement, green procurement, compliance, information security, and human
rights, labor and occupational safety.
our suppliers agree to follow the panasonic management philosophy and guidelines for csr procurement, and are
required to sign the standard purchase agreement that clearly stipulates considerations concerning human rights and the
environment before business commences. panasonic also periodically evaluates its suppliers based on their csr
activities, in addition to their quality, cost, delivery and service (qcds) standards and management performance.

for suppliers
while conducting business activities, panasonic is expected by society to ensure that corporate social responsibility
(csr) is being followed throughout its supply chain. we therefore ask our suppliers to strictly adhere to the following csr
issues.
1. agreement with panasonic's clean procurement policy
2. product quality and safety
3. environmentally consciousness management (green procurement)
4. compliance and fair trade
5. information security
6. safeguarding of human rights and the health and safety of labor

supply chain: responsible executive and framework

promoting csr procurement
each company and business division incorporates the pdca cycle to implement csr procurement activities through
planning and promoting it in line with the corporate policies, rules and standards, and manuals with regard to procurement
operations, as well as with the characteristics of their business. every issue raised in the operations is discussed and
resolved in the conferences organized by the company purchasing managers.

at the same time, we have made available training tools on our intranet for our procurement-related employees to acquire
the skills needed to promote csr procurement. transferred employees and new hires assigned to procurement
operations are required to take csr training courses.




                                                           176

supply chain: rules and system

clean procurement
we ask our suppliers to indicate their approval of our clean procurement declaration, which shows panasonic's
commitment to fair and appropriate procurement activities, and engage in fair and appropriate transactions.
1. fair transaction on an equal basis
2. selection of our suppliers
3. practicing appropriate procurement activities


▶ procurement activities "clean procurement declaration" http://panasonic.net/procurement/declaration.html



green procurement
▶ environment: collaboration across the supply chain http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/sustainability/eco/supplychain.html



compliance
as a public entity of society, compliance is a major component of achieving our vision. we adhere to the laws and
regulations of each country and region where we do business and maintain a strong sense of ethics to conduct our
business activities. we assess ourselves to verify that we conduct fair and honest transactions with our suppliers based
on our internal transaction rules. we also provide our employees responsible for procurement with regular training on
compliance.

in the standard purchase agreement, suppliers are required to consent to the following items.


standard purchase agreement
• abide by all applicable laws and regulations
• offer no bribes or illegal political contributions, nor offer or receive cash or its equivalent, gifts or entertainment in excess
  of social conventions
• eradicate any and all associations with anti-social forces, and others


information security
panasonic has issued its information security standards and an information security checklist. we ask our suppliers to
maintain the same level of information security as panasonic does, in order to correctly handle and manage information
assets including customer data, personal data, and information about technology, quality, products and services.


fundamental human rights at work, labor, and occupational health and
safety
in consideration of the rights of the employees of its suppliers, panasonic promotes procurement activities that are of
benefit to labor conditions and occupational safety.

we demand that our suppliers adhere to the following in our standard purchase agreement with them.


standard purchase agreement
• completely respect the human rights of their employees
• provide employees with a safe and comfortable workplace environment
• strive to provide equal employment opportunities without discrimination
• do not engage in forced labor, child labor, illegal employment of foreign labor, or any other illegal employment activities
• follow the laws and regulations of countries and regions in which business activity takes place regarding employment
  conditions, including wages and work hours
• require that their subcontractors and suppliers follow the same rules



                                                                     177

• in the event a violation is discovered, it must be immediately reported and remedial action must be swiftly taken, and
  others

supply chain: addressing the issues of conflict minerals

basic stance toward conflict minerals
panasonic recognizes that for the democratic republic of the congo (drc) and neighboring nations (hereinafter “covered
countries”), the issue of conflict minerals* as a source of funding for organizations that are involved in human rights
abuses, environmental destruction, bribery, and other unlawful activities is a grave concern.

in order to fulfill its social responsibility in its procurement practices, panasonic therefore has adopted a policy of non-use
of conflict-affected minerals as raw materials. in the unlikely event that panasonic discovers that it is inadvertently using
conflict-affected minerals, the company will immediately take steps toward their non-use.

to put this system in place, panasonic sent a communication to all members of the panasonic group in december 2010,
ordering them to make sure that they are not using conflict-affected minerals. in february 2011, panasonic began
encouraging its main suppliers to identify their mineral sources.

however, in covered countries there are still companies and individuals who are engaged in legitimate business. the
company must make every effort to ensure that its decision not to use illegal minerals does not harm the business
activities of these legitimate operators.

this is why it is important for panasonic to maintain contact with the various stakeholders in the building of a legitimate
mineral supply chain in covered countries, including government, corporation, and npos. with this understanding,
panasonic participated in the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals in conflict-
affected and high-risk areas project that the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) began
in august 2011.

by participating in this and other projects, following oecd guidelines, and adopting a management process that is in
accordance with global standards, panasonic is contributing to international efforts that seek to overcome the conflict
minerals problem.

panasonic’s structure to address conflict minerals
panasonic has built a corporate structure that puts the global manufacturing division in charge of group-wide
administration with the director responsible for quality and the environment as the chief executive. panasonic adopted a
four-company structure in april 2013, and designated an officer in charge of conflict mineral investigations and reporting in
each company. under the direction of the officer responsible for conflict mineral investigations and reporting in each
company, we have been building systems and conducting surveys in accordance with the particular traits of each
business.


due diligence
in addition to communicating our policies to suppliers, we also ask them to make reasonable efforts toward a conflict-free
drc and to procure from conflict free smelter (cfs) to the greatest extent possible.

since we require the cooperation of all suppliers from smelters to refiners in our conflict mineral surveys, sharing
investigative tools and briefing materials is an effective means of reducing the burden placed on suppliers and improving
their survey efficiency. for this reason, panasonic uses a survey tool called the conflict mineral reporting template
(cmrt) that is published by the conflict free sourcing initiative (cfsi). moreover, panasonic participates as an explainer
in investigative briefings held by jeita’s responsible minerals trade working group. we proactively utilize survey
manuals and guidelines commonly used by automakers and the japan auto parts industries association.


status of surveys
in the responses we received from suppliers surveyed in fiscal 2014, there were some issues with accuracy at certain
suppliers. for instance, we noticed the names of companies that are not smelters mixed in the information we received
about smelters. we assume these errors in the conflict mineral survey were due to a variety of factors. for example,
errors can be attributed to the fact that many of our suppliers are parts makers that deal with multiple layers of



                                                              179

intermediaries from smelters, that 2013 was the first fiscal year for sec reporting, and that respondents lacked a proper
understanding of the survey.

in the responses from suppliers listing “covered countries as the origin of production,” many of the smelters that were
identified as a part of the supply chain for parts and materials were cfs-validated smelters, but some suppliers were
unable to identify their smelters, making it impossible to determine the origin of the minerals used in production. we
continue to help these suppliers as they try to identify their smelters. however, we believe it would be premature to
demand that these parts and materials suppliers immediately change their subcontractors. making such a demand while
so few smelters have been validated as cfs would in effect impose a de facto embargo on the covered countries, and
impede efforts to responsibly procure minerals from covered countries. at this juncture, panasonic is involved in
industrywide initiatives to get smelters to obtain cfs validated, while encouraging its suppliers to continue to perform due
diligence. in the event that minerals have been discovered to support a conflict, panasonic demands that its supplier
change subcontractors and otherwise discontinue their use.


participation in forum for implementing due diligence for responsible mineral
procurement
since 2011, panasonic has participated in the oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals
in conflict-affected and high-risk areas project. in november 2013, panasonic participated in the sixth forum held for the
first time in one of the covered countries, the republic of rwanda, that was sponsored by international conference on the
great lakes region (icglr), oecd, and the united nations group of experts (ungoe) on the drc. we came away
with a greater understanding of the mines and exchanges that are working toward responsible mineral sourcing in
rwanda, as well as efforts being made to establish a mineral traceability system and efforts to identify mines through
analysis of mineral composition and age.


efforts at industry collaboration
conflict mineral surveys require the cooperation of suppliers along the entirety of our supply chain. for this reason,
panasonic works as joint chief examiner and joint leader on japan electronics and information technology industries
association’s (jeita) responsible minerals trade working group in order to help spread the word throughout supply
chains via industry collaboration and to help improve survey efficiency.

more specifically, panasonic held seminars and survey briefings with industry groups inside and outside japan in order to
facilitate the correct way of addressing conflict minerals. panasonic also participated in the analysis of data about
smelters and refiners, as well as the creation of ipc-1755, a data transmission protocol for conflict minerals in the us.
together with japanese automakers, the responsible minerals trade working group inaugurated the conflict free
sourcing working group in november 2013, thereby promoting dialog with the smelting industry and accelerating efforts
to analyze data about smelters and refiners. panasonic continues to participate in these activities as well.


supporting initiatives in the democratic republic of the congo and neighboring nations
panasonic performs due diligence along its supply chain as a part of its social responsibility as a downstream company. in
order to resolve the issue of conflict minerals, we believe the most important action that can be taken is establishing a
framework for responsibly procuring minerals in covered areas.

based on this belief, we joined the public-private alliance for responsible minerals trade (ppa), a select group of
industry, government, and civil society leaders in march 2013.

the ppa is an initiative that provides multifaceted support including assistance in putting in place assurance and
traceability mechanisms as well as encourages capability development with respect to conflict-free minerals in the great
lakes region of central africa. the ppa also provides a platform for alliance stakeholders to discuss and collaborate on
initiatives to achieve sustainable, responsible minerals trade in the region.

by joining the ppa, panasonic aims to contribute to the healthy economic development of the areas by supporting
initiatives for responsible mineral sourcing.

supporting sustainable development in covered countries
as part of our corporate citizenship activities in this region, we established the panasonic npo support fund for africa in
2010 to strengthen the advertising foundations for npo/ngos working to resolve social problems in african nations. from
2011 to 2013, panasonic has provided support to groups like terra renaissance, which is working to prevent use of land
mines, small arms, and child soldiers in uganda, the democratic republic of the congo and other areas. in 2014,
panasonic provided support to groups including the npo reborn kyoto, which fosters economic independence by
providing opportunities for women to receive occupational training in rwanda.

through the 100 thousand solar lantern project, an initiative at panasonic to deliver 100,000 solar lanterns to regions
without electricity by 2018 to commemorate its 100th year of operations, panasonic donated about 1,500 solar lanterns to
hospitals in uganda, burundi and other countries through the japan red cross.

local community: management approach

partnering and collaborating with stakeholders to solve social issues around the world.
there are a wide variety of social issues related to poverty, energy, education, food, medicine and healthcare, primarily in
emerging and developing countries. even in advanced countries some of these issues may exist, as well as the problem
of declining birthrates and aging populations. moreover, environmental issues affect us all on a global scale. many
national governments, local governments, npos, ngos, and international organizations have been working together to
solve these social issues. their efforts can be significantly bolstered with the effective deployment of the business
resources held by corporations, such as their employees, technologies, knowledge, expertise, information and financial
resources.

with this understanding, panasonic has positioned its corporate citizenship activities (activities that contribute to society
as a corporate citizen) as a social investment, based on the philosophy of education and coexistence, to help solve social
issues in two key areas: the environment and energy, and nurturing the next generation.

these initiatives are based on three key strategies of “finding solutions to social problems in emerging regions and
developing countries,” “the global extension of environmental education,” and “improving employees' innovation mindset
as a global citizen.”

in addition, panasonic strives to maximize the outcomes of its corporate citizenship activities by using the pdca cycle,
which is also used for business activities, to make sure that the outcome of its initiatives has had a greater impact
(changes and influence in society). it has also incorporated third-party assessment programs for some of its activities.

panasonic aims to help realize a sustainable society by collaborating and cooperating with stakeholders to solve social
issues around the world.

local community: basic stance toward corporate citizenship activities

philosophy and policies of corporate citizenship activities
panasonic is promoting corporate citizenship activities (social contribution activities) and working to solve social issues
around the world, based on the philosophy of education and coexistence while focusing on two key areas: the
environment / energy and the next generation.

we carry out our corporate citizenship activities not as a distribution of profits but as an investment in society while
collaborating and cooperating proactively with multiple stakeholders to help build a firm basis for civil society.
furthermore, we have set the following global policies for our global corporate citizenship activities. based on this policy,
we aim to enhance the impact of our activities under three key strategies: “finding solutions to social problems in emerging
regions and developing countries,” “the global extension of environmental education,” and “improving employees'
innovation mindset as a global citizen.”

                            social investment should be an integral element in business strategy, and top management must
 positioning
                            take the lead in making these investments.
 activities                 the highest priorities are the next generation and the environment/energy.
                            the head office will establish global strategies and oversee activities that are carried out across
 vision                     several regions.
                            regional companies will spearhead regional strategies and activities.


responsible executive and framework in the promotion of corporate
citizenship activities
from japan, panasonic formulates and conveys global strategies, for which executive officer satoshi takeyasu bears
ultimate responsibility, and directs activities across regions. in six overseas regions - north america; latin america;
europe and cis; southeast asia and pacific; india, south asia, middle east and africa; as well as china and northeast
asia - regional strategies and activities are directed predominantly by a responsible official based in each region.


status of corporate citizenship activities
in fiscal 2014, approximately 49 percent of our total social investment was allocated to our overseas corporate
citizenship activities.

measuring benefits of investment in corporate citizenship
panasonic goes to great lengths to gauge the efficacy of its expenditure on corporate citizenship. as an example, we
introduce a case study of the panasonic npo support fund, which helps strengthen the organizational foundations of
npos and ngos active in the fields of the environment and in supporting the development of the next generation (see
page 197 for details). panasonic has managed the fund since 2001 in recognition of the fact that major stakeholder
npos/ngos needed to strengthen their organizational foundations in order to develop their citizenship activities in a
sustainable manner toward the solution of social issues. in fiscal 2014, we provided grants totaling 29.97 million yen to 20
organizations, nine in the environment field and 11 that work with children.

a follow-up survey of grant recipients is conducted one year after a grant-subsidized project has ended. a third party
conducts a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the program's efficacy in strengthening organizational foundations.

in fiscal 2014, surveys were conducted at 21 groups that received grants in fiscal 2012 to strengthen their organizational
foundations. the results of these surveys are shown below. in response to the question “did the grant solve the biggest
issue in organizational management?” 70% of the groups answered that organizational issues had more or less been
solved, demonstrating the efficacy of the grants.

moreover, 90.5% of the grant recipients indicated in at least one of five self-assessment questions that they had worked to
improve the impact (changes in and impact on society) of their core operations as a result of strengthening their
organizational foundations. the efficacy of the panasonic npo support fund in strengthening organizational foundations
was affirmed by improvement in the outcomes of the major operations of the grant recipients following the strengthening
and growth of their organizations.

local community: addressing challenges in emerging and
developing countries

emerging and developing countries around the world are now facing a wide range of challenges, including poverty,
energy, education, food, medical, and health problems. we at panasonic have the mission of contributing to the growth of
local communities through our business and proactively leverage panasonic's technologies, solutions, and expertise to
resolve these problems. in doing so, we are strengthening collaboration and cooperation with a number of stakeholders,
including npos/ngos and international organizations.


improving people's lives in off-grid areas
currently, there are about 1.26 billion people worldwide living without electricity, mainly in developing countries in asia and
africa*. many homes in these regions use kerosene lamps for lighting, but they pose the risk of fire and the smoke
released is harmful to human health. since they do not provide sufficient light, the activities of people are significantly
restricted while also posing a danger at night. in resolving the wide-ranging issues arising from the lack of electricity and
supporting improvement in people's lives, panasonic leverages its energy technologies while promoting cooperation with
npos/ngos and international organizations.

100 thousand solar lantern project
▶ 100 thousand solar lantern project http://panasonic.net/citizenship/lantern/


solar lanterns are compact lighting equipment that store in a battery the electricity generated by the light of the sun during
the day and use this power for lighting at night. not harmful to health and with no risk of fire, solar lanterns do not emit
co2 when in use.

until fiscal 2012, panasonic ran a pilot project where it donated solar lanterns to people in tanzania and cambodia.
based on the experiences gained from these pilot projects, panasonic conceived the 100 thousand solar lantern project
in fiscal 2013 as a solution to various social problems in regions with poor electricity coverage, such as emerging and
developing countries. the aim of the project is to contribute 100,000 solar lights by 2018. in fiscal 2013, the first year of
the project, panasonic gave away a total of 10,000 compact solar lights in myanmar, india and kenya.

in fiscal 2014, panasonic surveyed how a new type of solar lantern (bg-bl03) was being used, and took steps to
enhance communications by launching a new project website.

the following is a description of donations made by country.


myanmar (november 2013)
panasonic donated 2,000 solar lanterns to five npos/ngos active in the field of
education, healthcare, and occupational development in myanmar. the solar
lanterns are used for lighting in “temple” schools* and occupational training
centers, as well as for emergency lighting during surgical procedures in hospitals
in areas with frequent power outages. they have also been distributed to people
in refugee camps in myanmar, improving the quality of their lives.

local community: panasonic kids school for developing the
next generation

panasonic believes developing the next generation is an important activity that should be tackled on a global scale in
order to realize a sustainable society. based on this belief, the company has actively promoted the panasonic kids
school, which offers a variety of educational support programs to children around the world. panasonic leverages its

the "smiling for sure 2021" great east japan earthquake support program
panasonic operates the "smiling for sure 2021" video-making assistance program for children still living in evacuation
after the great east japan earthquake. since its launch in september 2011 through fiscal 2014, an aggregate total of
around 5,400 students from 18 elementary and junior high schools in iwate, miyagi, and fukushima prefectures, have
participated in the program, which includes members from a local community group and participants in regional screening
events. "smiling for sure 2021" was created using the know-how gained through the "kid witness news*" program, a
video-making assistance program that panasonic has promoted over many years. the program was launched with the
aim of bringing back a smile to the faces of disaster-stricken children.

under the program, children make two videos with the titles "what i want to say" and "message for us in 2021." a
screening of the "what i want to say" videos made by the children is held at schools, attended by the students, teachers,
their parents and members of the local community. the "messages for us in 2021" videos are saved onto an sd memory
card and placed in a time capsule, which was then presented to each participating school. the idea was generated in the
hope that the children would come back to the school for a reunion and watch the videos 10 years from now.

local community: global citizenship activities promoted by
employees

for panasonic to create innovation in its businesses across the world, it is becoming increasingly important to improve the
mindset of its employees toward innovation as global citizens. to create a sustainable global environment and society as
a global citizen, panasonic is not only promoting its corporate activities as an enterprise but is also supporting the
volunteer activities carried out by its employees, and their families, on a global scale.



emerging country ngo pro bono program:
panasonic innovation volunteer team (plvot)
for employees applying their business skills to volunteer activities, panasonic has operated the panasonic npo support
pro bono program since april 2011 in japan and the panasonic innovation volunteer team (pivot) program for emerging
countries since 2012, where employees work together with ngos to solve various issues faced by emerging countries.

specifically, teams are made up of four to five panasonic employees of varying experiences and expertise. one or two
members from each team visit an ngo in an emerging country and stay for a month beforehand as dispatched members
to local areas and, while liaising with remote team members in japan and specialists from within and outside the
company, work to solve local problems. working at npos/ngos and social enterprises in emerging countries in asia and
africa, employee skills are matched with the needs of the organizations centered on the three areas (environment/energy,
education, healthcare) from which they can draw on their business expertise at panasonic. most of the employees
residing abroad take advantage of additional paid leave for volunteer work or other purposes which employees are
awarded in return for 10, 20 or 30 years’ service.

these volunteer opportunities under pivot not only provide the local npo/ngo partner(s) with much-needed human
resources, business development, and problem-solving support, but they also provide challenging opportunities for our
employees to contribute their knowledge and skills, gain new experiences, learn new cultures, and develop new
relationships. furthermore, pivot projects provide panasonic with new insights and knowledge about needs and local
sustainability issues that could inform our own product and service development efforts in emerging regions that are key
to our future growth. since beginning in february 2012, seven employees have volunteered to help locally and 16
employees have provided support remotely.

in fiscal 2014, four employees volunteered to help locally on a total of three occasions in indonesia and india, with support
provided by nine remote employee volunteers.

local community: strengthening the organizational
foundations of npos

to realize a sustainable society, the organizational foundations of npos/ngos need to be strengthened in order to
sustainably continue their activities as citizens trying to solve social issues. in 2001, panasonic launched a support
program for strengthening the organizational foundations of npos/ngos as a central activity of its social contributions.
we have continued to offer support in this regard since then.

the panasonic npo support fund is one of six programs that the company organically operates toward achieving this
objective. in order to ensure these programs are beneficial to local npos, we have programs that collaborate with npo
intermediary support organizations. panasonic holds forums for strengthening the organizational foundation, pro bono
forums, and marketing forums to disseminate information throughout society about these initiatives to strengthen
organizational foundations and their benefits. through independent efforts such as these, panasonic aims to contribute to
social change for the better through sustainable citizen activities and by finding solutions to social problems.

their own organizational issues. in november 2013, panasonic held a marketing
forum as an event for participating groups to present their outcomes. 135 people
participated in the event. since it was launched in 2008, the program has helped                 participants in the inaugural orientation and

local community: foundations
in its aim to develop the next generation, panasonic has established many foundations, scholarship programs and
academic achievement awards to promote the development of a broad range of human resources.


the japan prize foundation
inaugurated in 1983, the foundation aims to promote the development and
dissemination of science and technology by awarding the prestigious japan
prize. the japan prize is presented annually to scientists and researchers who
have made significant contributions to the advancement of science and
technology as well as to the promotion of peace and the prosperity of mankind. a
cumulative total of 83 individuals had received the award worldwide by 2014.


panasonic education foundation
originally established in 1973 as the matsushita audiovisual education research
foundation, the panasonic education foundation aims to promote the utilization
of audiovisual and information technologies to enhance education. it provides
grants and training for elementary and secondary education taught at academic
institutions in support of finding solutions to local problems. through these
activities, the foundation’s philosophy is to nurture creativity and humanity for
creating the future in children that will become the next generation. as of may
2014, the foundation has provided assistance 22,731 times, mainly for
elementary and secondary education.


the konosuke matsushita memorial foundation
the matsushita international foundation (established in january 1988) and the
k. matsushita foundation of expo '90 (established in december 1988) were
merged together to become the konosuke matsushita memorial foundation in
august 2010 (registered as a public interest incorporated foundation in april
2012). the foundation strives to contribute to advances in world culture and the
peace and prosperity of the world by aiming to promote mutual understanding
internationally and to create a society based on the concept of coexistence
between nature and mankind. with these objectives, the foundation provides
assistance to young japanese researchers studying abroad, provides research
grants, invites international students to study in japan, promotes international
exchange, and recognizes initiatives to encourage coexistence between nature
and mankind. as of march 2014, the foundation has provided grants to a total of
174 foreign students to study in japan, and a total of 185 japanese students to
study in foreign countries.


ryozen institution (japan)
in october 1968, on the centennial anniversary of the meiji restoration,
panasonic founder konosuke matsushita called on the finance sector to
participate in a fund with the contribution collected used to preserve and
maintain historical monuments and sites located in the ryozen hill of graves,
where participants in the meiji restoration movement are enshrined. konosuke
matsushita established the ryozen institute on this opportunity, which was later
registered as a public interest incorporated foundation in june 2012. this
institute seeks to preserve the cultural spirit of ryozen and honor the spirit and
great undertakings of the pioneers that laid the foundations of modern japan. by
doing so, it aims to pass on this spirit to the young generation that will be the
next leaders of japan. in 1970, the ryozen museum of history was opened, and
many visitors have come to learn about the meiji restoration and the end of the
tokugawa shogunate.



                                                             205

panasonic scholarship
the panasonic scholarship program was established in 1998 in commemoration
of the company's 80th anniversary as a way for the company to express its
appreciation to society. its aim is to provide scholarship opportunities to privately
financed students from asian countries who wish to pursue a master's course in
science and technology in japan, to offer financial assistance to foster highly
educated experts who can contribute to the development of their countries in the
21st century, and to promote mutual friendship between their home countries
and japan. as of march 2014, the program has helped 320 foreign students.




                                                              206

local community: other initiatives for coexistence with society
panasonic strives to create a society that respects diversity by cooperating with npos/ngos and supporting the arts and
cultural activities, for a civil society in which people can coexist with ease.


support for the arts and culture
the arts and culture are a representation of the human race, its spirit, history and countries. the arts are an important
aspect of an open-minded society where people are able to live with joy and fresh vitality. fostering young artists and
passing on tradition, we sponsor events that recognize outstanding artistic achievements. from the perspectives of
developing the next generation, education and global vision, we contribute to local communities through the arts and
cultural activities, as well as employee involvement, while supporting and collaborating with npos.


panasonic shiodome museum
this museum was opened in april 2003 on the fourth floor of the tokyo head office building of the former panasonic
electric works co., ltd. [pew] (currently the panasonic tokyo shiodome building) to offer as many people as possible
opportunities to view oil paintings and prints by the famous artist georges rouault (1871-1958) that represents 20th
century france. these works of arts have been collected and preserved since the 1990s as a part of pew’s contribution
to society. the collection of about 230 works represents the full spectrum of rouault’s accomplishments from his early
years to his final years, in oil paintings and traditional prints. these works of art are always on display in the rouault
gallery in the museum. other exhibitions related to rouault are also periodically put on display.

exhibitions are held based on themes that are strongly related to panasonic’s operations, such as construction, homes,
the arts and design, exploring new avenues and offering ideas about the relationship between people and space, as well
as people and goods that make our lives plentiful.

as an urban oasis that inspires visitors while providing them with a respite with various cultural activities, the panasonic
shiodome museum creates a cultural atmosphere well suited to its location in shiodome, a modern urban environment for
the 21st century.

promoting traditional japanese art and crafts
founder konosuke matsushita had an intense interest in traditional japanese arts and crafts, as a form of the basic art of
manufacturing. to pass this interest along and develop it further, panasonic has supported the activities of the japan
kogei association, which since 1960, has been composed primarily of traditional artists and artisans, the so-called living
national treasures of japan. passing along the will of our founder, we have offered the panasonic award since 1992 to
the winners of the japan traditional art crafts exhibition sponsored by the japan kogei association, as well as to the first
time winners among them residing in the kinki area.



                                                                207

supporting and cooperating with the activities of npos and ngos
resolving social issues and helping to realize a better society through the efforts of a single company is often difficult to
accomplish. panasonic is committed to building a new society by collaborating with npos, ngos and a variety of
stakeholders.
