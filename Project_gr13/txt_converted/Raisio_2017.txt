raisio annual report / year 2016 / chief executive's review




raisio - good profitability,
focus on growth
raisio’s comparable ebit of eur 50.7 million in 2016 was a good performance in a
situation where the exchange rate changes of the british pound had a negative impact of
almost eur 3 million on our ebit and some eur 20 million on net sales. with
comparable exchange rates, raisio would have reached clearly better comparable ebit
than in 2015.

raisio’s board of directors will propose the annual general meeting
a dividend of 17 cents per share for 2016. if approved, raisio has
increased its dividend for ten consecutive years. it is a rare

megatrends provide opportunities for raisio
for an international operator like raisio, global megatrends offer first and foremost opportunities. sustainably
produced, healthy and safe food of high-quality is related to many of these trends. population growth, ageing,
urbanisation, sustainable development and digitalisation are examples of the global megatrends.

increasingly common snacking continues to be one of raisio’s opportunities. as eating habits are changing and
mobile lifestyles break traditional meal rhythm, an increasing part of the daily food intake is snacks. the demand for
snacks is moving to ready and easy-to-use products, and the quality and healthiness of energy is becoming more
and more important.

profitability through responsible operations
at the beginning of 2016, we started to implement our three-year
responsibility programme concerning all the company’s operations.
the themes of the programme – sustainable food chain, healthier
                                                                                        wellbeing for people,
food, and safety and wellbeing at work – will build a better future for                 animals and the
all of us. we will continue our productive work for the wellbeing of                    environment
people, animals and the environment.

in 2016, raisio committed to the un global compact sustainability
initiative and its ten principles concerning human rights, labour practices, environment and corruption. we will
continue to promote these principles in raisio’s operations and value chain.

i would like to thank raisio’s employees for their dedication and work well done. by working together, we will
achieve profitable growth and make raisio one of the best workplaces in finland.

brexit creating uncertainty
as a result of the referendum of june 2016, the uk will probably leave the european union. brexit details are still
unclear and referendum-related uncertainty is expected to weaken growth prospects for the uk and eurozone and
to continue causing high volatility in the british pound exchange rate.

sales volatility of cholesterol-lowering foods in raisio’s european
markets continued and the entire category decreased slightly. in the
uk, benecol was the only brand to improve its position despite the
                                                                                        benecol spreads showed
decrease of the whole spread category. intense competition among                        growth in the uk despite the
retailers as well as consumers’ price-conscious purchasing                              declining spread category
behaviour continued in the uk. demand for products with less sugar
and salt increased due to the lively public debate in the uk.

retail trade is facing major changes




in finland, retail sales slightly increased and growth is expected to continue at a moderate pace in 2017 due to slow
growth in purchasing power and jobs. retailers continued with their so called cheapening. with changing eating
habits, the demand for healthy and ecological snacks increased.

in poland, volume in cholesterol-lowering spreads increased as a
result of extensive promotional sales. polish consumers value
traditional spreads with butter.
                                                                                        demand for healthy and

in asia, potential new markets for benecol products, regulation
processes for foods vary greatly from country to country, and some
countries have tightened these processes. raisio has carried out
several successful regulation processes with its licencing partners.

in the uk’s confectionery market, consumer demand remained stable for the product categories in which raisio is
present. in the european markets, retail chains were actively launching new soft gum products under private labels.

restructuring of milk farms continued in finland

there were no major changes in the finnish cattle feed market because the number of dairy cows did not reduce in
the same proportion as that of dairy farms.

lower prices paid for milk and farmers’ challenging financial position increased the demand for affordable feeds and
tightened competition. russia is actively developing its own milk chain, which opens up new opportunities for
consultative feed sales.

increased demand for farmed fish

were more due to growth conditions. global price increases in oily
fish were also seen in finland. difficulties in the chilean salmon

farming collapsed the country’s production, which resulted in price                     source of protein
increases. the shortfall of farmed fish has been compensated with
norwegian salmon, the main product also in the finnish market. the
rise in the norwegian salmon price also increased the price of
finnish rainbow trout.

raisioaqua is a responsible pioneer in fish feeds in finland. the development and launch of the baltic blend fish
feed continue to promote the responsibility of fish farming and reduce its environmental impacts.

to get the desired cholesterol-lowering effect benecol should be used daily. therefore raisio wants to make sure
that the use of benecol is as easy as possible. we are carefully listening to the consumers to make sure that we are
really meeting the consumer needs of today and tomorrow.

which not only taste good and lower cholesterol but also fit in the
overall lifestyle of the consumer. examples of this are new benecol
soft chews, food supplements that are conveniently travelling with
the consumer, or a range of low fat and low sugar spreads and yoghurts.

widening the product portfolio is one way to make benecol consumption more relevant to wider audience so this
remains to be one of raisio’s focus areas in the near future. we continue our work to ensure that more new
consumers with elevated cholesterol perceive benecol clearly as a healthy food.

consumer behavior is changing so raisio will increasingly focus on finding the right distribution channels to help the
consumers find their daily benecol in the same places they are naturally visiting anyway.

empowering journey in cholesterol lowering
the vision of benecol brand is to offer innovative solutions to consumers globally to help them on their
cholesterol-lowering journey. with the changes we have made on the brand communication and offering in 2016 are
already paying off. the market share of benecol is growing in all the key markets as well as the number of new

besides convenience, the composition of snacks and quality of energy are increasingly important selection criteria.
consumers are increasingly aware of the good nutritional properties of oats; high fibre content, long-lasting energy
and ability to balance blood sugar levels.

traditional boundaries between product categories are blurring as the supply of snacks is growing. today, all ready,
half-ready, easy-to-use and on-the-go foods are perceived as snacks. elovena, the market leader in oat products,

our development work on brands and product range is based on the information obtained through the interviews of
more than 5,000 consumers. consumers look for energy boost, balanced blood sugar levels and digestive health. in
addition to these factors, overall wellbeing is a growing selection criterion. authenticity, naturalness and simplicity of

raisio annual report / operating environment / raisioagro



raisioagro is a feeding expert
raisioagro’s strength is its ability to innovate products that promote sustainable
development and meet customer needs. feeding expertise and high-quality feeds meeting
the farm needs improve the profitability of farms in line with objectives while ensuring
animal welfare.

restructuring of milk farms continued in finland
despite the lowering number of finnish milk farms, the number of dairy cows did not substantially decrease since
some of the farms carried out extension investments. the key change impacting the feed market was that the
number of tmr feeding farms and robotic milking farms continued to grow. tmr feeding means that all feed
components are mixed with silage and a cow is given only one feed mixture.

as the challenging economic situation continued, milk farms continued their shift to more affordable feeds of lower
added value. the main reasons for the milk farmers’ challenging economic conditions are the russian ban on
imports of dairy products and the subsequent drop in the producer price of milk in finland.

benemilk added value feeds are mainly used at the robotic milking farms where farmers are satisfied with the added
value they have received for their milk production. at the end of 2016, some six per cent of all finnish dairy cows
were fed with benemilk feeds.

raisioagro did not get involved in the aggressive price competition
but focused on extending the expertise of sales employees, targeted
marketing, developing of the product range corresponding customer
                                                                                        benemilk feeds have an

russia's economic challenges and weakening liquidity of dairy farms
reduced raisioagro’s cattle feed sales to russia. russia is investing
in its own milk chain, which means that the need to improve the
quality of milk and to raise the yield levels will increase the demand for feeding expertise consultation. due to its
advanced expertise, raisioagro has a strong potential to increase its exports to russia.

raisioagro continued its strong investment in the development of digital services. as part of the internet of farming
project, raisioagro changed its milking robot monitoring into tuotostutka®. at the end of 2016, already 130 farms
with over 10,000 cows were in the monitoring programme. with raisioagro’s real-time optimisation of cattle feeding,
the average milk yield has increased by almost six per cent.

raisioaqua’s fish feeds promote sustainable development
fish are cold-blooded, so growth conditions play a key role in the farming. raisioaqua’s range has fish feeds for
many different species. the feeds for rainbow trout are by far the largest segment. the season for fish feeds is from
spring to autumn as fish are virtually not fed in winter.

raisioaqua is the only finnish fish feed manufacturer. the key markets are finland and northwest russia. exports
account for about 60 per cent of all fish feed manufactured.

raisioaqua’s forerunner position in fish feeds is based on the close
cooperation with fish farmers as well as on sustainable innovations,
which have significantly reduced the environmental impacts from
                                                                                        baltic blend is raisio’s fish

in the summer 2016, raisioaqua launched baltic blend fish feeds
and strengthened its position as a forerunner in the environmentally
friendly fish farming in finland and northwest russia. raisioaqua’s most significant investment included the
development and launch of the baltic blend feed.

as a raw material, baltic blend feeds use fishmeal and oil made from herring and sprat fished from the baltic sea;
fishmeal and oil are processed in finland. fishmeal and oil for raisioaqua’s feeds are made by raisio’s important
partner in kasnäs, finland.

with the baltic blend feeds, nutrients are not brought to the baltic sea from elsewhere.

healthy and responsible benella rainbow trout




sales season of sustainably produced, environmentally friendly benella fish started in september. benella fish are
farmed using raisoaqua’s feeds, and the sale proceeds of this quality fish ensure the profitability of fish farming
industry.

the entry of benella rainbow trout to the finnish kitchens was
boosted significantly as kesko started to distribute benella in
october 2016. after a successful pilot period, kesko quickly made

raisioaqua has developed a contract farmer model for benella

raisio annual report / year 2016 / business risks

raisio group is an international diversified company whose key products are plant-based
foods, their ingredients and feeds for cattle and fish. raisio is a significant user of
renewable raw materials. changes in quality, availability and prices of these materials are
difficult to predict so they present a challenge to the group's operations. in europe,
raisio’s key operational area, changes affecting consumer demand are closely monitored
and the company strives to adapt to these changes.

the year 2016 was marked by many long-term election results, such as the uk decision to leave the eu and the
election of donald trump as president of the united states. in spite of the prevailing uncertainty, the world economy
is expected to grow moderately in 2017 and the growth is generated primarily by private consumption and
increasing investments.

the euro area economy is expected to grow moderately in 2017. the recovery is still based on private consumption,
supported by low oil prices, low interest rates and the weakening euro, particularly against the us dollar. european
refugee crisis continues and its effects may extend not only to politics but also to the economy.

in 2016, economic growth in finland was based on the domestic demand, especially on the growth of private
consumption. in addition, construction investment has increased rapidly. the situation on the labour market has
improved and the unemployment rate trend is downward. in finland, the economy is expected to grow moderately in
2017, supported by domestic demand.

although brexit is causing uncertainty, the uk’s economic growth is expected to continue, and employment and
earnings are estimated to develop positively.

the uk’s vote to leave the eu and related exit negotiations are
creating uncertainty in the food industry’s operating conditions and
long-term business planning. changes in the pound to euro
                                                                                        a large portion of raisio's
exchange rate significantly affect raisio's net sales and ebit,                         net sales and ebit is
directly and indirectly, as a significant portion of the group’s net                    generated in the uk.
sales and ebit is generated in the uk.

volatility in the rouble's external value affects the exports of feeds
and oat products to russia and may also have an impact on the utilisation rates of production plants in finland.

the price and availability of agricultural raw materials are a major challenge for raisio's businesses. global warming
and extreme weather events rapidly affect the crop expectations, supply, demand and price of these commodities.
in addition, changes in supply, demand, availability and price of other key raw materials are possible. in terms of
business profitability, the role of risk management remains essential both for value and volume.

in europe, various health taxes are discussed and related initiatives are being set up. sugar may be one of the
taxed raw materials. in case these initiatives result in new taxes, they will probably affect raisio’s operations.

raisio annual report / year 2016 / business risks

raisio expects the grocery market to remain fairly stable compared
to other sectors. however, retail activities create pressure on the
food industry too, through prices and sales terms.
                                                                                        grocery market expected to
                                                                                        remain stable.
profitability problems in the finnish agriculture and livestock farming
weaken the purchasing power of the sector and put pressure on
raisioagro's profitability. due to the crisis in ukraine and crimea,
the eu’s sanctions and russia’s counter-sanctions in 2014, especially the import ban of dairy products, will directly
and indirectly hamper raisioagro’s operations.

to ensure growth and profitability of its operations, raisio may carry out corporate restructuring which, as
rationalisation projects, may result in significant one-off expenses.

risk management
raisio's risk management policy defines the targets, principles and responsibilities of risk management. the target
of risk management is to identify risks and to secure the continuity of raisio's operations, safety of products and
operations, personnel and assets and to prevent events affecting negatively the shareholder value.

raisio emphasises preventive measures in its risk management and strives to continuously improve the risk
management in all of its aspects. in practice, the divisions and service functions, such as financing, are responsible
for identifying and surveying risks and report them to the group's management team and risk management
function. risk management function coordinates, develops and monitors risk management at the group level.
possible findings of internal control and business risks are reported to the board of directors as part of monthly
financial reporting.

       sales in benecol consumer products increased significantly in indonesia, the philippines and thailand.
       exchange rate changes had a clearly negative impact on net sales and ebit of the benecol business.


financial review
ebit for the benecol business remained at the comparison year level even though volatile exchange rates had a
clear negative impact on ebit and net sales. on the other hand, ebit was positively impacted by the streamlining
of operations.

net sales for the benecol business were clearly down from the comparison year, totalling eur 124.6 million (in
2015: eur 140.3 million). the net sales decline was due to the volatility of currency and consumer product sales
volume in raisio’s home markets. the uk is raisio’s by far the largest market for the benecol consumer products
so the sales prices and volumes of the products have an essential effect on the figures of the entire business.
benecol ingredient sales to licensing partners were up from the comparison year.

raisio annual report / year 2016 / raisioagro


financial review
raisioagro’s net sales totalled eur 126.6 (145.9) million. despite the net sales decline, the division clearly
improved its relative profitability. net sales were down primarily due to lower fertiliser sales, milk farmers’ shift to
more affordable feeds and lower grain exports.

raisioagro’s comparable ebit was eur 3.7 (2.8) million. ebit
totalled eur 3.7 (2.4) million. the key factors behind the ebit
improvement were the successful development and launch of new
                                                                                        raisioagro’s ebit improved
products in line with customer needs, and improved production and                       +0.9 m€
material efficiency.

raisioagro’s net working capital at the turn of the year decreased by
almost 50 per cent, totalling eur 5.8 (11.3) million. the decrease in net working capital was particularly due to
improved raw material and stock management in both the fish feed business and cattle feed business.

raisioagro’s average return on restricted capital increased to 11.4 per cent due to decreased net working capital
and improved profitability.

businesses
raisioagro consists of three business areas: cattle feeds and farming supplies, fish feeds and grain trade.

in cattle feeds, raisioagro did not get involved in the aggressive
price competition but focused on improving of its operations, on                        raisioagro continued its
developing of the product range meeting customer needs and on
digital services.
                                                                                        investment in internet of

in finland, milk farmers’ challenges continued due to the import ban
                                                                                        farming
imposed earlier by russia on dairy products and the subsequent
drop in the producer price of milk. benemilk feeds are mainly used at the robotic milking farms where farmers are
satisfied with the added value of their milk production.

raisioagro continued its strong investment in the development of digital services. with these services, customers
can make better use of the company's advanced feeding skills.

raw material used in raisioaqua’s baltic blend fish feeds is fishmeal and oil processed in finland and made from
herring and sprat of the baltic sea. with the baltic blend feeds, nutrients are not brought to the baltic sea from
elsewhere. raisioaqua’s forerunner position in fish feeds is based on close cooperation with fish farmers and on
innovations in line with sustainable development.

the entry of benella rainbow trout to the finnish kitchens was boosted significantly as kesko started its distribution
in october 2016.

grain exports were clearly down from the comparison year. the global grain market was oversupplied, which
significantly weakened grain export and its profitability.

raisio annual report / year 2016 / benemilk




benemilk
benemilk is raisio’s cattle feed innovation that helps improve milk production efficiency
and the fat and protein levels of milk. it also makes cows produce more milk. by the end
of 2016, benemilk feeds had been granted a patent in four countries. these patents are an
indication of the patentability of the innovation in different markets. in finland,
benemilk feeds are sold and marketed by raisioagro. benemilk feeds have an established
market position in cattle feeds.

main events
       patents granted for benemilk feeds and their production method in finland and new zealand at the end of
       2016.
       in august 2016, raisio’s board of directors decided to reduce benemilk ltd’s activities to internationally
       commercialise the innovation as the company’s short-term outlook was not favourable.
       the office in seattle, usa, was closed in the autumn 2016.

raisio annual report / year 2016 / benemilk




benemilk feeds and their production method were granted a patent in finland on 30 december 2016. after a
thorough investigation, the finnish patent authority determined that the benemilk innovation meets the criteria for
patentability; it is new, inventive and industrially applicable. in finland, the first patent applications related to the
benemilk innovation were filed in january 2012.

furthermore, patent authorities in new zealand examined the patent applications, and granted patents for the
benemilk feeds and their manufacturing method as well as for the milk produced by benemilk fed cows.

so far, benemilk has been granted patents in finland, new zealand, australia and south africa, which is a strong
indication of the patentability of the innovation in various markets. now that the first important patents have been
received, raisio will not publicly analyse the benemilk patent portfolio.

business operations
in november 2015, benemilk ltd launched a process to examine the conditions and opportunities to obtain new
financing. based on the completed assessment, benemilk ltd’s board of directors concluded in june 2016 that it is
not justified to implement the equity financing scheme as the company valuation indicated by potentially interested
investors was not satisfactory for owners.

benemilk ltd’s operations were significantly reduced in the autumn 2016 and the investment to internationally
commercialise the innovation was minimised in accordance with the decision taken by raisio’s board of directors in
august. global crisis in the milk market as well as potential customers’ unwillingness to change their feeding models
affected the decision, and for these reasons, the company’s short-term prospects for the international expansion of
the business were not favourable. the office in seattle, usa, was closed.

raisio annual report / responsibility management / diverse value chain




raisio’s value chain extends from primary production to consumers. in different parts of the value chain, the
company’s influence and way of interacting are different. raisio’s ability and willingness to develop responsible
foods and feeds promote the sustainable food chain.

raisio affects the beginning of the value chain, i.e., suppliers, by following its responsible procurement principles.
raisio expects its suppliers to commit to the supplier code of conduct concerning, for example, environmental
responsibility, working conditions in accordance with international regulations, prohibition of child and forced labour
and anti-discrimination.

some of raisio’s branded products are manufactured by subcontractors. they are required to follow operating and
production practices outlined by raisio. the agreements specify, for example, the quality requirements of raw
materials used. raisio purchases all its grain from areas near its production plants whenever possible. raisio’s
grain products are mainly manufactured in finland. in finland, the company purchases some 85 per cent of the
grain directly from farmers. due to close cooperation, raisio has an opportunity to develop farming practices
together with the farmers.

raisio continuously examines consumer needs and behaviour. this way, raisio can provide retailers with
interesting branded products and innovations that meet consumer needs. the company also invests in its brands to
keep them commercially interesting. furthermore, raisio must meet the increasingly stringent requirements of trade
organisations, restaurants and catering companies, and industrial customers regarding the responsibility of
products.

in terms of the international benecol ingredient business, raisio’s influence extends to the assistance and
counselling of licencing partners. licensing agreements define in detail matters related to the products and use of
the brand. in addition, raisio's licensing partners are committed to raisio’s benecol partner code of conduct.

at the higher end of the value chain of consumer products, raisio influences consumers by communicating on
nutrition, environmental labels, recipes and tips to use the products, among other things. raisio is engaged in a
continuous dialogue with consumers in, for example, social media and customer service channels.

raisio influences dairy and fish chains by providing producers with feeds that promote profitable and sustainable
agriculture. raisio’s feeding solutions affect animal welfare and improve the yields. in the fish chain, our feeding
innovations have significantly reduced the environmental impacts.

raisio plc’s shares are listed on nasdaq omx helsinki ltd. the company has over 39,000 shareholders and
about 1,400 employees. raisio operates in 12 countries and has production plants in nine places in three countries.

raisio annual report / responsibility management / materiality assessment



materiality assessment defines the
key responsibility themes




raisio’s materiality assessment was renewed in 2015 together with stakeholders. we have discussed with them
and listened to their views. the materiality assessment, confirmed by raisio’s board of directors, took all
stakeholders into consideration both locally and internationally in the countries where raisio operates.

based on the views of the businesses and stakeholders, key responsibility aspects were identified and prioritised,
and then grouped in the matrix below. material aspects concern the entire raisio group. raisio’s materiality
assessment guides the company’s responsibility work and reporting.

the timeliness of the materiality assessment is reviewed annually. in 2016, no changes were made and raisio
continued its work to promote the key themes.

goal-oriented responsibility
programme
raisio’s responsibility programme for 2016 – 2018 sets objectives and indicators for
important, selected sustainability themes. in 2016, raisio began the determined
implementation of its responsibility programme.

objectives of the responsibility programme support the implementation of raisio’s business strategy.
responsibility programme is a practical tool to be used in raisio's responsibility work: it sets targets and indicators
for important sustainability themes to the company management and personnel. all raisio’s businesses actively
participated in the preparation of the responsibility programme and are committed to its implementation.

raisio operates in many countries and in several sectors. therefore, important responsibility themes vary by
business. the group’s responsibility programme has three themes that are material to every business. to promote
these themes, concrete goals and indicators were determined to monitor progress. some of the objectives are
business-specific.

raisio’s clear and concrete responsibility programme supports the business strategy and is focused on material
responsibility issues. main parts of raisio’s value chain are matters related to responsible procurement of raw
materials, innovations and product development, healthiness and work safety. since these themes were also
highlighted in raisio’s materiality assessment, they are also the key themes of the responsibility programme.

key themes in raisio’s responsibility programme
       sustainable food chain

              ethical and environmental aspects are related to the procurement of raw materials. management of
              these aspects is material to raisio. in addition, raisio aims to reduce the environmental impacts of its
              own production and affects the sustainability of milk production and fish farming through its feed
              innovations.

       healthier food

              development of healthier products and services is important to consumers and at the core of raisio’s
              strategy. at raisio, we never compromise on product safety.

       safety and well-being at work

              staff safety and wellbeing are of particular importance in raisio’s operations so that we can ensure
              product safety, process reliability and the ability to develop new innovations that interest consumers
              and customers.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / responsible procurement




responsible procurement
promotes sustainability of the food
chain
quality, safety and responsibility are the key criteria for raisio’s raw material
procurement. raisio’s consumers and customers are increasingly interested in the
traceability of product raw materials and in the production in line with sustainable
development. as an expert in animal feeding and healthy foods, raisio has an ability and
opportunity to promote the sustainable food chain with its raw material choices.

main events in 2016
       raisio harmonised its responsible procurement practices. the group’s common supplier code of conduct
       will be introduced in all our businesses during 2017.
       healthy snacks business prepared its transfer to the use of utz certified cocoa.
       at the nokia mill, raisio decided to get the rspo supply chain certificate and it will enter into force in the
       spring 2017.

raisio’s value chain is part of the sustainable food chain. all the company’s raw materials are renewable. raisio’s
key raw materials are grains (wheat, oats, rye, barley) and rapeseed. these account for some 70 per cent of all raw
materials. raisioagro’s share of the group’s all raw materials is almost 70 per cent. key raw materials in the feed

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / responsible procurement

manufacturing are wheat, barley and rapeseed.

raisio has almost 80 years of experience in contract farming and the company acquires 85 per cent of its grain
directly from farmers. raisio’s grain products are largely made in finland and the grain transport distance from the
producer to the factory is on average less than 100 kilometres.

subcontractors manufacture part of raisio’s branded products. quality criteria for the raw materials used in contract
manufacturing are defined in the agreements. raisio acquires raw materials for part of its finnish subcontractors.

raisio secures the responsibility of raw materials by requiring its suppliers to commit to the supplier code of
conduct regarding, for example, human rights, working conditions in accordance with international regulations,
environmental responsibility and anti-corruption.

certified raw materials
to secure the responsibility of soy, palm oil and cocoa, raisio has drawn up policies regarding the use of certified
raw materials.

soy accounts for about one per cent of all raw materials and the company uses it mainly for fish feeds. all the soy
raisio used in feeds is either proterra or rtrs certified. raisio is a member of the round table on responsible
soy association.

since 2014, all the palm oil used in raisio’s foods has been responsible. in 2016, 70 per cent of the palm oil used in
raisio’s foods was physically traceable (mass balance or segregated) and 30 per cent was green palm certified.
our long-term goal is to transfer to the use of physically traceable palm oil in food products. palm oil accounts for
less than one per cent of all raisio’s raw materials. raisio is a member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil.

raisio’s goal is that the cocoa used in its own branded products is certified by the end of 2018. this does not,
however, apply to the confectionery since major part of the confectionery is produced for contract partners who
themselves define the certification requirements of raw materials. during 2016, we were preparing the transfer to
the use of certified cocoa, and the first products containing certified cocoa will be available in 2017. cocoa accounts
for less than 0.5 per cent of all raw materials of our branded products.

origin of the fishmeal and oil used in fish feeds is always known, and no endangered fish species are used in the
manufacturing of our feeds.

certified raw materials account for some four per cent of all raisio’s raw materials. in addition to certified palm oil
and soy, raisio uses, for example, small amounts of organic oats and other organic grains.

objectives for 2016-2018
       we will further develop the responsible procurement of our key raw materials. raw materials that we use the
       most include grains, particularly oats and wheat, and rapeseed.
       we require our suppliers to operate in accordance with our supplier code of conduct.
       we expect the suppliers to complete the supplier self-assessment questionnaire at least every three years.
       we continue to purchase proterra or rtrs certified soy.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / responsible procurement

       we are committed to the use of gmo free raw materials.
       we use only responsible palm oil. the responsibility of palm oil used in foods will be improved through our
       transfer to the use of physically traceable palm oil.
       we only use utz certified cocoa in our foods (excluding confectionery).
       we will further decrease our raw material acquisitions from the countries classified as risk countries.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / environmental responsibility




environmental efficiency through
innovation and production
development
raisio operates in a sustainable manner, respecting the environment. we follow environmental impacts of our
operations, and develop the operations in a sustainable and goal-oriented way. raisio’s environmental priorities are
the reduction of energy usage, the improvement of material efficiency and innovations benefiting the environment
and customers.

main events in 2016
       reporting and monitoring of the group’s environmental impacts were harmonised with a new data
       management system.
       all the group’s production functions drew up plans to improve energy and material efficiency.
       raisio developed several innovations promoting sustainability of the primary food production. baltic blend fish
       feeds, milking robot monitoring (tuotostutka) and a urea index describing greenhouse emissions from milk
       production are good examples of these innovations.
       wwf finland added finnish farmed whitefish on the green list of its seafood guide in 2016. several raisio’s
       fish feed innovations have reduced the environmental impacts of fish farming.
       the czech confectionery business invested in the wastewater treatment that resulted in improved
       wastewater quality and enabled the use of recovered biogas. the investment improved energy efficiency and

       allows the expansion of production.
       the uk confectionery business is involved in the climate change act aiming to reduce energy consumption.

raisio reports on the environmental impact arising from its production. raisio’s operations cause environmental
impacts throughout the life cycle of products. in 2016, raisio had nine production plants in finland, the uk and
czech republic. our environmental efficiency development is goal-oriented, particularly in energy and material
efficiency.

the company invests in renewable energy. raisio started building a bioenergy plant in its industrial area. the plant
will be completed during the spring 2017. as a result, the carbon footprint of raisio’s production plants will decrease
significantly as, at the same time, the company will discontinue its use of coal-based industrial steam.

raisio operates in accordance with rules and regulations. no environmental damages were identified in the group’s
offices and the group received no fines or sanctions for violations of environmental legislation in 2016.

raisio’s production plants are not located in protected areas or in areas of high biodiversity value, or in their
immediate vicinity.

results 2016
       environmental investments were carried out to enhance energy production and consumption, waste reduction
       and wastewater treatment.
       in the fish feed production, heat recovery was renewed, which improved the energy use.
       in the production of cholesterol-lowering benecol ingredient, a new operating model resulted in significant
       energy savings.
       the group’s energy consumption per produced product tonne decreased by four per cent.
       the amount of landfill waste declined by 62 per cent. the amount of recovered waste increased to 94 per
       cent. investments and improvements in the equipment contributed to the results.
       raisio’s product packages are mainly made of recycled material.


objectives for 2016-2018
       we will enhance our energy use.
       we will perform energy audits at all our production plants at least every two years.
       we will analyse material efficiency in terms of raw materials and other production inputs. we will decrease
       waste at our production plants.
       we will only use recyclable materials in our product packages.
       we continue to develop and commercialise innovations that benefit the environment and our customers.

raisio's environmental impact
raw materials and material efficiency
raw materials used in raisio’s products are renewable. the company’s goal is a material-efficient use of raw
materials. to achieve this, all the group’s production plants have drawn up plans. material efficiency is promoted
particularly through the development of monitoring and reporting.

raw material use at raisio’s production plants decreased by over three per cent and per tonne of product by one
per cent.

recoverable waste accounts for more than 94 per cent of the total waste. the amount of landfill waste declined by
62 per cent from the previous year. the amount of hazardous waste decreased by 38 per cent and that of total
waste by two per cent.

scope of reporting: in terms of raw material use, finnish production plants are reported for 2013 – 2016, while the
group’s continuous operations are reported for 2015 – 2016. landfill waste is reported for the whole group’s
continuous operations. water use for products is not included in the raw material quantities shown below.




water
water use is an important environmental factor at raisio, as water is needed in production and cooling processes.
water use is monitored continuously and water is recycled effectively. furthermore, we actively examine means to
decrease water use.

household water use increased by 14 per cent in the group. despite various enhancement measures, a number of
pipeline leaks in the uk resulted in the increase in the group's water use. in finland, household water use
decreased by over four per cent.

the amount of wastewater increased by six per cent in the group while decreased significantly in finland.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / environmental impact




emissions from energy production
raisio reports direct greenhouse emissions of its own energy production and indirect emissions of purchased
energy as co2e values. emissions generated in raisio’s production are calculated while for the purchased energy,
emissions are defined as co2e values of emissions reported by suppliers. carbon dioxide equivalent (co2e)
describes the total climate warming effect of greenhouse gases.

the groups’ electricity is purchased energy. electricity that raisio buys in finland is eco-labelled and its production
does not cause greenhouse gas emissions. electricity purchased in finland accounts for almost 60 per cent of the
group’s electricity use.

the uk and czech production plants produce heat from natural gas. in finland, our thermal energy is purchased
with the exception of the kouvola plant that has a steam boiler plant using natural gas. in raisio’s industrial area,
there is a power plant operating as a reserve plant. it will be closed during the spring 2017 when the new bioenergy
plant is completed.

raisio continues its work to improve energy efficiency and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / case: leading through information results in more sustainable milk
production




leading through information
results in more sustainable milk
production
modern barns generate plenty of information that results in more
profitable and sustainable milk production. internet of farming also
reduces the environmental impact of milk production.

milk increasingly comes from free-stall barns where one or several
milking robots take care of the milking. a robot generates a large amount of data on, for example, the cow’s milking,
activeness and production phase. raisioagro developed a milking robot monitoring service so that the information
gathered could be used more effectively.

monitoring service is meant for farms using robotic milking; real-time data on the yields, feeding and health of dairy
cows is gathered. raisioagro’s experts analyse the data and prepare a report for the producer who can then
optimise the feeding, improve milk yield and enhance economic profitability of the farm. this service is a concrete
example of the opportunities offered by the internet of farming.

the development of the service started in 2015 together with a few farms and milking robot manufacturers. with the
innovation, the aim is to create added value through feeding plans and feeds as well as through specialists and
investments made in a milking robot.

cattle welfare in focus

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / case: leading through information results in more sustainable milk
production
raisioagro’s monitoring service uses cow-specific information gathered by the milking robot. based on the data, it is
possible to monitor, for example, the impacts of changed feeding on yield as well as their effects on the relationship
between milk yield and feed costs. the report provides results regarding the entire cattle, while it is also possible to
follow the yields of different animal groups or individual cows.

only healthy cows produce a lot of milk. with the data analysis, it is
possible to closely monitor the cow’s wellbeing, quickly detect
anomalies and make necessary feeding changes.
                                                                                        monitoring service -

kilograms are reduced.

already more than 130 dairy farms, almost 15 per cent of the
finnish robotic milking farms, use the monitoring service, with very positive results. the energy-corrected milk yields
of the farms involved have grown by 6.5 per cent on average resulting in higher producer milk income.

raisioagro is the strongest finnish expert in the use of internet of farming. the company continues to further
develop its milking robot monitoring and other services using digitalisation.

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / case: the feed innovation baltic blend made fish farming more
sustainable




the feed innovation baltic blend
made fish farming more
sustainable
since june 2016, the innovation baltic blend® has
been used in all raisioaqua feeds. fish meal and oil
made of the baltic sea fish are used as raw
materials for the baltic blend feeds. when the fish
farmed in the baltic sea area are fed using local
feeds, nutrients are recycled and not brought to the
baltic sea from outside. with baltic blend, the
environmental impact of raisioaqua’s feed customers will be significantly lower as the
phosphorus load from fish farming turns negative and the nitrogen load is reduced to a
fraction of what it was before.

nutrient recycling is one of the pillars of sustainable food chain. until now, fishmeal and oil made of the fish from the
world’s oceans have been used also in the finnish fish feeds; now they can be replaced by fishmeal and oil made of
the baltic sea fish. this way, nutrients will not be brought to the baltic sea from outside.

with raisioaqua's innovation baltic blend, the same amount or even more phosphorus and nitrogen is removed, in
the form of herring used for fishmeal production, from the baltic sea than generated from the farming. according to

raisio annual report / sustainable food chain / case: the feed innovation baltic blend made fish farming more
sustainable
the natural resources institute finland, strong herring and sprat stocks in the baltic sea are considered
sustainable, so the local feed production is not harmful to natural fish stocks.

a significant reduction in the baltic sea nutrient loading
a total of 13,000,000 kg of fish a year is farmed in finland. the feeding earlier based on raw materials brought from
the world’s oceans has produced 60,000 kg of phosphorus load and 507,000 kg of nitrogen load each year. when
the baltic sea feed baltic blend is introduced, significant nutrient load reductions will be achieved. on an annual
basis, phosphorus will be reduced by 75,000 kg and nitrogen by 377,000 kg, so sustainable fish farming will
decrease the nutrient load in the baltic sea.

raisioaqua has also developed a feeding concept hercules opti allowing the replacement of fish oil used in fish
feeding by rapeseed oil while maintaining high levels of omega-3 fatty acids of fish. already from 2009, the hercules
feeds contain phytase enzyme. due to the enzyme, the phosphorus load into the water system decreased by 26 per
cent.

feeds have a significant impact on the sustainability of fish farming. wwf finland added finnish farmed rainbow
trout on the green list of its seafood guide in 2014 and finnish farmed whitefish in 2016. several raisio’s fish feed
innovations have reduced the environmental impacts of fish farming

cholesterol lowering now easier
also when travelling
raisio actively develops its benecol® product range so that it would be increasingly easy for consumers to lower
their cholesterol. the food supplement benecol soft chew launched in autumn 2016 is a new, convenient way to
lower cholesterol for example during the workday or while travelling as it does not require cold storage.

with changing eating habits and today’s mobile lifestyle, consumers increasingly eat away from home. since the
efficacy of benecol products is at its best when consumed with food, raisio developed a new, portable benecol
product storable at room temperature.

lemon and lime flavoured benecol soft chew food supplement is easy to pack as it is light and small. it is
sweetened with xylitol and the daily dose, 3-6 soft chews, is taken with one or more meals, with or without water.
the food supplement launched in the autumn has been well received. unlike other benecol products, benecol soft
chew is primarily sold by pharmacies. it is available in finland, ireland, belgium, poland and holland as well as in
raisio’s online oatlet store that supplies goods within the european union.

benecol products sold in raisio’s home markets are mostly cold chain items. the best-selling products are benecol
minidrinks and spreads. product diversification is an integral part of the renewed benecol. we want to provide
effective and tasty alternatives to lower cholesterol so that as many consumers as possible could find a suitable
benecol product.

raisio’s brand benecol is a finnish top innovation promoting people’s well-being in about 30 countries. it has
helped millions of consumers to lower their cholesterol levels for over 20 years.

quality and customer satisfaction
through lean thinking
raisioagro has determinedly implemented lean thinking. over the last few years, many of the company’s processes
have been simplified and raisioagro has established its way to focus on the work creating value for customers.

lean thinking is a management philosophy aiming to improve customer satisfaction, quality and cost-effectiveness.
raisioagro has implemented lean thinking since 2014. all employees have attended multi-day lean training events;
practices and processes have been discussed from a new perspective using lean tools. after the events, business
processes have been described according to lean, and wastes - non-value adding phases – have been cut down
and shortened. earlier, particularly the production focused on the improvement of resource efficiency, but now the
focus is on the development of the flow efficiency.

in lean thinking, value is defined as something that the customer is
willing to pay for. roughly speaking, all other activity is waste that
should be avoided or at least minimised. the idea is to make things
                                                                                        lean has helped to focus on

improvement and learning are fundamental principles in lean
thinking.

encouraging results
the new management approach has brought significant results. as the manufacturing is based on customer
demand, lead time has been reduced and stocks of raw materials and finished goods have decreased. at the same
time, we have been able to serve customers more flexibly and employees have learned to better understand the

raisio annual report / workplace safety and well-being / case: a comfortable work environment improves
employee interaction and atmosphere




a comfortable work environment
improves employee interaction and
work atmosphere
work environment plays a significant role in the employee wellbeing and work routines.
raisio’s benecol unit in poland moved to new offices early 2016. employee engagement,
work climate and internal communication improved with the new open-plan office.

poland is one of raisio’s biggest markets for benecol products. at the beginning of 2016, over ten raisio's office
employees moved to an open office with better transport links. the open-plan office had many positive impacts. the
bright office is in a modern building, with premises of other international companies.

workspace affects work routines
new premises with mainly open-plan space have changed work routines. the staff now have a common break room
which has increased interaction among employees.

with the open-plan office, internal communication has significantly improved. members of different teams - customer
service, finances, marketing and sales - now sit next to each other which makes communication easier. the number
of internal emails has decreased considerably as people work together and communicate face-to-face. a sense of
togetherness and work atmosphere have improved.
