our unchanging management philosophy and sustainability
our mission at panasonic is to contribute to the advance of world
culture by working to improve society through the products we
produce and sell. panasonic’s basic management objective clearly
expresses the purpose of our business activities as well as the
purpose of our existence.

since the company’s founding in 1918, this management philosophy
has formed the foundation of all our business activities. as the
key element of this philosophy, we have the basic concept of
the “company as a public entity of society.” all the management
resources of a company-including the people, money, and
commodities-all come from society.

while the company engages in business activities using the
resources entrusted by society, it also develops along with society,
and so the company’s activities must be transparent, fair, and just.

the entire panasonic group takes care to ensure that our management and business activities are appropriate for “a public
entity of society,” and we will continue to implement this management philosophy through manufacturing as our primary
business. this is also the very essence of the panasonic group’s sustainability. as we stand at historical turning points
in many areas today-society, economy, global environment-the panasonic group will continue to promote sustainability
management globally and to contribute to the future of society and the world by proposing the lifestyles of tomorrow.

                                           (issued in june 1978)
                                           “there is much discussion today regarding ‘social responsibility,’ but while the meaning of
                                           that concept can be wide-ranging depending on social conditions at a particular time, the
                                           fundamental social responsibility of a corporation, in any era, should be to improve society
                                           through its business activities. it is extremely important to manage all business activities
                                           based on this sense of mission.”

   record of its efforts to contribute to today’s society and to fulfill its social responsibility.

system for the promotion of csr activities

continuously and organizationally managing issues and progress relating to sustainability
for each area of activity relating to csr—including human rights, fair operating practices, and the environment—panasonic
establishes executive officers and functional divisions. each company, business division, regional office, and functional
division has created various group meetings and opportunities for stakeholder engagement, the results of which are
incorporated into everyday activities. using pdca cycles, these panasonic group constituents monitor their progress and
act autonomously.

for issues affecting the entire group for which there are strong demands from society for us to respond, including by
contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as to water-related issues, decisions are made at board of
directors’ meetings and at group strategy meetings. concerning issues that are deemed the most material, the company
makes an analysis of and identifies such issues for each area of activity, and incorporates these important issues into its
operational policies. for material issues in each area of activity and the background to their selection, please refer to the
items on “management system” for the respective area (“policy” for the environmental area). panasonic conducts its csr
activities with respect for worldwide guidelines and stakeholders’ voices as a fundamental concept.

risk management

fundamental stance
panasonic’s founder, konosuke matsushita, coined numerous aphorisms which are still used at the company: “hardship
now, pleasure later,” “the source of our failures is within us,” “there are signs before all things,” and “small things can
create big problems; one must be alert to signs of change and act accordingly,” among many others. using these ideas as
a cornerstone in its thinking, the company conducts groupwide risk management activities covering its operations around
the world, with the aim of taking preemptive actions to eliminate “sources of failure”—that is any factors that could impede
the accomplishment of business goals.

at panasonic, risk management functions in parallel with the development and execution of management strategies. the
company believes that by combining these two functions, it is better positioned to accomplish its business objectives and
to increase its corporate value. furthermore, by disclosing appropriate information concerning risks to the public, improving
the transparency of its management, and reducing risks through preemptive measures, the company gives its customers
and other stakeholders—as well as local communities and the public as a whole—greater confidence in its organization.

organizational system
in april 2005, panasonic established the global & group risk management committee (g&g risk management
committee), which promotes risk management throughout the whole panasonic group. the chief risk management
officer (cro), who is nominated from among group management, chairs the committee whose membership consists of
company chief risk officers (cros) and managers from regional headquarters, the corporate strategy head office, and
functional divisions. the risk management promotion office serves as the committee’s secretariat.

the g&g risk management committee determines what serious risks the entire company faces, as corporate major
risks, based on the results of risk assessments conducted by each company, affiliates, the panasonic headquarters, and
regional headquarters. this constitutes part of panasonic’s corporate compliance with legal mandates. the committee also
monitors the progress of plans instituted by the companies, affiliates, panasonic headquarters, and regional headquarters
for countering serious risks. as needed, it provides instructions to functional divisions and various committees, as well
as assistance for companies, affiliates, panasonic headquarters, and regional headquarters, promoting continuous
improvement. the g&g risk management committee reports the status of monitoring to auditors and is itself monitored
and evaluated by the audit & supervisory board.

basic framework
panasonic has three levels of management cycles for risk management: the g&g risk management committee, four
panasonic companies, and business divisions. each year, an assessment of the impact of risks that could affect the
business management of companies and affiliated business divisions is undertaken using a single, global set of standards
incorporating the potential impact on business operations, probability of risk occurring, and other factors. steps are then
taken to identify major company risks and to ensure that appropriate countermeasures are implemented. taking into
consideration these major company risks, the g&g risk management committee considers and identifies those major
risks that require attention from a group-wide perspective. the g&g risk management committee also monitors progress
made concerning countermeasures as a means to improve and strengthen group-wide risk management.

increasing risk sensitivity
the g&g risk management committee systematically educates, and raises awareness among, panasonic group
employees to ensure the thorough dissemination of knowledge of basic policies on risk management and for these to be
put into practice. in addition to disseminating information to all employees through internal communications on its activities
(selected corporate major risks and the progress of measures for handling those risks), the g&g risk management
committee provides annual seminars on risk assessment for managers in charge of risk management promotion. the
committee aims to increase the level of skills for the effective conducting of risk assessments by explaining panasonic’s
basic policy on risk management, “the risk management guidelines.”

in addition, to prevent risks from becoming even more severe when they have manifested and responses have been
insufficient, the committee issues “guidelines for business unit directors on responding to risk occurence” to the
business unit directors and ensures that these guidelines are put in place thoroughly. the committee improves the ability
to handle risks on the ground overseas by providing training on the essentials of risk management, how to respond when
risks have manifested, and related matters for newly appointed presidents of overseas affiliates and for employees who are
about to be posted overseas.

the committee has organized hotlines as a mechanism for employees to report latent risks regarding matters such as
compliance violations, various forms of workplace harassment, and improprieties in procurement processes. employees
and suppliers are able to report any perceived problem independently and at any time. the company has also established
a mechanism by which all employees can independently report latent compliance-related risks in the workplace through
annually conducted compliance awareness surveys. feedback concerning reported risks is provided to each workplace,
and these risks are dealt with.


initiatives relating to business continuity management (bcm)
as a public entity of society, panasonic has established as part of its management philosophy that it will contribute to the
advancement of world culture by working to improve the quality of life of society through the products that it produces and
sells. since 2005, the company has been keenly aware of the necessity of activities relating to business continuity—one of
the company’s duties to society. the company thus engages in business continuity management (bcm), whose goal is to
prevent a halt to the supply of products or the provision of services when contingencies such as disasters have occurred,
or, in the rare event that service has halted, to restart operations as quickly as possible.

specifically, if disasters or other incidents were to occur within our supply chain, they would impact the production or sales
of our group companies. in the case of btob, this impact would also affect the production and sales of companies to which
we deliver. this is why panasonic believes it is critical to have bcm that includes our supply chain.

for this reason, we have conducted a hazard survey of various risks posed by natural disasters in countries around the
world—earthquakes, floods, tropical depressions, tsunamis, naturally occurring fires, landslides, tornadoes, and volcanic
eruptions. we have also shared these findings with each of the four companies and have put priority-ranked measures
in place, both within our own group and in our supply chain. we also work hard to obtain information on disasters
and incidents and to respond swiftly in real time, both in order to confirm the safety of our employees and to provide
uninterrupted supply to customer companies.

forecasts indicate a high probability of a major earthquake in japan, directly under the tokyo metropolitan area or in the
nankai trough, within the next 30 years. in response to these predictions, panasonic has established a cross-company
task force, which is promoting earthquake resistance and disaster responses, based on the latest government damage
predictions. the task force conducts annual groupwide disaster-preparedness training drills. it has established emergency
response headquarters at every level of the group, within the four companies, and within business divisions. these
headquarters are intended to maintain and improve panasonic’s initial response capabilities—including confirmation of the
safety of employees and reporting among different emergency response headquarters on the degree of damage.

in terms of procurement activities, we also manage the securing of replacement sourcing and the building up of inventory
for emergencies, based on evaluations of the criticality and interchangeability of procured parts.

concerning fires, the task force conducts periodic fire risk assessments, independent fire prevention checks, and fire
prevention audits and strives to prevent similar accidents from occurring again by sharing case studies of dealing with fire-
related accidents.

environment: panasonic environment vision 2050

panasonic environment vision 2050
the management philosophy of panasonic is based on the belief of our founder, konosuke matsushita, who said: since a
company runs its business by borrowing people, things, money, land, and so forth from the society, a company is “a public
entity of society.” he also said that the role of a company, which is a public entity of society, is to contribute to the society,
and therefore if the company’s activities destroy nature and take away people’s happiness, it would be like putting the cart
before the horse.

panasonic currently focuses on four business areas: consumer electronics, housing, automotive, and b2b, under the brand
slogan “a better life, a better world.” “a better world” means to face various social challenges including environment,
energy, and safety, aiming to contribute to realizing a sustainable society by resolving such challenges.

to date, panasonic has executed the environmental action plan “green plan 2018” (see pages 14-17), and has shown
steady progress to achieve its targets. meanwhile, with environmental and/or energy issues becoming more serious at a
global level, the concern for such issues is increasingly growing in the international society, as can be proven by the paris
agreement or sdgs (sustainable development goals) by the united nations.

under these circumstances, we wish to help build a society with clean energy to realize both “a better life” and “a
sustainable society” by making full use of our technologies in all of our business areas. the reasons why we focus on clean
energy are because: (1) use of clean energy is developing at a global level; (2) this is an area where panasonic can greatly
contribute to with its businesses; and (3) many of our products consume power over a long period and our businesses
create the most environmental impact in this area.

with such background, in 2017, panasonic formulated the panasonic environment vision 2050 (“environment vision
2050”), as a long-term vision for environmentally sustainable management.



                                               panasonic environment vision 2050



                                   to achieve “a better life” and “a sustainable global environment,”

                                                       panasonic will work towards
                                        creation and more efficient utilization of energy
                                           which exceeds the amount of energy used,
                                 aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle.




                                     energy used < energy created


the environment vision 2050 means to work towards creation and more efficient utilization of energy which exceeds the
amount of energy used, aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle.

currently, relative to the amount of energy used (energy used in our business activities such as during production, and
energy used by products in the hands of our customers), the amount of energy created (clean energy that is created
and/or made available by products and services by panasonic, such as photovoltaic power generation systems, storage
batteries, and energy solutions) is merely one-tenth. from now on, for the energy used, we will develop technologies for
improving energy-saving performances of products and innovate manufacturing processes to reduce the amount of energy
consumption. for the energy created, we will expand energy-creation and storage businesses as well as contribute to new
social systems such as a hydrogen society to increase the amount of clean energy.

through these efforts, panasonic will endeavor to make the “energy created” exceed the “energy used” toward the year 2050.

                                                                             11

activities for achieving the environment vision 2050
one of the initiatives to realize the environment vision 2050 is “creating a safe and secure society with clean energy.” to be
specific, we will work to provide eco-conscious and smart living spaces as well as contribute to eco-conscious and smart
travel and transport.

another initiative is “promoting businesses aiming for a sustainable society.” we will work to promote effective utilization of
resources as well as promote the creation of factories with zero co2 emissions.

1. panasonic will create a safe and secure society with clean energy
the eco-conscious and smart living spaces that panasonic strives to provide means living spaces that create clean energy
from electricity and/or hydrogen, and then storing/transporting the created energy. such living spaces offer a safe and
secure life with clean energy enabled through appropriate energy management for energy-saving equipment and buildings
with high insulation performances. here, living spaces refer to not only homes of individuals but also working or learning
spaces, and spaces for living or leisure. it refers to all spaces relating to people’s lives.

in order to realize this, panasonic will work on development of environmental technologies from the four viewpoints of
energy creation, energy saving, energy storage, and energy management.

as for energy creation, in particular, we will develop fuel cell technologies that use next-generation solar cells, or hydrogen
derived from clean energy as energy sources. at the same time, for energy storage, we will work on technologies relating
to storing and/or supplying hydrogen, and storage batteries. these will expand the possibilities of utilizing clean energy
anywhere in the society.

we will also work on developing environmental technologies to realize eco-conscious and smart travel and transport. with
further development in technology of storage battery systems for eco-cars such as electric vehicles, we will contribute
to promoting the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. additionally, for a safe mobility society, we will work on further
development of support systems for autonomous driving and utilize our iot technology etc. to realize next-generation
logistics/transport solutions that help arteries in the society flow more smoothly.

2. panasonic will promote businesses aiming for a sustainable society
as efforts to promote effective utilization of resources, panasonic will aim for sustainable use of resources through the
reuse of parts and materials and product recycling.

to create factories with zero co2 emissions, we are switching the lighting to led, and plan to complete this transition
by the end of fiscal 2019*1. we will also expand the utilization of advanced energy-management systems such as fems*2
and smart manufacturing. in addition, we will complete the adoption of photovoltaic power generation systems in all our
business sites by 2020*1 as an initiative to increase energy creation.
*1 installable sites
*2 factory energy management system

environment: policy

environmental policy
contributing to society has been the management philosophy for panasonic ever since its founding, and we have been
taking measures against pollution since the 1970s. we announced the environmental statement in june 5, 1991, clarifying
our approaches to address global environmental issues as a public entity of society. since then we have been carrying
out initiatives including matters on global warming prevention and resources recycling corporate-wide, aiming to attain a
sustainable, safe, and secure society.

after the completion of the green plan 2010 which was established in 2001, the green plan 2018 was established in 2010
to clarify our targets for fiscal 2019 (from april 1, 2018 to march 31, 2019) as well as an action plan for all employees
in order to achieve the targets. the green plan 2018 will continue our initiatives in five areas: co2 reduction, resources
recycling, water, chemical substances, and biodiversity.

in 2013, the panasonic group introduced a new brand slogan, “a better life, a better world,” aiming to realize a better
life for all its customers, and is promoting environmental initiatives as an important element in achieving that goal. based
on this, the green plan 2018 was revised in 2013, followed by the newly-established environmental action guideline.
furthermore, in response to rising demand by the society for co2 reductions following the 21st session of the conference
of the parties (cop21) of the united nations conference on climate change, and to the need to make changes to our
business structure, including growth in the automotive and b2b businesses, the plan was revised again in 2016.

additionally, we formulated the environment vision 2050 in 2017 to achieve “a better life” and “a sustainable global
environment,” aiming for a society with clean energy and a more comfortable lifestyle. under the vision, through the
development of products, technologies, and solutions relating to energy creation, storage, saving, and management,
panasonic will work towards creation and more efficient utilization of energy which exceeds the amount of energy used.

environmental policy


                                                         environmental statement
     fully aware that humankind has a special responsibility to respect and preserve the delicate balance of nature,
     we at panasonic acknowledge our obligation to maintain and nurture the ecology of this planet. accordingly,
     we pledge ourselves to the prudent, sustainable use of the earth’s resources and the protection of the natural
     environment while we strive to fulfill our corporate mission of contributing to enhanced prosperity for all.




                                                     environmental action guideline
     toward achieving a sustainable society, we will strive to develop our business through the creation of environmental
     value. for this purpose, we will address environmental challenges through our business activities and will expand
     our environmental initiatives based on collaboration with stakeholders.

     (1) initiatives to address environmental challenges
         - we will reduce co2 emissions through production activities and products/services.
         - we will work to efficiently use resources by pursuing recycling-oriented manufacturing.
         - we will conserve water resources through efficient use of water and prevention of contamination.
         - we will reduce the impact of chemical substances on human health and the environment.
         - we will consider and conserve biodiversity.

     (2) initiatives based on collaboration with stakeholders
         - we will provide products and services that create environmental value for customers with our technical strengths.
         - we will expand our environmental contributions with our partner companies.
         - we will deepen communications with local communities and work as a team to address environmental challenges.




                                                        environmental action plan



we strive to grow and develop our business through the creation of environmental value for customers with our technical
strengths while each and every employee follows the environmental policy to address environmental challenges. therefore,
collaboration with stakeholders including our partners is essential. we will continue to sincerely work on environmental
sustainability management through further collaboration with stakeholders.


environmental action plan “green plan 2018”
the green plan 2018 is focused on maximizing the size of our contribution in reducing co2 emissions through products
and services (see pages 33-34), which is an indicator that represents our efforts for co2 reduction, as well as on steady
and continual reduction in co2 emissions from our factories to contribute to making net co2 emissions from the entire
community peak and decline thereafter at an earlier timing.

panasonic has introduced its own indicator called “the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions” to strengthen co2
reduction efforts through products and services. the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions had been disclosed
from the fiscal 2011 results to represent the volume of our direct contribution to co2 emissions reduction by cutting down
power consumption during product use through energy-saving designs for our key consumer products. now, we are also
engaged in business development in the areas of housing, automotive, and b2b. accordingly, more of our products are
being integrated into finished goods and services of other companies, contributing to their energy-saving performances.
for this reason, we have defined the co2 emissions reduction effect in these business areas as “the size of indirect
contribution to reduction,” and disclosed the figures from the fiscal 2015 results. in addition, the revised green plan 2018
clearly stated the target amount of co2 reduction to clarify our contribution in these areas.

furthermore, we define our products and services that accelerate the transition to a sustainable society, such as energy-
saving performances, as strategic green products (gps). of these, we call the products that deliver the industry’s top class

                                                                            14

environmental performance “super gps,” and are actively working for business expansion and wider use.

in production activities, exhaustive energy-saving measures have been implemented in all factories worldwide, pushing
for further co2 emissions reduction in our production activities. as for resources recycling, we promote higher recycled
resource utilization ratio and factory waste recycling rate, as well as create more resources recycling-oriented products to
materialize recycling-oriented manufacturing.

in addition, the revised green plan 2018 has set new targets such as 100% completion of water risk assessments for our
factories. it also clearly states zero violation of laws and regulations related to environmental pollution by factories, and
products.

in the area of eco-conscious products and businesses, we have expanded the scope of our activities to products, services,
and solutions in our b2b business, while applying our strengths in home appliances. the concrete numerical targets
established in line with the revisions to the green plan 2018 are aimed at creating environmental value for our customers.
panasonic will deepen the collaboration with various partners across the supply chain and accelerate environmental
initiatives to extend better impacts on the society.

we will steadily execute this environmental action plan towards achieving our fiscal 2019 targets.

*1 the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the amount that
  would have been emitted without the improvements by the energy-saving performance of our products and productivity from fiscal 2006, and
  this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation by energy-creating products. this total of size of direct
  contribution through our key consumer products, and indirect contribution through our main housing, automotive, and b2b businesses. (see
  pages 33-34)
*2 co2 emissions per basic unit in logistics = co2 emissions in logistics/transportation weight
*3 factory waste recycling rate = amount of resources recycled/ (amount of resources recycled + amount of landfill)
*4 air conditioners, refrigerators, tvs, washing machines, etc.
*5 a zeh is a house designed to produce net-zero or nearly zero consumption of primary energy per year by improving the energy-saving
  performance of the housing structure and equipment and utilizing energy efficient means such as renewable energy. the japanese government
  aims to make zeh as the standard for new houses by 2020. including nearly zeh (a house that reduces its primary energy consumption per year
  by 75% to less than 100% by utilizing energy efficient means such as renewable energy).
*6 our target was initially set at 68% but has been revised to 22% in 2017. (see page 38 for details.)

environment: environmental governance

promoting corporate-wide environmental sustainability management
centering on pdca
striving for the creation of a sustainable society, we are following our initiative under the executive officer in charge of
environmental affairs (yoshiyuki miyabe senior managing executive officer as of august 2017) and working to fulfill our
corporate social responsibility through eco-conscious business activities as well as to resolve environmental issues such as
climate change, resources, water, etc.

panasonic group formulates its annual environmental management policy in accordance with the group management
policy, the environment vision 2050, environmental action guideline, and the environmental action plan, “green plan
2018.” the annual environmental policy is shared across the entire organization through the operation policy meeting led
by the executive officer in charge of environmental affairs, who has the authority delegated from the president. companies,
business divisions, and regional headquarters outside japan establish their own environmental policies and targets based
on this group policy, and plan and promote their activities accordingly.

the progress and results of activities for the key environmental targets we pledged achieving to society under the green
plan 2018, as well as environment vision 2050 are examined in the group strategy meeting. this meeting is attended by
the presidents of panasonic corporation and the four companies as well as other members of senior management, for
reviews of policy directions, issues, and, particularly important measures to be adopted.

in fiscal 2017, the environmental compliance administrators meeting (held twice a year) attended by the executive officer in
charge of environmental affairs and environmental compliance administrators at the four companies was newly established
to accelerate decision-making for corporate-wide action in the area of the environment. in addition, as has been the
way until now, successful practices, challenges in implementation, and approaches to mid-term to long-term targets at
companies and various regions are shared and discussed at the global environmental working committee meeting, held
twice a year, which consists of environmental compliance administrators and environmental operation administrators
at companies and regional headquarters, seeking to enhance the level of corporate-wide environmental sustainability
management through the pdca management cycle.

in principle, results of activities relevant to environmental targets are gathered and assessed on a monthly basis as
environmental performance data, to identify the achievements, and additional measures are taken as needed. feedback of
annual performance data is given internally and disclosed externally after review, onsite audits, and independent assurance
by a third-party. moreover, reviews and feedback from stakeholders are utilized in subsequent measures to ensure further
continuous improvement.


promotion system for environmental sustainability management
to implement key measures across the entire company, theme-specific committees and working groups are formed
to set a promotional structure that enables coordinated action across companies, related job functions, and regional
headquarters outside japan. specific examples include the product chemical substance management committee which
deliberates and ensures the implementation of chemical substance management guidelines, and the product environmental
law working group which engages in information sharing regarding product-related legislation and reviews the actions to
be taken.

environment: environmental management systems

environmental sustainability management founded on environmental
management systems (ems)
as the foundation of environmental sustainability management, panasonic established ems in all of our manufacturing sites
across the world in fiscal 1999, and has continued to have the sites iso14001 certified since then.

in order to further reinforce environmental sustainability management globally, we have established ems in all our sites
including non-manufacturing sites across the world, and these sites have certified iso14001 in principle. in october
2011, we published the environmental management system establishment guidelines that summarize ems concepts for
different business forms such as manufacturing, sales and services, and head office administration, aiming to build ems in
accordance with the basic rules for environmental affairs on a global scale. based on the guidelines, group-wide action is
underway to achieve the goals set out in the green plan 2018.


the revisions to iso 14001 in 2015 called for consolidation of environmental
and business activities as well as for actions from a wider perspective. in
response to the revision, activities are underway to gain deeper understanding,
including in-house seminars on the transition held at each company and
business division, training sessions for internal auditors, information-sharing
with divisions that have already made the transition, and materials exclusively
prepared for top management aimed at promoting awareness. we will work to
complete compliance with the new standards during the transition period until
                                                                                                               in-house seminar on the transition to

environment: environmental risk management

group-wide systems to manage environmental risks
as a tool to continuously reduce environmental risks, panasonic has established an environmental risk management
system specific to each company. in accordance with the basic risk management policy for all companies (see page 8),
we promote (1) identification of environmental risks and group-wide risk management each year, and (2) ensuring quick
responses to reported environmental risks.

to identify environmental risks and implement the management system, environmental risks are identified for each
company and for each region in the world each year. from these risks, environmental risks on a group-wide level are
selected. the risks that show a high level of frequency or seriously impact business management are designated as major
risks and prioritized in planning and executing risk-reducing measures. these measures are implemented for each major
risk, and progress is monitored and followed up on a quarterly basis in the pdca cycle.

when an environmental risk is found, the relevant company, related job functions, and regional headquarters collaborate
to promptly implement emergency measures and recurrence prevention measures adapted to the risk level. also, the
management flow in case of risk discovery is standardized to prevent the occurrence of secondary risks as a result of
confusion.

environmental compliance management at factories
panasonic manages its environmental systems in full compliance with laws and regulations. we regularly measure emissions
of gas, wastewater, noise, odor, etc., and introduce preventative measures for cases that may lead to serious violations.

furthermore, key human resources are developed for information sharing among the companies/business divisions,
environment-related job functions, and regional headquarters, to ensure exhaustive compliance with legislation related to
factory environment management in respective countries where panasonic manufacturing sites are located. specifically,
activities to share information as well as specialized training are conducted for factory management officers in charge of
the management of chemical substances, waste, wastewater, and exhaust gas, either by country or by region in japan,
europe, china, and southeast asia. field surveys on laws and regulations using checklists were conducted on a global
scale to confirm comprehensive implementation of environmental compliance, and we also conducted verification of the
effectiveness of various measures. as a result of these efforts, we had no violations of environment-related legislation. we
will continue to ensure compliance with legislation as well as prevent recurrence.


compliance with environmental regulations relating to products
panasonic manages compliance with regulations relating to its products through a quality management system. compliance
with regulations is ensured with our products assessment system, a mechanism which incorporates environmental
performance targets such as customer demands for environmental performance, the energy efficiency labeling program,
and third-party certification systems, as well as evaluation of compliance with regulations on chemical substance
management, energy efficiency, 3r, and recycling, to (1) establish general targets at the product planning stage, (2)
define concrete targets at the design planning stage and confirm compliance at the design stage, (3) conduct interim

assessment at the design completion stage, and (4) conduct final assessment at the mass production decision-making
stage. additionally, acceptance inspections are being conducted on a regular basis for purchased components to ensure
compliance with the rohs regulations which regulates the content of six hazardous substances (see page 61 “chemical
substances management”).

notwithstanding, there was one violation of regulations relating to chemical substance management in fiscal 2017.
going forward, we will conduct reviews at a stricter level for potential presence of regulated substances and strengthen
compliance management.


measures against soil and groundwater contamination
in the latter half of the 1980s, soil and groundwater contamination due to chlorinated organic solvents was detected at
some panasonic sites. in response, we have conducted anti-contamination activities across the company. specifically
in 1991 we created the manual for preventing contamination of soil and groundwater and began conducting necessary
surveys and measures. in 1995 we discontinued the use of chlorinated organic solvents, and in 1999 created guidelines
on the prevention of environmental pollution to ensure there would be no recurrence of similar problems at our sites. in
fiscal 2003 we began enhancing our surveys and measures to comply with relevant laws and regulations, including the
soil contamination countermeasures act, which was enforced in japan in 2003, and in fiscal 2004 started implementing
measures to place all our bases across the globe under management supervision with regard to soil and groundwater.

specifically, we conduct onsite inspections and interviews at the bases, in addition to surveying their use of vocs and
heavy metals. furthermore, we implement surface soil surveys within the premises. for the sites where contamination was
detected beyond the regulatory pollution standards, we conduct detailed borehole surveys to identify the boundaries of the
contaminated areas and take remedial measures.

as a result of these efforts, we were able to place all our bases under management supervision in 2008. furthermore, in
fiscal 2011, the management supervision scheme was purpose-specifically reorganized and reinforced to establish a new
management supervision scheme. with the highest priority given to preventing dispersion of pollution beyond our premises,
this new scheme is implemented across all operating sites to further improve the level of measures against contamination.
in fiscal 2017, we reviewed the new management supervision guidelines in response to the amended soil contamination
countermeasures act in japan.

to adapt to the wide range of products (including automotive
equipment) in step with the expansion of our businesses as
well as to comply with laws and regulations that have grown in complexity in coordination with product design databases.

also, we aim to cut down co2 emissions during product use by improving the energy-saving performance of our products.
for this reason, the eco system (product) is used to globally assess the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions by
linking product performance data such as annual power consumption for each product category with other data such as
sales volume and co2 emission factors in each region.

environment: overview of environmental impact and
environmental accounting

overview of environmental impact from business operation
in order to mainly manufacture and market electrical and electronic products, panasonic consumes petroleum and
electricity as energy sources and resources as raw materials of parts and components. as a result, we emit co2 and
wastes into the environment. this diagram maps the environmental impact from our business operation from a procurement
stage to recycling activities. also, ghg throughout the entire supply chain is classified into scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3
and assessed according to the ghg protocol, the international calculation standard.

environment: eco-conscious products and factories

initiatives for eco-conscious products (green products)
panasonic uses a product assessment system that evaluates the environmental impacts of our products and services
starting at the planning and design stages. based on our criteria, we accredit our products and services that achieved high
environmental performance as green products (gps).

in the gp accreditation criteria, we assess the performance of our products in terms of prevention of global warming,
effective utilization of resources, and management of chemical substances by comparing not only among our own products
but also with competitors’ products. in fiscal 2012, we took steps to further enhance our accreditation criteria by adding
biodiversity and water conservation to existing items. this has in turn enabled the creation of a wider range of gps.

starting in fiscal 2014, the existing superior gps*1 have been enhanced to designate products and services that accelerate
the transition to a sustainable society as strategic gps. of these products, products that particularly create new consumer
trends are certified as super gps.
*1 products and services that showed superior environmental performance to products in the same category in the industry.

expanding the scope of strategic gps
panasonic has been devoting much of its energies into the creation of no. 1 eco-conscious products (superior gps) until
fiscal 2013. in the course of business reorganizations such as expansion of b2b businesses, panasonic has decided not
only to pursue environmental performance of consumer products but also to work on further expansion of products and
services that lead to the mitigation of environmental impact. starting in fiscal 2014, the concept of strategic gps has been
introduced for the creation of such products and services. in addition to alleviating impact on the global environment with
top-level environmental performance, we aim to accelerate the drive to shift to a sustainable society through a variety of
business operations, including those that are expected to reduce impacts through wider dissemination and those directly
cutting impact in specified regions.

the ratio of strategic gps rose from approx. 21% in fiscal 2016 to 23% in fiscal 2017. additionally, in our green plan 2018,
we have set the fiscal 2019 target as 120% of expansion of sales in eco-conscious b2b strategic gps (compared with
fiscal 2016). the result of fiscal 2017 was 103% compared to fiscal 2015. panasonic will work to further push up the ratio
of strategic gps in the future.

of the strategic gps, the following three were named super gps for fiscal 2017: combo, the home delivery box; hit™
photovoltaic modules for automobile; and se-hev lithium-ion battery systems.

combo, home delivery box for detached houses
the delivery box provides convenience for residents to receive a packet while they
are away and contributes to environmental protection by reducing usage of delivery
notice paper and co2 emissions from redeliveries. also, the delivery box provides a
stamp for the courier as a delivery proof and enables the courier to lock the delivery
box without using any electricity. no electrical wiring is necessary either for installation
or operation.

hit photovoltaic module for automobiles were adopted for the new prius phv
released by toyota motor corporation in february 2017. whereas conventional
automotive solar cells have an output of several tens of watts and have been used
for ventilation only, this product achieves high output of approx. 180 w, even in the
limited space on a car roof, enabling generation of drive power. this allows evs to
run for some 1,000 km, or roughly 10% of the average annual travel distance of a
                                                                                                                      hit photovoltaic modules for

se-hev lithium-ion battery system
se-hev uses a gasoline engine for the power generator, and electrically drives the
vehicle by supplying the motor with electric power stored in the battery. the power
for the vehicle’s entire drive system is provided by the motor. to contribute to the
acceleration feeling of evs, higher fuel economy, and better cabin comfort, a compact
and highly reliable lithium-ion battery with the industry’s top charging/discharging
performance was developed. a small and light battery system installable in a limited
vehicle space was also achieved.                                                                                      se-hev lithium-ion battery

improving air quality in living environments
air pollution caused by pm2.5 etc. is now a major social issue not only in developed countries such as japan but also in
emerging countries including china and india. with this background, panasonic has set offering products, services, and
solutions that improve people’s lifestyles, reduce burden on the environment, and help make our society more sustainable
as the fiscal 2019 target in its green plan 2018 one specific element of the plan is to improve the air quality of living
environments (air purification), with a target figure equivalent to 14 million rooms with improved air quality over fiscal 2016
to 2019. the cumulative total for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 is equivalent to 6.98 million rooms.
examples of air purifiers are introduced in the following website.
http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/sustainability/eco/gp_gf.html


initiatives for eco-conscious factories (green factories)
panasonic is working on green factories (gf) activities in its efforts to cut down environmental impact caused by
manufacturing. specifically, based on legal compliance, each factory develops a variety of plans for reducing environmental
impact in production activities, focusing on co2 emissions, total waste generation, water consumption, and chemical
substance releases and transfers. progress control is implemented and improved through total emissions reduction and
specific unit management to achieve both environmental impact reduction and business management.

the gf assessment system was introduced in fiscal 2011, aiming for further advancement by visualizing the activity levels
at factories. under the system, the factories evaluate themselves on a one-to-five scale across 19 environmental activity
items classified into six basic groups: emissions reduction, environmental performance enhancement, reduction activities,
risk reduction, human resource development, and management. comparing the progress with other sites and implementing
relative assessment enables the factory to identify issues and voluntarily review/promote measures for improvement. in
fiscal 2014, the system was upgraded to enable the addition of further assessment items to the existing 19, based on the
company’s needs. for example, at companies where additional items have been introduced in the area of compliance
with environmental regulations and management methods, assessment questions such as whether voluntary standards on

air and water quality of the facilities/air conditioners have been set at a level higher than what is required by law have been
included to strengthen risk management at respective factories.

additionally, information on global activities for environmental impact reduction, legislation, and social trends are shared
through the manufacturing environmental information sharing group. in europe, southeast asia, china, and latin
america where our factories are located, regional information exchanges and competitions on best practices to reduce
environmental impact (presentation of awards for best practices and activities for group-wide expansion) are held as
needed. we are promoting gf activities suited to the issues of each region to boost and accelerate efforts and actions.

furthermore, the best practices regarding co2 emissions, waste, chemical substances, water, etc. at respective factories
are registered and shared in the before/after (ba) chart search system accessible on a global scale, to enable utilization
in other factories. in fiscal 2017, a large number of past cases that have accumulated were reviewed in detail. at the same
time, the system was improved to enable easier access to appropriate practices and case studies, by adding items such
as reduction volumes, economic benefits, and number of years required for investment recovery, and we are working to
widely promote management know-how, etc. across the group.

in order to support these gf activities, respective regional headquarters, companies, and related divisions in each region
are working on human resource development programs every year in their respective regions. training programs are
being organized, including those on energy conservation, management of chemical substances, and waste management,
which are in great demand in china and southeast asia where panasonic has many sites. special training programs on
environmental laws and regulations are being held especially in china, to ensure compliance with the legislation being
strengthened at great speed.

environment: co2 reduction

size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions
the paris agreement that went into effect in november 2016 sets out a target to limit global temperature increases to less
than 2°c above pre-industrial levels and a more ambitious target to keep global temperature increases to less than 1.5°c
above pre-industrial levels, as well as sets the goal for co2 and other greenhouse gas emission levels for the second half
of this century to be virtually zero. to achieve these targets, it is essential to cut co2 emissions to the greatest extent
possible, and companies are required to make further contributions to reducing co2 emissions.

panasonic has introduced a unique indicator “size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions” to accelerate emissions
reduction, targeting our products (for energy saving and energy creation). the size of contribution in reducing co2
emissions is defined as the amount achieved by deducting the actual emissions from the amount that would have been
emitted without the improvements by the energy-saving performance of our products and productivity from fiscal 2006,
and this amount is combined with the emission reduction resulting from power generation by energy-creating products.
in other words, it reflects the continuous efforts being made to reduce co2 emissions.

panasonic will continue to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions.

we will improve the energy-saving performance of our products to reduce the energy consumed in using the products.
the more energy-saving products are introduced and promoted, the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions will
further increase.

by using electricity generated by solar power generation and such, we can reduce co2 emissions from thermal power
plants. panasonic will further foster its energy creation business to increase the size of contribution in reducing co2
emissions.

meanwhile, since fiscal 2014, panasonic has been reinforcing its housing, automotive, and b2b businesses, and is
disclosing the co2 reduction effect results in these areas from fiscal 2015. specifically, the data represents “air conditioning
load reduction effects from improved insulation performance in panasonic housing,” “energy-saving effects from products
by other companies equipped with panasonic energy-saving compressors and motors,” and “improved fuel economy
effects from electric vehicles equipped with panasonic automotive batteries.” starting with the results for fiscal 2016, the
energy-saving effect of products by other manufacturers using panasonic vacuum insulation materials is calculated and
disclosed. from the results for fiscal 2017, co2 reduction effects as a result of energy saving such as less travelling made
possible through the use of hd visual communication systems are also calculated and disclosed.

we regard such contribution in reducing co2 emissions as “indirect” contribution to reducing co2 emissions, to distinguish
them from the direct contribution from products under the panasonic brand such as home appliances. this indicates that
panasonic products support the co2 reduction effects for products by other manufacturers.

our size contribution in reducing co2 emissions through products and services amounted to 52.69 million tons in fiscal
2017. of this, direct contributions amounted to 39.58 million tons, and indirect contributions to 13.11 million tons.

   expert opinion




                                            norihiro itsubo
                                            professor, faculty of environmental studies, tokyo city university
                                            dean of the graduate school of environmental and information studies


     following the conclusion of the paris agreement in 2015, the world reached an agreement to limit temperature rises
     to 2°c above pre-industrial levels. the following findings have been reported in recent studies.

     • the 2°c limit cannot be achieved unless dramatic cuts are made to co2 emissions immediately.
     • it is possible to keep to the 2°c limit if reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are started in 2015, but a 5-year
       delay in commencement is expected to cause the temperature to rise by 2.5°c. a 10-year delay is predicted to
       cause the temperature to rise by over 3°c, far exceeding the 2°c limit.
     • even if emission reductions were implemented right away, actual reductions must be achieved at a great speed
       that would accomplish carbon positive by 2080.

     it is imperative to reduce as must as possible the amount of energy consumed during the use of electrical appliances
     designed to be used for a long period. this is all the more essential in view of the fact that we cannot rely on nuclear
     power. panasonic has supplied energy-saving products and energy-creating products to the market at an early
     stage, thereby contributing to reducing co2 emissions in the entire society. panasonic’s size of contribution in
     reducing co2 emissions in fiscal 2017 was 52.69 million tons, which is equivalent to roughly 4% of the total amount
     of emissions in japan—this is a significantly major effect. the steady increase in the size of contribution since fiscal
     2011 demonstrates the company’s continuing efforts for innovation in its environmental activities.

     panasonic’s efforts to mitigate climate change are indeed diverse, covering not only its end-products but also
     its supply of intermediate products and business solutions with high energy efficiency. in addition, its active
     implementation of measures to adapt to climate change, including the 100,000 solar lanterns project*10 and the
     coastal monitoring system*11, is worth recognition. i look forward to panasonic’s continued execution of powerful
     initiatives as a leading global company working to address climate change from all directions.


*10 panasonic is promoting a corporate citizenship activity of donating 100,000 solar lanterns to communities without electricity in asia and africa by
    2018, the 100th anniversary of its founding. we contribute to resolve various social issues of the people living in communities without electricity.

environment: co2 reduction through energy-saving/
creating/storing products

energy-saving products
the size of direct contribution in reducing co2 emissions through our energy-saving products in fiscal 2017 was 35.70
million tons due to steady sales of home appliances and led lighting particularly in japan. in the breakdown of the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions by global product category, 73% was from air conditioners, lighting equipment, and
tvs. by region, japan, southeast asia & oceania, china & northeast asia made up approx. 81%. co2 emissions from the
use of our major products*2 in fiscal 2017 is estimated to be approx. 63.50 million tons*1. we will continue to further reduce
the co2 emissions from the use of major products by making energy-saving products even more widely available.

also, improvement in energy efficiency of major consumer electronics by 35% compared to the fiscal 2006 level is our
numerical target for fiscal 2019 under our green plan 2018. the results for fiscal 2017 marked 41% due to an increase in
sales of high energy-saving performance models. the green plan 2018 also includes a numerical target for fiscal 2019 to
achieve a 75% sales ratio for led lighting (residential and non-residential buildings), and the fiscal 2017 results marked 73%.
*1 from fiscal 2017, the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions and the amount of co2 emissions for household air conditioners are
  calculated based on the updated standards (e.g. jis) employed in calculating the annual power consumption. based on the previous calculation
  method, the amount of size of direct contribution in reducing co2 emissions in fiscal 2017 is 38.14 million tons, and the amount of co2 emissions
  is 82.12 million tons.

energy-creating products
we actively develop our energy creation business to maximize the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions. by
delivering photovoltaic power generation systems and household fuel cell cogeneration systems as means to create
necessary electricity with few co2 emissions, we reduce co2 emissions in society.

the size of direct contribution in reducing co2 emissions through energy-creating products in fiscal 2017 was 3.88
million tons due to the stagnant solar market for housing in japan. by region, japan accounts for approx. 80%.

other fiscal 2019 targets under the green plan 2018 include achieving 440,000 mwh of total power generation from
dissemination of household fuel cells (fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2019), and 5 million mwh of total power generation from
dissemination of photovoltaic power generation systems (fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2019). the results of total power generation
up to fiscal 2017 were 299,000 mwh from household fuel cells and 3.78 million mwh from photovoltaic power generation
systems.

initiatives for energy-storing products
energy-storing products such as lithium-ion batteries can be used in various situations for electric power storage and
contribute to co2 reduction through installation in offices, homes, etc. in addition, our automotive lithium-ion batteries
are one of the key devices that help promote the popularization of eco-conscious cars. panasonic is actively engaged in
the development of energy-storing products.

under our green plan 2018, we have set the target as 200% for battery supply demand for increase in automotive battery
supply (compared to the fiscal 2015 level). the results up to fiscal 2017 were 125%.
examples of energy-saving/creating/storing products are also introduced on the following website.

environment: global warming mitigation and adaptation

global warming mitigation
while people seek for affluent lifestyles, the acceleration of global warming caused by the increase in co2 emissions
from people’s daily lives and corporate activities is becoming a concern. panasonic promotes measures to mitigate the
progress of climate change and to minimize the impact by reducing the greenhouse gases emitted from its products and
services as well as production activities.

as measures to mitigate the impact of our products and services, we offer energy-management products and solutions
that link and control a range of energy-saving/creating/storing products.

in promoting our net-zero energy house (zeh), we defined a numerical target for the zeh ratio for all detached houses
under green plan 2018. however, the promotion did not progress as planned, with a slump in the rate of installation of
photovoltaic power generation systems, essential for zeh, as a result of the decline in the surplus energy purchase price.
the figure for fiscal 2017 was 17% compared to our initial fiscal 2019 target of 68%. this has led us to redefine the zeh
ratio targets to 17% for fiscal 2018, 22% for fiscal 2019 and 50% for fiscal 2021. to achieve these targets, we plan to
accelerate the dissemination of zeh by making effective use of government policies and by providing a comprehensive
proposal for eco-conscious and smart living spaces.

in addition to these energy management solutions in the housing area, the panasonic group is also promoting smart
town projects in fujisawa city and yokohama city in kanagawa prefecture. under green plan 2018, we are aiming to
start construction/sales at three locations (870 lots) from fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019. the results up to fiscal 2017
were three locations (424 lots).

more details on reducing co2 emissions at our factories can be found on pages 40-43. for details on reducing co2
emissions in logistics, see pages 44-46.

global warming adaptation
panasonic is also making efforts for adaptation to address unavoidable impacts on the
global environment that cannot be addressed by mitigation measures. such adaptation
is based on the matters indicated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change
(ipcc) etc., focusing on the impact of climate change on the ecosystem, society, and the
economy. further, we understand that it is important for the measures to take account of
regional characteristics, as impacts of climate change vary according to the region.

our measures are currently implemented from the viewpoints of the following two aspects:
                                                                                                                            coastal tsunami monitoring

as for (2), the importance lies in first identifying the issues to be addressed by
assessing the impact of climate change on panasonic. one such issue is the
effect of water shortages on our production activities. we are currently working on
assessing water-related risks, and we plan to examine necessary measures based
on the assessment results. for more details, see the chapter on water resource
conservation (pages 59-60).

environment: global warming prevention at factories

reducing co2 emissions through production activities
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in factories with the aim of contributing to climate change mitigation, as well
as improving production efficiency in factories and reducing energy costs.

since fiscal 2011, we have been using our unique indicator, the size of contribution in reducing co2 emissions, to improve
our energy management capabilities and reduce the co2 emissions per basic unit, working to maximize the size of
contribution in reducing co2 emissions in production activities. in revising green plan 2018, our environmental action plan,
we changed the indicator for co2 reductions in our production activities to “co2 basic unit,” with the target for fiscal 2019
to exceed the fiscal 2014 level by at least 5%.

in addition to individual efforts implemented in each factory, energy-saving and co2 emission reduction measures including
horizontal introduction of good examples across the company, specialist training, and co2 itakona initiatives*1 are
promoted. we are also promoting the introduction of photovoltaic power generation to achieve our fiscal 2019 target of “at
least 10,000 mwh of in-house renewable energy adoption.” our investment in co2 emissions reduction in fiscal 2017 was 2.8
billion yen*2.

as a result, the co2 basic unit in fiscal 2017 reduced by 8% compared to fiscal 2014. not only the basic unit but also the
total amount of energy consumption is reducing steadily.

furthermore, we are shifting the lighting to led at our factories, offices, showrooms, and other buildings. we plan to
complete this transition on a global scale by the end of fiscal 2019*3.

panasonic is a member of keidanren’s commitment to a low carbon society, a voluntary action program for global
warming prevention across the entire electric and electronic industry, with the targets set aiming at 2030. specifically, we
are steadily implementing energy-saving measures in factories and offices in order to achieve the goals set by the industry
in japan, aiming improvement in energy consumption rate in factories and large offices at an annual rate of 1% on average
towards 2030.
*1 itakona is a term unique to panasonic which refers to a process by which we review stages prior to production to study raw materials to
  ensure waste is minimized and quality is maintained. we apply a similar review process for our co2 emissions reduction efforts and call these our
  co2 itakona initiatives. the activity is aimed at discovering energy conservation measures from a new viewpoint through continuous display of
  energy consumption levels (energy consumption per basic unit), and analyzing the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit.
*2 includes all investments concerning co2 emissions reduction. differences or appropriate portions are not calculated.

*4 calculated using the weighted average of improvement rates compared to the fiscal 2014 in co2 emissions per basic unit, which is calculated
  by dividing co2 emissions by the volume of activity closely related to co2 emissions, including production amounts and volumes, etc. of each
  factory. basic unit of fiscal 2014 was converted into an index as 100.
*5 the factors related to fuels are based on the guidelines for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions (version 2.2) published by the japanese
  ministry of the environment. the co2 emission factor (kg-co2/kwh) for electricity purchased in japan in each fiscal year is fixed at 0.410 to
  accurately reflect efforts for co2 emissions reduction. if the factors set for each fiscal year are used instead (0.570 for fiscal 2014, 0.554 for fiscal
  2015, 2016 and 2017), total co2 emissions will be 3.19 million tons for fiscal 2014, 2.77 million tons for fiscal 2015, 2.61 million tons for fiscal
  2016, and 2.58 million tons for fiscal 2017. the factors above are also used for electricity purchased from power producers and suppliers (pps).
  the ghg protocol factors for each country are used for electricity purchased outside japan.

                                                                                                                                            under study to minimize energy
measures to visualize reduction effects. to date, we have                                                                                   consumption per basic unit

introduced more than 40,000 measurement systems and
factory energy management systems (fems) at all of
our global manufacturing sites, and we have continued to
promote our co2 metageji *6 initiative.

based on this scheme, the co2 itakona initiative has
been implemented since fiscal 2011. the activity is aimed                                                                               minimum energy consumption per basic unit
at discovering energy conservation measures from a
new viewpoint through continuous display of energy                                                                                                                                 time
consumption per basic unit of production, and analyzing
the factors that influence the variables in each basic unit.

in order to accelerate action under the co2 itakona initiative, we developed the se-navi software that displays energy
and production data simultaneously and analyze energy consumption per basic unit. the “energy-saving navigation
function” of this software quantitatively extracts energy loss per device as well as loss per factor, based on the automatic
energy loss analysis results through co2 itakona analysis. with this function, energy-saving efforts prioritizing processes
with large energy loss have been made easier.

conventionally, energy consumption and other data had been analyzed manually by specialists in order to develop energy
conservation measures. this function automatically analyzes data and enables users to consider energy conservation
measures based on the energy-saving measure database. not only did this contribute to a reduction in working time but
also to the identification of energy-saving measures without the assistance of specialists.
an example of factory energy conservation support service is introduced on the following website.

*6 metageji is a term unique to panasonic which refers to visualizing energy consumption and implementing measurable reduction initiatives by
  introducing measurement instruments, such as meters and gauges.

to continuously study mechanisms for co2 reduction, the factory co2 reduction working group was set up in fiscal
2017 as a corporate-wide program. one of the working group’s activities is the exhaustive use of measuring instruments
and fems previously introduced to bring greater results of co2 reduction. in model plants, measurement of physical
data of main processes such as temperature, humidity, and differential pressure, was added to enable multifaceted data
analysis and to bring further depth to our energy saving efforts.

at panasonic energy (wuxi) co., ltd., in china, attention was focused on heat source facilities with much exhaust gas,
and work data including heat volume, flow rate as well as points for quality control including dew point were visualized
in addition to energy data measurement. the introduction of a standby mode, which enables reduction of emissions
while keeping the internal temperature of furnace from dropping when not in
production, and automatic switching to standby mode when temporarily not in
production, has led to an annual co2 reduction of 115 tons.

at automotive & industrial systems company’s uji factory in kyoto,
temperature, humidity, and differential pressure in and outside the
manufacturing processes were incorporated into existing fems for data
analysis. this led to the discovery of a production floor with excessive intake of
external air. an annual co2 reduction of 80 tons was achieved by discontinuing
this external air intake and changing to internal air circulation.                                         factory co2 reduction working group



utilization of renewable energy
in order to reduce co2 emissions, panasonic actively and globally promotes the
adoption of renewable energy suitable to the characteristics of the region, such
as photovoltaic power generation.

an example of a large-scale implementation in fiscal 2017 is the 1.0 mw
photovoltaic power generation system installed at our factory in singapore that
supplies roughly 20% of its electric power demand at its peak. in europe, where
wind power generation is more advanced, a 2.0 mw wind power generation
system has been introduced at our factory in belgium, supplying roughly                                    photovoltaic power generation system in
                                                                                                           singapore
25% of its peak electric power demand. in addition, wood scraps and wood
dust generated in the manufacturing process and wooden pallets used for
distribution are being used for biomass power generation in gunma prefecture
and in the uk, respectively.

as a result of such efforts, our in-house renewable energy adoption across the
entire company*7 reached 12,000 mwh*8 in fiscal 2017, and we have achieved
our target under the green plan 2018, our environmental action plan, revised in
fiscal 2017, which was to reach 10,000 mwh in the use of in-house renewable
energy by fiscal 2019.                                                                                     wind power generation system in belgium

adoption of photovoltaic power generation systems is also underway at respective
sites on a global scale in addition to those mentioned above, and we aim for
completion at all sites considered feasible for adoption by the end of fiscal 2021.
we will continue our efforts to achieve further reductions in co2 emissions.

environment: green logistics

reducing co2 emissions in logistics
to contribute to the prevention of global warming as well as to improve transportation efficiency while reducing costs,
panasonic is working to reduce co2 emissions in logistics. when we revised green plan 2018, our environmental action
plan, in 2016, we set the targets of reducing co2 emissions per basic unit*1 by at least 1% year-on-year, and by 5% from the
fiscal 2014 level by fiscal 2019, focusing on modal shift, introduction of low-emission vehicles and biodiesel fuel, reduction in
transportation distances, and improvement in load factor.

in fiscal 2017, our global co2 emissions from logistics activities came to 0.82 million tons across the world, of which
international transportation was 0.33 million tons (41%), and domestic transportation within japan was 0.133 million tons
(16%). co2 emissions per basic unit of transportation within japan reduced by 5.8% from the fiscal 2014 level.
*1 co2 emissions per transportation weight.

modal shift*2 initiative in collaboration with logistics partners
panasonic promotes modal shift in transportation from trucks to railroad in order to reduce co2 emissions.

since fiscal 2016, panasonic has taken the initiative in modal shift, collaborating with our logistics partners, including
mitsui-soko logistics co., ltd., japan freight railway company, and nippon express co., ltd.

conventionally, we delivered cold chain equipment from gunma prefecture to
fukuoka prefecture by truck based on requests from customers. in 2015 we
established the kyushu stock point (sp) to achieve stable product supply and
optimize stocks of popular products. this enabled us to shift the means of
delivery from road to railway. the co2 emissions reduction effects from this shift
are equivalent to 304 tons per year (113% compared to the previous year).

as a result, our railway transportation in japan in fiscal 2017 reached 9,770 five-
ton containers, reducing 4,968 tons of co2 emissions.
                                                                                                            rail freight transportation
*2 switch from truck and air transport to railroad and sea vessel transport that has less
  environmental impact.



adoption of new natural gas heavy-duty trucks
from february 2017, we started using a new type of heavy-duty trucks that utilize natural gas*3 for product deliveries
between osaka and tokyo. this is the first heavy truck to be introduced under the project to accelerate usage of advanced
eco-friendly trucks and buses which commenced in fiscal 2017, led by the ministry of the environment in collaboration with
the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, and the ministry of economy, trade and industry.

panasonic participated in japan’s first long-distance trial of natural-gas heavy-duty trucks in fiscal 2010. since then, we
have been taking part in field tests and promotional activities by public and private sectors towards practical utilization of
natural-gas heavy-duty trucks. the truck adopted at this time can reduce
co2 emissions by more than 10% compared with diesel trucks in the same
classification that conform with the fiscal 2016 fuel economy standards.
on february 27, 2017, the first day of truck operation, the operator of the
truck—eco truck co., ltd. (kadoma city, osaka prefecture)—held a launch
ceremony sponsored by the kinki smart eco-logi council.*4

in addition to adopting natural gas trucks, we will continue to promote a
range of efforts to reduce environmental impact, such as by further modal
shifts as well as reducing waste from logistic materials.

  both people and the environment.




use of biodiesel fuel (japan)
panasonic promotes transforming waste cooking oil collected from its business sites into biodiesel fuel and utilizing it for
vehicles used in production, procurement, and marketing activities. since fiscal 2010, we have been using 100% biodiesel
fuel for the joint transportation with the asahi shimbun company in the tokai and tokyo metropolitan areas to enhance
further usage of biodiesel fuel.

however, due to the decrease in vehicles compatible with biofuel and also because of vehicles that shifted to diesel as a
result of discontinuation of production by biofuel suppliers, usage of biofuel in fiscal 2017 fell to 29,632 liters, 49% of the
previous year.

recycling of stretching film used in transportation
as an effort to reduce logistics waste, we jointly                                stretch film recycling scheme with nozoe
entered into a full recycling scheme for used stretch
film with nozoe industry inc. (nozoe) in fiscal 2015,
                                                                                                   nozoe collects used stretch film
and are continuing the initiative in fiscal 2017. the
stretch film used for our transport was previously
discarded, but is now recycled by nozoe as a material
for plastic garbage bags, which we then purchase.
                                                                                     nozoe                                      panasonic
a total of 182 tons of stretching film was recycled
in fiscal 2017 (117% compared to fiscal 2016) as a                                                purchases garbage bags etc.
                                                                                                 recycled from used stretch film
result of expanding our initiatives from sites centered
in the kansai area to the kanto area which was made
possible through the opening of a new recycling factory
in saitama prefecture by nozoe. we plan to further
                                                                                                  purchases stretch film and
expand this scheme to the north kanto and chubu                                                    uses it for transportation
areas in fiscal 2018. we will continue to make effective
use of used stretch film and reduce logistics waste.


landing shipments at a port close to the target sales area
aiming for higher efficiency in transporting products, panasonic is expanding its our efforts to land imported products at
a port close to the target sales area in japan. conventionally, landing of products was centralized to a port near the west
japan global logistics center (glc) in amagasaki city in hyogo prefecture, stored at the west japan glc, and then
transported to respective locations as required. landing the products at ports closer to the target sales areas can reduce
the distance required for land transport within japan, thereby contributing to reducing not only co2 emissions but also
inbound and outbound deliveries between sites as well as distribution costs. this effort has reduced co2 emissions by 1,107
tons per year.

we will further refine projection of sales demand in various regions and optimize stock amounts held in those areas, and
expand landing products at ports near target sales areas.

environment: resources recycling

recycling-oriented manufacturing
with swift economic growth advancing worldwide and bringing heightened attention to concerns over resources, the
sourcing of new resources and materials not only significantly impact the environment, but mineral resource depletion and
material pricing run-up have also become issues.

to address these concerns, and as a responsibility of a manufacturer that uses a large volume of resources, panasonic
has been propelling recycling-oriented manufacturing under the theme of recycling resources since 2010, placing it as an
important issue along with co2 emissions reduction. under the green plan 2018, which was revised in 2016, increase in
the usage amount of recycled resin and higher factory waste recycling rates continue to be promoted, and realization of
recycling-oriented manufacturing is being further implemented through efforts such as expanding the creation of recycling-
oriented products. recycled resin, in particular, is being promoted with a target figure to ensure increase in usage.

recycling-oriented manufacturing has three aspects under this concept, which are to minimize the amount of total
resources used and maximize the amount of recycled resources, aim towards zero waste emissions by reducing our
landfill disposal of waste from production activities, and recycle used products.

we have been working on the weight reduction and downsizing of products to minimize the total resources used, and are
continuing to increase resource collection through introduction of new recycling technologies and systems to expand the
usage of recycled resources.

furthermore, by reducing the amount of factory waste and thoroughly recycling resources from waste, we are working to
eliminate the amount of waste treated in landfills to as close to zero.

in addition to utilizing the resources that were previously wasted across the entire production process, we have established
a process where resources are recovered from used products, recycled into products, and further delivered to customers,
to realize sustainable business activities throughout the product life cycle.

we use many kinds of resources, including iron (27% of total resources used) and plastic (10% of total resources used),
due to our wide range of products and businesses, from home appliances, components such as semiconductors and
batteries, to housing. in recycling-oriented manufacturing, it is important to promote the reduction of total resources used,
and at the same time develop a recycling process according to the specific characteristics of each resource for expansion
of our usage of recycled resources.

furthermore, we clarify recycled resource utilization issues by identifying the volume of each type of resource used across
the panasonic group. for example, in the case of recycled resin, we used approx. 15,900 tons of recycled resin in our
products in fiscal 2017 by identifying the characteristics required in the materials to be used, securing a stable supply,
researching how to recycle it in production, and developing new recycling technologies. total usage of recycled resin since
fiscal 2015 has reached approx. 50,600 tons. although we have achieved the target under the green plan 2018, we will
continue to work on further reducing total resources used and maximizing utilization of recycled resources, to maintain and
improve our recycled resource utilization ratio.

in addition, as for the recycling rate of waste at factories, we had traditionally set different targets for japan and countries
outside japan according to the relevant local infrastructures. however, with the awareness of the importance of zero
waste emission activities, we have set a globally standardized target since fiscal 2011 and are taking steps to improve the
standard level of waste recycling across the entire group. the factory waste recycling rate*1 was 99.0% for fiscal 2017
against the target of 99% or more in fiscal 2019. (see page 57)
*1 factory waste recycling rate = amount of resources recycled/(amount of resources recycled + amount of landfill)

environment: reduction in resources used

reducing product mass
to minimize the use of resources for production, we continuously look to reduce the weight of our products. through
the product environmental assessment (see page 29), panasonic has been promoting resource saving from the product
planning and design stage, such as using less resources, making our products lighter and smaller, and using less
components. we also implement various measures from the standpoint of resource recycling throughout the product life
cycle, such as component reuse, longer durability, use of recycled resources, easier battery removal, and labels necessary
for collection/recycling.

examples of weight reduction and recyclable product design are also introduced in the following website.

environment: product recycling

global initiatives for used product recycling
aiming toward the effective use of natural resources and the prevention of environmental pollution, a growing number of
recycling laws have been enacted in various countries throughout the world. examples include the law for recycling of
specified kinds of home appliances (home appliance recycling law) and the act on the promotion of effective utilization
of resources in japan, the weee directive in the european union, and recycling laws in many states in the united
states. in china as well, a similar law has taken effect. in addition to complying with the basel convention which controls
the transfer of hazardous waste to non-oecd countries as well as with related laws in respective countries, we strive
to establish the most efficient recycling system in each country in view of its local recycling infrastructure including the
utilization of third-parties.

product recycling results in fiscal 2017 are as shown below. because the collected products are becoming more compact
and lighter due to less volume of collection and recycling of crt tvs and more flat screen tvs, and because the volume
of collection and recycling has decreased due to reforms of business areas in respective countries, the weight is in a flat or
downward trend.


fy2017 results
    japan           processed approx. 138,620 tons of four kinds of home appliances

   europe           collected approx. 30,000 tons of used electronic products

     usa            collected approx. 2,426 tons of used electronic products



product recycling initiatives in japan
in response to the home appliance recycling law of 2001, which covers four specified
kinds of home appliances, we established ecology net co., ltd. jointly with toshiba
corporation, which manages a geographically dispersed recycling network through
the effective use of existing recycling facilities nationwide. the recycling management
company operates all the recycling-related services, which includes supervising 343
designated collection sites (shared with “groups a and b”) and 30 recycling facilities, on
behalf of the “group a” manufacturers (18 companies including panasonic). our recycling
factories, panasonic eco technology center co., ltd. (petec), panasonic eco technology
kanto co., ltd. (peteck), and chubu eco technology co., ltd. (cetec)*1 conduct unique
research to improve our recycling processes for more efficient treatment of the four kinds
of home appliances*2 and for the recovery and supply of more resources. in fiscal 2017, we
processed approx. 138,620 tons of the four specified home appliances.                                                   compact crushing and sorting
                                                                                                                        system for heat exchanger of
amendment of the home appliance recycling law was considered in 2014 in order to                                        air conditioner in peteck

make recycling fees clearer and lower, as well as to improve recycling rates.*3 as a result,
the statutory recycling rate*4 was revised in april 2015.

panasonic recycling factories are working to further enhance resource recycling by improving the productivity and recycling
rates through efforts of applying different recycling methods according to the characteristics and materials of products.

peteck has developed and put into practical use a space-saving, low-cost compact crushing and sorting system, aiming
to efficiently sort air conditioner heat exchangers into single materials. the system can crush heat exchangers in indoor
and outdoor air conditioner units as they are, and removes grease with centrifugal force from high-speed rotating blades
on the crushing machine. aluminum, copper, and iron are sorted by gravity and blower. copper can be recovered at a high
purity of 99%.

in addition, petec has introduced crushing and sorting lines for copper pipes and mixed metals. in these lines, copper
pipes cut and recovered from the air conditioner line as well as mixed metals (mixture of copper and aluminum) obtained
after removing iron and plastic from crushed refrigerators are crushed again and sorted to increase the resource values of
copper and aluminum.

                                                                            50

recycling efforts in the europe / cis region
in fiscal 2017, we collected approx. 30,000 tons*5 of used products covered by the weee directive across europe.

producers with online sales in germany and warehouse facility space of more than 400 m² have to offer their online-
customers a weee take-back free of charge. this is not just as before via the municipal collection but also via so called
“nearby local shipping points.” panasonic germany took necessary action in this regards and ensured legal compliance
through offering a proper take-back solution to its online customers from july 2016 onwards.

the russian waste law has been amended several times. the most recent amendment came into force in january 2015
(comprehensive law).

a new decree sets environmental fee rates. given the low collection targets, the effective rates producers have to pay are
low in 2016/7. producers and importers must manage waste from their product and packaging waste either through self-
compliance or a collective organization, or pay an environmental fee. the reporting requirements for self- and collective
compliers (producers and importers opting to not pay the environmental fee) are laid out. the fee rates allow attracting
significant investment in waste management infrastructure and establishing the russian recycling industry. 14 members
(including panasonic) are registered as members of the newly formed collective organization epr e-waste recycling.
panasonic is working on further developing appropriate regulations through the industry association ratek.
*5 calculated by multiplying the weight of collected products per collection system by panasonic market share in terms of weight per collection system.



promoting recycling activities in north america
panasonic continues its leadership role in establishing and operating a recycling system for waste batteries and consumer
electronic products in north america. following the startup of a state recycling law in minnesota in july 2007, we
established the electronic manufacturers recycling management company, llc (mrm), jointly with toshiba corporation
and sharp corporation in september of the same year, and began recycling tvs, pcs, and other electronic equipment.

with collaborative ties to several recycling companies, mrm operates collection programs on behalf of 40 companies
across 20 states. mrm has collected approximately 340,592 tons since its inception in 2007. with the changes in
panasonic’s business strategies in the us in 2016, our remaining collection obligations are de-minimis, mrm will continue
operating its collection programs on behalf of the manufacturers it serves.

as for waste batteries, we established call2recycle in 1994 jointly with other battery manufacturers, and now provide
recycling programs for rechargeable batteries throughout the us and canada. call2recycle provides collection programs
and a robust retail collection network for over 300 companies, and collected approx. 6,386 tons of rechargeable batteries
in the u.s. and canada.

recycling end-of-life products in canada started in 2004 with the alberta government extended producer responsibility
(epr) regulation. since then a total of 10 provinces and two territories have legislated weee, each with their own
unique parameters and requirements. in an effort to harmonize these programs, panasonic canada takes active role in
the governance of the electronic product recycling association, a not-for-profit management organization which was
established with the mandate to standardize operations and bring about economies of scale on a national basis through
2,200 collection sites. they are now responsible for managing all the provincial programs with the exception of alberta and
the two territories, as these three programs are under the direct jurisdictions of their governments and not industry. the
currently active provincial epr programs have proven to be very effective in diverting e-waste as reflected in last year’s
totals, where 127,122 tons were collected and resulted in an average of 3.57 kg per capita in canada.

                                                                            51

these numbers reflect the ongoing trend of light weighting of our products and the reduction in the number of heavy crt
televisions entering the end-of-life waste stream. in 2017, new brunswick province and yukon territory will launch their
end-of-life recycling program leaving only the territory of nunavut to legislate e-waste.


initiatives in china
in china, through the executive committee of foreign investment companies (ecfic) and other organizations, we are
engaging in activities to clarify the definition of products covered by the second catalog (published in february 2015) of the
regulation for the management of recycling and disposal of waste electrical and electronic products published in may
2012 and enforced in july of the same year, as well as to gather information or submit comments on the establishment of
a fund unit price, toward early disclosure of information by the chinese government including ministry of environmental
protection and the ministry of finance.

we are also carrying out an assessment of developments in the plan on promoting extended producer responsibility
announced by the chinese government in january 2017 and reviewing our response.


international collaboration in southeast asia and oceania
the recycling law in vietnam has been implemented from july 2016 and it requires producers and importers to establish a
take back scheme for their products sold in vietnam. although the official implementation circular has yet to be published
by the vietnamese government, panasonic sales vietnam has set up 2 collection points in their hanoi and ho chi minh
service center as part of their efforts to support the government in raising recycling awareness and complying to the legal
obligations. panasonic sales vietnam is expected to set up 6 more collection points at panasonic’s exclusive service
centers in haiphong, thanhhoa, nghean, danang, ho chi minh and cantho from april 2017.

the national television and computer recycling scheme was established in australia in 2011.

panasonic australia is a member of the electronic product stewardship australasia (epsa), a co-regulatory arrangement
approved by the australian government to fulfill our obligation under the national scheme. below are the recycling-related
data for televisions and computers from 2012-2017:

                   period                        volume

      july 2012 – june 2013                   1,452 tons

      july 2013 – june 2014                   1,052 tons

      july 2014 – june 2015                   1,166 tons

      july 2015 – june 2016                   1,108 tons

      july 2016 – june 2017                   1,027 tons


the australian government has announced a review of the product stewardship act in 2017 and panasonic australia will
engage in this review through industry group representation. in addition, panasonic australia is part of the battery industry
working group with the queensland government and other stakeholders to investigate the viability to establish voluntary
recycling for handheld batteries.

regulators in malaysia, thailand, and singapore are also gearing towards the global trend of mandating responsible end-
of-life product recycling. discussions with regulators and industry bodies are in progress. such examples include malaysia
department of environment-japan international cooperation agency (jica) e-waste management mechanism development
project and thailand local industry association.

through such engagements between the government and industry bodies, panasonic hopes to contribute to the
formulation of sustainable e-waste management policy in each country.


recycling efforts in india
in india, the recycling new e-waste law has been notified by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change
(moefcc), which will be implemented from 1st of september 2017, with extended producer responsibility (epr) target
based on end-of-life (eol) defined in the e-waste (management) rules 2016. to fulfill the compliance, we will collect and

recycle waste home appliances through the “i recycle” program already established by panasonic india (pi).

panasonic has also been taking part in the consumer electronics and appliances manufacturers association (ceama) to
help develop the white paper containing reports on an analysis of current recycling activities in india, and a long-term plan
for waste problem solutions. the white paper with respect to e-waste channelization and eol of products was submitted
to the moefcc in october 2016.

we are having various dialogues with the indian government, jointly with ceama, about the epr target and eol definition
for recycling management.

we are also actively engaged in different active associations including the federation of indian chambers of commerce
and industry (ficci) and confederation of indian industry (cii) to establish an even more efficient and robust recycling
system and to submit industry comments to the indian government for a better governance system.


recycling initiatives in latin america
as the trend of reinforcing environmental laws progresses in latin american countries, discussions on establishment of
recycling laws and actual enforcement are being conducted.

we are having dialogues with the brazilian government, jointly with an industry association and retailers, about
the establishment of local recycling systems. through associação brasileira de reciclagem de eletroeletrônicos e
eletrodomésticos (abree), we are participating in the reverse logistics improvement project, to which the japan
international cooperation agency (jica) has been extending technological cooperation for three years, at the request of the
brazilian government, and working on building an effective system. in the test recovery program under the project, we have
started for the first time in brazil to collect used appliances from customers’ homes after they purchase a large household
appliance, in addition to collecting used appliances at the store based on collaboration with retailers and recyclers.

under the recycling law that came into force in peru in 2016, we joined a nonprofit organization asociación peruana de
actores para la gestión de residuos (aspager) as a leading member, and started a used products recovery program
through discussions with the government.

in costa rica, we have started collecting used products through unidad de cumplimiento para la gestión integral de
residuos electrónicos (asegire), a compliance organization for integrated management of waste electronics, and a similar
program is underway in mexico under the government-approved recycling and management plan. in colombia, we formed
a recycling management organization under and alliance of manufacturers liaising with governmental organizations and
industrial groups, and started collecting refrigerators from 2014, aiming to resolve ozone depletion issues.

the legislation process has also been accelerated in chile, and preparations are underway through continuous discussions
with the government to create a collection program. in argentina, we are participating in the latin american battery
association (alpiba) and engaging in continuous discussions with the government for effective legislation on regulations
for dry cell batteries.

using technologies such as our original near-infrared identification technology, petec
is capable of sorting shredder residue of waste home appliances into three major
types of resins with different purposes and properties—polypropylene (pp), acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene (abs), and polystyrene (ps)—at a material purity of over 99%.

the recycled single resins sorted and recovered at petec are then transferred to
the adjacent kato plastic recycling factory to be further purified and processed to
recover their chemical properties. kato plastic recycling factory is a manufacturing
and development site that demonstrates promotion of use of recycled resin at our
                                                                                             near-infrared sorting machine that can sort
appliances company, a home appliance manufacturer and seller. the factory plays              three types of resin simultaneously
an important role in enhancing recycled resin utilization by developing recycling
technologies, such as a more efficient method for improving the purity of recycled resins. recycled resin is generally weaker
in strength and has a shorter life than new resin. this is why its chemical properties have to be recovered to the level of new
resin to make them usable as materials and components in new products. the properties required by our customers vary
depending on the resin. we have established techniques that make full use of the properties optimal to each resin such as
pp, abs, and ps, which include adding antioxidants or mixing recycled and new resins.

in fiscal 2017, development of high-performance materials started, including the recycling of flame retardant ps from the
back covers of tv sets and flame retardant pp from nonwoven fabric. a recycling method was also developed for ppgf (pp
containing short glass fibers) from drum-type washing machines that had not been recycled in the past into talc-filled pp with
high rigidity.

recycled resin quality-assured by kato plastic recycling factory are being used in our manufacturing factories, and
depending on the resin type, reborn as air conditioner filter frames or internal parts of ih cooking heaters and refrigerators.

building a recycling scheme for scrap iron
jointly with tokyo steel co., ltd., we started a recycling scheme for scrap iron in july 2013. in this scheme, we recover the
scrap iron from used home appliances and tokyo steel makes it into steel sheets. we then purchase the sheets back as a
material for our products. supplying scrap iron for recycling and repurchasing the recycled iron is the first scheme of its kind
in the japanese electrical manufacturing industry.

specifically, scrap iron from home appliances collected and treated at petec is supplied to tokyo steel’s okayama plant,
where the scrap iron is processed into electric steel plates.*1 panasonic procures the recycled steel plates and utilizes
them in products. discussions with tokyo steel commenced in 2010, and we have worked together since then to improve
the quality of recycled iron to a level sufficient for production use, as well as developing the technology to improve the
applicability of the recycled iron. from this we identified the optimum application of the electric steel plates, and refined
its specific features (e.g. shape, strength, and weldability) to meet application-specific requirements. use of thin electric
steel plates in our products was first made possible in 2011. through this close collaboration, we materialized this recycling
scheme in 2013, a scheme where a home appliance recycling company that we own supplies scrap iron to be used to
make electric steel plates.

the amount of scrap iron we initially supplied to tokyo steel was about 50 tons per month. in fiscal 2017, it reached over
2,600 tons, and the recycled steel is being used in our products, including washing machines and ceiling materials for
housing.

the increase in electric steel plate usage leads to an increase in the usage of scrap iron, which is one of the most important
resources in japan. in addition, producing steel plates from scrap iron emits much less co2 compared with producing
steel plates from scratch. this scheme also stabilizes the procurement price, because the price of scrap iron supplied from
petec and the price of electric steel plates procured from tokyo steel are determined by the scrap iron fluctuation rate
agreed between the two companies. we will further expand this recycling scheme for more efficient resource utilization,
co2 emissions reduction, and stabilization of procurement prices.

environment: factory waste management – zero waste emissions

improving factory waste recycling rate
from the viewpoint of effective usage of resources, we believe that generation of waste and revenue-generating waste at
factories must be minimized, even if such waste could be sold as valuable commodities. based on this belief, we identify
the amount of generated waste (including both revenue-generating waste and factory generated waste) and classify it
into: (1) recyclable waste (including those that can be sold and those which can be transferred free of charge or by paying
a fee), (2) waste that can be reduced by incineration or dehydration, and (3) landfill (waste with no option other than being
sent to landfills).

we reduce the emission of waste by boosting yield in our production process and increasing the recycling rate of our
waste materials. accordingly, we strive globally toward achieving our zero waste emissions from factories*1 goal by
reducing the amount of landfill to nearly zero. we have reinforced such efforts particularly in china and other asian
countries, where many of our factories are located. we will continue our initiatives to achieve the factory waste recycling
rate target of 99% by fiscal 2019.

as a means to reduce the generation of waste, we are fostering resource-saving product design. in our production
activities, we are engaging in resource loss reduction, employing our own unique material flow analysis methods. we
consider materials that do not become products and excessive use of consumables as resource losses, and make the
material flow and lost values for each process visible in order to resolve the issues with close collaboration with the
design, manufacturing, and other relevant business divisions. in the future, we will promote further reductions in resource
losses through the resource loss navigation, our original system developed to automatically display information to help
reduce resource losses.

as measures to reduce the amount of landfill of waste and revenue-generating waste, we constrain the amount of waste
materials that are particularly difficult to recycle, such as thermosetting resin. we are also strictly adhering to waste
sorting practices in production processes to further expand the reuse of resources.

because waste recycling rates in our overseas factories lag behind those in japan, we have worked to improve the
average level of recycling activities by sharing information within and between regions outside japan. specifically,
in addition to accelerating the information sharing on waste recycling issues between our local factories and group
companies in japan, we also promote the sharing of excellent examples and know-how among our factories across
regions by utilizing ba charts*2 prepared by each region, following our long-standing approach toward co2 reduction
activities.

environment: water resource conservation

approaches to water resource conservation
it is said that available fresh water is only about 0.01% of the earth’s total water resources. in addition, the world economic
forum, host of the davos meetings, has stated in its annual report on global risks that the water crisis continues to be one
of the top risks with global impact, in view of the increase in water consumption to be caused by future economic growth
and population increases.

with water shortages becoming an increasingly grave social problem, panasonic is working to conserve water resources
both in its products and production activities, in order to fulfill its social responsibility and to reduce management risks. our
environmental policy (page 14) stipulates that we make efforts to conserve water resources by using water efficiently and
preventing pollution. in green plan 2018, our environmental action plan toward fiscal 2019, we aim to expand the range of
products that contribute to saving and recycling water. at the same time, we will work on reducing the volume of water we
consume and using more recycled water in our production processes, in order to conserve water resources throughout our
business activities. in risk management, we are aiming to complete our water risk assessments for all our production sites
by fiscal 2019.

concrete action that we have taken for this includes an evaluation of the scale of water risks in all regions where our
production sites are located, in order to identify and mitigate the impact of our production activities on our use of water.

in the evaluation, we employ evaluation tools such as the mapping tool aqueduct by the world resources institute (wri)
and the water risk filter by the world wide fund for nature (wwf), which can not only assess the physical risks of water
shortages but also examine the risks in water-related regulations as well as reputation risks in each region. we are also
making use of public databases available from respective national governments. furthermore, in areas with higher water
risks, we are working to collect information through public local information as well as through interviews with relevant
organizations, etc. by conducting detailed analyses and close examination of such local information and production site data
including water use volume, we will specifically identify the impacts on our production activities. this water risk assessment
process aimed for completion in fiscal 2019 has progressed by roughly 50% so far. although no obvious water risk that may
impact our business activities has been found at this point, we will continue our evaluations. at the same time, we will work
to conserve water resources and reduce business risks in regions where water risks are determined to be high, by focusing
on promotions to reduce water consumption and expand water recycling.

to promote such activities, we have established an environmental sustainability management system (page 18) for these
activities including water management, under the executive officer in charge of environmental affairs (yoshiyuki miyabe,
senior managing executive officer as of august 2017), and are aiming to raise the environmental management level by
implementing the pdca cycle.

in addition, we have established an environmental risk management system to continuously reduce risks, and (1) identify
environmental risks and promote company-wide risk management every fiscal year and (2) promptly respond to occurrence
of environmental risks (see page 21). we will continue to manage our environmental risks through these activities.

we are also a member of the water project, a public-private collaborative project aimed at boosting awareness, organized
under the initiative of japan’s ministry of the environment in 2014. its objective is to maintain a sound water cycle and
promote its recovery, and presents water-related activities by business corporations as well as communicates information
on the importance of water as its activities. we will work in cooperation with the japanese government and other
companies to conserve water resources.


water resource conservation through products
by thoroughly analyzing the use of water through our products, we have developed functionalities that allow a considerable
amount of water conservation by utilizing water at a maximum level through improvement of water flow control and cyclic
use. in fiscal 2012, we enhanced one of the criteria, water conservation, in our green product accreditation criteria (see
page 28-30), and are speeding up the development of industry-leading products that contribute to water saving.
 example of water-saving products are introduced in the following website.

initiatives for water resource conservation through production activities
by collecting and reusing wastewater from our manufacturing                         water consumption in production activities and water
processes and air conditioning systems, we reduce the                               consumption per basic unit

meanwhile, as represented by the enforcement of
the reach regulation*2 in the european union, the world is moving toward the goals agreed at the world summit on
sustainable development (wssd) held in 2002, which is to produce and use all chemical substances in a manner that
minimizes their impact on human health and the environment by 2020. in support of the precautionary approach proposed
in the rio declaration made at the earth summit in 1992, we have been manufacturing products in line with our basic policy
of reducing the use of chemical substances that might adversely affect human health and the environment throughout their
lifecycles. as specific initiatives, we aim to reduce the environmental impact of our products by (1) identifying hazardous
substances contained in our products, (2) evaluating these substances on their environmental impact, and (3) voluntarily
reducing or discontinuing their use in case of any environmental risks.

to promote our initiatives clearly, we set forth our chemical substances management rank guidelines, which prohibit or
specify certain substances for management in terms of our products and factory activities. companies in the panasonic
group are requested to follow the guidelines, and suppliers are also requested for support as necessary. in fiscal 2013,
we added level 3 to the chemical substances management rank guidelines (for products) to review the timing for the
prohibition of further substances that may adversely affect humans and the environment, in addition to the current and
forthcoming prohibitions.

chemical substances management rank guidelines (for products) and relevant documents, which prohibit or specify
certain substances for management, can be downloaded from the website shown below (green procurement).

management of chemical substances in products
to minimize the environmental impact of chemical substances contained in products, we endeavor to identify chemical
substances used in the components and materials of our products. in addition, for substances that are prohibited in
products in major developed countries due to legislation such as the european rohs directive, we specify prohibited
substances to globally ensure that they are not used or contained in our products, except in certain cases where
substitution of the substances is infeasible. we will also conduct environmental impact assessments for managed
substances contained in our products, take steps to reduce the use of substances where the impact on human health and
the environment cannot be ignored, and plan to eventually prohibit the use.


identifying chemical substances in products
to contribute to the achievement of the global goals set at the wssd, it is important for us to disclose and communicate
information on the chemical substances used in our products across the supply chain, for which we must promote cross-
industrial initiatives to establish and disseminate an effective system. we are a member of the joint article management
promotion consortium (jamp) together with about 440 major companies from various industries, such as chemical,
component, and equipment manufacturers. we are proactively formulating, utilizing, and disseminating chemical substance
management standards and systems through this organization. since fiscal 2005, we have been using a product chemical
substance management system to gather data concerning the chemical substances contained in the components and
materials for our products from our suppliers. in july 2009 we asked our suppliers to submit the data in a common format
by jamp, and approx. 10,000 suppliers are currently using this format.

meanwhile, in japan alone, burden on companies grew, as a number of hazardous substance inspections were carried out
throughout the supply chain using formats unique to each company that were not standardized such as the jamp format
for information communication. the ministry of economy, trade and industry recognized this issue and presented a new
scheme, “chemsherpa,” for sharing and exchanging information about chemicals contained in components and products
throughout the supply chain. because chemsherpa follows the standardized jamp format to communicate information,
panasonic has joined the scheme and adopted the use as the information-gathering format in its system. we plan to
replace the current jamp mechanism with chemsherpa by june 2018 when the jamp support and maintenance period
will discontinue (excluding communication of information on automotive equipment for the automobile sector for which the
industry’s standard information sharing system is already established).

in addition, with the supply chain expanding to a global scale, it is particularly important for overseas suppliers to deepen
their understanding on the handling of hazardous chemical substances. towards a full changeover to the chemsherpa
format, we will continue to promote the use to our suppliers through collaboration with jamp and jamp counterparts in
respective countries.

companies that procure electronic components may need to have a full understanding of the substances contained in the
components at the point of selection or usage in order to adhere to the eu rohs directive and reach regulation.
particularly, as the reach substances of very high concern (svhc) list is updated every six months, those companies
expect their suppliers to provide the latest substance data to demonstrate compliance with the list.

also, as a company supplying electronic components to other companies, we have published a table of rohs and reach
compliance status on our website since november 2012 so that our clients can obtain relevant chemical substance
information from us quickly and efficiently. the table covers our rohs directive compliance information and the substances
designated in the rohs / reach confirmation report for all our major generic electronic components.

in june 2015, the act on preventing environmental pollution of mercury was established to implement measures agreed
in the minamata convention on mercury. the act requires manufacturers of products containing mercury to provide
information such as labelling so that such products are appropriately sorted and discharged when being disposed of. we
have established a new webpage, information based on the act on the preventing environmental pollution of mercury, in
may 2017 to communicate information concerning the mercury used in our products to customers.

assessing the impact of chemical substances
scientifically identifying the impact on human health and the environment of products containing chemical substances is vital
to the development of products with low environmental impact. we are engaging in activities designed to assess the levels
to which customers are exposed to substances of very high concern (svhc), as well as safety at the time of product use.

to date, we have undertaken assessments on the impact of ceramic fibers used in certain models of commercial microwave
ovens. as part of our efforts to comply with the eu reach regulation which requires preparing information for the safe
use of products containing a certain amount of svhc, we have created and disclosed a safety assessment document. the
exposure was considered to be nominal with little concern for any impact on human health. furthermore, usage of ceramic
fibers in our products was discontinued in december 2010.

reduction in usage and emissions of chemical substances
fluorocarbons used as a heat insulator and a refrigerant
for freezers and air conditioners can damage the ozone
layer and cause global warming. we developed the
technology to utilize co2, which has much smaller
impact than fluorocarbons, as a refrigerant and have
been supplying a home boiler using co2 refrigerant
since 2001. although the co2 refrigerant is suitable for
heating purposes, it was difficult to apply to refrigerators
and freezers, especially in large professional equipment
due to insufficient cooling efficiency and size problems.
                                                                 ocu-cr2001mvf, a fluorocarbon-     fpw-ev085, a display case
however, with support from the new energy and industrial
                                                                 free freezer using co2 refrigerant compatible with a fluorocarbon-
technology development organization (nedo), we                                                      free freezer
developed a refrigeration system using co2 refrigerant,
and started supplying these fluorocarbon-free freezers and refrigerator display cases to supermarkets and convenience
stores in japan from 2010. by the end of march 2017, we delivered roughly 5,800 units to approx. 2,200 stores.

making the best use of our expertise in the japanese market, in may 2017 we also started sales of fluorocarbon-free
co2 freezers designed for small stores and prefabricated refrigerator/freezers for the european market, where f-gas
regulations and other environmental regulations are in place. we released the product in norway, denmark, sweden, and
belgium, aiming to sell more than 300 units in the first year. we plan to expand the market to other countries, including
germany and holland.


in addition, as measures against ozone depletion caused by hcfcs, a refrigerant called r410 that does not deplete
the ozone layer was used in compact air conditioners, but this substance has a very high global warming potential
(gwp). panasonic then developed a model that uses a new refrigerant r32, which has a lower gwp and introduced it
to the market in 2013. furthermore, pt. panasonic manufacturing indonesia, which owns the factory for manufacturing
compact air conditioners in indonesia, redesigned its production facility that used an ozone-depleting hcfc refrigerant
r22 to one using r32 in fiscal 2015, and commenced supplying new r32-based air conditioners. panasonic contributed
to the indonesian government’s initiative to eliminate the use of hcfcs.

mercury lamps are currently widely used as the light source for projectors, because they provide high luminosity easily.
however, mercury can have a serious impact on human health and the environment if not treated properly, and the short
life of the lamps causes high consumption of resources as well as high environmental
impact. for these reasons, panasonic is developing products that adopt laser light
sources. the pt-rz31k series are projectors for professional use that provide high
luminosity by employing a high-output semiconductor laser light source module
and a heat-resistant phosphor wheel. in addition, the casing material does not use
halogenated flame retardant, making the projector an eco-conscious product that
contributes to reducing the use of hazardous substances.                                                               pt-rz31k series, a laser

reducing the use of pvc resin
polyvinyl chloride (pvc) is a material of concerns to the generation of hazardous substances from inappropriate disposal,
as well as the harmful effects of certain additive agents (phthalates) used to render pvc more pliable. in light of the
significant potential for inappropriate disposal of the pvc resin used in the internal wiring of products, due mainly to
difficulties associated with the sorting of this resin from used products, we have switched our new products launched from
april 2011 to non-pvc.

restriction on the use of phthalates
phthalates are often used in pvc products, and the use of four phthalates*5 will be restricted under the eu rohs2 from
july 22, 2019.

we specified these substances as level 2 prohibited substances in our chemical substances management rank
guidelines ver. 10 (for products) issued in june 2016, and delivery of such substances will be prohibited from july 22,
2018. we have specified other phthalates as level 3 prohibited substances, and are promoting substitution.

as for the four phthalates, we are currently working on creating an analysis and assessment system to ensure substitution.

since phthalates have a migration characteristic (where a substance from another article migrates through contact),
materials may be contaminated by migration from production equipment as well as process equipment containing the four
phthalates specified as level 2 prohibited substances. accordingly, we are also discussing management of preventive
measures against contamination through contact.

management of chemical substances at factories
panasonic is working to minimize environmental impact by identifying the hazardous substances used in our products,
assessing the impact of such use, and voluntarily discontinuing the use or reducing the release of such substances. since
1999, we have been conducting the 33/50 reduction activity to materialize reduction by 33% in three years and by 50% in
six years. in japan, we started promoting cutbacks in the use, release, and transfer of chemical substances at our factories
in fiscal 2000. against the target in our voluntary action plan, a reduction by 50% from the fiscal 1999 level, we achieved
a 75% reduction in chemical substance use and a 62% reduction in release and transfer in fiscal 2005. since then we
have been continuing the activity, focusing on substances with particularly large amounts of release and transfer, setting
a voluntary action target of reduction by 30% compared to the fiscal 2006 level. as a result, we achieved a 46% reduction
in the amounts of release and transfer of specified key reduction-target substances across all factories worldwide in fiscal
2011.

reflecting international trends in chemical substance management, our reduction measures have focused increasingly on
particularly hazardous substances from fiscal 2011. our chemical substances management rank guidelines (for factories)
was established in 1999 as a guideline to help manage the above chemical substance reduction activities. in version 1,
the guidelines specified a list of chemical substances to be managed, mainly focusing on carcinogenic substances. the
guidelines were later updated to version 2 in 2000 to include rules concerning the japan prtr law. version 3, introduced
in 2004, additionally covered a list of substances specified by chemical substances management legislation in japan. the
chemical substances covered by version 4 and later from 2009 are those specified in legislation on human health and
environmental impact in japan, the u.s., and europe, as well as those specified under international treaties.

under our chemical substances management rank guidelines (for factories), we have focused our management on
select chemical substances that are hazardous to human health and the environment. further, we have created a unique
indicator, the human environment impact,*6 which is used globally in all our factories. conventionally the chemical
substances were managed by “quantity,” such as usage amount or emissions/release. however, such quantity-based
management has a problem in that some highly hazardous substances do not become subject to reduction or management
if the usage amount was small, and therefore would fall out of the scope of impact assessments. in addition, the toxicity
criteria varied according to substance types and regional legislation, which made standardized management across the
group difficult. to address this issue, panasonic worked together with experts from both within and outside the company,
reclassified chemical substances based on an overall assessment of their hazardousness, and specified a hazardousness
factor for each classification. specifically, we set a hazard classification to each substance by utilizing carcinogen risk
assessments issued by international organizations, together with publically available hazard information and lists of ozone
depleting substances. for substances that have multiple hazard information items, the item ranked with the highest hazard
risk is used for classification. we utilize this internal indicator as the human environmental impact indicator to promote
efforts to ensure reduction of highly hazardous substances with greater environmental impacts, such as carcinogens and
ozone depleting substances, according to the risk level. the panasonic group chemical substances management rank
guidelines is also available on the website on our green procurement activities to promote collaboration with our suppliers,
encouraging them to offer materials that do not contain hazardous substances.

and hazards, and improving processes, including reviewing the amount of paint or the number of washing cycles, as well
as improving the efficiency of removal/deodorization equipment. we will continue our initiatives to minimize the amount of
substances with environmental impact released through our production activities.

environment: biodiversity conservation

approaches to biodiversity
business management and human life in our society is founded on the ecosystem services—a multitude of nature’s
blessings provided by our natural capital, including soil, air, water, and animals and plants. it is important to preserve
biodiversity to sustain the benefits derived from this natural capital towards the future; however, this biodiversity is
experiencing significant damage at an unprecedented speed.

the 13th meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity (cop13) was held in december
2016. at the meeting, business entities were urged to incorporate conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity
(mainstreaming of biodiversity), promote activities to achieve the 2020 aichi biodiversity targets, and consider the
sustainable development goals (sdgs) adopted by the united nations.

we are committed to properly understanding the impact of our business activities on biodiversity and contributing to
conservation. to this end, we are promoting initiatives in cooperation with local governments, environmental conservation
ngos, and specialized agencies. we focus on the three key areas of land use, procurement, and products, in order
to promote biodiversity conservation as an initiative incorporated into our businesses. in promoting the key areas, we
formulate a biodiversity action plan (bap), which is the basic concept of article 6 of the convention on biological diversity,
and implement measures, check the achievement progress, and improve the initiatives.


initiatives in land use
green areas in our business sites can potentially contribute to conserving biodiversity in that area. in particular, hardly
any natural environments where wild animals can live and breed remain in urban areas. therefore, even small areas of
green in corporate premises can become a precious environment for a variety of living organisms if they retain indigenous
vegetation and a watery environment.

in terms of biodiversity, such green areas take on the roles of reinforcing the ecological network including connections with
green areas and parks dotted around the neighborhood as well as protecting rare fauna and flora in the area,.


preservation of biotopes in collaboration with governments and experts
an ecological network refers to the organic relationship between ecological spaces such as the greenery and waters
where a variety of creatures lives and breeds. the greenery in our sites helps expand the overall space where wild animals
including birds, butterflies, and dragonflies live, as they can fly from one green area to another dotted in the area. in
addition, protecting wild fauna and flora in local areas is an activity in collaboration with governments and with help and
advice of experts, to preserve endangered species designated by the ministry of the environment or local government that
are deemed to be disappearing from that area. the kusatsu factory of the panasonic appliances company in kusatsu
city, shiga prefecture promotes this activity. its kyozon-no-mori forest (forest of coexistence) underwent assessment
during its development in 2009 and continues to undergo monitoring by experts. other examples include the biotope at the
eco solutions company in kadoma city, osaka prefecture that concluded the osaka biodiversity partnership agreement
with the government of osaka prefecture, osaka prefecture university, and the research institute of environment,
agriculture and fisheries, as well as tsunagari no hiroba at panahome corporation that was set up with the participation
as part of osaka prefecture’s project to create green wind streets and conclusion of the aforementioned agreement with
osaka prefecture, toyonaka city, osaka prefecture university, and the research institute of environment, agriculture and
fisheries.
examples of activities are introduced in the following website.

acquisition of external certification based on quantitative evaluation
the japan habitat evaluation & certification program
(jhep) is a method for quantitative evaluation of biodiversity
developed by the ecosystem conservation society based
on the habitat evaluation & certification program (hep)
employed in environmental assessment. in october 2010, the
matsumoto factory of the automotive & industrial systems
company became the first factory green space in japan
to obtain the jhep certification (future prospect type). the                                                              the common five-ring (ypthima argus)
factory was certified as a business site with prospective                                                                 identified at the plant

contributions to biodiversity in terms of creating a suitable
environment that encourages habitation for local wildlife.                        deadwood planted in forests

since then, the formulation of the factory green space
management policy was combined with diligent conservation efforts such as changing lawn into sawgrass, placing of
deadwood, and replacing trees of foreign origin, resulting in an increase in reproduction levels for birds and butterflies.
confirmation of these concrete results led to an upgrade in the evaluation ranking to level a in september 2015, which
was the year for certification renewal. the upgrade in ranking not only recognizes our biodiversity conservation effect
objectively, but also holds great significance for further development of our efforts.

initiatives in products
together with the ngo birdlife international, we have established a third-party assessment system to provide customers
with information about product contributions to biodiversity. through this system, we have assessed products which are
closely linked to biodiversity.

we have also enhanced our green product accreditation criteria (see pages 28-30) by adding biodiversity to the existing
items. we define products that contribute to biodiversity conservation as those that use biodiversity-conscious materials in
their major components and those that include functions to help biodiversity conservation.

in fiscal 2014, panasonic environmental systems & engineering co., ltd. developed atps-bluesys, a ballast water
management system (bwms) to reduce disturbance from maritime transportation of the marine ecology of local sea
areas. ballast water is sea water used to retain the balance of a freight vessel at sea when it is not carrying shipment.
because the ship travels across the sea taking sea water from one port and then draining the water into another port, the
impact of foreign organisms such as plankton and bacteria on the local ecology, environment, and resources is becoming
an increasingly serious problem. atps-bluesys treats microorganisms in the water with inline electrolysis without using
filters, which is the first in japan. the system can treat the water to a level lower than the standards by the international
maritime organization (imo), and successfully acquired the imo g9 basic approval (g9ba). marketing of this system will
be launched in fiscal 2018 as it acquired equivalent designation by system, atps-bluesys received type approval from
the japanese ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism in march 2017.

biodiversity conservation through collaboration with and support by ngos
and npos
we collaborate with ngos and npos through the keidanren committee on
nature conservation, in an effort to promote biodiversity conservation on a
global scale as well as in coordination with the industrial sector.

the keidanren committee on nature conservation is an organization
consisting of more than 110 keidanren member enterprises that are actively
involved in nature protection and biodiversity conservation. since its
establishment in 1992, it has been engaged in supporting ngo efforts in
nature conservation, promoting exchanges between business enterprises and
                                                                                                       tour to moeyungyi wetland in myanmar
ngos, promoting awareness of nature protection and biodiversity among
businesses, and supporting the efforts in the tohoku region to recover from
the earthquake disaster through the restoration of nature.

through corporate and private donations to the keidanren nature conservation fund, including donations from panasonic,
support worth a cumulative total of approx. 3.7 billion yen has been donated as of fiscal 2017 to 1,278 ngo projects in
japan and other countries.

in addition to donating and participating in projects promoted by the committee, we fulfill our responsibility to ensure solid
implementation of these projects through on-site inspections, etc. in october in fiscal 2017, we participated in a mission
to study nature conservation projects. in addition to a tour of conservation of wetlands in myanmar and vietnam, the
delegation visited the japanese embassy in myanmar and the country’s ministry of natural resources and environmental
conservation to exchange opinions on the country’s problems including deforestation and activities to address those
problems. in vietnam, the group inspected a project to conserve endangered species that inhabit the tidal flats of the
mekong river and visited can tho university where research on the mekong river ecosystem is underway, to share
information on the current state of activities.

we are also providing active support for activities to conserve biodiversity by various ngos and npos. in 2016, we
sponsored the certification of an oyster farm of miyagi prefecture fisheries cooperative by the aquaculture stewardship
council, which was the first ever in japan, under the program by the world wide fund for nature (wwf) japan, assistance
in the recovery of eco-conscious aquaculture in the minami-sanriku region. we have also donated 100 ic recorders to
the wild bird society of japan for its nationwide bird breeding distribution survey, a five-year program started in 2016 for


                                                                            71

despite the fact that nature conservation is an area of biodiversity conservation that is difficult for companies to be directly
involved in, solid actions are possible through collaboration with industry associations and through support for ngos and
npos. we will continue contributing to conservation of the ecosystem through continuous participation in these initiatives
in the future.


participation in a working group by the four electrical and electronic
industry associations
panasonic is a member of the biodiversity working group under the four electrical and electronic industry associations.*1
in the working group, biodiversity conservation activities of member companies are examined in detail in relation to the
aichi biodiversity targets, and examples of efforts are registered in a database. our activities are also disclosed and shown
in relation to the aichi biodiversity targets. this database provides access to various programs and activities conducted by
many business enterprises, and contributes to the wider dissemination of efforts to conserve biodiversity by members of
the four electrical and electronic industry associations.

is working to conserve and recover biodiversity in the
yodogawa river system and work for the return of itasenpara to the wild.

established in 2011, the itasen-net works in coordination with panasonic and other business enterprises as well as
administrative authorities, research institutes, universities, npos, and citizens groups, and implements activities including
investigation and eradication of non-native species as well as riverbank cleaning. these activities won the minister of the
environment prize in the 17th japan water prize organized by the japan water prize committee and the ministry of land,
infrastructure, transport and tourism. additionally, in october 2016, these activities were certified as a project linked to the
japan committee for the united nations decade on biodiversity (undb), promoting participation and cooperation among
national and local governments, business enterprises, private organizations, etc., for the conservation and sustainable
usage of biodiversity in order to achieve the aichi biodiversity targets.

perj will continue collaboration for activities to preserve the itasenpara and biodiversity for the yodogawa river system.

environment: collaboration across the supply chain
collaboration with suppliers and transportation partners
as a company backed by a number of suppliers, we must consider the environmental impacts of our entire supply chain,
and not just of our own operations. through our coordination efforts with suppliers and transportation partners, who
form an integral part of our business operations, we strive to minimize our environmental impact across the entire supply
chain, focusing on the reduction of co2 emissions, resource recycling, chemical substance management, and biodiversity
conservation.


activities for green procurement
since the publication of the green procurement standards in 1999, we have been promoting the manufacture of eco-
conscious products in partnership with our suppliers. furthermore, in the green procurement standards, we set out
the establishment of a group of suppliers who support our environmental policy in supplying products and goods in
order to materialize the targets in supplier collaboration in our green plan 2018. in addition to cooperation in “reducing
environmental impact in supplier business operations” and “sharing achievements through collaboration,” we are asking
our suppliers to “seek the cooperation of upstream business partners” to expand the scope of activities of reducing
environmental impact throughout the entire supply chain.

also, based on the green procurement standards, we have been conducting the green procurement survey, where we
monitor the implementation status of our suppliers regarding our requests, to promote environmental impact reduction
activities more effectively with our suppliers. in fiscal 2013, we conducted a trial survey targeted at our major global
suppliers. we received responses from 415 companies, and were able to confirm the level of activity in areas such as
environmental management system development, thorough implementation of chemical substance management, reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions, promotion of resource recycling, and biodiversity conservation. from fiscal 2014, we have
replaced surveys conducted on a group-wide scale with surveys at a site level as a means of communication with our
suppliers.

in china, seminars on our csr procurement policy and chinese environmental regulations were held in september 2016
for more than 400 suppliers in guangzhou, dalian, and shanghai. by calling for exhaustive implementation of csr through
the supply chain by using the csr self-assessment checklist as well as sharing china’s latest environmental regulations,
we are making efforts to grasp the risks and reduce environmental impacts across the supply chain.

in response to the enhancement of regulations such as eu rohs directive, we have been engaging in continual
environmental quality assurance audits of our suppliers since 2005 to improve the management level throughout the entire
supply chain. in fiscal 2017, we assessed the environmental quality assurance systems of some 1,400 suppliers and have
supported their efforts to upgrade their management levels.

estimation of environmental impacts in business activities by suppliers
in order to assess greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions across the entire supply chain (scope 3*1), we made our original
calculations based on the greenhouse gas protocol, the international accounting standard for ghg emissions. since fiscal
2012 we have conducted assessment surveys on four occasions, with the cooperation of 185 suppliers in the areas of raw
materials, electrical and electronic components, and processed parts.

from fiscal 2012, we started estimating our overall ghg emissions in the upstream range by multiplying the volume of
materials purchased with the resource-specific ghg emissions per basic unit based on the input-output table published
by the japanese government. the estimation results based on fiscal 2016 data is 12.91 million tons, roughly five times the
ghg emissions of our own production activities.
*1 other indirect emissions, excluding scope 1 (direct emissions from facilities owned and controlled by panasonic) and scope 2 (emissions from
  production of energy consumed at facilities owned and controlled by panasonic).

sharing achievements through collaboration
since fiscal 2010, we have been implementing the eco-vc*2 activity with our suppliers. this program is a collaboration
between panasonic and our suppliers, aimed to both reduce environmental impact as well as reinforce product
capability and achieve further rationalization for our products and our suppliers. in fiscal 2010, the target for reducing
environmental impact was limited to energy saving (co2 emission reduction). however, this was extended in fiscal 2011 to
recyclingoriented manufacturing aiming at saving resources and using recycled materials. the geographical range of our
activities has also extended. initially centered in japan, actions accelerated to china and other parts of asia in fiscal 2013,
and later extended to a global scale in fiscal 2015.

eco-vc activities are stored in a database for effective use within the panasonic group. furthermore, exemplary activities
are recognized through awards at the eco vc presentation of awards/reception meeting. these activity presentations are
also shown at the meeting venue to be shared with suppliers for use and application in future activities.

although the number of cases presented by suppliers in fiscal 2017 fell from the previous year to 622, many excellent
proposals were presented. one of the outstanding practiced recognized and selected was “reduction of electric power
consumption with automotive infotainment system mcu” by renesas electronics. this achieves vc of reducing co2
emissions of the entire system by 60% while dramatically improving both the performance and system costs, with an
rh850 system mcu in the automotive infotainment system.

going forward, we will expand eco-vc activities with as many suppliers as possible through greater application of value
engineering (ve) methodologies. by reducing environmental impacts and reinforcing product capability, and with further
rationalization, we will strengthen partnerships with our suppliers.

collaboration with environmental ngos
panasonic has more than 50 manufacturing sites in china. with environmental issues
in china becoming more serious due to its economic development, we are working
to improve the environmental challenges through coordination and continuous
communication with environmental ngos.

in fiscal 2017, we visited the institute of public and environmental affairs (ipe), a chinese
environmental ngo, twice to exchange views and information on our activities to address
environmental risks. although panasonic fell from sixth to seventh place in the ipr global
rankings, we gained 10 more points in the evaluation compared to the previous year.

at the second green supply chain forum in beijing held by ipe and other organizations
on october 27, 2016, we gave a presentation on our activities for environmental and csr
risks in our chinese supply chain in the main session named business best practices
case sharing, alongside representatives of global corporations including apple inc. the
forum was attended by over 200 representatives from china’s ministry of environmental      green supply chain forum

protection, the china united nations environment programme (unep) association,
business corporations located in china, foreign global corporations, environmental ngos, and other bodies.

increasingly stringent environmental restrictions are anticipated to be implemented in china. we strive to reinforce our
green supply chain activities, aiming for further advancement of our brand value.

environment: human resource development

encouraging all employees to become practitioners of environmental activities
we believe that the development of human resources is important in laying the foundations and promoting environmental
sustainability management. to put this into action, a training curriculum is in place for each specialty and position. general
programs are organized for all employees to acquire environmental knowledge as well as learn about our environmental
policy and activities. specialized programs are designed to bring employees’ environmental skills to an advanced level.

general programs are held every year at each business site for employees to acquire a wide range of knowledge, such
as energy problems, trends in global society, and environmental activities by panasonic. additionally, training catered to
the distinctive features of each operation is organized to provide information directly linked to business and operational
activities. other creative initiatives that we continue include environmental sustainability education to new employees and
engineering-related employees using exclusive textbooks specific to their respective job experiences and skills to enable
them to practice environmental action in their job activities.

in fiscal 2017, twelve courses were held in the specialized programs, such as iso 14001 internal environmental auditor
training, environmental legislation, chemical substance management, and factory energy conservation diagnosis, and a
total of 139 people took the courses.

the programs are not limited to employees in environment-related job functions, and allow attendance of those in related
divisions to expand the scope of practitioners of environmental activities.


fostering environmental awareness and skills through global competitions
and on-site training
the eco mind skills competition and energy conservation diagnosis skills
competition are held; as environment-related events in the panasonic group
manufacturing skills competition held annually for panasonic employees
worldwide, aimed at training employees to acquire advanced skills and become
top runners in panasonic manufacturing. we hope that these events will bring
greater environmental awareness and continuous environmental activities among
our employees, and thus lead to more active proposals to address and resolve
wide-ranging environmental issues and business risks.
                                                                                                             eco mind skills competition
the eco mind skills competition tests the participants’ capabilities in overall
environmental knowledge and expertise including global environmental issues and
environmental sustainability management by panasonic, as well as environmental
improvement skills of proposing and implementing improvement measures
that cut down environmental impact. training materials for the competition,
preparatory study sessions, and mock tests are held at each business site, aiming
for promising contenders to win high-ranking places. additionally, voluntary
activities are being organized actively to encourage competitors to acquire and
                                                                                                             energy conservation diagnosis skills
improve their knowledge in the area. in fiscal 2017, 1,166 people participated in
                                                                                                             competition
the competition.

in china, which is one of the major regions where we focus business strategies on,
the eco mind skills competition china has been held since fiscal 2012 at the manufacturing technology learning center (our
in-house center for manufacturing education) in hangzhou. in fiscal 2016, it was also held in beijing.

matters unique to the region, including essential environmental impact reduction at the business site, energy-saving
and improvement activities and environmental trends and laws in china, are being included to foster greater employee
awareness of the environment.

in the energy conservation diagnosis skills competition, 66 employees participated in fiscal 2017 and competed in
various fields such as air-conditioning, furnace & heat, etc. the competition requires competitors to identify energy-saving
issues and improvement measures through analysis of the state of facility operations and energy use within a designated

environmental engineering. we award outstanding performers in the competition, and continue to promote further
development of human resources capable of more advanced practices to raise the overall level of the company.


raising the level of human resources development through environmental
education and internal certification system
in may 2017, panahome corporation received recognition of its excellence
in environmental human resources development at the environmental human
resources development business awards 2016, sponsored by the ministry of the
environment and another organization.

the company has been offering environmental education to all its employees via
e-learning since fiscal 2008. in fiscal 2014, the company introduced an internal
certification system in which employees who demonstrate continuing excellence
in performance are recognized as eco-men or eco-jo (which mean eco-conscious
men/women; the names have been registered as trademarks) to promote human                                    environmental training via e-learning

resources development in the environment field. under the panahome hr system,
the eco kentei (certification test for environmental specialists) is a requirement
in a program granting subsidies for acquiring public certification (for labor union
members), as well as a promotion requirement for all employees based on job
performance standards. accordingly, the e-learning training covers questions
similar to the eco kentei.

environment: environmental communication

promoting environmental communication
panasonic has been focusing on maintaining close communications with stakeholders. we are actively engaged in
environmental communication with our customers, business partners, local communities, governments, investors,
employees, ngos, experts, etc., through a variety of perspectives, including products and services, factories, and
cooperation in environmental activities, as well as advertising, exhibitions, and website communication.


proposals on environmental policy
in addition to publicity through keidanren (japanese business federation) and other industrial organizations, we submit
environmental policy proposals not only to the japanese government but also to governments of other countries through
a wide range of opportunities. we joined in policy deliberations on environmental issues that the society is facing today:
a future vision for national governments, industry, and people’s lives aimed at the creation of a sustainable society, and
information sharing and exchange related to international activities. through this approach we established a deeper
understanding of government policy. based on this, we are engaging in a drive to promote environmental management with
an awareness of preventing business risks as well as creating opportunities, through actively presenting proposals from the
standpoint of manufacturing, marketing, and technology development.


communication with assessment bodies and investors
panasonic is engaged in constant communication with assessment bodies and investors to foster better understanding of
its environmental contribution activities. examples in fiscal 2017 include ir meetings in zurich and london focusing on csr
organized by panasonic europe ltd. (pe) for three leading assessment bodies and institutional investors.

in these meetings, great interest was shown in the environmental impact of our products throughout their entire product
life cycles and activities aimed at the development of a smart mobility society. we will continue engaging in similar
communication in the future.


engagement with third parties
panasonic actively conducts a number of dialogues with experts from both within and outside japan, and utilizes their
comments in its environmental strategies.

with the natural step, in particular, we have built a partnership since 2001. we hold meetings with them to share the most
advanced environmental information in europe and seek their opinions on our environmental strategies and activities to
assist us in further improvements.


publishing environmental information
although panasonic had been publishing its environmental reports in paper format since 1997, these reports were shifted
to solely web-based publication in 2010. in fiscal 2014, our environmental activity website was integrated with the csr
website for all-round and exhaustive corporate communication from the standpoint of sustainability. starting from fy2016,
major information disclosed on the web, such as environmental policy and approaches, performance data, etc., is provided
in a pdf file titled sustainability data book.

in the efforts to foster greater awareness of the five major areas of our environmental
action plan “green plan 2018” (co2 reduction, resource recycling, water, chemical
substances, and biodiversity) among general consumers worldwide, we offer an
overview of our activities on panasonic websites in 59 countries and regions (in 35
languages). in the area of chemical substances, for example, activities involving the
entire supply chain to control certain chemical substances hazardous to the human
health and the environment are presented in an easy-to-understand style.

raising quality levels and ensuring product safety

management system
based on the management philosophy that its founder espoused—that the company should strive “to contribute to society
through its products and services while always placing the customer first”—panasonic, as a leader in global trends,
engages in manufacturing while continuously improving its various systems and mechanisms to raise quality levels and
ensure product safety.

as a part of its fundamental policy regarding product quality, panasonic has established a basic rules for quality
administration under the chief quality officer (cqo). using the panasonic quality management system, panasonic is
engaged in continuously improving the quality of the company’s products, with a perspective that puts the customer
first. in october 2016, panasonic enacted standards of duty for its medical equipment manufacturing and sales business
to promote a smoother and more appropriate performance of duties involved in the manufacturing and sales of medical
equipment.

panasonic expresses profound regret for the accidents involving ff-type kerosene heaters and reflects the lessons it has
learned when ensuring the safety of its products. the company regards product safety to be its top management priority.
furthermore, to improve the level of safety of its products, panasonic strives to ensure product safety in line with changes
to its businesses or products, led by its groupwide corporate product safety committee.


policy
panasonic’s groupwide quality policy states that the company will “truly serve customers by way of providing products
and services that continuously meet and satisfy the needs of customers and society.”


the company has also established a basic policy regarding the autonomous code of conduct for product safety. (this basic
policy was approved at a meeting of the board of directors—held on june 27, 2007—of what was then called matsushita
electric industrial co., ltd.) under this policy, panasonic actively strives to ensure the safety of its products, keeping to its
principles of “the customer comes first” and of maintaining a “super-honest” attitude.

the panasonic code of conduct also states, in its “product safety” section, that the company will strive to ensure the
safety of its products.

regulations
quality management system
to establish self-sufficient quality assurance processes in each company, business division, and overseas subsidiary,
panasonic published its quality management system (p-qms) guidelines in 2004. each of these business units then
formulates its own quality management system, based on these guidelines.

p-qms complements the requirements of the iso9001 standard with panasonic’s own quality assurance methods and
experience to create a quality management system that aims to deliver the level of quality that the company demands.

based on its implementation of the p-qms, panasonic strives to continuously improve the quality of its products.

in fiscal 2014, panasonic drew up and began applying the automotive quality management system development
guidelines (the automotive p-qms) to its automotive parts business.

furthermore, in fiscal 2016, coinciding with the incorporation of the 2015 revisions to iso9001 into the p-qms guidelines,
panasonic established standards for each of its business areas—consumer electronics, automotive, housing, and
devices—specifying which portions apply groupwide and which portions apply to specific businesses, with the aim of
moving toward compliance within all its business areas.

                                                                            82

education
 to thoroughly spread panasonic’s approach to quality among its employees,
 the company holds training for all quality managers at its companies, business
 divisions, and overseas subsidiaries, based on the concept of “learning about
 panasonic quality.” panasonic also holds its quality control circles world
 conference to improve the quality control skills of on-site employees. at the 54th
 conference, held in fiscal 2017, 28 quality control circles were picked from a total
 of 5,008 groupwide circles to compete in a quality control grand prix.

                                                                                                                a scene from the quality control circle world
to establish a corporate culture in which product safety is the top priority in                                 conference
manufacturing, panasonic held product safety training lectures to train product
safety experts. to further ensure that this corporate culture, in which product
safety is the top priority, reaches all group employees, panasonic conducts product
safety education, such as by providing employees with self-directed learning
opportunities, including the fundamentals of product safety e-learning program,
and by holding product safety forums, at which employees can consider product
safety-related issues through cases seen inside and outside the company.

panasonic has also established a product safety learning square at the human                                    product safety learning square
resources development company in hirakata, osaka, with the aims of conveying
lessons based on actual sites and actual items, and of providing instruction on
product safety-related skills. the product safety learning square offers an opportunity to learn about the actual products
that were recalled in the past—such as those recalled after the ff-type kerosene heater accidents—as well as the causes
of their problems, the steps taken during the recall, and the measures taken to prevent the essentially unsafe phenomena
(including tracking or strength degradation).

in fiscal 2017, 7,073 employees—ranging from new hires to management-level employees—visited the facility (a 110%
increase over the previous year), and they resolved to never allow another accident to happen after learning about
accidents from the customer’s perspective.


 responsible executive and framework
 the executive officer in charge is senior managing executive officer yoshiyuki miyabe (as of august 2017).

 with the support and governance of the panasonic head office, each company, business division, and overseas subsidiary
 has implemented systems for undertaking its business with independent responsibility and self-sufficiency.

since september 2014, regional quality administration managers have been appointed for six regions: north america; latin
america; europe and cis; southeast asia and the pacific; india, south asia, middle east; and china and northeast asia.

these managers monitor regional quality conditions and promptly share information on product safety-related defects with
the various business divisions. they also share information on safety standards and safety certifications in their regions,
reinforcing the organizational structure of their business divisions.


committees and organizations
activities of quality managers meetings
panasonic investigates and summarizes groupwide quality improvement efforts and the state of product quality at its cqo
meetings. these meetings are attended by the cqos from each company and related function persons. at the meetings,
the attendees discuss how panasonic should handle quality over the medium and long terms, and they decide on policies
and actions meant to further strengthen the foundation of quality for the whole group.

panasonic also periodically holds quality managers meetings—attended by the quality managers at each company—as a
place for more practical discussions on quality policies. these meetings both enhance cooperation within the group and
promote quality improvement efforts. since fiscal 2016, panasonic has held a global quality managers meeting for quality
managers from around the world. it is an opportunity for these managers to share regional issues and annual plans with
companies from other regions, facilitating quality improvement efforts.


activities of the corporate product safety committee
to conduct manufacturing with safety as its top priority, in 2012, panasonic reorganized its groupwide corporate product
safety committee and established a safety technology working group and a safety standards working group under its
umbrella. using these working groups, the company began to develop safety technologies and upgrade its product safety
standards on a regular basis, in response to the 2005 ff-type kerosene heater accidents.

because of the growth of various types of robotics products and increasing product safety-related accidents among the
elderly, panasonic is investigating new policies to pursue in regard to these matters.


activities of the safety technology working group
the safety technology working group takes into account, during a product’s design phase, the possibility that customers
may use products longer than anticipated. it develops scientific evaluation methods for testing the durability of materials
used in products—including accelerated deterioration tests—accumulates data, and creates testing databases. in fiscal
2017, the working group shifted its product safety activities from accident response to accident prevention. it drew up
thematic plans with an eye on future panasonic businesses, such as by reflecting considerations for the elderly during
product design stages.


activities of the safety standards working group
to realize a higher level of product safety beyond just complying with public safety standards, panasonic has established
the panasonic corporation safety standards (pcss), consisting of design rules that must be followed when developing
products.
the safety standards working group has reflected in the pcss what it has learned from the activities of the safety
technology working group, and it has strengthened standards relating to major safety issues, such as long-term use,
flame-retarding measures, and fall prevention. in fiscal 2017, it prioritized preventing lithium-ion batteries from catching fire
by establishing standards that should be followed for applicable products that use such batteries.
the working group is also making efforts to expand the scope of its product safety standards to actively prevent risks that
it anticipates could occur because of the expanded areas in which the company does business. for example, the working
group created the panasonic system safety standards (psss), which cover energy management and other systems. to
ensure the safety of panasonic’s personal care robots, the working group established the panasonic personal -care robot
safety standards (prss).

quality and product safety: major accidents and responses

responding to product-related incidents
in the event that a product-related accident has occurred in the market, panasonic immediately confirms the facts relating
to the incident, and analyzes and verifies its causes. if a product-related incident is deemed to be serious, the group’s head
office and each of its companies and business sites work together to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of
its customers. specifically in terms of the first response, the company notifies relevant government bodies, such as the
consumer affairs agency, the company president, and senior management, and investigates its plan for responding to the
market.

serious product-related accident information
in japan, panasonic publicly reports serious product accidents*1, accidents suspected of being caused by products*2, and
accidents for which it has been determined that it is unclear whether a product was the cause*3, based on the consumer
product safety act and panasonic’s basic policies, as laid out in its autonomous code of conduct for product safety.
*1 “serious product accidents” are the following accidents specified in the consumer product safety act:
   1. accidents resulting in death;
   2. accidents resulting in serious injury or illness (injury or illness requiring at least 30 days of treatment), or accidents resulting in permanent injury;
   3. carbon monoxide poisoning;
   4. fires (confirmed as such by firefighting authorities).
*2 “accidents suspected of being caused by products” are defined as follows:
  • accidents relating to gas devices or kerosene devices (including accidents in which it has yet to be determined whether the product was the cause);
  • accidents relating to products other than gas or kerosene devices for which it is suspected that the product was the cause.
     panasonic promptly releases information on these types of accidents.
*3 “accidents for which it has been determined that it is unclear whether a product was the cause”
   this refers to accidents announced by the consumer affairs agency as accidents for which it cannot be determined whether a product was the
   cause.
   of these accidents, panasonic publicly releases information on those for which the product safety group of the consumer affairs council of the
   ministry of economy, trade and industry has determined that it remains unclear whether a product was the cause.

customer relations

management system
panasonic has established a set of basic rules for response to customers (compliant with iso 10002 and jis q 10002) for
responding appropriately groupwide to inquiries and complaints from customers. the cs planning office at the panasonic
head office oversees the implementation of these regulations, which apply to all work relating to customer relations in
japan by panasonic or by affiliates that handle products bearing the panasonic brand. in those business sites in japan, the
company has implemented a management system for response to customers as a mechanism for utilizing information in
management that is received from customers. these sites conduct periodic self-audits and make other efforts to improve
the quality of customer relations.
overseas, the company has implemented iso-compliant management systems based on the basic rules for response to
customers and tailored to the legal system in each country or region.


policy
fundamental stance on customer satisfaction (cs)
since its foundation, panasonic’s management philosophy has been to contribute to society through its products and
services while always putting the customer first. based on this philosophy, the company strives to improve customer
satisfaction and offers products, solutions, and services that enrich the lives of people around the world.
when providing customer service, panasonic strives for sincerity, accuracy, and speed, and acts with humility and
appreciation. this finds its basis in the principle of “true service” that the company’s founder described. the company’s
fundamental stance is thus to provide customers with trust, peace of mind, and satisfaction.


  the fundamental concept of customer satisfaction (the pursuit of customer satisfaction)
  the only way for those of us engaged in business to earn trust is to have everyone, regardless of whether they are
  working in the manufacturing division or the sales division, cater completely to the demands of the customers on
  all points and work strictly under the basic rule of producing or selling not even one product that cannot perform its
  function well.

 perfection can be reached only by paying careful attention not only to the manufacturing details but also to where our
 products are going and making efforts to completely satisfy the customers and provide flawless service.

                                                                                                                   konosuke matsushita
                                                                          august 1940 statement calling for a quality products campaign
                                                                                           (from matsushita electric’s 50-year history)




  service philosophy (true service)
  the customer’s satisfaction is our satisfaction.
  true service resides in mutual satisfaction.
  service is an integral part of any business. a business that does not provide service is no business at all. service,
  therefore, is the duty and obligation of any business person. but there’s nothing more aggravating than service provided
  only out of a sense of duty. customers can sense it.

  service means satisfying customers, and when we satisfy our customers, we in turn find satisfaction in a job well done.

  satisfied customers and satisfied employees: this is what constitutes true service.

                                                                                                                         konosuke matsushita

customer inquiry response system
in japan, panasonic deals with inquiries from customers before they purchase products as well as with their concerns
about how to use them after purchase through the customer care center. the customer care center is open from 9:00
am to 8:00 pm, 365 days per year. there are separate phone numbers for each product. customers rarely spend a long
time on hold; the customer care center is organized to provide accurate and rapid service.

when customers make inquiries on the panasonic website by typing in a question, the site displays multiple relevant faqs.
thus, the company strives to provide quick responses to questions.

regarding the content of its faq pages, the company analyzes the search keywords that bring customers to faqs, as well
as the number of times that the questions are viewed, to increase the precision of the faqs, so that the information that
customers require is accurate and displayed quickly.

in recent years, the company has also been undertaking initiatives to use facebook and other social media outlets to post
various types of useful information in a timely manner, such as when the seasons change, and to entice customers to visit
relevant faq pages.

because these faqs are organized so that customer’s problems can be solved without the customer needing to contact
the customer care center, the number of inquiries at the center is trending downward.

panasonic operates call centers in each country/region outside of japan as well, handling all types of inquiries as well as
intake for repairs.

the website for each country includes faqs, and we are working on building ways to allow customers to resolve their own
issues as they are able to in japan.

fair operating practices

management system
as corporate activity expands globally, improprieties occur with some frequency, due not just to deliberate dishonest and
criminal acts but also to a lack of awareness and understanding. employees doing business in countries and regions where
legal systems are incompletely realized must perennially exercise a high degree of awareness of norms.

we at panasonic have set down a clear set of rules for compliance with the law and corporate ethics. we strive to achieve
thorough adherence to these rules, with the aim of promoting fair operating practices in all countries and regions of the
world, and to realize a sustainable society. this is the “panasonic code of conduct,” which incorporates the requirements
of the oecd (organisation for economic co-operation and development) guidelines for multinational enterprises and other
norms.

in our observance of our own code of conduct, we have a global network of legal departments, directors, and executive
officers in charge of ensuring adherence to the code of conduct, as well as managers in charge of export control and
other persons responsible for supervising various other functions in our companies, business divisions, and regional
headquarters outside japan.

each year, we designate september to be “compliance awareness month,” marked by efforts to strengthen our awareness
of the need to observe ethical and legal requirements. we conduct a “compliance awareness survey” to check the degree
of compliance awareness dissemination among our employees around the world. once each year, we check the status of
observance and practice of the “panasonic code of conduct” in our business locations around the world.

in addition, to prevent improprieties and achieve quick resolutions, we have established hotlines for whistleblowers in our
domestic and foreign business locations, and for our business partners.

in addition to initiatives aimed at correcting the issues that we have discovered through such efforts at the business
division level, we also bring those issues together centrally and comprehensively at our head office and reflect them
in groupwide policies with consideration to societal conditions and the like, and repeat this process in the pursuit of
continuous improvement. we are currently promoting activities under the themes of “preventing cartels” and “preventing
bribery of government officials.”


also, panasonic has been a member of the business ethics research center (berc) since berc was founded in 1997.
together with berc and other member companies, we have engaged in research, practice, education, and promotional
activities for management ethics through panels, study groups, information-exchange activities, and so on.


policy
panasonic has established as part of our management philosophy the basic management objective set forth by konosuke
matsushita, founder of panasonic corporation, that says “recognizing our responsibilities as industrialists, we will devote
ourselves to the progress and development of society and the well-being of people through our business activities,
thereby enhancing the quality of life throughout the world.” with this basic management objective, we will engage in our
business activities in a manner that ensures that our business contributes to the improvement of living standards around
the world and to the progress of society. in order to put our management philosophy into practice, we have established
the panasonic code of conduct which includes elements from the oecd (organisation for economic co-operation and
development) guidelines for multinational enterprises and other norms, have translated it into 22 languages, and share our
basic stance as a company in terms of our aspirations for the panasonic brand and answering the demands of society in
relation to corporate social responsibility (csr) with all of our directors and employees globally.

panasonic code of conduct (excerpts)
the panasonic code of conduct defines our efforts to establish fair business practices as a public entity of society.

  chapter 1: our core values

  an enterprise as a public institution
  since our business is dependent on our customers and other stakeholders, we must remember that “an enterprise is
  a public institution,” that must strive to fulfill its social responsibilities. in addition to listening to stakeholders’ opinions,
  we must conduct our business activities transparently in order to be accountable. in short, we must continue to be fair,
  truthful, honest and swift in taking action to comply with our social responsibilities.
   panasonic code of conduct, chapter 1: our core values

  chapter 2: implementing the code in business operations

  ii-3. compliance with laws, regulations and business ethics
  (1) compliance with laws, regulations and business ethics
  we will conduct business with integrity, a law-abiding spirit, and the highest ethical standards.
  we will fulfill our tasks by always observing not only applicable laws and regulations, but also the highest standards of
  business ethics. compliance with laws, regulations and business ethics in all our business activities is essential to the
  survival of our business.

  (2) fair and sincere action
  we will respect free and fair competition, and abide by all applicable antitrust (competition law) and other laws and
  regulations. all of our transactions shall be properly and fairly recorded.
  we will not engage in bribery of any kind. we will be sensitive to, and shall abide by laws and regulations and social
  ethics that govern the offer of benefits of any kind, including gifts, meals and entertainment. in the same manner, we will
  not receive personal benefits from any of our stakeholders.
  moreover, we remain steadfast in our attitude to oppose any illegal group or organization.

  (3) thorough observation of relevant laws and regulations
  to ensure that all employees observe applicable laws and regulations and respect their spirit, we will establish
  appropriate in-house codes and promote employee understanding through seminars and training.

 (4) prompt redress and strict treatment for violations of laws and regulations
 if we suspect that our activities violate applicable laws, regulations or business ethics, we will report such information to
 a superior, or to the legal affairs section or other relevant section, or via an in-house notification hotline. whistleblowers
 shall be protected from dismissal, demotion, or any other retaliatory treatment because of their well-intentioned reporting
 of possible violations of any law or regulation. we will ensure thorough and confidential treatment of information
 reported.

  once we have established that a law or regulation has been violated, we will immediately seek to remedy the violation,
  take appropriate action and prevent it from recurring.

communications
panasonic aims to make compliance and fair business practices penetrate our worksites globally through our directors
and executive officers in charge of ensuring adherence to the code of conduct; the legal divisions we have created at
the companies, business divisions, and regional headquarters; and the export control chief officer and individuals with
job function responsibilities, based on the thinking that the level of compliance awareness of the chief executive of the
business is of upmost importance. specifically, we share the compliance policies for the fiscal year with the companies
and regional headquarters at the beginning of each fiscal year at our global legal conference, and september is
designated as compliance month (for details, refer to compliance training). we also contact and notify those responsible
for legal matters at the companies and other relevant organizations whenever there are changes to laws, governmental or
ministerial ordinances, or notices from other authorities that have any effect on our business.


compliance training
panasonic conducts training on compliance and the code of conduct regularly, including when employees join the
company or are promoted.

we have assembled a compliance guidebook to serve as a tool for putting into practice items related to compliance with
the code of conduct. the guidebook explains 54 topics that panasonic considers critical from a compliance perspective,
explaining each of them through examples in a way that is easy to understand, addressing how employees at panasonic
can stay in compliance with the law in the course of their daily work activities and answer societal expectations, covering
topics such as preventing corruption and preventing cartels.

we also implement e-learning on compliance with a variety of laws that involve antitrust laws including those concerned
with cartels, export controls, and copyright laws in sales, procurement, engineering, and other functional divisions at each
company.

each year, we designate september as “compliance awareness month” to check up on our efforts to ensure that the
mental attitude of strict adherence to ethics and the law has taken hold globally and to respond to risks. in recent years,
as our business and the business environment have changed, this has presented opportunities to strengthen our efforts to
accurately grasp signs of changing risks, legal violations, and improprieties in specific fields / units of business, countries
and regions.

in this interval, the president, the heads of companies and business divisions, regional representatives, and other senior
executives have clarified policies and positions on the observance of ethics and the law, ensuring the dissemination of the
importance of compliance down to the ground level.

during this period, we also conduct a “compliance awareness survey” among our employees.

in fiscal 2017, compliance training through e-learning was held in eight languages, with 40,000 employees from 19 regional
offices taking part.

additionally, priority education aimed at preventing cartels and preventing bribery of government officials is being
conducted. (for more detail, refer to the chapter on “fair operating practices: fair trade.”)


responsible executive and framework
the executive officer in charge is managing executive officer jun ishii (as of august 2017).

to ensure the dissemination of compliance and fair business practices at the ground level throughout the world, we have
legal departments, directors, and executive officers in charge of ensuring adherence to the code of conduct, as well
as managers in charge of export control and other persons responsible for supervising various other functions in our
companies, business divisions, and regional headquarters outside japan.

in fiscal 2016, panasonic established a centralized organization with functions for handling compliance, risk, and
governance issues that span multiple functional divisions. this move has accelerated the pace of support for fair operating
practices in panasonic’s business divisions.




                                                                            97

whistleblowing systems
within our company, we have established the following whistleblower hotlines as systems for receiving a variety of internal
reports regarding compliance:

• ”business ethics global hotline” for general information on compliance in japan and abroad.
• ”equal employment opportunity office” for consultations regarding sexual harassment, equitable treatment, and the like.
• ”fair trade hotline” for the reporting of legal violations concerning cartels, bribery, the subcontract act, and so on.
• ”internal control promotion office hotline” for accounting irregularities.
• ”fair business hotline” for receiving reports from our business partners.
• ”auditor report system” for reports concerning our accounting and audits.

the panasonic code of conduct stipulates that “whistleblowers shall be protected from dismissal, demotion, or any
other retaliatory treatment because of their well-intentioned reporting of possible violations of any law or regulation.
we will ensure thorough and confidential treatment of information reported.” at all the hotlines above, mistreatment of
whistleblowers is strictly forbidden and confidentiality is assured. in addition, reports can be made anonymously if there is
no need to contact the whistleblower for additional information (some hotlines are excluded).

in fiscal 2017, roughly 250 reports and consultations were handled through these whistleblowing systems. these systems
respond to all reports and consultations by investigating and verifying facts with the cooperation of the relevant divisions.

outside japan, in addition to the “global hotline,” region-specific reporting systems have been set up in north america,
europe, asia, and latin america.

fair operating practices: performance evaluation

to monitor the understanding of compliance policies, the effectiveness of measures, and the degree of adherence, once
each year we conduct checks on the status of observance and practice of the “panasonic code of conduct” in all our
business locations around the world.

more specifically, at each group member company, a director / executive officer is appointed to be in charge of ensuring
adherence to the code of conduct. education and training are conducted regarding the code of conduct; written pledges
regarding the observance of the code of conduct are obtained; and checks are made regarding the status of these items.
our auditor conducts an audit of internal control.


once each year, employees fill out “compliance awareness surveys.” these surveys include topics that are common
globally, such as compliance, and information security, and also other topics that are specific to particular companies,
places of business, and regions. there were around 126,000 respondents globally in fiscal 2017. the survey results are
analyzed from a variety of perspectives – region, company, employee rank, and so on – and are used in a wide variety of
functions, such as the formulation of policies and measures regarding compliance and responses to specific issues.

for example, there are uneven levels of legislation, depending on the country, within asia—which panasonic considers
a strategic overseas region. this region poses considerable risks in regard to panasonic’s efforts to combat corruption.
in this business environment, in order to develop fair and powerful solution business – including btob and btog – we
were able to identify issues through this survey such as: (1) the need for ongoing efforts to instill compliance awareness,
(2) the need for repetition of compliance education, and (3) the national differences in compliance awareness. based on
these results, various elements were incorporated in the mid-term action plan to practice in the daily business activities,
including (1) the formulation of action guidelines and education campaigns at the level of the regional headquarter, (2) the
strengthening of e-learning and training programs in each national language, and (3) the fortification of alliances involving
legal departments in each region and the raising of the level of compliance through auditing.


grave violations and corrective measures
in fiscal 2017, panasonic paid fines for violations of eu competition law relating to its cathode ray tube and secondary
battery businesses. having taken this development seriously, panasonic has continued to work to ensure that, through
complete and thorough management, such issues do not arise again. for information about panasonic’s policies for
preventing cartels, refer to the chapter on “fair operating practices: fair trade.”

in the rare event that panasonic becomes aware of any serious ethical or legal violations, we stop the violating behavior
immediately, and in addition to reporting to executive management, we will consider countermeasures after verifying facts
and analyzing the causes of the violation in relevant divisions. we report on such matters to the board of directors as
necessary and correct the violations swiftly and cross-sectionally groupwide based on the resolution of the board.




                                                                            99

fair operating practices: fair trade

panasonic believes that cartels and bribery of government officials can have critical effects on management throughout the
entire group, and it acts to combat these phenomena as a group. in more specific terms, within the “control environment,
prevention, detection, and response” framework discussed below, each company and regional headquarters establish
an annual compliance program (such as the one shown below), based on the understanding of the risks that it faces with
its business and in its region. at the end of the fiscal year, company president or regional head is required to certify the
effective functioning of the program to the panasonic president. supervisory organizations relating to these practices have
been established in departments at the panasonic headquarters, and these organizations provide oversight and support for
initiatives in companies and regional headquarters.

• control environment: particularly during compliance awareness month, the president, company presidents, and regional
  heads issue compliance messages targeting employees. in each company, compliance workshop among the business
  division directors is held, helping to foster a culture of compliance in all business divisions.
• prevention: e-learning is provided in eight languages for the people responsible within the organizations of relevant
  departments. in fiscal 2017, around 31,600 people underwent this training. in fiscal 2016 and 2017, group study sessions
  were conducted with management from overseas companies. in total, around 7,800 people attended. to improve the
  effectiveness of panasonic’s anti-cartel and anti-bribery of government officials’ regimes, each location conducts self-
  checks to examine the operation status of cartel prevention measures including the functioning of company rules and
  offering of education, and each company or regional headquarters reviews or audits these self-checks.
• detection: hotlines have been established at the group headquarters, in companies, and at regional headquarters. these
  hotlines are publicized through educational activities.
• internal investigations are conducted immediately when behavior suspected of constituting a violation is discovered
  through auditing or a hotline tip-off.
• response: if internal investigations have confirmed that violations occurred, the violation is immediately halted, the true
  cause is pursued, measures to prevent re-offense are implemented, and the people involved are disciplined.


preventing cartels
we at panasonic are taking the fact that our company has been implicated in multiple international cartel incidents
seriously, and we have positioned the prevention of cartels as a critical groupwide issue. if panasonic were to become
involved in the creation of a cartel, we would not only lose the trust of our customers but also be required to pay high
penalties and compensation for damages, as well as lose our designation in public procurement. we take very serious and
detailed care to prevent any such involvement, because it would have a variety of negative impacts on our business.


basic policies
we have put the following basic policies in place in an effort to prevent cartels, collusive bidding, and other such violations.

• contact with competitors is allowed only in absolutely necessary cases and subject to prior approval.
• agreements and exchanges of information with competitors regarding prices, quantity, and other competition-related
  matters are strictly prohibited.
• one who encounters behaviors that may give rise to suspicions of cartel must make an objection, leave the room, and file
  an internal report.
• the company establishes whistle-blowing systems and internal leniency systems to improve its ability to self-regulate and
  conduct appropriate monitoring based on risk assessment, whereby maintains an effective anti-cartel system.


rules concerning activity and relationship with competitors
in 2008, we established the rules concerning activity and relationship with competitors for the purpose of preventing
behaviors that could lead to cartels or bid rigging or cause suspicion of same, which apply to all group employees. these
rules include items such as the following:

• prohibition of agreements or exchanges of information regarding product pricing, quantity, performance or specifications
  that may cause suspicions of cartels or bid rigging


                                                                           100

contents    prev   page   next   ) human resources development and promoting diversity     ) occupational health and safety   ) responsible supply chain



• prior approval system under which contact with competitors requires prior approval of the head of the business group
  and the person in charge of legal affairs
• responses to inappropriate activities
• duty of reporting possible violations
• measures taken in response to violations
• internal leniency system

in the device business where the risk of cartels is particularly high, we are promoting global initiatives meant to prevent
cartels through activities including making sure once again that these policies are fully understood by executives at
company management conferences and managing directors conferences at overseas subsidiaries, cartel prevention
training for all employees, identifying suspicious behaviors, submitting written pledges, conducting cartel audits, and
speeding up personnel rotations.


preventing corruption
prevention of bribery of government officials
even as the authorities in different countries continue to bear down harder on corruption, along with the expansion of
business in developing countries and solutions business comes a higher risk of bribery of public officials. panasonic
continues to engage in efforts to prevent bribery of government officials through means such as issuing bribery prevention
policies from senior executives, establishing standards and approval processes for spending on meals and the like with
public officials, managing business partners, and ensuring that training and awareness-raising activities for executives and
employees are thoroughly carried out, especially for business sites located in countries and regions which are considered
to have a high level of corruption.


rules on dealing with government officials
in 2010, we established the rules on dealing with government officials for the purpose of preventing bribery of
government officials or actions that my raise suspicions of such unlawful behavior.

these rules stipulate that no employee may offer, give, pay for, promise to pay for or authorize the payment or the grant of
any benefit to any government officials in connection with obtaining or retaining business.

an approval process and specific standards were established such as for meals with government officials. these are
intended to prevent the direct offering of benefit to government officials and also the indirect offering of benefit through
consultants, distributors, lobbyists, or other business partners. careful screening and designation of business partners
must be conducted, and contracts must include provisions prohibiting bribery.

in cases of violations of these rules, swift steps must be taken to redress the situation, and strict measures must be taken
against the violation.

in addition, regarding expenses for social interactions or gifts, prior approval is required, and detailed reports must be filed.
there is also a process for ensuring that no government officials are involved, in an effort to preclude corrupt acts.


ensuring transparency with political contribution funds
the japan business federation says of political donations: “in order to maintain democratic politics in a proper
manner, matching costs are required, and it is important for businesses to make political donations as part of their
social contribution.” panasonic abides by this policy and makes political donations as a part of its corporate social
responsibilities.

when making donations, panasonic complies with the political funds control act, all other relevant legislation, and with its
own strict rules.

in japan, the legal duty of disclosing political fund income and expenditures falls on political groups. these disclosures are
publicly available from the official gazette or from official prefectural bulletins.

they are also available on the web.

prevention of other corruption
needless to say the prohibition of bribery of government officials, as provided in the code of conduct, it is prohibited
to offer benefits of any kind, including gifts, meals and entertainment, and to receive personal benefits from any of our
stakeholders, which would go contrary to laws and regulations and social ethics. concretely, the panasonic group has its
anti-corruption policies region by region, so that such policies would meet the laws and custom of trade of that country/
region.

for instance, the companies in european region have their own guidelines in place on “entertainment, gifts and hospitality”
in line with their national laws for public officials and non-public officials, which contain specific limits and examples of what
is and is not considered acceptable. further, each person is obligated to speak out against suspected acts of bribery or
corrupt practices.

in emerging countries and regions including china and asia, it is prohibited to offer directly or indirectly any benefit to
business partners including government officials, in connection with obtaining or retaining business. additionally, each
director and employee is required to sign an undertaking letter committing never offering/accepting a bribe, to raise the
awareness of bribery.

fair operating practices: measures taken against counterfeit goods

it is estimated that around 80% of counterfeit goods originate from china, and catalyzed by the growth of the internet,
these goods are spreading worldwide. in recent years, counterfeit goods have also expanded from consumer products
to b2b products. not only does this lead to quality concerns (accidents and injuries) for all customers, but it also leads to
economic loss (reduced tax revenue and reduced incentive for companies to develop new products) and security issues
(national security threats and funding opportunities for criminal/terrorist organizations) for society.

in its efforts to eradicate counterfeit goods, panasonic implements extensive measures globally to protect our customers
and society. these measures are targeted at various stages of counterfeit goods production and distribution, including
manufacturers, major trade shows, importers/exporters, wholesalers, and distributors.

our brand is an irreplaceable asset that is testimony to the trust and satisfaction our customers and society place in us, so
we will continue to resolutely respond to counterfeit goods that illegally display our brand.


specific countermeasures
• raid manufacturing plants that counterfeit goods and seize them
• prevent negotiations about counterfeit goods from taking place at
  major trade shows in china
• work with customs officials in various countries to suspend
  counterfeit goods
• prevent the sale of counterfeit goods by retailers (including on
  ecommerce sites) in various countries
• raise market awareness about counterfeit goods by collaborating
  with relevant authorities in various countries
• urge countries with insufficient legal systems and legal practice to                           a celebration of counterfeit goods destruction
  make improvements to these frameworks                                                          held by a relevant authorities in vietnam

respect for human rights

management system
the panasonic code of conduct expressly states that “we must respect human rights and do our best to understand,
acknowledge and respect the diverse cultures, religions, mindsets, laws and regulations of people in the different countries
and regions where we conduct business.” panasonic supports the fundamental principles of the united nations universal
declaration of human rights, the international labour organization (ilo) declaration on fundamental principles and rights
at work, and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises. the major parts of these principles are embodied in the
panasonic code of conduct.
panasonic is also taking an active approach to reflecting ideas concerning global human rights in its management,
including by making reference to the guiding principles on business and human rights, which were adopted by the un
human rights council in june 2011.
in fiscal 2016, panasonic complemented the code of conduct by setting a “global human rights and labor policies” and
by implementing a management system for abiding by that policy. the management system consists of self-assessment
checklists for properly evaluating risks involving, and the impact on, human rights and for identifying risks, a manual
outlining the procedures for correcting the risks that have been identified and for carrying out continuous improvement, and
other components.
going forward, in addition to efforts conducted with its employees, panasonic will continue to cooperate with its suppliers
throughout the world to fully understand laws and labor practices in different countries and to respect human rights.


policy
as a company doing business globally, panasonic treats, as a fundamental principle behind its business activities,
interactions with not just its employees but all stakeholders with the maximum degree of concern and respect for their
human rights. panasonic’s policies concerning human rights are expressly outlined in panasonic code of conduct and
global human rights and labor policies. these policies include items concerning such issues as working hours; wages;
humane treatment; prohibition of discrimination; protection of privacy; concern for the human rights of foreign workers,
trainees, and younger laborers; and the freedom of association plus labor-management dialogues, among others.

http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/management/code-of-conduct/chapter-3.html



education
panasonic conducts periodic training concerning its code of conduct—which sets forth its policies on respect for human
rights—including when employees join the company or are promoted.

the company conducts “overseas employee / pre-overseas appointment training” for employees on assignment from
japan and posted at overseas subsidiaries. it provides education on issues of human rights that demand particular
attention overseas, including fair treatment, the prohibition of employment discrimination, and respect for union activities.


responsible executive and framework
the executive officer in charge is senior managing executive officer mototsugu sato (as of august 2017).

the departments responsible consist of the human resources & industrial relations department established at the
panasonic headquarters, the human resources departments established at each of the four panasonic companies
(appliances, eco solutions, connected solutions, and automotive & industrial systems), and all business divisions and
affiliated companies under the panasonic umbrella.

human rights support desk
panasonic has established an equal employment opportunity office at its headquarters and appointed full-time
consultants to staff it. in addition, a consultation desk was established at each company and business division in an effort
to provide a place for employees and temporary staff to go to discuss any concerns relating to human rights and all forms
of harassment, including sexual harassment, harassment based on power differentials, and topics related to the rights
of members of sexual minorities (lgbt*). beginning in january 2017, employees and temporary staff can also discuss
harassment related to pregnancy, childbirth, or taking childcare leave.
furthermore, in conjunction with the revisions to the equal employment opportunity act and the child care and family
care leave act that took effect january 2017, panasonic has revised the leaflet containing company policy toward
harassment, definitions and examples of various types of harassment, internal regulations on harassment, and internal
systems for discussing and reporting harassment. we have also notified all employees of these changes. the equal
employment opportunity office also conducts activities aimed at resolving workplace problems and creating workplaces
without barriers to employees performing their jobs. for example, people from divisions who are responsible for training
sessions on human rights have expressed opinions such as, “all staff should attend this training” and “i want to hold this
training every year to improve employee awareness and the workplace environment.” they at their respective business
divisions strongly recognize the necessity of wider employee awareness, and they are promoting independent initiatives
toward this goal.
in its overseas subsidiaries as well, panasonic is acting with all due attention to the privacy of those who seek consultation
or report misdeeds, including by establishing consultation offices and suggestion boxes similar to those in japan.

respect for human rights: performance evaluation

as a company doing business in countries around the world, panasonic strives to respect human rights and considers it a
precondition for all its behavior to abide by international standards, the laws and regulations of each country or region, and
the panasonic code of conduct.

further to these efforts, since 2007, the company has been conducting overseas human resources and labor
assessments intended to identify, comprehend, and resolve issues in personnel management and labor management
overseas. the checklist used in the survey contains around 300 items, including those concerning proper implementation
of labor management; compliance with local labor laws, employment systems, and business practices; and discovery of
bad influences on business and of latent labor-related risks that could cause problems.

after the local affiliate has conducted a self-assessment based on the checklist, an assessor who belongs to a company
or business division in japan performs an audit with the support of the regional headquarters. efforts to resolve problems
discovered via assessments are undertaken primarily by assessor-leaders (mainly managers in charge of human
resources), who strive to raise the level of labor management. panasonic periodically runs “assessor seminars” to
systematically promote the education of assessors and to raise the levels of their checking skills.

in fiscal 2017, assessments were conducted at a total of 6 sites, consisting of 2 sites in china, and 4 sites elsewhere in
asia. panasonic will continue to strive to improve labor management capabilities through close partnerships between its
japanese and overseas locations, thereby to improve the company’s ability to respect human rights in all its businesses.

furthermore, since fiscal 2015, panasonic has implemented risk assessment and improvement efforts based on a
“self-assessment checklist” relating to human rights and labor that was established that year. we have expanded the
implementation of these to manufacturing sites within japan in fiscal 2017, engaging in efforts toward self-assessments as
well as corrections and improvements at 98 sites worldwide.

because issues with working hours management have been observed at some companies through self-assessments, we
have proposed improvement plans that include revisions to the organization of personnel, work management methods, and
equipment automation, and are moving forward in our efforts to correct these issues.


in addition, panasonic receives audits from the clients that we supply. we were audited 17 times in fiscal 2017, and we are
engaged in correcting and improving the areas that our clients have indicated may be problematic in terms of human rights
and labor standards. these efforts include reviewing our work regulations and management methods.

respect for human rights: efforts concerning fundamental
human rights

prohibition of forced labor, effective abolition of child labor, and attention
to young workers
when recruiting employees, panasonic adopts a perspective of protecting fundamental human rights and engages in
recruitment activities that comply with the laws and regulations of the respective countries. it also prohibits forced labor,
labor against the will of any employee, or child labor. in order to prevent child labor, we have built items such as age
verification into the “self-assessment checklist” used when individuals join the company. the risk that child labor will be
performed is thought to be especially high in china and elsewhere in asia, and panasonic is thoroughly implementing age
checks in these regions. the company does not make employees under the age of 18 engage in overtime work and heavy
labor, and offers them consideration and support so that they may have opportunities to receive education.


providing employment opportunities for young people
providing employment opportunities for young people

panasonic holds our professional internship program (pip) twice annually through industry-university cooperation.

pip has the following three goals:
• to train human resources in industry-university cooperation
• to provide an opportunity for learning through work experience
• to eliminate employment mismatches by verifying work appropriateness


employing foreign workers
because there tend to be greater human rights and labor-related risks for migrant and foreign laborers, panasonic has
established items to be checked that include ensuring that panasonic-affiliated entities are not allowing temp agencies
to collect any fees and are not retaining workers’ passports or identification documents, as well as ensuring that they
are providing workers with employment contracts, including terms of employment, in those workers’ native languages.
panasonic recruits employees and accepts temporary workers based on the laws and regulations of the respective country,
so that no employees are made to work against their will or are unduly subjected to disadvantageous working conditions.


prohibition of discrimination
panasonic strives to create workplaces where diverse and talented individuals can respect one another as vital partners
irrespective of differences such as race, sex, age, nationality, beliefs, religion, social status, disability, sexual orientation and
gender identity, and can work in a lively and active manner in a supportive environment, with consideration of the laws and
regulations of each country.

the company has established recruitment standards that select employees based on the applicants’ aptitudes, capabilities,
and desires. to thoroughly implement these standards, the company in japan, for instance, educates interviewers based
on the handbook “recruitment and human rights,” which the “hellowork” public employment stability office established
by the national government has drafted for the purpose of promoting fair recruitment selection.

for employee discipline, panasonic has, among other provisions in its work regulations, those mandating respect for
human rights, those forbidding illegal behavior, and those forbidding sexual harassment in the workplace; in the event of a
violation of any one of these provisions, expressly stated disciplinary measures are to be taken.

furthermore, the company is engaged in the following efforts to prevent sexual discrimination, including sexual harassment,
as well as harassment based on power differentials, in order to create a more fair, equal, and pleasant workplace:
• establishment, publication, and thorough implementation of policies concerning sexual harassment
• distribution of leaflets and manuals concerning sexual harassment
• seminars and training on sexual harassment, harassment based on power differentials, and revitalizing workplace culture
• lgbt training

managing working hours
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements, panasonic has established in its
work regulations provisions relating to appropriate working hours, break times, overtime work, holidays, leave, and so forth.

to abide by these provisions, the company operates a working-hours management system and is also engaged in
comprehensive employee health management.

with a work management system, panasonic has implemented a variety of measures with an eye to employees’ health,
including a mechanism by which warnings are issued and other steps are taken at the point when a certain length of
overtime has been reached; optimal placement of personnel so that overtime is not overly imposed on only certain
employees; and additional health checks performed in the rare event that an employee has worked excessively long hours.


managing wages
based on labor standards legislation in the respective countries and on labor agreements, panasonic has established in its
employee wage regulations provisions for adequate wages, allowances for commuting and other expenses, bonuses, other
compensation paid on occasional bases, retirement allowance, and so forth.

the company has implemented a “role / grade system” that determines compensation based on the work or role in which
employees are currently engaged; there are no gender-based inequalities in this compensation system.

in japan, to ascertain whether employees’ wages are being paid correctly, labor unions conduct annual surveys of wage
conditions among their members and check whether those members are being properly paid the salaries resulting from
wage negotiations decided between labor and management.

overseas, panasonic establishes, by country, company regulations that comply with all wage-related laws and regulations
pertaining to matters such as the minimum wage, statutory benefits, and overtime. the company conducts its operations
based on these regulations and—for the specified period of payment and at the specified time of payment—notifies its
employees through pay statements and electronic data, and pays them directly.

in cases where the laws of the country or region in question do not prohibit monetary disciplinary action, panasonic
recognized such disciplinary action as a possibility, and does not prohibit it. however, this is all predicated on the
procedures for such actions as well as the monetary amounts involved being established within legal limits with
consideration given to the impact on the recipient’s life, as well as such measures being codified in internal regulations and
made well known to employees. japanese law does not prohibit monetary discipline, but panasonic’s disciplinary rules
within japan do not include monetary disciplinary measures.


the freedom of association and respect for the right to collective bargaining
panasonic believes that the freedom of association, combined with the right to collective bargaining, is one of the
fundamental human rights that companies should respect.

in countries and regions that permit the formation of labor unions—for instance, in japan—panasonic and the panasonic
group workers union association have stipulated in their labor agreement that unions retain the rights to organize, to
collectively bargain, and to strike.

in addition, even in countries and regions where the formation of labor unions is not permitted because of legislation,
regulations, or conventional labor practices, the panasonic code of conduct stipulates the de facto promotion of issue
resolution through labor-management dialogues, which are the goals of the principles of the freedom of association and
the right to collective bargaining. in addition, the company expressly lists these dialogues as one of the conditions for doing
business with suppliers in its standard purchase agreement and demands suppliers comply with this condition.

japan
panasonic has adopted a “union shop” system, whereby all full-time company employees automatically become labor
union members upon being hired with that status, and it has concluded labor agreements and a basic agreement with the
panasonic group workers union association. except for some employees engaged in work relating to management, all
full-time panasonic employees in non-managerial jobs belong to a labor union. in addition, the company respects the right
of non-regular employees to join a labor union if they choose to do so. at panasonic, important management issues are
discussed in advance with the labor union, and management-labor committees are established as a forum for people
to express their opinions on these issues. particularly, important decisions are explained to the labor unions, and labor-
management councils are held to provide an opportunity for people to express their approval or proposals for change.

both management-labor committees and labor-management councils are held periodically and separately at the
groupwide, company, and business division levels. the groupwide-level management-labor committee includes the
panasonic group president, executives in charge of human resources, the head of the labor union’s central executive
committee, and others, and is held once per month. the groupwide-level labor-management council includes all
executives who are managing directors or above, all members of the labor union’s central executive committee, and
others, and is held twice per year.

there is no established minimum notification period when a vital matter for consideration, such as a structural change, has
arisen. however, after the company has issued a proposal, there will be discussions, if necessary, every single day at every
level—groupwide, company, and business division—until both labor and management have reached complete agreement.


europe
following an eu directive* adopted in 1994, panasonic set up a voluntary labor-management agreement to provide a venue
for meaningful discussions between labor and management, and established the panasonic european employee congress
(peec).

in fiscal 2017, 29 employee representatives and 15 company representatives assembled in prague, czech republic;
exchanged information concerning management strategy, business issues, and other matters; and had active discussions.
* eu directive: a directive that obliges all companies employing 1,000 or more employees in two or more countries of the european union to
 establish a pan-european labor-management consultation committee

china
the unionization rate among private companies in china varies among different groups of firms, but nearly all panasonic
affiliated companies have organized labor unions (gōnghuì) and are actively engaged in labor-union related activities.
specifically, panasonic conducts—among other initiatives—periodic labor-management dialogues, proactive joint labor-
management recreational events, and prior explanations to unions concerning important management decisions. the
company is thus focusing its efforts on building good relations between labor and management—the basis for business
development.

standards, legislation, regulations, and so forth

state of efforts relating to the ilo core labour standards
panasonic supports the fundamental principles of the united nations universal declaration of human rights, the
international labour organization (ilo) declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work, and the oecd
guidelines for multinational enterprises. the major parts of these principles are embodied in the panasonic code of
conduct. panasonic’s headquarters and each regional headquarters serve as bases for the collection of information on
critical changes in legal requirements related to human rights and labor, and every one of our business sites works to
ensure and strengthen our compliance with them.

initiatives for the prevention of slavery and human trafficking
modern slavery can occur in various forms including servitude, forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking, all
of which include the deprivation of a person’s (an adult or child’s) liberty by another (collectively “modern slavery”). the
following sets out the procedures panasonic has put in place with the aim of preventing opportunities for modern slavery
to occur within our business or supply chain.

panasonic is committed to a work environment that is free from modern slavery in accordance with the laws and
regulations of the respective countries in which we operate.

we operate a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in
all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure
modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains. we will not knowingly use
modern slavery in any of our products and/or services supplied, nor will we accept commodities, products and/or services
from suppliers that we believe to engage in acts of modern slavery.

our business and key risk areas:
our business
panasonic’s global business is organised into four key business segments:
  • appliances;
  • eco solutions;
  • connected solutions; and
  • automotive & industrial systems.

our supply chain:
our supply chains include the sourcing of raw materials and minerals principally related to the provision and manufacture
of electrical products. please refer to
http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/sustainability/supply_chain/minerals.html
for more details.

our key risk areas:
the risk that modern slavery will occur is thought to be especially high in certain regions of the world. we are also aware there
are greater human rights and labour related risks in areas where migrant foreign workers are widely employed. panasonic is
actively implementing a programme of enhanced checks in these regions to ensure compliance with local legislation.

due diligence process for human trafficking and slavery:
as part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risks, we have taken a number of actions to verify the absence of modern
slavery in our supply chain, including the following:

panasonic code of conduct
this includes requirements on ensuring respect for human rights and that panasonic will not employ people against their will.
chapter 3: employee relations
(omitted)
(2) respect for human rights
2) the company will not employ people against their will, and will not use child labor.
 the company will comply with the employment laws and regulations of the countries and regions in which it conducts
business.

suppliers
we ask our suppliers to meet our csr requirements, including safeguarding human rights and the health and safety of
labourers.

panasonic supply chain csr promotion guidelines (excerpts)

    card, passport, working permit (except the case where the retention of a working permit is required by law), immigration
    application, and any other similar document.
  • suppliers, manpower supply companies, and staffing agencies shall not collect any recruitment fee from workers.
  • suppliers shall inform workers of all items deducted from their salaries.
  • suppliers shall request and confirm that manpower supply companies and staffing agencies comply with above items.
http://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/management/procurement/for-suppliers.html


standard purchase agreements (excerpts)
(demand on suppliers to respect human rights)

the supplier shall not engage in forced or child labor, illegal employment of foreign workers, or other illegal or illegitimate
employment practices; employment conditions, including wages and shift lengths, shall be based on the laws and
regulations of the respective countries and regions in which the supplier does business.

training
we conduct training for all new, permanent staff on our basic business philosophy and code of conduct. this includes
training on: compliance with local laws and a respect for basic human rights with emphasis on not employing persons
against their will and on compliance with local employment laws.

recruitment
when recruiting employees, panasonic adopts a perspective of protecting fundamental human rights and engages
in recruitment activities that comply with the laws and regulations of the respective countries in which we operate.
panasonic also prohibits forced labour including child labour. in order to prevent child labour, we have included age
verification in the ‘self-assessment checklist’ which is used when individuals join the company. the risk of child labour
is thought to be especially high in china and elsewhere in asia and panasonic is implementing age verification in these
regions. the company does not allow employees under the age of 18 to engage in overtime work and heavy labour, and
offers them consideration and support so that they have opportunities to receive education.

supplier csr meetings and csr self-assessments
we have been conducting csr meetings with our suppliers and conducting csr self-assessments. the self-assessment
questionnaire fully covers issues related to modern slavery. in fiscal 2017, we held supplier csr meetings in china and
asian countries, where we circulated the self-assessment questionnaires to around 5,000 suppliers. where concern is
raised in the responses obtained, further contact is made, with some investigations conducted through site visits. identified
risks are discussed with the supplier and panasonic assists in formulating a corrective action plan where required. in fiscal
2017, we examined conditions on the ground at 12 of our suppliers. we identified issues in areas such as human rights,
health and safety, and we requested that these issues be rectified.

confidential whistle-blowing
we protect whistle blowers by providing an anonymous whistle-blowing hotline for employees. employees are regularly
reminded of the whistle-blowing hotline and are encouraged to use it if they suspect any potentially illegal behaviour or
practice.


plans for the future and continuous improvement:
we are aware that there are serious human rights and labour-related risks in some part of the supply chains, notably in high
risk areas. with the complexity of the supply chains, it takes time and effort to ensure all our suppliers are substantially free
from modern slavery. we therefore endeavour to tackle modern slavery issues as a continuous process.

we have expressed our commitment towards better understanding our supply chains and working towards greater
transparency and responsibility towards people working in them. we will continue to work with our suppliers to encourage
commitment to and compliance with our csr policies and legislation. we plan to act in accordance with the following over
the coming years:
  • supplier csr meetings and csr self-assessments – we will continue to conduct supplier csr meetings
    and csr self-assessments with our suppliers to help ensure compliance and evaluate their compliance with our
    csr policies. this will allow us to assess how we can achieve continuous improvement in the coming years. the self-
    assessment questionnaire includes: checking whether we are confirming ages in order to prevent child labour; not

                                                                           113

     allowing temporary agencies to collect fees or retain workers’ passports or identification documents; and providing
     workers with employment contracts, including terms of employment in those workers’ native languages. panasonic
     recruits employees and accepts temporary workers based on the laws and regulations of the respective countries, so
     that none of them are made to work against their will or are unduly subjected to disadvantageous working conditions.
     we will continue to conduct supplier csr meetings and circulate the self-assessment questionnaires to suppliers in
     fiscal 2018. china, asean countries, europe, us and central and south america are specifically planned for this work.

  • follow-up of the csr self-assessments – after receiving the self-assessment questionnaires from suppliers,
    we analyse the results and if we find any points of concern, we visit the suppliers on site for further investigation.
    this includes questioning the suppliers in more detail to identify any underlying issues. the process we now follow is
    based on advice we have received from a human rights and labour specialist. as appropriate, this results in an agreed
    corrective action plan being put into effect.

  • hotlines for workers employed by suppilers –we are going to introduce hotlines for workers employed by
    suppliers in fiscal 2018. these new hotlines will be assisted by an external organization so that workers will feel more
    comfortable using it. this hotline will first be introduced in malaysia.

  • employ an external information service – finding risks is the first step of tackling modern slavery issues,
    however it is highly challenging for a large organisation with many suppliers like us to monitor all suppliers. to overcome
    the difficulty, panasonic corporation will start employing an external information service. this will ensure that we are kept
    updated with human rights and labour information about our suppliers and take measures to address any issues.

policy
to deliver products and services that contribute to the lives of customers around the world, and to develop panasonic’s
business, it is essential for the company to step up its efforts to develop human talent that can participate actively, and
grow, in the global business environment. it is also essential that the company creates an organizational culture in which
all individual employees can fully deploy their talents regardless of age, gender, or nationality. thus, panasonic regards
the promotion of diversity as a crucial part of its business strategy, and hence provides a broad range of opportunities for
anyone with ability and ambition, and actively strives to create a work-friendly environment.

in fiscal 2011, panasonic compiled this thinking into a global diversity policy. since then, this policy has been implemented
globally.



   global diversity policy
   panasonic group is now one of the world’s leading business groups which offer a wide variety of products in
   electronic business areas related to our daily lives. with an aim to contribute to progress in society and to enrich
   people’s lives through manufacturing, every employee plays a leading role in their job and promoting business
   activities of panasonic.

   panasonic is a collection of people with various backgrounds, such as in terms of region, culture, and history, who
   possess diverse capabilities, as well as diverse traits in terms of various factors including gender, age, race, belief,
   religion, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. each person has various different ideas, and by sharing
   these ideas across countries and business areas, we can create more innovative values. thus, panasonic will
   continue to be a group which always gathers wisdom and spurs innovation with the concerned efforts of all. we have
   a strong hope that using our diverse mindsets and viewpoints we can deliver products and services like no other in
   the world to our customers.

   in order to achieve this, it is important to give a chance for success to motivated people of all countries and regions,
   regardless of their gender, nationality or any other characteristics. we have expanded our diversity activities to make
   the best of the individuality and abilities of each employee and to support their success towards the group on a global
   basis. we will continue to take up the challenge of becoming “no.1 in diversity promoting activities in each country
   and region.”

organization in charge of promoting diversity
in 1999 panasonic began its equal partnership initiative, and since this time, it has promoted the creation of an open
and fair work environment—one that does not discriminate based on gender, age, nationality, or similar factors—through
initiatives such as the establishment of the panasonic positive action program, special training programs for female
employees, and the naming of equal employment opportunity officers.

soon thereafter, in 2001, efforts to appoint women to positions of responsibility—previously largely the purview of
the human resources department—were more forcefully recognized as drivers of diversity for the entire organization.
accordingly as part of the management policies to change the corporate climate by facilitating the participation of women
in management, the corporate equal partnership division was established directly under the office of the president.

in 2006, the division was further developed as an organization, and became the corporate diversity promotion division—
with an expanded mandate that included a focus on diversity of age and nationality, in addition to gender. currently,
engagement & diversity promotion office is established in the human resources & industrial relations department,
endeavoring to create an organizational culture in which diversity thrives and supporting active participation by female
employees.


performance evaluations
panasonic believes “individuals and organizations that continue to evolve” to be an engine of growth and that it is crucial
to combine the individual strength of each employee—who all are eager to work and to challenge themselves—in order to
fully realize the potential of the organization. therefore, panasonic believes it is essential to create an organization that is
broad-minded and open.

putting this belief into action, panasonic conducts surveys of its employees’ opinions—both in japan and abroad—to
understand the state, needs, and problems of its employees and organization. problems discovered in these surveys are
factored into action plans, and each relevant corporation and organization works to implement the plans and resolve the
problems. from fiscal 2016, panasonic has been conducting its japanese and various overseas opinion surveys—which
are now conducted individually—by using a common platform. by doing so, the company is—through a common global
perspective—gaining a clearer understanding of both its organizational strengths and problems to be resolved, able to
enhance the quality of its management, and striving to achieve an organizational culture in which all employees can find
their work meaningful.

list of awards
randstad award 2017: overall fifth place, first place in the industry

the randstad award is based on a survey of companies by an independent organization, using common global standards.
the awards are given to the companies found to have the best employer brand (based upon the appeal of a company as
an employer).


managerial promotion
for management candidate selection and management human resources development, panasonic has unified its
standards, systems, processes, and it on a global basis. the company discovers and nurtures the most suited candidates
irrespective of age, gender, or nationality. the company is undertaking efforts for planned career development and
promotion for its employees.

for example, the company has established its “panasonic global competencies” (pgc)—global common guidelines for
action that are based on the company’s management philosophy—to clarify the leadership competencies needed for its
leaders and the core competencies of all employees. thus, the company is promoting behavioral change and improved
practical initiatives among its leaders worldwide.

the company has also indicated on a global basis that experience such as managing multiple businesses, or working in a
country other than one’s own, are prerequisites to being selected as an executive officer or being promoted as a member
of senior management. panasonic fosters talented individuals, who are likely to become management candidates, from
an early stage of their careers by clearly identifying the requirements and career paths required of senior managers.
implementing strategic human resources rotation is one means toward this goal, and overall this accelerates the pace of
career development.
                                                                           116

furthermore, the company is implementing 360 degree evaluation—as well as assessments by external organizations—
of managerial candidates. this allows the company to learn objectively of the strengths and weaknesses of candidates—
in terms of leadership, capabilities, and other aspects. thus, both the company and the prospective manager on the path
to managerial promotion are able to understand which negative issues must be addressed or overcome, as well as which
skill developments to focus on. this encourages future senior managers to develop their talent with high levels of self-
awareness and drive.

selection and administrative mechanisms for managerial positions
panasonic has established quantitative mechanisms to evaluate candidates for major group posts using a common global
standard. all positions of a certain level or above are considered “managerial,” and the corporate division supervises both
current senior managers and succession candidates. in addition, the company has established a “talent-management
committee” as a place to debate and consider the career development and promotion of succession candidates for major
posts objectively, transparently, and openly. the committee includes the presidents of panasonic corporation and the
four companies and the executive officer in charge of human resources. it discusses the search for and selection of the
best global senior managers, as well as career development plans. the company will continue to enhance its process for
discovering, nurturing, and promoting talent irrespective of age, gender, and nationality.


performance-linked system of remuneration
panasonic has adopted a performance-linked remuneration system that sets the levels of bonuses for the current fiscal
year based on the company’s performance during the previous fiscal year. the degree to which the performance of the
company is reflected in compensation increases at higher levels of management.

in addition, the amount of each individual’s bonus is determined based on the previous fiscal year’s performance of the
jobs of which he or she was in charge.

thus, by reflecting the company’s performance and individual performance within certain limits in compensation, panasonic
inspires the desire to improve individual and corporate performance.

in particular, the compensation of directors and executive officers consists of a fixed “basic compensation,” a
“performance-linked remuneration”—which serves as a short-term incentive—and stock options—which serve as a long-
term incentive.

performance-linked remuneration is evaluated by considering the performance of the entire panasonic group and of the
executive’s area of responsibility, based on indicators including sales, operating profit, free cash flows, and ccm*.

stock options are allocated so that executives can share profit awareness with other shareholders and strive to improve
corporate value, taking a long-term perspective.
* stands for “capital cost management,” panasonic’s proprietary management indicator based on the return on capital.

human resources development company
panasonic has established the human resources development company (hrdc) as an organization that specializes in
human-resources-related education and training for employees of all levels.

in broad terms, panasonic’s training falls under one of three areas: job-rank-based talent fostering, including executive
development and management enhancement; job-function-specific training (technical, manufacturing, etc.); and self-
development, which includes programs for increasing skill levels. in job-rank-based talent fostering, for instance, the hrdc
is engaged in nurturing leadership in order to put the panasonic management philosophy into practice. as part of this
area, the hrdc provides training aimed at enhancing management ability among those in charge of organizations as a
requirement.

in other areas, as well, the hrdc conducts specialized training. (the following are examples.)

• technology training
  offers training in technology management, hardware, software, product safety, and information security

• manufacturing training
  offers training in skills for manufacturing, as well as skill training related to quality management, environment
  management, and manufacturing technologies


global human resources development
to better nurture leaders who can play a leading role in promoting business that goes beyond national and regional borders
and who can serve as loci for cooperation, panasonic has established regulations for inter-regional personnel transfers and
strives to place its employees wherever in the world they can best display their abilities. for example, panasonic began
full implementation of a program called “working in japan” in 2007, with the aim of accelerating the development of talent
from overseas through the experience of working in japan.

in each country and region, panasonic conducts and is expanding training programs to increase mutual understanding
among people from all nations around the globe. for example, in europe, as part of the two-year “talent for tomorrow”


                                                                                118

(tft) human resources development program, employees spent several months engaged in volunteer work overseas with
non-profit organizations. the employees who participated worked on social issues while making use of their work skills
and then put the knowledge and experience that they gained from these activities into product development and business
creation.

additionally, panasonic conducts “global onboarding training” for career-track hires in each country and region, builds the
system of global core common knowledge that is a compilation of the training that all global panasonic employees should
undergo, and provides e-learning services.


efforts to develop employee employability
supporting skills development for flexible change in the organization
in a business environment constantly subject to turbulent upheaval and to maintain competitiveness through flexible
change, we find it important to support employees’ efforts to keep their skills up to date in a flexible fashion. for this, we
offer training opportunities to develop new skills. for example, when we implemented structural reforms in recent years, we
offered training to some of our engineers so that they could be redeployed in new business areas that we have earmarked
as future focus points.


career create system supports employees’ ambitions to create new careers
we at panasonic believe in the great importance of giving each and every one of our employees the opportunity to make
the most of their own desires and creativity, to develop their talents and skills, and reach their full potential based on what
their individuality brings to the table. based on this philosophy, we have devised our career create system to advertise
job opportunities within the company and to support our employees’ efforts to advance their careers. in this system,
departments that need new personnel must first formulate a clear statement of their requirements and seek to fill their
positions within the company, which we call “e-challenge.” we also have the e-appeal challenge system, which allows
employees to offer their skills directly to those departments where they wish to work and to challenge themselves with new
types of work. these systems support all employees equally, irrespective of age, gender, or nationality.


career and life design seminars
in these seminars, panasonic educates the individuals who work for it so that they may be more employable throughout all
of society and so that they may continue to challenge themselves for the future.

• employees take stock of their careers up to that point, verify their core values and make an inventory of the skills that
  they possess. they ask questions about the issues faced in creating careers according to their generation, and engage
  in other activities designed to promote understanding of the importance of independent careers. and employees clarify
  their career visions for the next 5 and 10 years.

• employees receive guidance concerning economic planning and self-discipline as regards their mind and body to
  increase their understanding of the importance of economic planning and healthy lifestyles in realizing their career
  visions.


building total rewards systems that treat both our organization and our
ambitious employees the way they deserve
at panasonic corporation and some japanese affiliates, a “role/grade system” has been implemented. this system
determines work/role grades for employees according to the size of the work or role they currently perform to form the
basis for employee benefits. the aim of this system is to treat the wide variety of employees at panasonic based on the
scope of their work and responsibilities. this helps to enhance the transparency of our human resources systems, and
fosters understanding among employees. by setting clear goals for employees to strive for, we encourage employees to be
bold to achieve their goals. we believe this helps make both our people and our organization bolder. in these ways, both
our people and our organization can reap the rewards of our ambitions, with the aim of building an organizational culture
that is brimming with vitality.

hr development and diversity: diversity

to exploit the knowledge capital of society to the greatest extent possible, panasonic believes that it is crucial to take
advantage of all forms of diversity in the workplace whether in terms gender, age, nationality, or any other cohort. the
company has implemented a “role / grade system” that determines compensation based on the work or role in which
employees are currently engaged; there are no gender-based inequalities in this compensation system. however,
particularly in japan, panasonic is aware that there is a need to employ greater numbers of women in upper management
and decision-making positions; it is striving to ensure gender diversity.

in terms of senior management, a female director (current board member hiroko ota) was appointed in fiscal 2014, and,
in fiscal 2016, a female executive officer (current executive officer michiko ogawa) has been named. to accelerate female
participation in management, panasonic holds study groups for female employees and provides career-advancement
seminars for women leaders, creating opportunities for women to encounter role models’ values and views on working, as
well as further strengthening the management capabilities of superiors.

furthermore, to raise the consciousness of all employees concerning the promotion of diversity, panasonic has established
that every july be diversity promotion month, hosting forums and creating opportunities in the workplace for discussions
on the theme of promoting diversity.

diversity in the united states – 2017
pna recognizes that inclusion and diversity naturally generate creativity and innovation and is committed to maintaining
a workforce that is as diverse as its customers, business partners and the communities in which it operates. in an effort
to improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace, in 2016, panasonic introduced the women connect and panasonic
veterans group. these, these business impact groups were created to support recruiting, hiring, internal advancement
and community service opportunities for women and military veterans at the company. in addition, recruiting efforts have
been enhanced to identify candidates from all diverse groups through marketing and partnering with specialized recruiting
organizations.

additionally, panasonic provides training for all employees. this training is designed to prevent harassment in the workplace
and help employees understand what the company means by an open and fair workplace environment. participants learn
to build relationships of respect with colleagues, customers and business partners. the equal employment opportunity
policies are covered extensively during the training. we also introduced a speaker series that provides additional education
on diversity & inclusion related topics. employees are required to complete a slate of compliance related online training
classes (panasonic legal awareness on the net “plan”). this training deepens knowledge of laws related to discrimination
in employment.


work-life management
realizing diversity in working styles—e-work*
panasonic promotes “e-work” as an efficient way of working that exploits information and communication technologies to
effectively utilize time in any location. it has implemented a work-at-home system that covers around 40,000 employees.
the company has also created “spot offices”—places with equipment and a network connection where employees can
work when traveling on business at 17 locations groupwide (16 of them in japan).

the spot offices have reduced travel time and accelerated customer service, and panasonic plans to create an
environment in which employees can work even more efficiently. the company will increase productivity and help its
employees achieve work-life management by a number of flexible work styles.
*the term “e-work” refers generally to working from home, mobile work, work at satellite offices, remote conferencing, and other such initiatives.


supporting diverse ways of working through work-life management
as part of panasonic’s efforts to create an environment that enables everyone to play an active role, the company is
implementing initiatives to support a good work-life balance for employees.

in addition to complying with japan’s act on advancement of measures to support raising next-generation children—
panasonic strives to create an environments in which employees can effectively use the systems that provide support
for to balanceing the time they spend between work and their families. an example of the company’s efforts includes the
posting descriptions and way of using the related support systems on the company’s intranet.

in cooperation with regional governments and other authorities, we as a group manage seven special subsidiaries to
promote the employment of workers with severe disabilities.

at these subsidiaries, special measures are taken to create an appropriate workplace, with specially designed workbenches
and materials arrayed at heights suitable for people in wheelchairs. these companies also actively welcome interns,
trainees, and observers.

at other group divisions, efforts are made to create a workplace where workers with disabilities can take an active
part. special training sessions are offered for the hearing-impaired, sign-language interpreters are provided for skills
development sessions, short courses may include sign language, and manuals have been created to train employees in
how to interact with people with hearing impairments.

going forward, panasonic will continue its efforts to foster the independence of workers with disabilities and integrate them
as participants in the society.

    upon receiving a recommendation from okayama prefecture and kibichuo
    town, panasonic kibi co., ltd. received the 2016 minister of health, labour
    and welfare award for the independence and rehabilitation of persons
    with disabilities.

    this award ceremony is one of the main events during persons with
    disabilities week (december 3–9, 2016), and it is held to confer awards on
    those who have overcome their own disabilities to live independent lives
    and who can serve as role models for other people with disabilities. it also
                                                                                                           holding the award certificate
    seeks to create understanding and raise awareness among the people of                                  president nishimura, panasonic kibi co., ltd.
    japan regarding the welfare of those with disabilities and to promote a
    higher level of welfare administration for people with disabilities.

    panasonic kibi was recognized mainly for its efforts in encouraging people with disabilities to contribute to society and
    in promoting sports for the disabled. the following activities were particularly praised during the selection process:

       1. the company promotes initiatives that encourage those with disabilities to take part in society through sports
          and that raise social awareness about their activities.

       2. it also contributes revenue from aluminum can recycling—conducted to promote understanding about persons
          with disabilities—to local sports competitions for the disabled and promotes social participation in local events.

       3. since taking over the administration of the okayama kibi kogen fureai wheelchair road race—a public-
           private joint event that has been held since 1998—from the prefecture, the company has been actively
           engaged in the project.

   ■comment from president nishimura of panasonic kibi
    i am extremely happy and honored that panasonic kibi has been chosen for this award. over the 36 years since the
    founding of panasonic kibi, we have been blessed with the hard work of our predecessors and support from the
    panasonic group.

    motivated by this award, we will come together as a company and continue to strive for new businesses and
    increased social participation and employment opportunities for persons with disabilities.




employing workers post retirement
in 1982, panasonic created the senior partner system, allowing workers past retirement age to enter into employment
contracts under new conditions. in 2001 we introduced our next stage program, renewing our position as an industry
leader in formulating policies for the employment of older workers in japan.

the next stage program is a system that consists mainly of the next stage partner program, which allows workers who
wish to continue working after mandatory retirement at age 60 to do so until age 65. in april 2008 we relaunched this as
the new next stage program. our basic thinking here is an emphasis on personal autonomy. the new system is easier to
understand, more flexible, and easier to use than ever before. in 2015, we updated this system once again, based on new
ideas of longer-term careers, aimed at encouraging each employee to map out his or her own career from an early stage.
our new system offers a broader range of measures to meet the diverse needs of older workers. more specifically, across
the entire company, we are developing and promoting training seminars on career design and life design for various stages
of people’s lives. as increasing numbers of people desire to continue working into their later years, social attitudes are
changing. this has economic ramifications, in terms of retirement and pension benefits—specifically, the need for many
employees to continue to work during the gap between when they officially retire and when they start to receive pension
payouts—as well as ramifications in terms of the emergence of older workers as a potential resource. we are striving to
ensure that everyone who wishes to continue working beyond the age of 60 has the opportunity to do so, and we are fine-
tuning the conditions of our next stage partner system to accommodate this change.

                                                                           123

we are also offering a full range of economic support for employees who wish to retire early and seek new activities
elsewhere, as well as support for those who wish to work elsewhere after reaching retirement age.


initiatives relating to lgbt* (sexual minority groups) concerns
policy
panasonic’s code of conduct makes it clear that discriminatory speech or conduct with regard to sexual orientation or
gender identity, as defined by applicable laws, are not permitted.
 panasonic code of conduct, chapter 3: employee relations (2) respect for human rights
http://www.panasonic.com/jp/corporate/management/code-of-conduct/chapter-3.html

*lgbt: an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, lgbt is used in this section to refer to these and other sexual minority groups.


treatment of individuals in panasonic’s hr systems
effective april 2016, panasonic corporation now recognizes same-sex domestic partners as equivalent to legal spouses
within its hr systems, except in areas where such recognition cannot be applied due to legal restrictions. this is part
of the company’s promotion of diversity in management, which is based on valuing, accepting and making the most of
individuality. affiliates both within and outside of japan are addressing this matter on an individual basis, subject to the
condition of compliance with applicable local laws.

advancement in understanding
in order to encourage understanding of the concerns of lgbt individuals and communities and to create a more lgbt-
friendly workplace, panasonic has been conducting successive seminars geared toward hr functional divisions, managerial
positions, and employees, since february 2016. seminars for hr functional divisions offer not only basic knowledge about
lgbt concerns, but also methods for dealing with discriminatory speech or conduct, and methods for responding to the
needs of those involved. information on how to advance understanding of lgbt issues and invitations to participate in
events that support lgbt causes are also sent out via panasonic’s intranet system.

creating support desks
panasonic has created support desks through which employees can engage in email or telephone consultations about any
internal company topics, including cases of sexual harassment or abuse of authority. (employees may use these support
desks anonymously.)

support for external activities
since fiscal 2015, panasonic has been engaged in cooperation with work with pride, a private organization that works on
initiatives to create more lgbt-friendly workplaces. panasonic provided a hall in its tokyo building as a venue for an event
in 2014, with roughly 200 people taking part, most of them from corporate hr departments.

every year since then, the company has cooperated with work with pride in other events, such as their tokyo rainbow
week exhibits, and has provided ongoing cooperation for other events. panasonic has made contributions to the policy
working group for a corporate lgbt evaluation index held from december 2015 to may 2016 as a secretariat member.

occupational health and safety

management system
the purpose of the panasonic group’s occupational health and safety management is to promote a comfortable,
safe workplace based on the most advanced and best practices. its aim is to contribute to the welfare of the group’s
employees and the development of panasonic’s business. in addition, the group has established in its regulations that it
will give careful consideration to the health and safety of the subcontractors’ employees who work full-time on panasonic
premises.

to maintain our efforts regarding occupational health and safety—and to improve them continuously—panasonic has
implemented an occupational health and safety management system at nearly all its manufacturing locations globally (some
of which are now under construction). the systems implemented at company locations consist primarily of the panasonic
occupational safety and health management system, which encompasses the ohsas18001 standard, supplemented by
the company’s unique perspective. panasonic also acquires external ohsas18001 certification in locations outside japan
where it has been requested to do so by customers.

panasonic uses this system to give all employees clear roles and responsibilities and to promote their engagement in
health and safety-related activities by setting clear targets. the system also involves periodic reviews by the directors of
business sites, thus allowing the company to revise these activities as needed. panasonic periodically—at least annually—
conducts risk assessments to uncover any remaining risks of workplace accidents or illnesses and to reduce these risks,
which it does decisively and in order of severity. furthermore, when a workplace accident happens within the company,
panasonic shares it as a case study through its corporate intranet, so that it can implement steps to prevent recurrences at
all business sites.

at all business sites in japan, health and safety committees, composed of employees and managers, investigate and
debate issues of health and safety that could affect employees. moreover, to achieve a similar level of protection for
employees of partner companies, including contractors operating on our premises, panasonic has established occupational
health and safety councils, which are involved in a variety of activities, including formulating occupational health and safety
policy, as well as various forms of information sharing.

panasonic group staff in charge of health and safety participate in an annual employee health and occupational health
and safety forum, where together they study case studies of efforts at different business sites, attend lectures by visiting
instructors, and engage in other activities to increase their knowledge, so they can put it into practice at each business site.

in addition, sites that have had no accidents for a certain period of time receive awards, as do those that have initiated
activities relating to safety, health, or the promotion of healthy lifestyles among employees. these initiatives can stand as
models of behavior for other sites. in fiscal 2017, we worked to expand this program globally by, for example, announcing
praiseworthy cases from outside japan.

occupational health and safety support desk
panasonic has established the following lines of support to help employees prevent or deal with mental or physical stress:

employee consultants (or the human resources department of the employee’s place of work)
since 1957, panasonic has designated employees with abundant work experience as “consultants,” and it has
implemented a “consultant system” whereby other employees may confer with them. the consultants answer any
questions other employees have concerning welfare systems, and they provide support aimed at helping employees take
charge of resolving worries or problems that they face in their work or private lives.

eap* consultation office
for this program, panasonic has engaged specialist counselors to listen to the personal concerns of employees, who can
rest assured that what they have discussed will not be disclosed to the company or to their health insurance association.

* eap: employee assistance program


company clinic
panasonic staffs these offices with full-time physicians and occupational health staff to provide a health support program
that performs functions such as handling illnesses that manifest during work, consulting on mental and physical health,
preventing lifestyle-related diseases, and helping in smoking cessation.

initiatives relating to health issues
initiatives for preventing damage to health
with regard to the stress check system, which became codified into law in december 2015, panasonic carries out checks
in conjunction with its regular health screenings and follows measures at each business site to ensure that all group
employees receive these checks. results of stress checks are used to make employees aware of their stress levels and are
combined with feedback analyzing workplace conditions. this information is used in measures to preempt mental health
issues by bringing vitality to workplaces.

employees who work more hours or whose regular health screening results suggest a need for monitoring their safety
receive consultation, based on panasonic’s own criteria, from an occupational physician, while measures are taken to
prevent damage to the employee’s health by addressing working conditions, etc.

furthermore, under healthy panasonic 2018, which is run by the panasonic labor union, the health insurance association,
and panasonic corporation, employees have taken part, since 2011, in a ball toss game as a measure for promoting
better employee health. when the company started promoting the game, a decline in physical and muscular strength due
to aging had been identified as one cause of the sharp rise in occupational accidents from falls while walking or going
up or down stairs. the ball game is a means for employees to become aware of their state of physical fitness and to
communicate more with one another, since the game helps make personal exercise a habit and improves communication
in the workplace. from 2015, we have held a company-wide tournament with more than 32,000 employees participating
annually.

*3 total time lost of victims due to labor accidents

at business sites where workplace accidents have occurred, panasonic investigates the causes behind the incidents,
implements measures to prevent recurrences, and shares accident case studies group-wide, so that all business sites may
implement preventive measures to avoid the same kinds of accidents themselves.

to our deep regret, one workplace death occurred in september 2016, when an employee was crushed by heavy
machinery. panasonic takes this event extremely seriously. the production engineering division and human resources
division worked together to immediately implement emergency inspections at business sites inside and outside japan in
order to prevent a recurrence, while countermeasures have been enacted to address hazardous areas. furthermore, with
regard to the employee death that occurred at the toyama plant in june 2016, we solemnly accept the february 2017
official recognition of this as an occupational accident due to too many working hours, and we are making efforts group-
wide to prevent a recurrence.

for special tasks, such as handling heavy materials or chemical substances, the company conducts work inspections
based on safety data sheet (sdss) and provides employees with appropriate personal protective equipment, making
every effort to minimize the required amount of such work. panasonic also reexamines the chemicals in question in
order to comply with the june 2016 compulsory regulations on chemical substance risk assessments. additional health
screenings and monitoring for employees engaged in such work are also conducted to prevent negative impacts on health,
in accordance with laws and regulations.

responsible supply chain

management system
with social responsibility in procurement, including consideration for the environment and human rights, being expected
from society, we at panasonic are working to conduct our business with suppliers that not only provide excellent
technology and quality, but also honor social responsibilities including clean procurement; green procurement; compliance;
information security; and human rights, labor, health and safety.

panasonic considers the promotion of csr in its procurement departments to be crucial and conducts periodic
management reviews.

to ensure at employees involved in procurement activities better understand csr procurement, and in order to raise their
awareness of csr procurement, we have created internal rules and manuals on csr procurement, and disseminated the
necessary information via handouts, our intranet, and training sessions.

we sign a standard purchase agreement with each of our suppliers provided that the supplier agrees with our
management philosophy and csr procurement policies. this agreement includes items related to csr such as human
rights, safe working environments, and consideration for the environment.

we also issue and distribute the guidelines we expect our suppliers to follow as the supply chain csr promotion
guidelines and conduct regular evaluations of supplier initiatives related to csr in addition to evaluations related to
standards for evaluating quality, cost, delivery, and service (qcds) and business results.

with regard to conflict minerals that fund organizations that behave without proper regard for human rights, engage in
environmental destruction, practice corruption, and otherwise act unethically in conflict zones, we strive to adhere to the
organisation for economic cooperation and development’s (oecd) due diligence guidance for responsible supply
chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas.

through these efforts, together with our suppliers, we strive to create sustainable supply chains.


policy
procurement policy
panasonic has summarized its core thinking on procurement in a 3-item set of procurement policy. the fundamental basis
of this policy is the concept that, based on relationships of mutual trust, and through diligent study and cooperation, our
suppliers are invaluable partners in creating the value our customers demand.

• implementation of global procurement activities
  the company globally establishes partnerships with suppliers to respond to production activities on a global scale, and
  works to create the functions and values our customers demand based on relationships of mutual trust and through
  diligent studies and cooperation.
• implementation of csr procurement
  complying with laws and regulations, social norms, and corporate ethics, the company promotes procurement activities
  together with suppliers that fulfill their social responsibilities, such as human rights, labor, safety and health, global
  environmental conservation, information security.
• procurement activities working closely with suppliers
  in order to achieve product values expected by customers, the company serves as the contact point of suppliers with
  respect to information, such as the market trends of materials and goods, new technologies, new materials, and new
  processes, and works to ensure and maintain the quality of purchased goods, realize competitive prices, and respond to
  market changes.

for details, please see our procurement policy at our procurement activities website.

supplier selection and evaluation
when selecting new suppliers, panasonic makes it a condition of doing business that the suppliers practice csr.
panasonic conducts checks from a perspective that encompasses such aspects as human rights, labor, health and safety,

                                                                           131

protecting the global environment, and information security. panasonic concludes standard purchase agreements that
include csr requirements with the suppliers that it has confirmed fulfill its requirements.

csr self-assessments of existing suppliers are also conducted. as required by the results of evaluations, panasonic
provides guidance or raises awareness with the aim of improving the situation.

ensuring fair business
because panasonic believes that a company is a public entity of society, it engages in fair transactions with its global
suppliers. there is a need for “a more stringent sense of moderation and ethics” in relationships with suppliers. in 2004,
panasonic made the clean procurement declaration and since then has followed a code of conduct in its procurement
activities. regretfully, in fiscal 2017, there were cases of employees working in procurement for panasonic in china who
violated these principles. panasonic considers this a serious issue. to prevent a reoccurrence, panasonic has instituted
thorough measures to remind all employees in charge of procurement of their responsibilities.

• prohibition of receiving money, valuables, and anything else that is improper from suppliers. prohibition of
  benefiting in the form of hospitality, entertainment, or meals.
  panasonic has established rules on entertainment and gifts from suppliers, which lays out strict rules that prohibit
  receiving any entertainment or meals, money, goods, or property, obtaining any advantages, or receiving other payoffs
  from any business partners from which panasonic purchases goods or obtains services, or who may become such
  business partners. these rules also both encourage reporting to or consultation with superiors in the workplace, hr or
  legal departments, or the internal hotline established for when a violation has been discovered, and lay out disciplinary
  actions for those who violate these rules.

• establishing of a purchasing ombudsperson fair business hotline
  panasonic promotes fair and equal procurement activities based on our clean procurement declaration.
  we have created the fair business hotline, a fair and objective organization, as a means for reporting in the event that
  any of our procurement staff have violated any laws or regulations, agreements with suppliers, the panasonic code of
  conduct, or other procurement rules, or is suspected to be about to do so in the near future.

education
training is spread out over seven sessions in one year, divided into introduction, fundamentals, and practice.

the purpose of this training is for employees to be able to gain a basic knowledge of our approach to csr and
procurement compliance, and to train our personnel to become individuals who can fulfill their responsibilities to society in
the context of procurement work.

we also hold training and workplace gatherings for discussions on the topic of clean procurement to ensure the
thoroughgoing implementation of fair business practices


responsible executive and framework
the executive officer in charge is senior managing executive officer yoshiyuki miyabe (as of august 2017).

the department responsible is the global procurement company. each of our group companies and their business
divisions and other affiliated companies has its own procurement department.

the global procurement company is responsible for csr procurement activities at the company-wide level. it works
together with the group companies and their business divisions and other affiliated companies to strengthen our efforts in
this area.

each company and business division draws up plans to follow and promote the company-wide rules and manuals, in
order to keep the pdca cycle in motion. issues that arise in this process are addressed by the conference and other
opportunities composed of executives responsible for the procurement functions in each company and business division,
which devises appropriate solutions.

responsible supply chain: enforcement of csr for suppliers

enforcement of the panasonic supply chain csr promotion guidelines
in march 2016, the panasonic group issued the csr requirements we have created in order to convey our stance on csr
procurement that we want our suppliers to adhere to known as the panasonic supply chain csr promotion guidelines
(hereafter, “procurement guidelines”), with reference to international standards and standard approaches in industry.

these procurement guidelines have been created in japanese, english, chinese, thai, vietnamese, and indonesian, and
we are working on distributing them to all our suppliers via email and ensuring that they have been notified, in addition to
posting them on our website.

we also have csr supplier meetings in china and southeast asia. in china, around 400 suppliers have attended, as have
some 3,000 in southeast asia and india.

requests to our suppliers for csr self-assessments
in fiscal 2016, we began requesting that our suppliers begin conducting csr self-assessments concerning the state of
their initiatives related to human rights, health and safety, the environment, and ethics.

in fiscal 2017, we requested csr self-assessments from roughly 5,000 suppliers, mostly in china, southeast asia, and
india.

based on the self-assessments, we visit suppliers, check conditions on the ground, and hold interviews whenever
necessary. in fiscal 2017, we checked conditions on the ground at 12 suppliers. we identified three issues in areas such as
human rights, health, and safety, and we requested that corrections be made. we will continue to request self-assessments
of our suppliers and to communicate with them about csr. we will work to take swift corrective action in the event that we
find any issues and to build up a solid, healthy supply chain.

responsible supply chain: response regarding conflict minerals

basic stance on conflict minerals
the issues of conflict minerals* are considered important by panasonic. these minerals are mined in the democratic
republic of congo (drc) and neighboring countries (hereinafter, “the covered countries”), and their extraction funds
organizations that violate human rights, cause serious harm to the environment, perpetrate corruption, and are otherwise
involved in illegal activity.

to fulfill our social responsibilities in our procurement activities, our policy prohibits the usage of illegally obtained conflict
minerals as raw materials.

in the rare event that such use is discovered, efforts aimed at to terminate any usage must be made without delay.

to this end, a notice was issued in december 2010 to the entire group requiring a thorough approach to non-use. in
february 2011, efforts began to require checks of our major suppliers’ sources for procuring minerals.

however, in the covered countries, there are also companies and individuals engaged in legal business activities, with
no connection to any illegal activities. we also must strive hard to ensure that such companies or individuals’ business
activities and livelihoods are not harmed by our efforts to avoid using minerals that are illegally obtained.

to this end, we need to cooperate with a wide range of stakeholders, including countries, companies, and non-profit
organizations (npos) that are taking measures to build fair supply chains of minerals in the covered countries. based on
these concepts, panasonic has been participating in the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s (oecd)
due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas, which
began in august 2011.

alongside our involvement in this project, we are also engaged in other efforts aimed at the implementation of the oecd
guidance, building management processes that conform to global standards, with the aim of contributing to international
efforts to resolve the problem of conflict minerals.

panasonic’s systems for dealing with conflict minerals
panasonic is making efforts to build company-wide systems, with ultimate responsibility residing with the executive officer
in charge of procurement. with the start of the four-company system in april 2013, we designated a person at each
company to be in charge of investigating and reporting on conflict minerals. under the aegis of these individuals, each
company is making efforts to build systems and carry out investigations based on the characteristics of its own business.


due diligence efforts
in addition to communicating panasonic’s policies to our suppliers, we also ask them to put reasonable efforts toward
being drc conflict free and procure materials from conflict-free smelters (cfs) to the extent possible.

investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers, and all the refiners / smelters they work with.
to reduce the burden on suppliers, and to enhance the efficiency of such investigations, we have found it effective to
use common investigating tools and explanatory materials. based on this realization, panasonic uses, as an investigative
tool, the conflict minerals reporting template (cmrt) issued by the conflict-free sourcing initiative (cfsi). we are also
active participants at investigative briefings held by jeita’s (japan electronics and information technology industries
association) responsible minerals trade working group, where we work as a presenter. we make active use of manuals
and other handbooks jointly prepared by japanese automobile makers and the japan auto parts industries association for
conducting investigations.

status of investigations
in fiscal 2017, the panasonic group as a whole surveyed around 1,800 supplier companies on conflict materials and had
responses from 95% of those (as of the end of january 2017). based on the cmrts that we have collected, we have
already conducted a risk analysis and assessment, and have requested further investigations from suppliers according to
risks.

a total of 313 smelters have been identified by the panasonic group for the four specified minerals.

at the present time, we have not confirmed any minerals that have served to finance military power either directly or
indirectly for the metals that have been reported in the survey as being sourced from covered countries, but we will
continue our work of closely examining and identifying smelter information.

furthermore, through our industry activities, we have urged smelters to acquire cfs certification. our suppliers continue to
perform due diligence, but in the rare event minerals are discovered to have been supportive of conflict, we are asking that
these suppliers strive to change their suppliers, or take other steps toward non-use.


participation in forums on implementing due diligence for responsible
mineral supply chains
beginning in 2011, panasonic has been participating in oecd due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains
of minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas projects (currently, the forum on responsible mineral supply
chains). at the forum in november 2013, we learned about ongoing efforts toward conflict-free minerals procurement,
including mines, exchanges, and traceability systems for responsible minerals procurement, in rwanda, and ways to
identify mines through analysis of mineral composition and generation. we also participated in the forum in paris in may
2015, where we were able to exchange views with other interested persons and learn about effective approaches to the
problem of conflict minerals.


industry cooperation initiatives
investigations of conflict minerals require the cooperation of all suppliers in the supply chain. accordingly, panasonic has
been working with jeita (japan electronics and information technology industries association) as co-chair and co-leader
of the responsible minerals trade working group, engaging in educational activities and efforts to make the investigative
process more efficient through industry cooperation.

more specifically, we have been working with industry groups both inside and outside japan and holding seminars and
briefings about investigations to promote correct efforts regarding conflict minerals. we have checked information on
smelters / refiners, and helped plan the ipc-1755 standards for the sharing of u.s. data on conflict minerals. in november
2013, jeita’s responsible minerals trade working group teamed up with japanese automakers to create the conflict-
free sourcing working group, in order to engage in dialog with the smelting industry and to accelerate efforts to verify
information about smelters / refiners. panasonic was also a participant in this activity.

since january 2016, along with other corporate members of jeita’s responsible minerals trade working group, we have
begun working toward getting smelters that have not yet received cfs certification to do so.

we have also visited smelters in japan and conducted information exchanges on the conditions and issues surrounding
conflict minerals, and have considered what sensible ways of dealing with conflict minerals should look like.


support for efforts in democratic republic of congo and neighboring countries
panasonic has engaged in due diligence initiatives to fulfill its social responsibilities as a downstream company, but we
think the most important development towards resolving the problem of conflict minerals would be the establishment of
mechanisms for responsible procurement of minerals in the covered countries.

based on this thinking, we participated, with industry groups, the u.s. government, and citizen groups, in the public-private
alliance for responsible minerals trade (ppa). (from march 2013 to august 2017)

the ppa supports efforts to create mechanisms and develop capabilities for certification and traceability of minerals
transactions that are unrelated to any conflict in the africa’s great lakes region. at the same time, it creates a platform for

support for sustainable development of the covered countries
as panasonic’s corporate citizenship activity in this region, in 2010 we began the panasonic npo support fund for africa,
as a means of supporting and strengthening the public relations foundation for npos / ngos working to resolve issues in
african nations. this is our way of supporting organizations working to resolve issues in african nations. included among
the organizations that panasonic has supported so far are the npo terra renaissance (2011 to 2013), which works on
issues including landmines, small arms, and child soldiers in countries including uganda and the democratic republic of
the congo, and reborn kyoto (2014 to 2016), an npo that provides opportunities for women in rwanda to take part in
vocational training in order to support their economic independence. in march 2016, panasonic donated roughly 500 of its
solar lanterns to the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), which offers humanitarian assistance in the
democratic republic of the congo. in march 2017, panasonic donated its 900 solar lanterns to the democratic republic of
the congo through the united nations development programme (undp), to be used at vocational training facilities to help
former child soldiers, internally displaced people, and repatriated refugees.


dialog with ngos
we are engaged in dialog with ngos regarding handling of conflict minerals. in march 2015, we participated in an “ethical
mobile phone campaign” seminar promoted by the international environmental ngo a seed japan, sharing our views on
our handling of conflict minerals with representatives of corporations and ngos. we also exchanged views regarding the
importance of sector-cooperative efforts on the handling of conflict minerals. going forward, we plan to continue this kind
of dialog and cooperation.
