     an omni-channel model

     to let customers choose where, when and how they want to shop, carrefour offers a range of solutions to make their lives
     easier by deploying an omni-channel approach based on the seamless interaction between stores and online solutions,
     which increases opportunities to develop contact with customers. in this approach, carrefour adopts a local strategy,
     adapted country by country.

     easily accessible from a phone, computer or tablet, carrefour’s food and non-food e-commerce portals offer customers an
     extensive range of products, competitive prices, promotions, advice and a choice of delivery or pick-up options. carrefour
     is also developing a full array of mobile solutions to facilitate the shopping process, while broadening and deepening its
     social media presence to interact directly with customers.

     2016 was also marked by further progress towards the omni-channel approach. carrefour now has an online offering in all
     of its integrated countries, with in particular the launch of a non-food offering in brazil, a food offering in china and a
     marketplace in spain. in france, in addition to rolling out a new interface for its carrefour.fr portal, carrefour has enriched
     its digital ecosystem with targeted acquisitions to accelerate the deployment of e-commerce activities. it has acquired
     rue du commerce (more than 3 million non-food items) and greenweez (20,000 organic items in addition to those
     offered in store) as well as top achat, croquetteland, grands vins privés and my design. in addition, it has continued to
     drive further growth at ooshop, with a broader, more precisely defined assortment, and has expanded its click & collect
     services nationwide. customers in france can now count on a network of 569 carrefour drive across the country.
     carrefour is also pursuing the development of innovative services, such as home delivery in less than an hour in the
     île-de-france region (livraisonexpress.carrefour.fr) and summer drive opened on belgian beaches during the summer.

the indicators and data contained in the csr report (included in chapter 2 of this registration document) are audited and checked by an
independent, third-party statutory auditor (mazars in 2016). the report complies with article 225 of grenelle ii and with the “core” level
(essential elements) of the not-for-profit global reporting initiative’s (gri) g4 sustainability reporting guidelines.

csr index
carrefour created its own csr index in 2016 to provide an overview of the group’s existing commitments in the four areas of csr. the
index reflects the group’s csr performance, measures the progress made on its action plans and ensures that all of the business lines are
working towards achieving a common set of goals.
simple and easy-to-understand, the index is both reliable and credible. the method used to compile the index and its contents have been
approved by vigeo eiris, an agency that specialises in providing csr performance research. the indicators will be monitored for the first
time in 2017 and will be audited by an independent third party.


the index can be broken down into four distinct areas, each of which contains four objectives on the following themes:

the breakdown of the workforce by geographic region and store format reflects carrefour’s multi-local, multi-format model. at end-2016,
carrefour boasted 384,151 employees in 10 countries. on a like-for-like basis, staff numbers increased slightly between 2015 and 2016,
mainly due to expansion in romania through the acquisition of the billa supermarket chain, and in spain due to the acquisition of
two hypermarkets and the opening of convenience stores.

carrefour has always given priority to local employment, and its employees come from its stores’ nearby communities. in france, this is
illustrated by the group’s long-standing partnership with the state employment agency, pôle emploi (detailed in section 2.3.1.4). the
companies and communities charter (charte entreprises et quartiers) signed in 2013 between carrefour and the ministry of urban affairs
(ministère de la ville) is currently in place in 11 départements and one region.

by resembling the customers that visit its stores around the world, carrefour welcomes society as a whole, in all its diversity. in 2016,
carrefour france received an award as one of the top 10 companies for diversity recruitment in france (trophée top 10 des recruteurs de
la diversité).
new hires were down on 2015 due to a lower number of departures, particularly in latin america (see table below), and tougher trading
conditions in china.
when employees leave the company due to restructuring, there is a lengthy social dialogue process and a set of measures in place to help
relocate these employees or support their job search within or outside the company.

carrefour’s performance
in 2016, 71.6% of waste was recovered, which represents an increase of 2.9 points compared to 2015. this improvement was achieved as a
result of continued efforts at headquarters and in stores. in particular, the sorting of waste has improved, as has team training, while
recovery networks are being optimised and monitoring and follow-up is more precise.
in 2016, carrefour set itself the target of recovering 100% of hypermarket and supermarket waste by 2025.

           notes to the consolidated financial statements


during 2015, the total carrying amount of goodwill increased by 267 million euros, primarily due to (i) final adjustments in the second half
of 2015 to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the dia business combination, leading to a corresponding
adjustment of the related goodwill and (ii) the reclassification as goodwill of items presented in “other intangible assets” in 2014, partly
offset by (iii) translation adjustments to goodwill in brazil and argentina.

no stock options were taken into account for the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they were out of the money in 2016 (i.e., their
exercise price was greater than the average share price for the year). therefore, dilutive potential ordinary shares correspond exclusively to
the performance shares presented in note 10.2.

5.7            statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial
               statements
year-ended december 31, 2016


this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements issued in french and is
provided solely for the convenience of english-speaking users.
the statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by french law in such reports, whether modified or not. this
information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph
discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. these assessments were considered for the
purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on
individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures.
this report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the group’s management report.
this report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, french law and professional auditing standards
applicable in france.


to the shareholders,
in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders’ meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
december 31, 2016, on:
●    the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of carrefour “the group”;
●    the justification of our assessments;
●    the specific verification required by french law.
the consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


1.            opinion on the consolidated financial statements
we conducted our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and               5
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
statements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position and the assets and liabilities of the
group as of december 31, 2016, and of the results of its operations for the year then ended, in accordance with international financial
reporting standards (“ifrs”) as adopted by the european union.




                                                                                             carrefour i 2016 registration document        245

2.          justification of our assessments
in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce) relating to the justification
of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:
note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements states that the company’s group’s management uses estimates and makes assumptions
that may affect the book value of certain assets and liabilities as well as the accompanying notes to the financial statements. note 1.3 also
states that, depending on the evolutions of those assumptions, the book value of these assets and liabilities in the future financial
statements may differ from the current estimates.
we have notably verified the followings:
●   your group has performed at year-end an impairment test of goodwill and an assessment of the recoverability of other intangible and
    tangible assets as soon as there was any indication of impairment, according to the methodology described in note 6.3 to the
    consolidated financial statements. we have reviewed the methodology used to conduct the impairment tests and the identification of
    triggers of impairment, as well as the cash flow forecasts and assumptions used and verified the appropriate information provided in
    note 6.3. to the consolidated financial statements. we have reviewed the calculations performed by your group; we have compared
    previous periods’ accounting estimates with actual results and reviewed management’s approval process of these estimates;
●   with respect to provisions, we have assessed the basis upon which such provisions have been set up, reviewed the group’s procedures
    to identify them, their assessment, and their recording and reviewed the information relating to the risks presented in notes 9 and 10.1
    to the consolidated financial statements.
these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and therefore contributed to
the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.


3.          specific verification
as required by french law, we have also verified, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france, the information
presented in the group’s management report.
we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

6.5            statutory auditors’ report on the annual financial statements
this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditor's report on the financial statements issued in french and it is provided solely
for the convenience of english-speaking users. the statutory auditor's report includes information specifically required by french law in
such reports, whether modified or not. this information is presented below the audit opinion on the financial statements and includes an
explanatory paragraph discussing the auditor’s assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. these assessments were
considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance
on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures.
this report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report and in the
documents addressed to shareholders.
this report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, french law and professional auditing standards
applicable in france.
year-ended december 31, 2016
to the shareholders,
in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders’ meetings, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
december 31, 2016, on:
●    the audit of the annual financial statements of carrefour;
●    the justification of our assessments;
●    the specific verifications and information required by french law.
the annual financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.


1.            opinion on the annual financial statements
we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit involves
performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
in our opinion, the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the results of the operations for the year ended as of
december 31, 2016, and of the financial position and its assets and liabilities, in accordance with french accounting principles.
without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in the notes 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 and 3 to the financial statements
which explain the effect of the first-time application as of january 1, 2016 of anc recommendation no. 2015-06, issued by the french
accounting standards body and which is notably related to the allocation of merger losses (“malis technique”).
                                                                                                                                                    6
2.            justification of assessments
in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce), we bring to your attention
the following matters:
as mentioned in the first part of this report, the notes 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 and 3 to the financial statements explain the effect of the new accounting
method related to the allocation of merger losses.
in the context of our assessment of the accounting principles applied by your company, we assessed the correct application of the new
accounting method and the appropriateness of its presentation.
as stated in notes 1.2 and 1.3 to the financial statements, financial assets, including shares in subsidiaries and affiliates and merger losses,
for which forecast future cash flows no longer allow the carrying amount to be recovered, are impaired. this impairment is determined by
comparing the carrying amount to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of the asset’s value in use and its market value.
we assessed the information and assumptions underlying the calculation of values in use and, in particular cash flow forecasts prepared by
your company’s management. we reviewed the calculations performed by your company, compared previous periods’ accounting
estimates with actual results and reviewed the management approval process for these estimates. we remind you, however, that these
estimates are based on forecasts which by nature are uncertain, and as such actual results may differ from the current estimates.
these assessments were made as part of our audit of the annual financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the
opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.




                                                                                              carrefour i 2016 registration document         267

3.         specific verifications and information
in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france, we have also performed the specific verifications required by french law.
we have nothing to report on the fair presentation and consistency with the annual financial statements of the information provided in the
management report of the board of directors and in the documents addressed to shareholders regarding the financial position and the
annual financial statements.
with regard to the information provided in accordance with article l. 225-102-1 of the french commercial code on remunerations and
benefits received by corporate officers, as well as any other commitments granted in their favor, we have verified their consistency with the
financial statements or with the underlying information used to prepare the financial statements and, where necessary, with the
information collected by your company from companies controlling or controlled by your company. based on this work, we attest the
accuracy and fair presentation of this information.
in accordance with french law, we have verified that the management report provides you with all the required information relating to the
identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights.
