focusing on sustainability isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s
smart business. this year we named our first chief sustainability
officer, cristina amorim, who was honored as ethical
corporation’s 2012 sustainability executive of the year. driven
by cristina’s leadership, our sustainability achievements are
a testament to our employees’ ingenuity and to our culture of
continuously seeking and delivering a better way to do things.
this commitment earned life technologies our first appearance
on the global 100 most sustainable corporations list, announced
at the davos 2012 world economic forum.

as we continue to shrink our environmental footprint, we’re
focused on creating innovative tools and technologies that shape
discovery and improve life. among our 2012 launches was the
ion proton™ sequencer, a revolutionary benchtop instrument
that promises whole-genome sequencing in a day for less than
$1,000. making sequencing accessible to any lab will accelerate
breakthroughs to help feed, fuel, and heal the world.

with rapidly advancing technology, strategic partnerships, and
a clear vision for the future, we are poised to make an
exponentially greater impact in 2013 and beyond.

                                     we’re reading the signposts: the circular economy has arrived.
                                     in the midst of a radical transformation, we’re making choices
                                     to ensure progress toward a closed-loop system by 2020.

                                     in 2012, our sustainability efforts delivered $5 million in
                                     productivity — demonstrating that sustainability pays while
                                     reducing our environmental footprint. from 2008 through 2012,
                                     we cut energy use by 22%, water use by 52%, and co2 emissions
                                     by 21%, against our 25% target.

                                     however, owing to growth in demand for specific products and
                                     a one-off relocation of manufacturing facilities, our hazardous
                                     waste increased 47% from 2011 to 2012 despite targeted reduction
                                     efforts. we are evaluating mitigation measures for these solvent
                                     wastes to reestablish a downward trend.

                                     the people of life technologies, who challenge our way of doing
                                     things every single day, make our progress toward a closed-loop
                                     model possible. our common commitment is making us
                                     a smarter, more efficient, better company overall—positioned
                                     to thrive in the circular economy.

                                                                    cristina amorim

a better approach to product design, sourcing of raw materials,
manufacturing, distribution, and use and reuse of resources.

valuable resources within a closed-loop system.
