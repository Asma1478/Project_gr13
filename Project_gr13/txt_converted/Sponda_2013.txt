responsibility priorities
in 2011, sponda defined seven responsibility priorities, the implementation and development of which will be particularly focused on in the
company's operations.


the priorities are based on the company’s strategy and in particular on its strategic areas of focus related to customer experiences and
environmental responsibility. the purpose of the responsibility priorities is to support the development of sponda’s operations from the
perspective of sustainable development.


sponda reviewed the responsibility priorities and their relevance to the operations of the company at the end of 2012. at the same time, the goals
related to each priority were reviewed and progress in terms of reaching the goals was assessed.


sponda's responsibility priorities are:


•     improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint
•     material efficiency
•     property locations
•     enhancing the customer experience
•     investing in employees
•     transparency in operations
•     taking the industry forward


more detailed information on each of the responsibility priorities can be found in sections dedicated to them in this online annual report.

improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon
footprint
the property sector has a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency. sponda recognises this and pays
particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint caused by energy consumption.



why is this a priority?

the eu climate and energy strategy aims for a 20 per cent decrease in the energy consumption of new buildings by 2020. construction activity
and energy consumption of buildings together represent over 40 per cent of final energy consumption.


improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions therefore plays a key role in achieving that aim. in 2021, all new buildings
must meet near zero energy standards.


sponda strives to reach the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients. energy efficiency is an important
consideration in all of the company's property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations. sponda also encourages
its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties. the company also provides
guidance to its clients on energy efficiency and environmentally friendly building use.


every day approximately 30,000 people work in premises owned by sponda. as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy
consumption of a building, co-operation between the landlord and tenant is of crucial importance in reducing energy consumption. even small
acts can result in major changes.


the figures for environmental responsibility concerning sponda’s properties located in finland are collected on energy and water consumption
and waste management. there is a certain degree of annual variability in sponda’s property holdings due to sales and purchases, which affects
the comparability of the annual environment figures.


for 2012, comprehensive energy consumption related figures could be collected for sponda properties also in russia.



improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint at sponda

the key aspects of the priority are:

•   the consumption of heat, electricity and water in buildings
•   property development
•   increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees

certification and sponda's design guidelines

at sponda, new construction, property renovation and the design of low-energy office buildings are all subject to the company's design
guidelines, which are in many ways more extensive than the generally applied standards and regulations. the guidelines help the company
develop adaptable and energy efficient properties that offer good physical working conditions for tenants and users.


sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations. in 2011, sponda decided to apply for
international environmental classification, an environmental certificate, for all new buildings and major renovation projects. this allows sponda to
offer the customers increasingly high-quality and environmentally friendly premises.



energy efficiency programme reduces environmental load

the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through sponda's energy efficiency programme. originally launched in 2009, the
scheme is aimed at achieving energy savings in cooperation with clients.


the energy efficiency programme starts with an energy review in sponda properties to determine the energy consumption of each property and
to examine the different technical systems relating to energy consumption.


energy-saving goals and measures for achieving them are set individually for each property in cooperation with the users. developments are
then monitored in regular meetings with clients. sponda's partners ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance
operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data.


the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency programme are reinvested in the property. the programme initially aims at energy
savings of 10 per cent by 2016. the long-term goal is to achieve a 20 per cent saving in energy consumption by 2020.



sponda increases environmental awareness among its employees

sponda's head office in helsinki was granted wwf green office certification in 2010 in recognition of the high extent to which environmental
aspects are taken into consideration in office work. sponda uses the green office programme to promote the environmental expertise of
personnel and guide employees in making environmentally sound choices. environmental awareness is increased through an annual green day
event as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet.


sponda aims to actively reduce the energy consumption and other environmental load of its head office. in 2012, the energy consumption of
sponda’s head office declined compared to 2011. electricity consumption declined by 3.9 per cent, (standardised) heating consumption by 4.5
per cent and district cooling by 23.8 per cent. the major decline in the entire property’s water consumption, down 24.4 per cent from the previous
year, is not comparable due to drain damage.


sponda's employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports low-emission options. employees
are also provided with company bicycles. as part of sponda's green office environmental programme, employees are also trained in economical
driving. the company makes shared public transport tickets available to employees who need to travel in the helsinki region during the working
day.

measures taken in 2012

more properties covered by the energy efficiency programme

at the end of 2012, the energy efficiency programme covered 107 (2011: 113) properties. some of the properties divested during the year were
also omitted from the programme. ten properties owned by the real estate funds managed by sponda started their own energy efficiency
scheme in 2012.


for properties that joined the programme already earlier, energy reviews continued, energy saving measures were taken and consumption was
monitored in accordance with property-specific action plans.


sponda’s energy efficiency programme has been implemented also in russia since 2010. measures that save energy in the buildings are
determined on the basis of the energy consumption reviews performed in the properties. in 2012, sponda launched a tenant’s energy guide
applicable to russia, which was distributed at all sponda's properties.


monitoring of consumption in the properties and related reporting were developed during 2012 in russia to cover all sponda properties. the
consumption of electricity, heating and water in the buildings is monitored on a monthly basis. the consumption figures are mainly comparable to
the figures for the previous years.


energy consumption of sponda's properties decreased

the energy consumption of properties owned by sponda decreased in 2012. the measured heating energy consumption of comparable
properties was up by 1.1 per cent from the previous year. however, weather-adjusted heating energy consumption was 7.7 per cent lower than
the year before. the total electricity consumption of comparable properties decreased by 4.8 per cent, water consumption declined by 11.5 per
cent and cooling energy consumption fell by 29.5 per cent compared to the year 2011.


in 2012, the carbon footprint caused by the total energy consumption of all of sponda’s properties in finland was one per cent higher than the
previous year.


in 2011–2012, sponda took part in preparing the low-energy construction guidelines of ril - finnish association of civil engineers. the guideline
on low-energy construction of premises was published by ril at the beginning of 2012. sponda also completed its own low-energy building
concept based on the ril guideline in 2012.


sponda joined the city of helsinki’s and businesses’ joint climate partners network in 2012. the network aims to create new operating methods
to reduce climate emissions and strengthen the competitiveness of companies.

customer cooperation for the environment

sponda encourages its customers to energy savings also in its environmental partnership programme launched in 2011, which aims to reduce
the environmental load caused by the use of buildings through joint efforts. the number of environmental partners was increased in 2012.


the content of the extranet service for customers was expanded in 2012, and the service is in use in an increasing number of properties. the
extranet service gives customers guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting and also includes news on the progress of the
energy efficiency programme. clients can also use the extranet to monitor the energy consumption of their property on a monthly basis.


sponda arranged four environmental events at clients’ premises in partnership with wwf finland during 2012. the events, open for everyone,
offered diverse environmental information and encouraged the users of premises to think about environmental issues.


international environmental certification for three properties

a total of three sponda-owned properties were granted international environmental classification in 2012:


•   the ducat ii office building in moscow was awarded good-level breeam® in-use certification. it was sponda’s first environmental certificate
    in russia.
•   the renovated office building on unioninkatu 20–22, helsinki, was awarded a good-level breeam® certificate. the building is the first new
    building or renovated property to receive a breeam® certification in helsinki.
•   the production facility built by sponda in vantaa was awarded the pass-level breeam® environmental certificate for a new building. the new
    building is leased to metso in full.

material efficiency
sponda’s efforts in promoting material efficiency are particularly focused on waste sorting and providing instructions for waste
sorting. the aim is also to reduce the amount of waste generated in construction work.



why is this a priority?

in 2008, the finnish government approved a national waste plan aimed at reducing waste generation and achieving a reduction in the total
annual volume of municipal waste by 2016. the objective of the plan is to have less than 20 per cent of municipal waste end up in landfill sites,
with the remaining 80 per cent recycled or used for energy generation. sponda aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the
national waste plan through its own operations.



material efficiency in sponda's operations

the key aspects of the priority are:

•   the sorting and recovery of property waste
•   improving efficiency in material use, also in purchasing
•   producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects


while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties, sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its
properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place. the company arranges for post-
sorting waste management, unless otherwise agreed with tenants. sponda encourages the users of properties to recycle and sort waste and to
reduce the total volume of waste.


reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency. sponda's construction and renovation projects take this
aspect into account by investing in flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design. this reduces construction waste-generating
alteration work during the use of the building.

in the construction phase of new buildings and major renovation projects, the company has adopted on-site waste management guidelines
according to the international leed® and breeam® certification systems. in all construction and renovation projects and in the daily use of the
company's properties, the aim is to minimise the volume of waste ending up at landfill sites.


sponda will also focus increasingly on reducing the volume of waste as well as producing services with fewer material inputs and lower
environmental impact.




objectives and measures
objectives for 2012

•   environmental partnerships with customers will be increased during 2012
•   the recycling rate in the properties in finland will be increased to over 70 per cent



measures taken in 2012

sponda improved waste recycling at its properties at the beginning of 2012 by signing a cooperation agreement with lassila & tikanoja. the
agreement facilitated waste sorting for customers operating in premises owned by sponda and improved the reuse rate of the materials.


due to the cooperation, the recycling rate of waste in the properties owned by sponda in finland increased to 82 per cent and in the metropolitan
area even to 86 per cent. sponda's total waste volume in 2012 was 5,898 tonnes (2011: 5,610 tonnes), of which 1,059 tonnes (2,371 tonnes)
mixed waste. the volume of mixed waste will be further reduced by improving waste sorting.


number of environment partnerships increased

in order to increase environmental awareness among its customers and strengthen its customer cooperation, sponda launched an
environmental partnership programme with 10 customers in 2011. the aim of these partnerships is to increase the energy efficiency of premises
and the waste recycling rate as well as to pay attention to the environmental effects of customers’ operations. the content and objectives of the
cooperation are always agreed upon with the customer.


during 2012, the number of environmental partnerships increased, and 16 sponda customers were involved in the partnership programme at the
end of the year. the aim is to increase the number of partners further in 2013.


wwf finland has been one of sponda’s key partners in promoting environmental responsibility since 2010. the aim of the cooperation is to
pursue environmentally friendly practices in sponda’s operations and promote environmental responsibility among the company’s customers and
the entire real estate industry.


sponda expanded its cooperation with wwf in spring 2012 to also cover services related to wwf’s green office environmental system. sponda
supports its customers' green office processes by helping their green office teams set their consumption goals and reporting consumption data.
sponda’s customers receive a discount from the green office membership and annual fees.


climate covenant to mitigate climate change

sponda joined the climate partners network of businesses and the city of helsinki in 2012. the aim of climate partners is to find new practices
for mitigating climate change. all companies in the network have signed a climate covenant, setting themselves goals, such as reducing co 2
emissions, improving energy efficiency and developing new services that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.


sponda committed itself to the following goals:


•   the comparable total energy consumption of sponda’s properties will decrease by 10 per cent by 2016.
•   the recycling rate in sponda’s properties will be increased to over 70 per cent by 2014.

property locations
sponda takes environmental considerations into account in deciding on the locations for its property investments. the company’s
properties are in key areas in major cities and in locations accessible by public transportation, which helps reduce the environmental
impacts of the properties.



why is this a priority?

for sponda, the central location of its properties is a key strategic choice: the company’s properties are in key areas in major cities and in
locations with good public transport links. this strategy supports sponda’s commitment to environmental responsibility.


location is also one of the criteria applied in the environmental certification of business properties. the breeam® and leed® certification
processes take into account public transport links, bicycle parking facilities and the building’s energy source, which is also influenced by zoning.



property locations as sponda’s priority

the key aspects of the priority are:

•   taking environmental aspects into account in making decisions on property investments
•   focusing on properties located in cities, accessible by public transportation
•   concentrating on prime areas


sponda's investment strategy is also financially sustainable and responsible. the demand and rental levels for properties in low-risk prime areas
are more stable, even in economically uncertain times. approximately 80 per cent of sponda’s properties are located in these areas. the
investment strategy also supports the comprehensive sustainability of sponda's operations.

objectives and measures
measures taken in 2012

the office building developed by sponda for talentum plc reached rooftop height in 2012. the new building, with a total floor area of nearly
6,000 square metres, is located in helsinki’s ruoholahti district and has excellent public transport links. energy efficiency and environmentally
friendly solutions were emphasised in the design and construction of the office building. sponda will apply for international leed® environmental
certification for the building.


the renovation of the citycenter block in the centre of helsinki was largely completed in 2012. citycenter is sponda’s most significant current
property development project. the project has made the traditional retail block significantly more comfortable, improved pedestrian access and
boosted the appeal of the surrounding area.


sponda completed the modernisation of an office and retail property on hämeenkatu in tampere in 2012. the property is located in the city
centre with good public transport links.


sponda also increased its level of preparedness to commence the ratina shopping centre project in tampere in 2012. if the required advance
occupancy rate is achieved, sponda is prepared to commence construction in summer 2013.



long-term objectives

•   increasing the share of shopping centres and office properties in the company’s property portfolio
•   developing the property portfolio by concentrating on prime areas and locations with good public transport links




enhancing the customer experience
sponda aims to develop interactive long-term partnerships with its customers. positive customer experiences are created by
identifying customer needs and responding to them.

objectives and measures
objectives for 2012

•   activating the customer relations strategy
•   developing the customer experience concerning subcontractors
•   developing customer service centre operations
•   adopting the best service innovations



measures taken in 2012

sponda’s customer relationships work and development is based on the company’s customer experience management strategy. the strategy
defines the customer relations management models and processes for making customer relationships deeper and longer.


sponda continued the implementation of its customer relations strategy in 2012. the company engaged in closer communication with customers
by increasing the number of customer meetings and developing its customer service channels.


the customer experience often begins online, with the customer searching for information on new potential business premises. in recognition of
this, sponda’s customer communications work in 2012 had a particular focus on developing the company’s online services. the extranet
services for customers were expanded and greater activity among the user base was promoted by providing support for service implementation
through the customer service centre.


sponda also increased its activity in social media by opening a facebook page and a live chat service as new customer service channels. the
customer service centre’s services were expanded with regard to internal services, which is communicated to external customers in the form of
faster and more responsive services and an improved customer experience.


property services are an integral part of the customer experience. during the year, sponda audited its subcontractors’ processes and developed
reporting under its subcontractor agreements.


new service innovations to benefit customers

sponda also aimed to improve the customer experience by developing new service innovations. in addition to the facebook live chat service,
examples of new and effectively implemented innovations include the launch of the wwf green office partnership and the piloting of
videoconferencing. both of these services assist sponda’s customers also in implementing their environmental responsibility initiatives.


sponda implemented an interactive process in 2012 to facilitate a more systematic approach to collecting and processing development ideas and
suggestions from employees. the ideas and initiatives may be related to the development of sponda’s own processes, improving the customer
experience, or environmental responsibility.



objectives for 2013

•   developing and measuring operations in line with the customer relations strategy
•   improving the effectiveness of customer communications at sponda-owned properties
•   investing in customer data management (crm system renewal)
•   continuing service innovations

sponda's customer process




building the customer experience begins from the very first meeting between the client and sponda and it continues and develops throughout the
customer relationship. sponda’s expertise helps customers find business premises that are tailored to their unique needs. as business premises
solutions are long-term decisions, the analysis of the client’s needs takes into account the client organisation’s future prospects and objectives.


business premises are tailored to these needs in close cooperation with the client. flexible solutions can be easily adapted as the client’s
operations develop and change.


the customer experience does not end when the right business premises are found. instead, it develops and strengthens throughout the
customer relationship. sponda maintains regular contact with its customers and analyses customer satisfaction annually. the aim is to create
interactive long-term customer relationships.




investing in employees

employee wellbeing and expertise are key success factors for an expert organisation. they are developed through training and good
management.

caring for employees at sponda

the key aspects of the priority are:

•   occupational wellbeing
•   improving expertise
•   internal communications



monitoring job satisfaction

job satisfaction and organisational effectiveness are assessed at sponda on a regular basis through an annual employee survey. the employee
survey aims to analyse employees’ perceptions regarding their jobs, organisational effectiveness, management and commitment. the
respondents are also given the opportunity to express their expectations regarding the development of their jobs and the work community and to
influence the solutions implemented by the company.



personnel development

sponda aims for continuous improvement and learning in all its operations. employees are encouraged to develop themselves and be
independent and active in their own work. common training programmes are arranged for personnel based on the needs arising from sponda's
strategy, customer and stakeholder feedback as well as from performance and appraisal discussions, or personnel may be offered the
opportunity to participate in training outside the company.


sponda's personnel development is guided by the company's customer-focused way of working. appraisal discussions are conducted to ensure
that everyone is aware of the link between one's own job and sponda's strategy and objectives. in addition to performance and appraisal
discussions, personnel development and the achievement of goals are evaluated on the basis of benchmarking, the investments made in
personnel development and employee surveys.



health care and supporting physical fitness and exercise

sponda invests in the wellbeing of its employees in many ways, including by providing comprehensive health services. the aim of sponda's
occupational health care is to prevent illnesses and problems resulting from stress and other work-related psychological factors and to support
work fitness. the goals also include the prevention and early detection of lifestyle diseases and supporting self-care. sponda has a special
wellbeing programme to support the work fitness of employees who have been in working life for a long time.


sponda also looks after occupational health and wellbeing by supporting its employees' physical exercise and cultural activities. employees are
offered company bicycles to encourage them to choose commuting options that provide significant health benefits while also being
environmentally friendly.



rewarding employees

sponda uses an incentive scheme that covers all personnel and is based on both the company's common goals and on personal targets set
specifically for each employee.


for more information on rewards and incentives, please refer to the management and personnel section of this annual report.



equal opportunities

sponda's objective is that employees do not experience any unequal treatment on the basis of gender, age, religion, health or other such factors.
fair and non-discriminatory treatment applies to the entire employment relationship, from recruitment to termination.

objectives and measures
measures taken in 2012

overall results of the personnel survey were extremely good

the annual employee survey was carried out in autumn 2012 to collect information on the respondents' level of satisfaction with their own work,
their workplace, managerial supervision and leadership and the operation of the organisation. the response rate was high at 96 per cent.


the overall results with regard to the personnel satisfaction survey and internal customer relationships were extremely positive compared to the
comparative standards of the survey, just as in previous years. the development wishes that emerged in the study had more to do with
developing the content and organisation of one’s own work than the operation of one’s unit or the company as a whole, which the respondents
were particularly satisfied with.


sponda's employees have a very positive view of the company and are willing to recommend sponda as an employer. based on the results
corporate-level decision-making and change implementation ability are appreciated, there are no disturbing rumours, and the company’s strategy
has been effectively communicated. trust in the top management is solid, and the values and goals are well known and considered worth
pursuing.


based on the survey, sponda’s rewarding system is regarded as fair. also, investments in personnel wellbeing were given an extremely positive
grade. sponda is seen as treating its employees in a fair and equal manner. this is also the best way to ensure equality between male and
female employees.


based on the results analyses, each unit prepares a development plan and the management board chooses broader themes to focus on to
improve further sponda's working atmosphere and operations.


erp system harmonises ways of working

sponda launched an enterprise resource planning (erp) system project in early 2012, aiming to harmonise ways of working, increasing
operational efficiency, support the management of customer accounts and making day-to-day work easier.


the development of the erp system responds to the wish that emerged in the 2011 personnel survey regarding the development of tools and
information systems, and it also supports customer relationship management.


sponda supports personal development

with regard to the development of personnel, particular attention was paid to process management. this development process clarified the
content, key roles and decision-making model of sponda’s strategic processes – customer experience management (cem), purchase and
quality as well as environmental responsibility.


during the year, sponda also launched a survey of personnel potential (management assessment). the survey will be carried out at various
organisational levels, and it is part of the company’s successor planning, which aims to ensure the success of the company in the future as well.


in 2012, there were 2.38 training days per person and training costs accounted for 3.1 per cent of salaries.


all sponda employees participated in performance and appraisal discussions in 2012. in the performance and appraisal discussions, concrete
training and development measures are determined for each employee on the basis of personal development plans to achieve the objectives set
for them.

the feel younger programme was extended to support occupational wellbeing

sponda continued the feel younger through better physical fitness programme focused on physical exercise in 2012. participants’ physical age
and body composition was measured at the beginning and end of the programme. the programme also offered tailored guidance for those who
are physically active.


all programme participants were instructed on preparing a personal exercise programme and a nutrition programme that supports the
achievement of the goals. the aims of the programme included the prevention of health problems caused by sedentary work and stress.


an interactive process for handling suggestions and ideas from employees

in accordance with the goals set for 2012, an interactive process was developed and deployed for the processing of employees’ development
ideas during the year. employees can submit initiatives electronically to intranet's innobox, and the initiatives and ideas received are reviewed
monthly in the inno team, comprised of the management and employees’ representatives. all ideas are also relayed to sponda’s executive
board.


the company’s operations are improved with the help of the ideas and initiatives. ideas for the development of internal processes were the most
frequently submitted. small everyday measures that improve occupational wellbeing were also frequently suggested. in addition, employees’
increasing interest in environmental responsibility could be seen in a large number of ideas. employees can be rewarded for significant ideas that
are implemented.



objectives for 2013

•   tools are developed to better support the work of the personnel and the attainment of objectives
•   the working environment is developed together with the personnel so that it will better support their work and assist in reaching the company’s
    goals

the scope of the report
description of the report

the annual report and the spondability section on corporate responsibility contain general information about sponda’s financial, social and
environmental operations between 1 january and 31 december 2012, unless otherwise indicated.



scope of reporting

sponda reported on its corporate responsibility for the second time according to the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri). the gri
3.1 reporting framework is used in reporting. additionally, the real estate and construction industry-oriented construction and real estate sector
supplement (cress) reporting guideline, which was published in autumn of 2011, has been applied in reporting. for the part of the cress
directive, the cre indicators related to the real estate sector in particular were reported on where applicable.


in addition to the gri framework, certain portions of the report also comply with the european public real estate association’s epra criteria,
which are taken into account separately in connection with the gri index. sponda’s consolidated financial statements are compiled according
to the ifrs (international financial reporting standards). in some respects, the report also complies with the oecd's guidelines for
multinational enterprises.


the corporate responsibility report has not been assured by an external assurance provider. sponda has self-declared its reporting to be
application level c.



structure of the report

sponda’s report is divided into three sections:


•   the responsible property investment discusses the strategic significance of responsibility for sponda.
•   sponda’s approach to corporate responsibility and the company’s responsibility-related priorities are described in the sponda’s responsibility
    priorities section.
•   a chart showing the correspondence between the gri guidelines and sponda’s reporting can be found in the gri index.



scope of the report and data collection

the figures which appear in the report are based on the figures of sponda’s finland operations, unless otherwise indicated. figures for the
company’s subsidiaries are mentioned separately. unless otherwise indicated, there have been no changes in the scope or method of calculation
of the reporting principles.


the figures for environmental responsibility are based on sponda’s properties located in finland, from which data is collected regarding energy
and water consumption and waste management. there is a certain degree of annual variability in sponda’s property holdings due to sales and
purchases, which affects the comparability of the annual environment figures.


approaches to managing financial, social or environmental responsibility are not discussed separately in the report.



earlier reports

the previous spondability report was published as a part of sponda’s annual report in february 2011. sponda reports on its progress in terms of
responsibility each year.


no changes have been made to the information reported in previous years in the 2012 report, unless otherwise indicated.
