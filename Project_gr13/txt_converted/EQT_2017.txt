about this report




bridging growth & success
g4-28, g4-29, g4-30, g4-31

eqt corporation (eqt or company) is pleased to share our sixth annual corporate social responsibility report, published in
accordance with the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 core option guidelines. this year’s theme — “bridging growth & success”
— emphasizes how we have consciously developed our natural gas production (eqt) and pipeline (eqt midstream partners)
businesses during the past 10 years, to become a top five natural gas producer in the united states as of december 31, 2016.

this year’s report highlights eqt’s management approach and performance in the environmental, social, and economic topics that
matter most to our stakeholders — including specific disclosures required by gri’s oil and gas sector supplement (ogss). in
covering the topics prioritized in the course of our recent materiality assessment, the company chose to focus on the most relevant
g4 indicators for each topic. to further demonstrate eqt’s commitment to transparency, this report also covers many governance
and ethics disclosures from gri’s comprehensive option. throughout this report, g4 and ogss indicator flags identify specific gri
content for ease of reference and correspond with the disclosures listed in the gri content index.

this report includes activities occurring january 1, 2016 to december 31, 2016 at eqt headquarters and at all locations of eqt’s
business segments, which as of december 31, 2016, include eqt production, eqt gathering, and eqt transmission. data utilized
in prior reports for the eqt midstream business segment is now included with the eqt gathering and eqt transmission business
segments. the eqt gathering and eqt transmission report data includes the operations of eqt midstream partners, lp (eqm) —
a publicly traded limited partnership formed by eqt in 2012 to own, operate, acquire, and develop midstream assets in the

a publicly traded limited partnership formed by eqt in 2012 to own, operate, acquire, and develop midstream assets in the
appalachian basin. also included are the financial and operating results of eqt gp holdings, lp (eqgp), a publicly traded limited
partnership created by eqt in 2015 to own the company’s eqm partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights in
eqm. due to eqt’s ownership of eqm and eqgp, unless otherwise noted, discussions in this report regarding the gathering and
transmission segments’ business, operations, and results include business, operations, and results from eqt, eqgp, and eqm.

in october 2016, eqt announced a ceo transition that was expected to occur in march 2017; therefore, this year’s report includes
a letter from current ceo steven schlotterbeck, the presiding ceo when this report was prepared. our last report, “sustainable
performance responsible growth,” was published in september 2016 and is available here on eqt’s website. for any questions

reflecting on 2016
                                                 g4-1

                                                 dear stakeholders,

                                                 eqt corporation has a long­standing history in the appalachian basin. throughout
                                                 our company’s nearly 130 years of natural gas operations, we have demonstrated
                                                 our commitment to the communities in which we work by engaging our valued
                                                 stakeholders, preserving and protecting the environment, ensuring our contractors
                                                 and employees remain focused on safety at all times, and being transparent in our
                                                 communications. this is eqt's sixth consecutive corporate social responsibility
                                                 report produced under the global reporting initiative (gri) guidelines and the first
                                                 during my tenure as ceo. i am proud to lead a company with such a strong
                                                 commitment to sustainability. we understand that actively managing the effects of
                                                 our activities drives continuous improvement, enabling us to learn every step of the
                                                 way. this year’s report theme, bridging growth & success, naturally grew out of
                                                 the collaboration between our production and midstream business units, and is
                                                 also a nod to our western pennsylvania heritage. as we continue to promote cross­
                                                 functional operations, we are better positioned to innovate and become leaders in
                                                 our industry.

our commitment to sustainability positively affects our employees, as well as the numerous communities and natural environments
where our daily operations take place. as we streamline processes and promote efficient operating practices, we also work hard to
help improve and sustain communities, to minimize our environmental footprint, and to deliver shareholder value. innovative ideas,
engagements with local communities, and partnerships with collaborative environmental groups inspire and support our
sustainability efforts.

we experienced significant change in 2016 through the strategic, focused work of the entire eqt team. despite facing pricing
challenges, production sales volume was 26% higher than in 2015. we are very proud to have become a top five natural gas
producer — fourth in the united states and first in appalachia — in 2016 and have every intention to maintain that status far into the
future. to that end, our consolidation strategy has promoted sustainable growth through contiguous acreage acquisitions that
complement our existing footprint. in fact, in 2016, we increased our marcellus acreage position by acquiring approximately 145,500
net acres. these acquisitions will lead to more efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly development in southwestern
pennsylvania and northern west virginia.



as we continue to promote cross­functional operations, we are better
positioned to innovate and become leaders in our industry.

in march 2016, our appalachian basin operations received certification from the center for responsible shale development (crsd)
upon passing a rigorous evaluation and verification process — confirming that our appalachian operations are in conformance with
all 15 of crsd’s performance standards for air, climate, water, and waste management. finally, we achieved our lowest
occupational safety & health administration recordable injury rate and lowest preventable vehicle accident rate in more than 10
years — reinforcing our commitment to safety and setting the bar high to maintain safe operations.

looking forward, we will remain committed to safety, operational improvements, and increased collaboration and transparency.
while we continue to strategically expand, we will incorporate lessons learned and best practices into new operations. we are
excited to continue “building bridges” as we adapt and grow as a company. on behalf of eqt, thank you for the opportunity to share
our commitment as a responsible natural gas exploration, production, and transmission company with you.

  about this report



stakeholder engagement




reaching out to our stakeholders
g4-24, g4-25, g4-26, g4-27

eqt’s stakeholders — those most interested in, and affected by, the company’s operations — provide a valuable perspective. as an
organization committed to responsible operations, eqt monitors stakeholder interests specific to the company and to the broader
natural gas industry. we engage with stakeholders as part of our continuous improvement efforts rather than for reporting purposes.

many of eqt’s stakeholders share similar, broad­based concerns about the natural gas industry overall; however, select individual
groups may have specific concerns about the manner in which we conduct our business operations. although stakeholder areas of
interest or concern vary widely, eqt believes in maintaining open and honest dialogue with our stakeholders, as we have for
decades.

experience and ongoing dialogue enable us to develop specific response methods to meet stakeholders’ diverse expectations and
preferred engagement methods. the table below illustrates eqt’s integrated engagement strategies and frequencies for each
stakeholder group — and provides links to our management approach and performance for each topic covered in this report.

  about this report



key topics & boundary




our process
g4-18

early in 2017, eqt conducted a materiality assessment to strategically guide our sustainability reporting. this assessment used the
global reporting initiative (gri) steps of identification, prioritization, and validation to define the environmental, social, and
governance topics most critical to the company and our external stakeholders. throughout this report, eqt uses the gri definition
of “material” to reference topics that reflect the company’s significant economic, environmental, and social impacts; or that
substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. eqt did not use the u.s. securities and exchange
commission’s concept of materiality within the context of this report.

to first identify a universe of relevant topics, we benchmarked peer reports, regulatory and industry trends, reporting frameworks,
and other stakeholder­related sources. we prioritized these topics by conducting interviews with leaders of eqt’s business units and
functional groups, as well as analyzing internal financial documents and peer, investor, community, regulatory, industry association,
and media documents for evidence to support the relative importance of each topic. a customized weighting process demonstrated
the importance of each source. our corporate communications team validated the customized weighting and topics most critical for
eqt to manage and report.

although we will continue to monitor and manage all topics raised through the assessment, this report focuses on the 11 highest
ranking or “material” topics shown below, plus the topics of climate strategy and technological innovation, which we also believe
are important to our stakeholders.

definition of the indicator, as well as a list of the interested or impacted stakeholder groups. for this assessment, topic boundaries
described as “internal” include all subsidiaries of eqt corporation. further, the stakeholder groups affected by “external” topic

about eqt




overview & locations
g4-3, g4-5, g4-6, g4-7, g4-9, g4-13

eqt corporation (nyse: eqt) is a standard & poor’s 500 investor­owned energy corporation operating in the united states of
america. the company’s history reaches back to the late 1800s, enabling us to demonstrate a long­standing record of integrity,
experience, innovation, and sustainability in our operations.

headquartered in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, eqt operates only within the united states, as all foreign subsidiaries are inactive. with
1,809 employees as of december 31, 2016, the company generated a net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2016. as described in our 2016
form 10­k, eqt corporation conducts business through three business segments: eqt production, eqt gathering, and eqt
transmission. eqt midstream partners, lp (eqm) and eqt gp holdings (eqgp) are both limited partnerships formed by eqt
corporation; therefore, all discussions in this report regarding any of these segments or entities will be disclosed as eqt, unless
otherwise noted. for more information about our products (as defined by gri), see markets & products.

in 2016, eqt made no significant changes to our locations, operations, supply chain, or relationships with suppliers. however,
during the year, we successfully completed several noteworthy business transactions:

   eqt expanded its marcellus acreage position by acquiring approximately 145,500 net acres located in northern west virginia and
   southwestern pennsylvania.

   the ohio valley connector (ovc) — a 37­mile pipeline from northern west virginia to clarington, ohio — began offering service
   on october 1, 2016. the ovc is certified to provide approximately 850 bbtu per day of transmission capacity.
   eqt sold the allegheny valley connector and select gathering and storage assets in southwestern pennsylvania and northern
   west virginia to eqm.

the assessment and management of sustainability risks and opportunities is part of the day­to­day operations of each company.
the public policy and corporate responsibility committee of the eqt board of directors provides oversight for many aspects of
sustainability risks and opportunities for eqt and the actions taken to address these issues. the eqgp and eqm boards of
directors provide similar oversight for their respective companies, as appropriate.

g4-40

the eqt corporate governance committee identifies and recommends to the eqt board requisite skills and characteristics for
individuals to serve as eqt directors. the committee identifies potential director candidates through many sources, including third­
party search firms and unsolicited shareholder submissions to identify potential director candidates. all eqt directors stand for
election by shareholders annually. for more information on eqt’s nomination and selection process, see pages 27–28 of eqt’s
2017 proxy statement. eqgp and eqm directors are appointed by eqt, and unitholders are not entitled to elect the directors of the
respective general partners. for more information regarding the selection of eqgp and eqm directors, see paragraph 5(a) of the
eqgp and eqm corporate governance guidelines.

g4-41

eqt, eqgp, and eqm disclose conflicts of interest to stakeholders as required by law. eqt and eqgp/eqm’s codes of business
conduct and ethics outline our policy to avoid conflicts of interest, and we also have a conflicts of interest policy. eqt maintains a
majority of independent directors and our corporate governance committee monitors related persons transactions. there are no
compensation committee interlocks involving eqt, eqgp, or eqm directors. for more information about processes regarding
related persons transactions, see:

   pages 30–32 of eqt’s 2017 proxy statement
   pages 130–132 of eqgp’s 2016 form 10­k; a list of certain relationships and related transactions begins on page 124
   pages 126–128 of eqm’s 2016 form 10­k; a list of certain relationships and related transactions begins on page 120




sustainability & risk management
g4-35, g4-36

at eqt, eqgp, and eqm, the respective boards delegate authority for select economic, environmental, and social topics to the
ceo, who reports directly to the board. the ceo delegates some of these authorities to senior management, based upon their
established roles and responsibilities within the company. these senior managers report to the ceo and often present updates to
each board regarding the economic, environmental, and social risks and opportunities facing the company. they also review the
company’s performance in managing the impacts of these activities.

g4-42, g4-45, g4-46

in addition to general oversight of the business and affairs of the applicable entity, the boards of eqt, eqgp, and eqm also perform
specific functions, which are set forth in paragraph 2 of their respective corporate governance guidelines
(eqt, eqgp, eqm). these include:

   oversight of succession planning for the ceo and other key officers
   review, approval, and monitoring of fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions
   reviewing the process for assessing major risks facing the company and options for mitigation
   confirming that processes are in place that are reasonably designed to maintain the integrity of the company’s financial
   statements, promote compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the company and its directors, officers and employees,
   and sustain good relationships with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders

the eqt, eqgp, and eqm boards are responsible for reviewing the process for assessing the major risks facing their respective
companies and the related risk mitigation options. for the eqt board, these responsibilities include:

   performing an annual review of the company’s major risks
   addressing major risks with management via presentations (initiated by management or requested by the board) throughout the
   year
   delegating oversight for certain risks to the board committees

additionally, the eqt, eqgp, and eqm audit committees each review their respective company’s major risk exposures and key
processes implemented to monitor and control such exposures. when making decisions on behalf of the applicable company, the
eqt, eqgp, and eqm boards each consider the feedback provided by their respective stakeholders.

g4-43, g4-44

upon selection, eqt, eqgp, and eqm directors receive an initial orientation to board service. additionally, the directors of each
company routinely receive information from management to educate them about company business, including related economic,
environmental, and social topics. directors of eqt, eqgp, and eqm are encouraged to participate in additional educational
programs, participation of which is funded or reimbursed by the associated company.

the eqt, eqgp, and eqm boards and committees use performance assessments to evaluate how well they are fulfilling their
governance responsibilities. the eqt board and its committees conduct annual self­assessments and each director, in a discussion
with the eqt lead independent director, provides feedback regarding individual director performance. at eqgp and eqm, the
board and audit committee also conduct annual self­assessments. although the boards do not disclose publicly the actions taken in
response to their annual self­assessments, they take the assessment process seriously and each board responds appropriately to
the results to improve overall governance performance.

communicating with the board
g4-37, g4-49, g4-50, g4-53

to achieve sustainable performance for shareholders, employees, customers, and communities, the boards of eqt, eqgp, and
eqm are committed to overseeing their companies with integrity, accountability, and transparency. they welcome input on how they
are doing, and each organization provides stakeholders multiple ways to communicate with their governing body.

the eqt lead independent director, eqgp presiding director, and eqm presiding director are the key points of contact for
concerns or inquiries at their respective boards. other avenues for contacting the boards of eqt, eqgp, and eqm include:

  each company’s corporate secretary, chief investor relations officer, management team, and respective websites
  the eqt compliance hotline
  traditional written correspondence

communications may be made anonymously or confidentially.

while eqt, eqgp, and eqm do not have systems in place to track the concerns communicated to their boards of directors, eqt
has conducted a formal shareholder engagement program since 2010 and we maintain active dialogue with our shareholders year­
round. through our investor relations program, senior executives hold meetings with eqt, eqm, and/or eqgp investors or potential
investors to discuss operations, strategy, and other critical items. executives from the compensation and governance functions also
meet with interested shareholders to discuss the company’s pay structure and governance. time is also devoted to answering
shareholder questions and taking suggestions for changes.

in 2016, we held more than 900 investor meetings. the results of the meetings are reviewed with the ceo, corporate governance
committee, and the management development and compensation committee. in response to the feedback recorded in these
meetings, eqt:

g4-51, g4-52

eqt independent director compensation — including descriptions of cash, equity­based, and other compensation — as well as
related processes are outlined on pages 33–35 in eqt’s 2017 proxy statement. annually, the corporate governance committee
reviews and the eqt board approves the compensation.

eqgp non­employee director compensation, including descriptions of cash, equity­based compensation, and other related
processes, are outlined on pages 119–120 of the eqgp 2016 form 10­k. annually, the eqgp board reviews and approves the
compensation of its non­employee directors.

eqm non­employee director compensation, including descriptions of cash, equity­based compensation, and other related processes,
are outlined on pages 115–116 of the eqm 2016 form 10­k. annually, the eqm board reviews and approves the compensation of
its non­employee directors.

the management development and compensation committee of the eqt board establishes the target total direct compensation for
executive officers by establishing base salaries, setting long­term and annual incentive targets, and approving perquisites. the
committee approves annual and long­term incentive programs on a yearly basis, with recommendations from management and an
independent compensation consultant. for more information regarding executive compensation practices, see pages 23–25 of
eqt’s 2017 proxy statement. additionally, pages 39–90 describe the executive compensation program and performance.

eqt has a compensation recoupment, or “clawback,” policy applicable to executive officers if the company is required to prepare an
accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting mandate under u.s. securities law. the policy
authorizes the company to recoup certain compensation from covered executives who received equity or non­equity incentive
compensation.

  about eqt



ethics & integrity at eqt




doing the right thing
g4-56

at eqt, we believe that the maintenance and enhancement of our good reputation is dependent upon the conduct of each individual
employee. we communicate our expectations for responsible and ethical conduct to all eqt employees and vendors through our
codes of business conduct and ethics — for eqt and eqm/eqgp. these codes act as guides and resources related to personal
responsibilities, compliance with law, and the use of good judgement while working on behalf of the company. they cover such
topics as environment, health and safety, avoiding conflicts of interest, communicating and cooperating with regulators and
investigations, and honest and ethical dealing. to ensure that our codes reflect the ever­changing work environment and legal and
regulatory landscape, we update them regularly in conjunction with subject matter experts. senior management at eqt, egqp, and
eqm approve changes to the codes.

we require all new employees to receive in­person compliance and ethics training during orientation, in addition to an online training
regarding the codes of business conduct and ethics and other compliance and ethics topics appropriate for their work
responsibilities. additionally, all employees annually certify as to their continued understanding and compliance with our codes and
related policies.

g4-57, g4-58

although our codes of business conduct and ethics provide strong guidance for our employees and vendors, they cannot be all
inclusive. to provide an additional resource for advice about ethical and lawful behavior, we established the compliance network,
which consists of senior­level employees from internal audit, employee relations, governance and enterprise risk, and
environment and safety. the compliance network also serves as a means for employees to report misconduct. employees may
also report misconduct to their supervisor or through a nationally recognized independent service provider that hosts our 24/7 eqt
compliance hotline. a third way for employees and stakeholders to express concerns is directly to the board of directors of eqt,
eqgp, and eqm via each organization’s website. we do not currently track the number of requests for advice, the request
descriptions, or level of satisfaction for those using the advice mechanisms.

economic impact
eqt contributes to the u.s. and local economies via job creation, providing access to cleaner, affordable domestic energy, and
through innovating and improving our processes to enhance resource efficiency. as we work to better understand our economic
impact, we will continue engaging with our communities to further develop solutions that support them, and will seek new
opportunities to contribute to thriving economies.

this year’s report also covers the topics of climate strategy and technological innovation, which we believe are important subjects
to various stakeholder audiences within the natural gas industry.

indirect economic impacts




  indirect economic impacts

  topic definition
  contributing to sustainable growth of the u.s. economy and the communities where eqt operates and sells its products through job creation, tax revenue
  generation, and access to affordable domestic energy.


  why managing it matters
  eqt's operations have a significant influence on the local economies where we operate by supporting economic growth via job creation and tax revenue
  generation. intentional management of our positive impacts enables us to build strong relationships with our communities and lessen the united states’ reliance
  on foreign energy.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt tracks the indirect economic impacts of our business operations to better understand and communicate how our operations
positively contribute to the economy. we annually commission an independent analysis of the direct and indirect economic impacts
of our activities on both local and u.s. economies. in 2016, fti consulting, inc. analyzed our year­end 2016 data and compiled the
results into a study entitled, “economic benefits of eqt corporation’s 2016 investment and operations activities.”

supporting national & local economies
as a domestic energy company, eqt provides abundant, easily accessible, affordable natural gas to the united states, lessening
the country’s reliance on other nations for energy. this reduces overall energy prices and helps to increase national security.

we also generate revenue for the communities and states where we live and work through job and wealth creation. our operations
— all in the u.s. — support local economies via taxes paid, road infrastructure improvements, local hiring of personnel, and through
use and support of local service establishments. we also provide millions of dollars in royalty payments to our mineral owners and
sustain local jobs for employees, direct contractors, and suppliers to support our daily operational activities.

supporting local & diverse suppliers
our board of directors and management team support a strategic sourcing approach in which we seek out small and diverse local
suppliers whenever possible. we consider diverse suppliers as those that are certified minority business enterprises (mbe),
women’s business enterprises (wbe), or veteran owned businesses (vob). we identify these suppliers through collaboration with
regional and national councils such as the african american chamber of commerce of western pennsylvania and the national
minority supplier development council. we also work with coalitions such as the women’s business enterprise national council.

further, we encourage our top vendors to consider diverse subcontractors, as it helps these businesses develop relevant experience
and expand business opportunities that may not be directly possible with eqt. our targeted procurement initiatives include:

   encouraging top suppliers to seek out and include diverse businesses as part of their proposed solution
   giving greater consideration to vendors who complete and submit a subcontracting document with their proposal identifying
   where and how they will utilize diverse vendors as part of the bidding process
   conducting meetings with our top contractors to provide supplier diversity education, outline reporting requirements for
   subcontracting with diverse suppliers, and identify specific products purchased by the top contractors to help align them with
   diverse firms selling those products
   tracking diverse vendor usage by asking our top contractors to provide their monthly spend with diverse subcontractors and local
   suppliers

we also work with our current local and diverse suppliers to identify opportunities to expand their scope of service. this directly
boosts the local economy through job growth and business expansion.




our performance
g4-ec8

national economy
according to fti consulting, inc.’s analysis, we provided $4.6 billion in value­added contributions to the u.s. gross domestic
product (gdp). of this $4.6 billion in economic benefits:

   35.4% of contributions occurred in six states where eqt operates
   64.6% of contributions related to out­of­state suppliers that provided goods and services for operational activities in eqt’s
   operating area

labor impacts
in addition to eqt’s own employees, we supported 32,400 ancillary jobs across our operations in 2016. this includes direct
contractors, suppliers, and supply chain employees that support our production, gathering, and transmission activities. our activities
generated an average labor income for employees, direct contractors, and suppliers that met or exceeded u.s. median household
income of $56,515 in 2016.

local procurement
g4-ec9

in 2016, we spent 80% of our procurement budget on suppliers physically located in or near the city or state where our activities take
place. we sponsored or participated in outreach events to target local and diverse suppliers including:

   regional matchmaker events, designed to connect diverse suppliers with corporations for potential business opportunities. in
   addition to direct participation, eqt encourages our top suppliers to attend and participate in one­on­one meetings with diverse
   vendors.
   education sessions on supplier diversity in the natural gas industry, where eqt shares our experience and best practices
   promoting the use of local and diverse businesses.

climate strategy




  climate strategy

  topic definition
  addressing current and potential regulations on greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, the increasing market demand for renewable energy sources, and the
  potential impacts of the changing climate on eqt’s operations.


  why managing it matters
  as the effects of climate change on our planet become increasingly apparent, the potential for regulation and the demand for lower­carbon energy are
  increasing. eqt must remain informed and proactive while upholding a responsibility to provide cleaner energy alternatives.




our approach
g4-dma

current legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions are in various phases
of discussion or implementation. eqt keeps abreast of these measures to remain compliant and understand how they may affect
our operations. for more information about climate­related legislation and our company, see pages 17–18 in our 2016 form 10­k.

climate change policy
eqt is developing a policy on climate change strategy, which will outline our position on climate change economic policies. as more
regulations are adopted to moderate climate change, eqt understands the benefits of developing a strategy to address the
ramifications of the regulations adopted. the development of a climate change policy that addresses potential legislation will benefit
the company by ensuring both regulatory compliance and preparedness to meet future ghg emission requirements.

emissions reduction
eqt strives to continuously improve equipment and operating systems in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which, in turn,
increases overall efficiency. we work to improve our processes in response to and in advance of regulatory change — via emissions
reduction technologies — to minimize our impact on climate change. quantifying and managing ghg emissions protects the
environment, while also minimizing regulatory risk. eqt is confident in its current air quality management, however, we must
continue to anticipate potential climate change regulations and be prepared for future compliance challenges. for more information
on our processes and operational emissions, see the technological innovation and energy & ghg emissions sections of this report.

technological innovation




  technological innovation

  topic definition
  incorporating innovation into eqt’s business strategy to increase operational efficiencies and reduce costs in a safer and more environmentally conscious
  manner.


  why managing it matters
  eqt’s commitment to innovation allows us to maintain our position as a leader in the use of advanced horizontal drilling technology — designed to minimize the
  impact of drilling­related activities and reduce our overall environmental footprint.




our approach
g4-dma

our commitment to innovation enables eqt to adapt to the fluctuating commodity price of natural gas, changes in the regulatory
environment, and advances in technology. innovation creates efficient, cost­effective processes that increase production and
improve the safety and environmental impact of our operations. our dedication to technological innovation will help us maintain our
status as a top five natural gas producer in the united states.

we strongly encourage innovation throughout the organization, as it is fundamental to every aspect of our operations. all employees
are assessed on eqt’s core competencies — including innovation — in formalized, annual self­assessments.

governance
in 2014, eqt established a formalized innovation group. our senior managers of internal and external innovation lead their
respective innovation teams. these leaders and their teams report to our corporate director of tax planning and innovation, who in
turn reports directly to the eqt senior vice president and chief financial officer. we evaluate and enhance our innovation program
based on feedback from our year­end employee surveys, and we share the results of this survey, as well as a year­end recap of the
program, with eqt’s management team. we will continue to expand the innovation program across the organization through 2017.

innovation processes
we use two separate processes for our internal and external innovation management. our specialized innovation management
software platform enables us to collect and analyze innovative ideas from employees. any eqt employee or group of employees
can submit an idea through this platform to improve a process or apply a researched technology. we route the ideas to a
governance committee for review, then invite the employee or group to present a formal pitch of the idea and business plan. if
accepted, we use a standard stage gate process to pilot the innovation and implement it if successful. this process empowers our
employees by providing a vehicle for them to contribute ideas.

our external innovation group manages our external processes; they assess and screen new technologies and startup service
companies that could prove useful in eqt’s operations. we then take companies and technologies deemed valuable to the
appropriate internal business group for evaluation, testing, and eventual implementation into operations contingent on viability.



innovation creates efficient, cost­effective processes that increase
production and improve the safety and environmental impact of our
operations.

innovative thinking for solutions
coaches within the internal innovation group, trained in design thinking, lead sessions to help employees use alternative human­
centered, design­oriented thinking and tools for solutions to identify problems. we use these tools and “innovative thinking” skills
learned from our design coaches to address eqt’s impact on the communities in which we work. each year, we prioritize two or
three organizational opportunities and launch an “innovation challenge” to encourage employees to identify creative solutions. we
choose teams with the best solutions to present to peers and the governance committee. we invite all finalists to dine with the
executive team, and the winning team receives a trophy. eqt allocates specific funds and resources to advance the winning idea to
a pilotable solution.




our performance
over the past two years, winning ideas from the innovation challenge have focused on how to optimize return­to­pad drilling,
reducing time from well staking to turn­in­line, and how eqt can operate more safely and efficiently in more densely populated
areas. we evaluated the implementation of two ideas for safer urban drilling locations in 2016, which included:

   a proposal to explore technology that might be implemented to reduce the audio footprint of our operations without impacting the
   operations themselves
   a data­driven social media strategy, powered by cognitive computing technology, to:
      comb social media content for early identification of specific community concerns
      identify and assess threats from activist groups
      generate effective social media content to proactively engage stakeholders and dispel myths of detractors
      measure our “social license to operate” using community feedback


in 2016, we implemented 45 out of the 133 innovation ideas submitted.

we began our external innovation program at the end of 2015 and evaluated only five external innovation opportunities — or
technologies relevant to the production business unit — that year. in 2016, we evaluated 117 opportunities. in 2017, we will begin
evaluating innovation submissions for our gathering and transmission operations. going forward, we hope to extend our tracking
beyond program participation and the number of ideas generated to capture total value created by these innovative project ideas.

in the workplace
eqt relies on talent with a broad range of skills, as the components of our operations vary widely. we aim to attract top talent from a
variety of backgrounds and provide growth opportunities for our current employees to create a positive and supportive work
environment.

we hold the safety of our employees to the highest standard by providing guidelines, trainings, and preventive measures on
workplace safety. our environment, health, and safety (ehs) policy, updated in april of 2017, underscores the principles that will
guide us toward superior ehs performance. as we grow and adapt as a company, we will continue to seek, support, and protect our
employees — our number one asset.

occupational health & safety




  occupational health & safety

  topic definition
  ensuring safe working conditions, supplying personal protective equipment, and providing resources to maintain and improve employees’ and contractors’
  physical and emotional health.


  why managing it matters
  our workers — employees and contractors alike — deserve to return home safely at the end of each day. further, safeguarding the health and welfare of eqt’s
  workers contributes to the success and longevity of the company.




our approach
g4-dma

safety is eqt’s number one priority, and we are committed to achieving superior performance. we will provide a safe and healthful
workplace for our employees and contractors and, through continuous improvement, will work to create and maintain a zero­injury
culture. we will not compromise safety to gain a business advantage.

governance
g4-la5


every worker — regardless of title or work responsibilities — has the
full authority and responsibility to stop any unsafe work activity.

eqt conducts our active business operations in accordance with the applicable health and safety requirements established by the
u.s. occupational safety and health administration (osha) and other regulatory bodies. as we continue striving to improve, we
work to integrate proper safety and health practices into the company’s operations.

the deputy general counsel, environmental, safety, and public policy implements and manages our health and safety programs.
eqt personnel conduct quarterly meetings with the company’s executive safety council to review safety issues, monitor trends,
and provide direction to enhance overall performance.

employees play a critical role in making sure that their co­workers return home safely each day. as part of the company’s overall
corporate social responsibility performance objective, which is an annual metric, all employees have an individual ‘workplace safety’
performance objective.

further, every worker — regardless of title or work responsibilities — has the full authority and responsibility to stop any unsafe work
activity.

eqt encourages employees to communicate with management about issues or initiatives that could help improve overall
performance, removing the need to establish formal joint management­employee committees. however, some safety committees do
exist throughout the organization. for example, within the midstream business unit, the field safety technician program enables
employees to take greater ownership of their own personal safety as well as demonstrate safety leadership to co­workers. the
program also enables employees to identify and prevent situations that could cause harm to themselves or those around them.

environment, health, & safety policy
to emphasize the importance of occupational health and safety, eqt’s environment, health, and safety (ehs) policy underscores
the principles that will guide us toward superior ehs performance. health and safety highlights from our policy include:

   eqt will provide and foster leadership to ensure all employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and that all
   employees are provided with the training and support necessary to integrate ehs principles into their work.
   we will manage our business to prevent incidents that could result in harm to people, communities, property, or the environment.
   we will commit the resources necessary for successful implementation of our ehs policy.


safety training
g4-la8

training, risk mitigation, and performance monitoring form the core of eqt’s workplace safety initiatives. since eqt does not have
any agreements with trade unions, no formal labor agreements define specific health and safety training topics. instead, every eqt
employee receives core safety training annually, along with more frequent specialized training tailored to the work performed and the
types of issues faced. eqt customizes specialized training subjects and delivery methods as needed. for example, monthly safety
meetings held with field employees cover issues such as:

   personal protective equipment
  stop work authority
  incident investigation
  safe driving
  industry specific technical safety training

contractor safety
our safety focus includes the numerous contract workers who perform work at eqt — both in the field and in the office. to ensure
that our job sites remain safe, every company providing contract workers must mirror eqt’s commitment to safety. we expect each
contractor (and its subcontractors and agents) to adhere to eqt’s relevant policies, as well as all applicable laws and regulatory
requirements for health, safety, employment, and other human rights as established for employers operating within the united
states.

eqt relies on isnetworld® — an industry recognized platform for monitoring safety metrics and performance — to prequalify
contractors before they obtain authorization to begin work for eqt. the isnetworld® database provides vital information regarding
a contractor’s performance in the following key areas:

   safety management systems
   injury and illness statistics
   department of transportation (dot) inspection compliance
   dot motor carrier safety rating
   written safety programs and safety training
   experience modification rating
   fatality history

a contractor expecting to perform services in drilling, construction, maintenance, or other operation­related activities must pass the
prequalification process and must agree to adhere to eqt’s contractor safety standard and safe work rules. these safety
requirements apply to all work performed by the contractor’s employees and the employees of their subcontractors or agents.
existing contractors who fail to meet the rules and standards cannot continue to work on an eqt job site.

we deeply regret that an employee of one of eqt’s contractors was fatally injured during a one­vehicle public highway incident in
2016. this incident was thoroughly investigated and eqt is aggressively pursuing steps to prevent a similar incident.

in 2017, eqt plans to refine its contractor safety management program to facilitate improved contractor safety incident performance:

   track contractor safety statistic incident rates (injury and preventable vehicle accidents), in addition to the review of the self­
   reported information provided by contractors in the isnetworld® database.
   incorporate a contractor safety auditing process within eqt’s contractor safety qualification program.




our performance
g4-la6

eqt closely monitors our health and safety performance, challenges, and statistics to ensure safe worksites; proper employee
training and motivation to work safely; and the continuous identification and evaluation of opportunities to improve.

when a safety incident does occur, eqt records the nature of the event as prescribed by the osha injury/illness recordkeeping
guidelines. after each incident, we also conduct a thorough incident review with senior management to clarify possible causes,
identify options to prevent recurrences, and highlight opportunities to improve training, processes, and procedures.

during 2016, the most frequently recorded injury and incident types involved employees working outdoors. insect bites, slip/trip/fall
incidents, and struck­by incidents (such as hand tool use) were the most commonly observed incidents. with expanded training, risk
assessment, and other preventive measures, eqt experienced a decline in osha­recordable incidents, restricted duty incidents,
lost­time accidents, and preventable vehicle accidents in 2016. as part of our continuous improvement efforts, refinement of the
training and incident management programs is helping to guide eqt towards ongoing, sustainable incident improvement. for
example, the rate of company vehicles striking stationary objects declined significantly after we implemented mandatory supervisor
observations of new and experienced drivers. with this new practice in place, the rate remained fairly constant, increasing only
slightly in 2016.

attraction & retention




  attraction & retention

  topic definition
  attracting high­caliber workers, including local talent; providing professional development opportunities; promoting diversity and inclusion; and developing
  strategies for retaining and engaging employees.


  why managing it matters
  eqt’s reputation as a responsible steward of our operating communities and as a leader in natural gas drilling technology and transportation influences
  potential and current employees. therefore, we are committed to diversity and inclusion, training and growth opportunities for our employees, and a robust
  compensation and benefits program to support them.




our approach
g4-dma

at eqt, we understand that our success depends on our ability to attract and retain unique and committed talent. we use an
analytical approach to hire and retain the best workers possible, as they are the driving force of our company. to maintain a strong
workforce, we leverage diversity and provide professional development and robust benefits to create a positive, productive working
environment.

recruitment & retention
our hiring process is overseen by eqt’s vice president and chief human resources officer and run by our corporate director,
talent acquisition. we review and evaluate our employment and diversity and inclusion programs on a regular basis. during these
evaluations, we ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and assess whether our programs remain competitive with
the external labor market. when reviewing a program, we consider:

  feedback from exit interviews
  input from internal employee resource groups (erg)
  annual employee engagement surveys
  turnover rate
  internal assessments of diversity representation
  internal assessments of compensation and benefit plans
  benchmarking peer companies in the natural gas industry

our management team reviews these evaluations and may adjust existing programs or develop plans to address any areas of
concern that arise.

training & performance reviews
g4-la9, g4-la10

enhancing the skills and knowledge of our current workforce through trainings, degree programs, and detailed performance reviews
provides our employees with the foundation they need to remain successful in their careers with eqt. all new employees complete
an orientation session where they learn about eqt’s culture, organization, benefits, leadership competencies, performance
expectations, and other available resources to help them succeed from day one. orientation also reinforces our commitment to
workplace safety, ethical conduct, and environmental stewardship. following orientation, employees receive additional training as
needed to develop the skills necessary to perform their job tasks safely and effectively.

while we do not currently have a mechanism to accurately track employee training hours, we provide mandatory training, work­
specific training, plus optional participation in seminars, workshops, and certification programs to ensure that employees are
continually prepared for their job tasks and feel empowered within the company. these training opportunities also bolster employee
professional development to ensure that core and technical skills remain current. additionally, we conduct performance reviews for
employees at all levels to understand areas in which they can grow.

employees continually work with their managers or supervisors to identify other appropriate training opportunities as they grow their
careers with eqt. we provide cross­functional rotational assignments, individual development plans and coaching, and in­house
training to serve our employees’ growth. some employees may seek to expand their formal education, and our education assistance
program provides financial assistance to those who enroll in degree programs and satisfy established grade requirements.

as eqt employees near the end of their careers, we also provide training and additional resources to aid them in the transition from
active employment. our independent 401(k) plan administrator offers online courses, one­on­one meetings, and telephone advice
about retirement options while our employee assistance program offers courses and individual counseling sessions for those
retiring or involuntarily terminating from the company.

diversity & employee resource groups
at eqt, we believe that employee diversity enhances the recruitment and retention of talented individuals, as well as eqt’s overall
success and performance. we believe in recruiting the best available talent regardless of ethnicity, race, or other identifiers — and
every employee has an annual performance objective to reinforce the importance of diversity and to recognize that employee
differences bring advantages to the workplace. we work to ensure inclusivity for all employees. company sponsored employee
resource groups (ergs), the first of which formed in 2013, provide support to employees with shared characteristics or life
experiences. currently, we have five active ergs:

   multi-ethnic
   parents
   women in energy
   developing professionals
   pride

these groups participate in events and programs to help existing employees navigate and thrive at eqt. members may attend
career fairs to support external recruiting, volunteer in the community, serve as informal mentors to new employees, and provide
feedback and ideas to the company about our diversity representation.

health service providers, and an employee assistance program. take charge offers personal health coaching, wellness information,

including confidential short­term counseling and treatment programs and referrals to providers with expertise in family and
relationship counseling, elder care, money management, and legal problems. eqt pays in full for up to five in­person counselor

in the community
at eqt, we work in harmony with the communities where we operate through collaboration, policy engagement, giving back, and
safety assurance. we understand that our ability to operate is rooted in our relationships with communities, especially when it comes
to safety and other concerns. to safeguard local communities’ well­being in alignment with our operational needs, we have
established routines to discuss and address concerns, engage in political activity, donate funding and resources, and educate
community members on various aspects of our business impacts. through these engagements, we develop strong relationships that
benefit both eqt and our communities.

  local communities

  topic definition
  managing impacts on and relations with the communities in which eqt operates, including addressing resettlement issues, transportation of materials and
  impacts on roads, noise pollution, and community complaints or concerns.


  why managing it matters
  local communities continue to be essential to the success and long­term growth of eqt’s business operations. our operations can and do affect nearby
  communities, so it is important that eqt conduct operations with the support, trust, and cooperation of our local communities.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt values the communities where we operate and we focus on three areas to support and engage with them: managing our
impacts, various forms of investment, and upholding a positive reputation. as eqt strives to grow responsibly, we work to build trust
by sharing information associated with our current, planned, and proposed operations. through public engagement, education,
corporate giving, and volunteerism, we are better able to uphold our reputation as a responsible natural gas company and operate in
a manner that is conducive to the needs and addresses the concerns of our local communities and governments.

addressing local community concerns & public perceptions
g4-so2

the traffic, road impacts, noise, dust, and lights associated with eqt’s operations can evoke community concern. to better
understand these concerns, our local government and community affairs specialists — regionally based eqt employees — are
responsible for establishing and maintaining relationships with civic organizations, elected officials, emergency response personnel,
business owners, residents, and other local stakeholders. these specialists work closely with eqt’s land, permitting, construction,
and legal departments, among others, to report concerns and engagement outcomes. the group, headed by the manager of local
government and community affairs, is part of the government affairs team, which ultimately reports to the general counsel.

we use our awareness of community concerns to establish policies and procedures designed to minimize or eliminate most
operational issues before they become disputes. for example, during the past two years, we evaluated issues and concerns related
to how our operations might affect nearby residents and businesses in more densely populated areas. we also collaborate with
counties affected by truck traffic and associated road impacts from eqt operations to mitigate the burden on local economies.

eqt maintains an internal database that tracks all concerns raised via the local government and community affairs specialists and
includes elements from identification through resolution. the database enables eqt to avoid issue recurrence by assessing lessons
learned. annually, we analyze the results to identify trends in performance, benchmark against previous data, and help determine
any required procedural changes. we also conduct an annual survey targeted to local elected officials and community leaders to
gauge performance and reputation.

our conscious efforts to understand and work with local communities support our desire to expand responsibly and develop positive
relationships and reputation with our communities. we strive to improve the public’s perception of our company as well as of the
natural gas industry. our local government and community affairs specialists protect and maintain eqt’s corporate reputation by:

   gathering information to help eqt identify local concerns before they inconvenience neighbors
   advocating for the community by ensuring that issues or concerns are addressed at the appropriate level within the company and
   ultimately achieve resolution
   acting as a conduit for suggesting ways to strengthen eqt’s processes and procedures
   providing a local point of contact for residents to learn about current or future projects and how they may affect their communities
   building relationships prior to the start of activity in new areas


evaluating development opportunities
eqt continues to evaluate issues and/or concerns related to our natural gas development opportunities. before commencing
activities in an area, we work closely with our land, permitting, and construction departments to review activity in similar locations
and evaluate direct stakeholder feedback as part of our pre­construction planning. eqt utilizes criteria to help determine potential
mitigation and, in some cases, can even eliminate the site from development consideration.

criteria include determining:

   distance from schools, places of worship, shopping centers, and other public gathering spaces
   existing condition of roads leading to the proposed site
   existing competitor projects near the site that might be sharing the same roads and community resources
   local political climate, including ordinances restricting drilling activity or organized opposition from neighbors

we will work to continuously improve these processes, considering feedback and effectiveness through all stages of engagement.
as an element of continuous improvement, and with a desire to expand business operations in a responsible manner, eqt will
continue to consider stakeholder needs and concerns as we further refine our approaches to local community engagement.

giving back to our communities
eqt and the eqt foundation — a separate 501(c)(3) organization — support our communities through their local giving and
philanthropic efforts. charitable contributions from both eqt and the eqt foundation are restricted to organizations primarily within
those communities near eqt’s active operations.

all corporate donations to local communities are approved at the corporate director level by leaders of the corporate
communication and/or government affairs teams. a routine review and pre­approval process is followed in an effort to avoid support
of illegal or otherwise inappropriate activities and the appearance of impropriety that could arise if contributions were made to
individuals or local authorities with decision­making responsibilities regarding eqt’s current or future operations. eqt donations
support a variety of organizations ranging from small local nonprofits to municipalities seeking additional support for community
projects that exceed their budgets. other types of corporate support include sponsorships of county fairs, community festivals, and
other local events. through our support we can bond with our neighbors, enhance the quality for life for residents, educate residents
about our company, and provide an opportunity for our fellow community members to meet eqt employees.

the eqt foundation also provides funding for communities in and near eqt’s operating areas. eqt foundation’s executive
operating committee reviews all grant applications, which applications must be submitted by a nonprofit organization and comply
with u.s. laws and regulations applicable to corporate foundations, and provides a funding recommendation regarding each request
to the eqt foundation’s board of directors. the eqt foundation board of directors approves all funding decisions. in 2016, the
eqt foundation supported local programming in four main funding priority areas:

   arts & culture
   community & economic development
   education
   environment

the foundation periodically adjusts its funding priorities to ensure that its funding strategy matches the evolving needs of the
communities where eqt and our affiliates operate.

our performance
addressing community concerns & perceptions
g4-so1, g4-so8, g4-so11

all of eqt’s operations participated in organization­wide local community engagement, impact assessments, and development
programs in 2016. as in previous years, eqt did not receive any fines or grievances regarding our impact on society during 2016.

eqt invested approximately $7.1 million to improve roads and associated infrastructure in affected communities in pennsylvania
and west virginia in 2016, where the majority of our activities take place.

political involvement & public policy




  political involvement & public policy

  topic definition
  engaging in political activity, providing corporate contributions to political candidates and organizations, and contributing to public policy.


  why managing it matters
  eqt serves as an informed resource to policymakers on issues directly affecting the activities of eqt, and those of the natural gas industry in general. this
  engagement supports fair and balanced laws and regulations that benefit all of eqt’s stakeholders.




our approach
g4-dma

to benefit local communities and protect the interests of eqt, we engage with state and local politicians regarding issues that affect
our operations and communities. our expertise in natural gas production and transportation enables us to have meaningful
discussions around energy policy. we disclose our political engagement activities on our website to support transparency for our
stakeholders.

governance
eqt conducts our public policy activities in compliance with local, state, and federal laws and, in addition, the eqt public policy and
corporate responsibility (ppcr) committee of the eqt board of directors periodically reviews these activities. the ppcr
committee reviews and receives reports regarding the approach eqt takes with respect to matters of public policy, including
corporate political spending, diversity, environment, health and safety, and energy policy. eqt has internal policies that help manage
our interactions with regulatory agencies and elected officials and that require, among other things, that no employee engage in
lobbying activity on behalf of eqt, nor use corporate treasury dollars for political purposes, without permission from our corporate
director of government affairs or general counsel. annually, the ppcr committee reviews all contributions made to political
candidates and discusses public policy issues that affect the company.

political spending & policy issues
eqt complies with laws and regulations in every operational jurisdiction where we plan to strategically spend on political
contributions. this includes federal and state campaign finance laws regarding political spending in support of political parties,
politicians, and related institutions. we do not engage in political activity or make financial or in­kind contributions to political parties,
politicians, or related institutions outside the united states. we fund our political spending through:

   eqt employees federal political action committee (pac), sourced solely from the voluntary contributions of eqt employees
   eqt employees pennsylvania state pac, sourced from voluntary employee contributions and transfers from the eqt employees
   federal pac
   eqt corporate treasury dollars

we also work to support federal, state, and local policies that promote stable investment climates for natural gas exploration,
production, storage, and transportation. these may include policies governing environmental protection, taxes, natural gas
production and transportation, and expanding the use of natural gas in sectors such as transportation, manufacturing, and electricity
generation. when engaging with policymakers, we consider the impacts to eqt, our stakeholders, communities, and the
environment. see our performance below for the issues and organizations eqt supported in 2016.

corporate memberships
g4-15, g4-16

eqt is a founding member of the center for responsible shale development (crsd), working with other producers, environmental
groups, and philanthropic organizations to promote performance standards for safe and sustainable operations in the appalachian
basin.

in addition, we paid $798,000 in corporate memberships in 2016, with approximately $109,000 of that total allocated to lobbying.

  public safety & emergency preparedness

  topic definition
  ensuring the health and safety of the communities in which eqt operates through careful well and pipeline construction, production activity, and lifecycle impact
  assessments; anticipating and having programs in place for crisis or emergency situations.


  why managing it matters
  safety is a number one priority at eqt, and we will not compromise on this to gain a business advantage. our communities rely on our maintenance of well and
  pipeline integrity, employee safety training, and regular communications to minimize safety incidents.




our approach
g4-dma

in addition to eqt’s commitment to provide a safe and healthful workplace for our employees and contractors (see occupational
health & safety for information), we maintain and operate equipment responsibly to create a safe environment in the communities
where we operate. this includes providing safety awareness and emergency response protocols to communities, establishing well
and pipeline designs and processes that prioritize safety, managing traffic, and providing safe driver training. our formal
environment, health, and safety policy, updated in april 2017, outlines safety procedures for our employees and contractors.

pipeline safety
it is important that community members where eqt operates know that we operate with their safety in mind. therefore, we have
established safety protocols, procedures, and processes that we review as needed. the careful design, construction, and operation
of wells and pipelines is essential in protecting our communities. when designing, constructing, and operating natural gas pipelines
and facilities, we integrate preventive measures to ensure employee, resident, and community safety along the entire pipeline route.
we carefully design the pipelines that transport natural gas from the well to the marketplace and maintain them regularly, prioritizing
public safety and environmental protection. we meet or exceed safety standards and practices through:




design

   comply with local, state, and federal regulations
   design facilities consistent with industry standards and best practices
   optimize routes to avoid sensitive areas

construction

   inspect construction activities to verify safe and proper installation measures
   test pipelines prior to placing them in­service to certify integrity
   examine welds to ensure safety

operations

   monitor, control, and analyze natural gas flow via 24/7 gas control center
   mitigate corrosion through maintenance of cathodic protection systems, fluid sampling, and flow control
   maintain rights­of­way for aerial patrols and routine on­site inspections
   sustain comprehensive operating and maintenance programs to ensure the integrity of the assets and minimize the potential for
   third­party damage

integrity management

   identify high­consequence areas along the transmission lines based on population and land/building use
   create a risk model that prioritizes the high consequence areas for integrity assessment
   complete specific evaluations, such as corrosion investigations and pressure testing, to assure integrity of the pipelines

security

   provide on­site security through electronic monitoring, fences, buildings, locks, and surveillance

community awareness

   mail safety brochure annually to residents and businesses located near pipelines
   participate in annual meetings for first responders and excavators to provide pipeline safety information
   promote national “811 – call before you dig” program to prevent accidents
   participate in and sponsor pa 811 safety day

we dedicate resources to adhere to gas transmission pipeline integrity federal regulations (subpart o) as well as other public safety
assessments, such as pipeline assessments, excavations, and material testing. these additional elements — although not federally
required — contribute to ongoing safe operations. in 2016, we spent approximately $2 million on pipeline safety initatives. through
these established routines and regulations, we limit the likelihood of pipeline incidents and protect our workers and communities.

public safety awareness
eqt understands that our operations can affect the communities in which we operate. we uphold safety as our number one priority
by regularly communicating with our communities to increase awareness of our activities and address potential safety concerns. we
work closely with emergency response personnel, public works employees, elected officials, school districts, and other key
community members to engage them in the process, educate and learn from them, and build relationships.

most often, the awareness and subsequent conversations surround:

   identification of the activity occurring at a local job site
   the types of equipment being used
   the most appropriate response for various scenarios
   eqt’s emergency or crisis response plan

through these interactions, eqt and our communities are more prepared to jointly respond to safety­related incidents if they
happen. local officials and first responders become familiar with eqt’s operations and feel more comfortable contacting eqt should
an incident occur. our conversations educate them on what they should and should not do to help eqt resolve an incident quickly
and safely. in addition to streamlining the response process to a potential safety incident, these engagements build trust and
establish lasting relationships.

road safety
a common local community concern is the impact of increased vehicle traffic on municipal roads from our operational vehicles. over
the years, we established routines and trainings to mitigate these concerns and reduce safety incidents. when designing
construction routes to job sites, we carefully consider the locations of schools, recreation areas, and heavily populated regions. we
base all our initial route considerations on safety, which can necessitate longer drives on local roads used by residents. often, route
options are limited to reach a site, so we work with local governments and school districts to maximize the community’s safety and
protection. we curtail traffic on roads traveled by school buses and place custom signs along our active truck routes, alerting our
drivers and contractors that truck travel is prohibited during school bus pick up and drop off times. these signs also alert the
community to slow down and watch for children.

vehicle safety is included in both our employee and contractor safety expectations. at all established marcellus and utica job sites,
we develop a mandated traffic control plan, which we distribute to employees, contractors, and subcontractors. these plans outline
our specified speed limits, curfews, and route restrictions. we actively monitor compliance with our traffic control plans and take
prompt action to address reported violations. we utilize private road monitors, with law enforcement backgrounds, to continuously
surveil our truck traffic once construction begins. the road monitors use radar­equipped vehicles and take necessary corrective
action if eqt­related traffic creates unsafe driving conditions. they also investigate community complaints regarding any violations
from employees or contractors. to ensure contractor accountability, we may require contractor vehicles to have gps systems in their
vehicles so we can access their data.

our safe driving leadership team, consisting of representatives from human resources and business unit leaders, developed
policies that uphold the safety of our employees and local communities. eqt acts to limit vehicle­related accidents by requiring
employees assigned to a company vehicle to complete a comprehensive set of driver training programs and procedures regarding
potential hazards and how to avoid them. during orientation, employees learn how to operate a vehicle safely, how to be aware of
common road hazards, and the best methods to avoid the most common types of accidents. both new and experienced drivers must
demonstrate their safe driving skills through a periodic supervisor observation session. upon passing, new employees undergo a
series of computer­based training programs and behind­the­wheel training, including a defensive driving module. we provide
additional instruction for those employees operating specialty vehicles or haul trailers, performing off­road travel, or driving
construction vehicles on public roads. one such course is a u.s. department of transportation training enabling drivers to cross
state lines and remain in compliance.

in combination, our safety routines, traffic control plans, and trainings limit safety incidents and help us respond to the needs and
concerns of the communities where eqt operates.

environmental stewardship
eqt strives to operate safely and protect the environment while continuously improving our practices in support of responsible
growth. we carefully monitor our emissions, water, waste, and energy use, as well as our operational impact on biodiversity,
ecosystems, and the air. our environment, health, and safety policy outlines our internal processes and guidelines for all
employees to follow to avoid harm to the environment. we updated this policy in 2017.

eqt is a founding partner of the center for responsible shale development (crsd; previously the center for sustainable shale
development), a nonprofit organization consisting of environmental organizations and energy companies. the members of crsd
collaborated to develop realistic performance standards for shale development that incorporate community needs and environmental
protection. through this partnership, eqt was audited against 15 performance standards to receive certification for compliance. we
are proud that, in march of 2016, our appalachian basin operations were certified by the crsd.

  topic definition
  minimizing water use, increasing use of recycled water, and protecting local water sources.


  why managing it matters
  today’s natural gas production process is sophisticated and relies on water for its innovative procedures. eqt must meet stringent regulatory safeguards to
  protect water resources and ensure that production activities have no significant lasting negative effects.




our approach
g4-dma

natural gas development activities are water intensive. understanding this, eqt is dedicated to protecting fresh water by operating
responsibly. we employ water use measurement and monitoring controls to minimize our impact to nearby water or other natural
resources and we comply with local, state, and federal laws governing the monitoring and withdrawal of fresh water.

governance
eqt’s environmental department, led by our corporate director, environmental affairs, is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint. this department reports to the deputy general counsel, environmental,
safety, and public policy, and is ultimately guided by the company’s executive environmental council. each quarter, we share
environmental progress, including water withdrawals and any violations, with our public policy and corporate responsibility
committee. additionally, regulatory agencies in pennsylvania, ohio, texas, and west virginia receive quarterly reports regarding
eqt’s water usage.

hydraulic fracturing
to increase the productivity of shale formations, natural gas extraction relies on the process of hydraulic fracturing, which is the use
of fluid to create pressure to crack shale formations underground that release the natural gas. this fracturing fluid is composed of
significant amounts of water, mixed with sand and a small percentage of chemical additives. to reduce the likelihood of groundwater
or aquifer contamination, our wells have multiple layers of steel and cement — a process known as triple casing.

further demonstrating our commitment to protecting water resources, eqt is proud of being a charter participant of fracfocus, an
independent educational website created by the ground water protection council and the interstate oil and gas compact
commission. through fracfocus, eqt regularly updates our public disclosure of the chemicals added to our hydraulic fracturing
fluid for each site. additionally, we continuously explore safer or more environmentally friendly alternatives for our fluids. we do not
use diesel additives in our fracturing fluid and significantly reduced the amount of other chemicals over the past few years. for
example, we replaced traditional biocides with non­chemical alternatives to demonstrate our commitment to protecting water quality.

we strive to protect the fresh water in our communities by complying with applicable regulatory requirements, investing in new
technology, leveraging best industry practices, reusing water whenever possible, and disclosing the chemical makeup of our
fracturing fluid.

water sources
g4-en9

eqt complies with individual state regulations and limits regarding water withdrawal and wastewater (see effluents & waste for
additional information). our water withdrawal in 2016 did not significantly affect any water sources. eqt uses the following
definitions to describe water usage:

 water withdrawal                                     recycled water                                          water intensity

 the water obtained from sources such as lakes,       the water that is reused by eqt’s operations; this      the ratio of water consumed (in cubic meters, or
 rivers, reservoirs, or municipal spigots/hydrants.   includes flowback, drilling water, and produced water   m3 ) to barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe)
                                                      collected from drilling operations.                     produced by the company. this metric normalizes
                                                                                                              freshwater withdrawal.


our primary sources of fresh water are surface and municipal water. this held true in 2016. eqt’s freshwater withdrawal varies each
year due to:




   the location and seasonal availability of fresh water may not match the location and timing of drilling and completions activity
   the completion of more hydraulically fractured wells results in greater total water usage

the use of longer laterals — the horizontal portion of the well — requires more water for each completion while at the same time
reduces the number of drilling pads, which minimizes surface disturbance. in 2016, we increased our usage of wastewater from
recycling plants and other producers, which enabled us to decrease our groundwater use by 141,589 cubic meters and increase
wastewater use by 74,487 cubic meters.

rainwater continues to have a minimal effect on eqt’s water usage. many of our water storage facilities and pits passively collect
rainwater for use in our operations. however, accurately measuring total usage is difficult due to low volumes and other variables.

energy & ghg emissions




  energy & ghg emissions

  topic definition
  carefully managing methane and other greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from operations, and promoting energy conservation and the use of renewable, clean
  energy throughout operations.


  why managing it matters
  slowing climate change is a global concern; however, eqt’s ability to find ways to reduce energy consumption in the office, on the job site, and on the road has
  a positive impact on the environment, our employees, and our bottom line.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt’s greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and energy consumption originate from three sources — facilities, transportation, and
operations. we drive continuous improvement and seek innovative ways to conserve energy, reduce our emissions, and lessen our
footprint in these three areas.

facilities
we track energy consumption in eqt’s owned and leased facilities on a regular basis. we work to improve energy efficiency at our
leased facilities via preventative maintenance and equipment upgrades, such as motion sensor lighting, energy­efficiency fixtures,
temperature controls, and weekend power down displays for computers. at owned facilities, we seek to increase efficiencies by
making capital improvements to permanent building controls, such as boilers, thermostats, and lighting systems.

eqt’s facilities use electricity primarily generated by coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. in 2016, our total energy consumption
across facilities was 51,569 gj, an 8% increase from 2015. the increased consumption was partially the result of 14% more cooling
days — days that required extra energy to cool buildings — as compared year­over­year. more than half of eqt’s total energy
consumption is derived from the use of electricity, which powers lighting, cooling, computers, audio/video, and other support
equipment.

in 2016, our direct energy usage totaled 19,460 gj, and was primarily generated by natural gas. our consumption of direct energy
increased in 2016 due to increased occupancy levels at eqt facilities and the corresponding increase in heating and cooling needs.

transportation
eqt has operations in multiple states, requiring us to rely upon trucks and other fleet vehicles for the transportation of workers and
materials to job sites. eqt vehicles drive millions of miles annually; therefore, we actively pursue efficient, cleaner­burning
alternatives to carbon rich fuels, such as compressed natural gas (cng). we significantly reduced our overall emissions through the
increased use of cng in our fleet vehicles since 2012. using cng, our total fleet emissions remain consistent, despite increased
vehicle count. in addition, we continue to identify ways to reduce our total number of fleet vehicles overall.

operations
eqt’s operational greenhouse gas air emissions vary greatly depending on the type and amount of field activity occurring year­to­
year. we monitor and report on air emissions relevant to our business operations as well as those required by state and federal
regulations and seek continuous improvement capabilities in areas that provide the most opportunity for ghg reductions. we gather
operational data and calculate emissions annually to comply with the emissions inventory requirements of each state where we have
operations.

eqt emissions data is based on stack test data, manufacturer’s data, and/or u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)
published emission factors. eqt has no biogenic co2 emissions to report. all data in this report reflects required air emissions
inventory submittals and includes all eqt production, eqt gathering, and eqt transmission operations. eqt does not measure or
report air, stack, and fugitive emissions for persistent organic pollutants. we have no plans to measure or report this data in the
future as there is no business or regulatory reason to do so. eqt also does not maintain records of equity basis emissions or track
indirect greenhouse gas emissions from outside the company (scopes 2 and 3).

g4-en18

eqt’s levels or amount of operational activity largely influence reported emissions, thus fluctuating with increases or decreases in
drilling and completions. additionally, changes in reporting requirements may also cause reported emissions to appear higher/lower
when comparing year­over­year data.

biodiversity & ecosystem health




  biodiversity & ecosystem health

  topic definition
  using land management systems to reduce the likelihood of land contamination and protect soil quality, biodiversity, animal welfare and habitats, including
  during reclamation and decommissioning.


  why managing it matters
  with approximately 3.6 million gross acres owned or leased, land plays a huge role in eqt’s daily activities. exploration, production, gathering, and
  transmission activity all impact the surrounding landscape—including areas with high biodiversity value.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt actively works to minimize our impact on the land and wildlife where we operate, both because it is the right thing to do and
because we understand that our reputation depends on it. our daily activities, including exploration, production, gathering, and
transmission of natural gas, inevitably alter the land to some degree and we create plans from which we make careful decisions to
minimize this impact.

once operations are complete at a site, we work with property owners to restore their land — as closely as possible — to its original
condition. we reestablish contours and revegetate with state­approved seed mixes, native seed mixes, and/or vegetation requested
by landowners. these techniques support local flora and fauna by allowing wildlife movement, restoration of pre­existing habitat, and
prevention of invasive species. eqt works with landowners to successfully accommodate their preference for returning their land to
its pre­construction condition, all while meeting the regulatory requirements set forth by the state. this enables us to maintain
positive relationships with landowners and communities while supporting biodiversity and habitat protection.

governance
eqt’s environmental department, led by our corporate director, environmental affairs, is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint. this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental,
safety, and public policy, and is ultimately guided by the company’s executive environmental council.

risks. eqt follows federal, state, and local regulations regarding species and habitat protection during operational activity near
protected land or areas of high biodiversity.



we assess and monitor 100% of our business segment operations —
production, gathering, and transmission — for biodiversity risks.

we do not drill on legally protected lands in our owned or leased properties; these include wetlands, federal lands, and national
parks. when drilling on land adjacent to protected areas, we leverage our horizontal drilling expertise to extract natural gas from
underground without disturbing the surface or any species native to the area. additionally, we use horizontal drilling techniques to
drill multiple gas wells from one pad, avoiding the need to disturb multiple land areas.




prior to operations in any area, we conduct studies to determine whether endangered species exist in that region. we also use
various domestic environmental registries to identify potential impacts to threatened, endangered, and special concern species or
resources near possible areas of operation. we make it a priority to avoid disturbing these species and habitats but, if this is not
possible, we work with appropriate state agencies to develop and execute protection plans.

eqt also conducts thorough environmental surveys prior to constructing new pipelines across our operating area. an integral
element of the routing process, these surveys include many levels of study that provide invaluable information on the region. eqt is
committed to building pipelines in a safe, environmentally responsible manner; therefore, we conduct these surveys to identify and
protect our natural resources, indigenous species, and cultural and historic resources. eqt strives to restore the land to as near its
original condition as possible.

bats, snakes, mussels, and plants are the most common species found within eqt’s operating areas. with consideration of species
protection, eqt consults with the united states fish and wildlife service (usfws) to ensure operations do not adversely affect
threatened or endangered species within proposed project locations. six endangered species and three threatened species occupy
habitat within eqt’s core operating area, covering both pennsylvania and west virginia. the migratory bird treaty act (mbta)
protects 25 different species, which use eqt’s core operating area as either breeding grounds or seasonal habitat. the following
table summarizes the species of concern located within eqt’s core operating area.

effluents & waste




  effluents & waste

  topic definition
  minimizing waste, including hazardous materials, fracturing fluid, cuttings and drilling waste, spills and leakages through recycling programs and safe chemical
  removal; treating wastewater to preserve water quality; preventing and managing spills when they occur.


  why managing it matters
  wastewater and solid waste, such as drill mud and cuttings, are both by­products of the drilling process. careful management of this waste, including the
  minimization and appropriate disposal of wastes, prevents spills and protects people and the environment.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt’s most prevalent by­products from the drilling process are wastewater from hydraulic fracturing (see water for more
information) and solid wastes, such as drill mud and cuttings. we pursue various strategies to recycle or reuse water and are
committed to identifying safe waste disposal methods that reduce ecological impact and organizational costs. additionally, to ensure
the safety and health of our workers, communities, and environment, we abide by policies and procedures designed to minimize and
mitigate liquid spills and releases.

governance
eqt’s corporate director of environmental affairs heads our environmental department, which oversees and manages all aspects
of our environmental footprint. this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental, safety, and public policy,
and is ultimately guided by the executive environmental council. each quarter, we share environmental progress with our public
policy and corporate responsibility committee. additionally, regulatory agencies in pennsylvania, ohio, texas, and west virginia
receive quarterly reports on eqt’s water usage, as required. we submit chemical analysis of residual waste reports to the
pennsylvania department of environmental protection annually to satisfy regulatory waste reporting requirements for the state.

wastewater & solid waste
eqt tracks all waste to landfill, waste from routine operations, and waste from non­routine activities on a project­by­project basis, as
these are our most significant waste streams. examples of non­routine operations may include spill clean­up, equipment
decontamination, and pipeline cleaning.

for our appalachian basin operations, eqt follows the center for responsible shale development (crsd) performance standards,
including maximizing water recycling to decrease wastewater volumes, safe wastewater disposal, and effluent monitoring. we
recycle wastewater after the completion of a well by collecting flowback, drilling, and produced water to reuse when fracturing new
wells. we do not permit the discharge of any produced water to surface water, and dispose of water that is no longer suitable for
recycling at state­ and federal­permitted facilities. eqt’s appalachian basin operations received full certification from the crsd in
2016. we are the fourth of the founding members to meet or exceed all 15 crsd performance standards of environmental
stewardship and continuous improvement for air and water protection.

eqt’s drill mud and cuttings are processed using solids control equipment that efficiently separates the drilling fluids from the solids.
drying agents then remove any residual moisture, and the dried cuttings are containerized and trucked to landfills that are pre­
approved to accept these solids in their permitted disposal cells. eqt continues to improve the efficiency of its solids management
program by using higher efficiency systems that create better separation of drilling fluid and drill cuttings, reducing the overall weight
of the disposed product. using more effective drying agents decreases the amount of these agents needed, which also decreases
the weight of the disposed product.



while disposal methods for our solid waste vary, we always seek the
most efficient, responsible, and cost­effective methods possible.

while disposal methods for our solid waste vary, we always seek the most efficient, responsible, and cost­effective methods
possible. our priority is to reuse or recycle, but we also use landfills, deep well injection, or other approved methods when
appropriate. in doing so, we comply with all regulatory requirements for the state or region, including de minimis thresholds for waste
reporting.

spill prevention & management
to reduce the likelihood and impact of significant spills, we maintain spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (spcc) plans
for every worksite that stores fluid. these comprehensive plans, based on regulation established by the united states environmental
protection agency (epa), guide our employees and contractors to minimize the chance for a release and dictate the actions required
should a spill occur. the plans define training programs, inspection protocols, secondary containment monitoring, and repair
programs required at each of our natural gas wells and compressor stations.

if an incident occurs, our typical emergency response and preparedness program outlines the following steps to take:

   determine the source and type of spill, and begin taking corrective action
   evacuate any employees requiring medical attention
   isolate the area and stop the spill as soon as possible using appropriate methods
   contain the spill with available resources, including containment ditches, diking, and spill kits (complete with absorbent booms,
   pads, pillows, and personal protective equipment); eqt does not use chemical dispersants
   notify the immediate supervisor or area manager and the environmental coordinator of all spills and complete an environmental
   incident investigation form
   perform, or observe, proper cleanup measures as directed by the environmental coordinator

in the event of a spill, eqt uses appropriate cleanup techniques to mitigate its effects, including removal of effluents from soil.
we promptly remove and dispose of cleanup materials according to prevailing federal, state, and local regulatory requirements,
minimizing impact on the environment and local community. we then evaluate the cause of the spill to identify and implement
corrective action. we work to prevent repeat accidents by integrating improved techniques and protocols into design standards,
operations, and future spill prevention plans. we share these with employees and contractors to continuously improve our operations.

in 2016, eqt experienced 36 reportable spills with a total volume of 183.34 barrels. one compressor station release in virginia was
significant and amounted in a release of 150.00 barrels of produced fluids released into containment and the ground due to a broken
dike drainpipe. of the other 35 spills, there was one spill of more than one barrel, containing 2.00 bbls of hydrocarbons; and five
spills of more than one barrel each that contained 175.38 nonhydrocarbons. there were no significant hydrocarbon or
nonhydrocarbon spills by vendors or contractors, and none of the 36 spills required disclosure in company financial statements.

we did not transport, import, export, treat, or ship internationally any hazardous wastes in 2016.

eqt does not discharge any produced water to surface water; therefore, no strategies or criteria are necessary for disposal and
treatment; no report standards for produced water quality are required; and eqt has no volumes of hydrocarbon discharged in
produced water to report.

  environmental stewardship



air quality




  air quality

  topic definition
  managing and minimizing air emissions (vocs, nitrogen oxides, etc.) across eqt’s value chain.


  why managing it matters
  our operational emissions can affect local air quality in the areas where we operate. a compliant emissions record enables eqt to maintain a positive
  reputation with local communities and regulators, which can streamline permitting for new facilities.




our approach
g4-dma

eqt monitors our operational air emissions to comply with relevant regulations. eqt implemented an environmental management
system (ems) that collects data for every station and calculates emissions based on monthly data, and we seek to continuously
improve our processes and procedures. inventories of such data tracking are generally required by each individual permit and, in
some cases, we have actively tracked inventories dating back to 1991.

governance
eqt’s environmental department, led by our corporate director, environmental affairs, is responsible for the oversight and
management of all aspects of our environmental footprint. this department reports to the deputy general counsel of environmental,
safety, and public policy, and is ultimately guided by the company’s executive environmental council within the environmental
department. within this department, the air quality team is responsible for air quality permitting and reporting. we report
environmental progress — including emissions reports, notices of violations, and obtained permits — to the eqt public policy and
corporate responsibility committee several times a year.

permits & monitoring
eqt must obtain operational permits, including air quality permits, prior to construction and operation in new locations. a strong air
quality compliance record can streamline this process. once obtained, our operations group reviews the permit and notes any future
compliance responsibilities. we communicate the requirements to our field workers to ensure appropriate data is collected and
uploaded into our ems, which tracks our emissions, obligations, limits, and air quality requirements. our environmental department
reviews the system monthly and identifies improvement processes for tracking and inputting information on an ongoing basis.

compliance personnel in each state inspect our work site locations regularly, including compressor stations and drilling sites, to
evaluate air quality compliance. they also meet with state regulators to ensure we are aligned to state air quality regulations, and we
conduct periodic leak detection and repair. we benchmark our air emissions against our peers to identify potential improvement
areas and evaluate what drives internal emissions across our operating regions.

audits & reporting
third party audits occur annually for a random selection of operating facilities, including compressor stations and well pad locations.
every facility receives a multimedia safety or environmental audit within a five­year period. our environmental group also conducts
internal inspections on our facilities and sites. our corporate auditing group periodically selects internal programs or processes to
audit, which often includes environmental process auditing, such as data collection of air emissions. we submit emissions reports
annually to the state in which the facility or site operates, and send overview reports to the u.s. environmental protection agency.




our performance
g4-en21

we strive to maintain 100% facility compliance with all permit requirements and emissions limitations, and we review any operational
incidents and notices of violation.
