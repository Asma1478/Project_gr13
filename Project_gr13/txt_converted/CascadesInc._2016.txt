         energy
         with regard to energy efficiency, cascades has a good head start on its competitors
         and the market in general. this is because, on the one hand, transforming recycled
         fibre takes less energy than wood and, on the other, we have a group of specialists
         among our ranks who have spent the past 20 years working on reducing the
         energy consumption of our plants. these strategic decisions are reflected in real
         savings: at the end of 2015, the average consumption of cascades plants was
         9.9 gigajoules 1 per metric tonne of saleable products, while the canadian
         industry average is 25.76 gj/mt 2.
         1
             ratio of energy used (includes the gigajoules that are generated internally from black liquor at one of
             our plants). differs slightly from the ratio of energy purchased (9.67 gj/mt).

        greenhouse
        gas
        in recent years, cascades has converted its steam boilers from heavy oil to natural
        gas systems. in addition to improved energy efficiency, these changes have also
        reduced emissions of particulates, sulphur compounds and greenhouse gases.
        combined with business decisions, these initiatives have enabled us to reduce our
        greenhouse gas emissions by 51% between 1990 and 2015.




        water
        in the paper industry, water is essential for processing and transforming fibres
        and other raw materials. it is also used in a slew of related activities such as
        washing, cooling and the production of steam energy. once again, the nature of
        cascades’ activities constitutes an indisputable competitive advantage, as
        producing paper from recycled fibre requires much less water than processes
        involving the transformation of wood into wood fibre. at the end of 2015,
        cascades plants’ average water consumption was 9.9 cubic metres per metric
        tonne of saleable products, while the canadian industry average is 65 m3/mt 1.
