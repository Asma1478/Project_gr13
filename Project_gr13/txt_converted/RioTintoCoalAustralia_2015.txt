1   from the managing director
    i am pleased to present rio tinto coal australia’s (rtca) 2015 sustainable
    development report. in yet another challenging year for the coal industry, we have
    remained committed and transparent on our safety, environment, employment,
    and community reporting, and our contributions that have benefited nearby
    communities and businesses.
    i am particularly proud of the significant improvements made to keep our people
    safe. in 2015 we recorded our lowest ever all injury frequency rate and introduced
    some important frameworks that address the safety risks our people face every
    day. safety continues to be our first priority, and in 2016 we will be looking to
    focus on fatality prevention at all of our operations.
    despite the market challenges, we are proud to have invested more than a$5.9
    million over 319 programmes benefiting the local communities surrounding our
    operations. we also spent a$914 million with more than 1100 local suppliers. i am
    confident we can continue this great partnership with our community members
    and suppliers in 2016.
    as always, we work hard to minimise the environmental impacts of our operations.
    transparency in our reporting is important to us, and last year we made excellent
    progress to improve our reporting mechanisms and frequency across all of
    our operations.
    in september 2015, we signed an agreement for the sale of our 40 per cent
    interest in the bengalla joint venture to new hope corporation for us$606
    million. this sale was completed on 1 march 2016, therefore bengalla joint
    venture has been included in this report, unless otherwise indicated.
    our goal is to be a long-term, sustainable business that delivers significant direct
    and indirect benefits to the areas in which we operate. we cannot do that without
    the support and collaboration of our local communities.
