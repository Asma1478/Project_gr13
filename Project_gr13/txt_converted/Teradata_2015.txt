        community champions
        the community champions program allows employees
        the opportunity to promote an ethic of service in their
        local community. community champions embody the
        values of teradata and are the leaders of change. working
        with teradata cares in their local offices, they are integral
        to mobilizing the corporate community and leveraging our
        highly-skilled workforce to make a significant and positive
        impact in the community. community champions have
        the unique opportunity to not only be a volunteer, but also
        to lead, inspire, and motivate colleagues to get involved.          planting trees – beijing, china

community service grants
teradata cares also provides community service grants
to encourage civic volunteerism by providing funds for
volunteer projects performed with teams of five or more
employees. community service grants must be used
to purchase supplies and materials for the performance
of a specific, one-time, hands-on project to be com-
pleted by the employee group that requests the grant, or
donations in support of teams raising money for various
causes. examples of this type of project might include
the purchase of lumber or hardware to build a fence
around a school playground; the purchase of bathroom
fixtures to renovate a homeless shelter; or the purchase
of flowers, shrubbery, and mulch to landscape around a
community center.
