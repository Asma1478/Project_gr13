benefitting from internal efficiencies
and a more favorable business environment
the start of 2017 has confirmed the positive trends
seen in the second half of 2016. above all, the return
to organic growth seen in the last two quarters in 2016
is continuing including the ongoing improvements we
have seen in brazil and a return of russian tourists in
selected markets. we also continue to see a reduction
of currency volatility in emerging markets. thanks to
the additional efficiencies we implemented over the
past 12 month, our organization is ready to perform,
backed by our solid strategy.

positive fundamentals on the global economy and the
resilient growth in passenger numbers indicate a pos-
itive overall business environment. combined with our
focus on operational improvements and the already
signed additional space of 22,000 m2 to be opened
in 2017 and beyond, we expect a successful year for

at operational level, we continue to use existing and
well-established commercial brands that are success-
fully used in specific locations, such as hellenic duty
free in greece or world duty free in the uk and spain,
or which represent specific commercial concepts,
such as hudson for our travel convenience stores.

– maintain flexibility of offering customers a variety of concepts




we will use our respective brands according to their
recognition and positive image established with land-
lords and customers at country or regional level. when
selecting a brand for a location, we assess each case
separately, which allows us to benefit from the posi-
tive local market perception and to successfully drive
global expansion while supporting each individual lo-
cal market.




                                                                     29

     general travel
      retail shops


     the general travel retail shop concept is
     the most common concept at airports,
     as it carries a large selection of different
     items and covers the full range of product
     categories, such as perfumes & cosmet-
     ics, food & confectionery, wines & spirits,
     watches & jewelry, fashion & leather, to-
     bacco goods, souvenirs, electronics and
     other accessories.

     these shops are typically located in cen-
     tral areas with high passenger flow,
     mostly in airports, but also in seaports
     and other locations. both departure and
     arrival areas can be fitted with this shop
     concept. as of december 31, 2016, dufry
     operated over 720 shops under the gen-
     eral travel retail concept. in the duty-
     free segment, these shops can be rec-
     ognized by the several retail brands in
     our portfolio, including dufry, nuance,
     world duty free, and hellenic duty free
     among others.

     in 2016, we continued with our initiative
     to renovate our most important opera-
     tions and major improvements were
     made in our general travel retail shops
     in a number of locations. we undertook
     renovations in our shops at airports in
     naples, birmingham, heathrow t4, basel,
     cambodia (phnom penh and siem reap),
     rio de janeiro galeão, lima, mexico city
     and toronto, to name a few. in all cases,
     the retail spaces were redesigned with
     the latest trends in travel retail, includ-
     ing the implementation of walk-through
     concepts wherever possible.

        dufry
      shopping




in order to offer domestic passengers a
similar shopping experience like the one
offered to international travelers, dufry
created a new retail concept: a general
travel retail shop for domestic passen-
gers, which offers an assortment com-
parable to a duty-free shop.

at our dufry shopping stores, domestic
passengers are presented with the
same retail excellence they normally
find in international terminals, with a
great variety of products from the most
prestigious brands combined with the
best customer service. there are a num-
ber of countries where domestic travel-
ers account for the majority of passen-
gers, particularly in large countries such
as china, the united states and brazil,
thus offering additional potential to in-
ternationalize this concept.

the concept was first introduced in
brazil, in a pilot at brasilia airport back
in 2014. given the successful launch, we
expanded the concept to another 6 air-
ports in brazil, including galeão airport
in rio de janeiro and guarulhos airport

      brand
    boutiques

brand boutiques enhance the travel-
er’s retail experience and allow the
creation of an exciting shopping mall
environment. dufry is a partner of
choice for global brands to showcase
their products in singular retail spaces
and to mirror their high street image;
e.g. burberry, bally, bvlgary, carolina
herrera, chopard, coach, desigual,
dunhill, emporio armani, ermenegildo
zegna, etro, gap, hermès, hugo boss,
kiehl’s, lacoste, l’occitane, mac, marc
o’polo, mcm, michael kors, montblanc,
pandora, paul & shark, pinko, polo ralph
lauren, salvatore ferragamo, shang hai
tang, shang xia, superdry, swarovski,
thomas pink, tommy hilfiger, tumi,
versace or victoria’s secret. as of de-
cember 31, 2016, dufry operated close
to 190 brand boutiques. dufry repre-
sents the world’s most prestigious lux-
ury brands. see the full list of brands
on page 65.

to best meet each location’s traveler
profile, we design these shops as stand-
alone boutiques or integrate them as a
shop-in-shop in our general travel retail
stores. brand boutiques exist in both
duty-free and duty-paid areas.

in 2016, we opened close to 30 brand
boutiques globally, representing over
2,300 m² of retail space. about half of
them are in the united states, a market
that continues to allocate more space to
the segment. other highlights are the
opening of several gap and superdry
shops at spanish airports and the open-
ing of three new shops at zurich airport.

convenience
  stores



our convenience stores offer a wide as-
sortment of products ranging from soft
drinks, confectionery, packaged food,
travel accessories, electronics, personal
items or souvenirs, to publications such
as newspapers, magazines and books.

within this concept, we have different
retail brands, which are used according
to the profile of the passengers in a
given location. hudson is our most im-
portant brand in this universe with an
outstanding recognition from passen-
gers. as “the traveler’s best friend”, our
goal at hudson is to provide passengers
with anything they may need during their
journey.

hudson is a very flexible concept for
dufry, which is successfully operated at
airports in both international and do-
mestic areas, as well as in other channels
such as railway stations and other tran-
sit locations. hudson shops are captive
and comprehensive through whimsical,
color-coded signage to attract custom-
ers’ attention to our four distinct selling
areas: media, marketplace, essentials
and destination.

north america is home of most of our
convenience stores, with over 530 shops;
while over 80 convenience stores are
operated outside north america, in all
divisions. in 2016, over 50 convenience
shops were opened globally.

       specialized
          shops

     specialized stores and theme stores are
     shop concepts that offer products from
     a variety of different brands belonging
     to one specific product category. we use
     this concept often for products such as
     watches & jewelry, sunglasses, spirits,
     food or destination merchandise and in
     locations where we see a strong poten-
     tial for a shop to carry a broad product
     range relating to only one specific
     theme. as of december 31, 2016, dufry
     operated over 640 shops under the spe-
     cialized shops / theme stores concept.

     examples of the shop concepts names
     include “colombian emeralds interna-
     tional”, a dedicated watches & jewelry
     format used in the caribbean market;
     “dufry do brasil” for local brazilian
     goods; “kids works” with its wide selec-
     tion of toys, dolls, games, books and ap-
     parel for children; or “tech on the go” fo-
     cusing on the needs of the tech-oriented
     traveler offering electronics and acces-
     sories. further examples are “sun
     catcher” for sunglasses; “world of whis-
     kies” for a selection of finest single malt
     or blend whiskies; “master of time” for
     luxury watches and jewelries; “sound &
     visions” for multi-brand electronics;
     “temptation & time-box” for fashion
     watches and accessories as well as
     “travel store” for luggage and travel aid
     products and finally “atelier”, a women’s
     leather accessories store.

     these shops can be located in airports,
     seaports, on-board cruise liners, as well
     as in hotels or downtown locations.

strong fundamentals – solid investment
for bondholders
ever since the first issuance of a bond in 2012, dufry
has been a well-established investment opportunity in
the senior notes market, which still represents an im-
portant source of financing for the company. our low
operating leverage and the strong cash flow genera-
tion are characteristics welcomed by the fixed income
market.

notes maturing in august 2023, dufry has a well-bal-
anced financing structure. all maturity dates of the fi-
nancial debt are spread across a time horizon between
2019 and 2023.

dufry’s senior notes are currently rated by standard &

for dufry, which are not covered by gri.

as a second step, we have assessed and identified kpis
for tracking performance on material non-financial
topics. the topics are further classified into the three
dimensions of economic, social and environment.
currently, we are assessing the respective data avail-

higher level of detail for the topics covered (see the

notes to the
consolidated
financial
statements
for the year ended december 31, 2016




1.       corporate information

dufry ag (the company) is a publicly listed company with headquarters in basel,
switzerland. the company is the world’s leading travel retail company. it operates
around 2,200 shops worldwide. the shares of the company are listed on the
swiss stock exchange (six) in zurich and its brazilian depository receipts on the
bm&fbovespa in são paulo.

the consolidated financial statements of dufry ag and its subsidiaries (dufry or
the group) for the year ended december 31, 2016 were authorized for public dis-
closure in accordance with a resolution of the board of directors of the company
dated march 7, 2017, and are subject to the approval of the annual general meet-
ing to be held on april 27, 2017.


2.       accounting policies

2.1      basis of preparation

the consolidated financial statements of dufry ag and its subsidiaries have been
prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs).

dufry ag’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the histori-
cal cost basis, except for available-for-sale financial assets and other financial
assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments), that are measured at fair
value, as explained in the accounting policies below. historical cost is generally
based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets. the
carrying values of recognized assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair
value hedges, and are otherwise carried at amortized cost, are adjusted to record
changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.

the consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of swiss francs
(chf) and all values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except when
otherwise indicated.

2.2      basis of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of
dufry ag and entities controlled by dufry (its subsidiaries) as at december 31, 2016
and the respective comparative information. certain comparative figures were
restated due to the revision of the values of the purchase price allocation of the
world duty free group (wdf) (see notes 6.1 and 39).
                                                                                       101

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on
which dufry obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when
such control is lost. the group controls an entity when dufry is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability
to affect those returns through its power over the entity. the financial statements
of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent
company, using uniform accounting policies. all intra group balances, transactions,
unrealized gains or losses resulting from intragroup transactions and dividends
are eliminated in full.

a change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is
accounted for as an equity transaction. if dufry loses control over a subsidiary, it
– derecognizes the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary,
   derecognizes the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest as well as
   derecognizes the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
– recognizes the fair value of the consideration received, recognizes the fair value
   of any investment retained as well as recognizes any surplus or deficit in the
   consolidated income statement and
– reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognized in other
   comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement or retained
   earnings, as appropriate.

for the accounting treatment of associated companies see 2.3 q).

2.3      summary of significant accounting policies

a) business combinations and goodwill
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. the cost
of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred,
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree. for each business combination, dufry selects whether it
measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. acquisition related
transaction costs are expensed and included in other operational result. when
dufry acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed
for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual
terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognized
at fair value at the acquisition date. contingent consideration classified as an asset
or liability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of ias 39 financial
instruments: recognition and measurement, is measured at fair value with the
changes in contingent considerations recognized in the income statement.

dufry measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
– the fair value of the consideration transferred;
– plus the recognized amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree;
– plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-
  existing equity interest in the acquiree;
– less the net recognized amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities
  assumed.

when the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognized immediately in
the income statement.

dufry annual report 2016




after initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impair-
ment losses. for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of dufry’s cash-gen-
erating units that are expected to benefit from the combination.

where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation
within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed
of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain
or loss on disposal of the operation. goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is
measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion
of the cash-generating unit retained, unless there are specific allocations.

b) turnover
sales are measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding sales
taxes or duties. retail sales are settled in cash or by credit card, whereas advertis-
ing income is recognized when the services have been rendered.

c) cost of sales
cost of sales are recognized when the company sells a product and comprise the pur-
chase price and the cost incurred until the product arrives at the warehouse, i. e.
import duties, transport, inventory valuation adjustments and inventory differences.

d) foreign currency translation
the financial statements are expressed in millions of swiss francs (chf). each
company in dufry uses its corresponding functional currency and items included
in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional
currency. transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional
currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-measured
to their fair value in the functional currency using the exchange rate at the report-
ing date and recorded as unrealized foreign exchange gains / losses. exchange
differences arising on the settlement or on the translation of derivative financial
instruments are recognized through the income statement, except where the
hedges on net investments allow the recognition in other comprehensive income,
until the respective investments are disposed of. any related deferred tax is also
accounted through other comprehensive income. non-monetary items are mea-
sured at historical cost in the respective functional currency.

at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries reporting in for-
eign currency are translated into the presentation currency of dufry (chf) using
the exchange rate at the reporting date. the income statements of the subsidiaries
are translated using the average exchange rates of the respective month in which
the transactions occurred. the net translation differences are recognized in other
comprehensive income. on disposal of a foreign entity or when control is lost, the
deferred cumulative translation difference recognized within equity relating to
that particular operation is recognized in the income statement as gain or loss on
sale of subsidiaries.

intangible assets and fair value adjustments identified during a business combina-
tion (purchase price allocation) are treated as assets and liabilities in the functional
currency of such operation.

e) equity instruments
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the ­assets
of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. equity instruments issued by the group
are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. repurchase of
dufry’s own equity instruments is recognized and deducted directly in equity. no
gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or
cancellation of dufry’s own equity instruments.

f) share capital
ordinary shares are classified as equity. mandatory convertible notes are classified
as compound financial instruments (see 2.3 g) below.

costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares or options are shown in the state­
ment of changes in equity as transaction costs for equity instruments, net of tax.

when any subsidiary purchases dufry shares (treasury shares), the consideration
paid, including any directly attributable expenses, net of income taxes, is deducted
from equity until the shares are cancelled, assigned or sold. where such ordinary
shares are subsequently sold, any consideration received, net of any direct trans­
action expenses and income tax, is included in equity.

g) compound financial instruments
compound financial instruments issued by dufry comprise convertible notes that
can be converted to share capital. the number of shares to be issued is dependent
on the changes in their fair value.

the liability component of a compound financial instrument is recognized initially
at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an equity conversion option.
the equity component is recognized initially at the difference between the fair value
of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the fair value of the liability
component and is represented in equity for the date of inception. the directly attri­
butable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components in
proportion to their initial carrying amounts.

subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of a compound financial
instrument is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. the
equity component of a compound financial instrument is not re-measured except
on conversion or expiry.

the liability component is classified as current liabilities unless dufry has an
­unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the end of the
 reporting period.

dufry annual report 2016




h) leases
leases of property, plant and equipment where the group, as lessee, has substan-
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. finance
leases are capitalized at the leases’ inception at the fair value of the leased prop-
erty or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. the correspond-
ing rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and
long-term payables. each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance
cost. the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability for each period. the property, plant and equipment acquired under
­finance leases is depreciated over the asset’s useful life or over the shorter of the
 asset’s useful life and the lease term if there is no reasonable certainty that the
 group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.

leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the group as lessee are classified as operating leases. payments
made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are
charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

i) linearization
in cases where fees for the concession are based on fixed or determinable amounts
of money, the expenses paid are treated as operational leases. for these operational
leases when the amounts are increasing or decreasing over the time dufry accrues
the difference between the amount paid and the respective straight-line expenses
for the period calculated over the overall duration of the contract, as linearization.
in addition, this line item includes the reduction in concession payments granted
based on an upfront payment done at the inception of two spanish contracts
­(madrid and barcelona as main airports), acquired as part of the world duty free
 acquisition (see note 6.1).

j) pension and other post-employment benefit obligations
the employees of the subsidiaries are eligible for retirement, invalidity and death
benefits under local social security schemes prevailing in the countries concerned
and defined benefit or defined contribution plans provided through separate funds,
insurance plans, or unfunded arrangements. the pension plans are either funded
through regular contributions made by the employer or the employee or unfunded.

the cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined using the
projected unit credit method.

re-measurements, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest) and the
return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognized in the statement of
financial position with a corresponding debit or credit to other comprehensive
­income in the period in which they occur. re-measurements are not reclassified
 to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

past service costs are recognized in profit or loss on the earlier of:
–– the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
–– the date that dufry recognizes restructuring related costs




                                                                                          105

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit
obligation (asset). dufry recognizes the following changes in the net defined bene-
fit obligation in the income statement:
– service costs comprising current service costs, past service costs, gains and
    losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements under “personnel expenses”
– net interest expense or income under “interest expenses or income”

k) share-based payments
equity settled share based payments to employees and other third parties provid-
ing services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at grant date.
the fair value determined at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments
is expensed on a pro rata basis over the vesting period, based on the estimated
number of equity instruments that will eventually vest. at the end of each reporting
period, dufry revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to
vest. the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognized in the
income statement such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate.

where the terms of an equity settled award are modified, the minimum expense
recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been modified. an additional
expense is recognized for any modification, which increases the total fair value of
the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the holder of
the option as measured at the date of modification.

l) taxation
income tax expense represents the sum of the current income tax and deferred
tax. where a different functional currency is used, the position includes the changes
in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities due to foreign exchange translation.

income tax positions not relating to items recognized in the income statement, are
recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehen-
sive income or equity.

current income tax
income tax receivables or payables are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. the tax rates and tax laws used to
compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date in the countries where dufry operates and generates taxable income.

income tax relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income is recog-
nized in the same statement.

deferred tax
deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial report-
ing purposes at the reporting date.




106

consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except:
– when the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or
  an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at
  the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable
  profit or loss
– in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in
  subsidiaries, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can
  be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse
  in the foreseeable future

deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the
carry forward of unused tax credits or tax losses. deferred tax assets are recog-
nized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available, against
which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except:
– when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference
   arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is
   not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither
   the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss
– in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in
   subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is
   probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future
   and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can
   be utilized.

the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will
be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be utilized. unrecognized deferred
tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent
that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax
asset to be recovered.

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected
to apply in the year when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the
reporting date applicable for each respective company.

m) property, plant and equipment
these are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in fair
value. depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. the useful lives applied are
as follows:
– real estate (buildings) 20 to 40 years
– leasehold improvements the shorter of the lease term or 10 years
– furniture and fixtures the shorter of the lease term or 5 years
– motor vehicles the shorter of the lease term or 5 years
– computer hardware the shorter of the lease term or 5 years




                                                                                           107

dufry annual report 2016




n) intangible assets
these assets mainly comprise of concession rights and brands. dufry considers
that these assets have indefinite useful lives, when concession rights are granted
by one of the non-controlling interests holder of the company, or for brands when
the company considers to use the brand for the foreseeable future. intangible
assets acquired separately are capitalized at cost and those from a business
combination are capitalized at fair value as at the date of acquisition. following
initial recognition, the cost model is applied to intangible assets. the useful lives
of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life. intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed annually to determine whether the
indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. if not, any changes are made
on a prospective basis.

o) impairment of non-financial assets
intangible assets with indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are
tested annually for impairment. assets that are subject to depreciation and amor-
tization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recog-
nized when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value
less cost of disposal and its value in use. for the purpose of assessing impairment,
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable
cash inflows (cash generating units).

p) non-current assets held for sale or for distribution to equity holders
of the parent and discontinued operations
dufry classifies investments as held for sale or for distribution to equity holders
of the parent if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale
or distribution rather than through continuing use. dufry measures these at the
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell or to distribute.

assets and liabilities classified as held for sale or for distribution are presented
separately in the statement of financial position.

a disposal group qualifies as discontinued operation if it is:
– a major line of business or major geographical area;
– part of a single coordinated plan for disposal; or
– a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale

discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations
and are presented as a single amount as net earnings after tax from discontinued
operations in the consolidated statement of income.

q) associates
associates are all entities over which dufry has significant influence but not
control, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 20 % of the voting
rights. investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. under the equity method, the investment is initially recognized at cost.
the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor’s share
of the net earnings of the investee after the date of acquisition and decreased by
dividends declared. dufry’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified
on acquisition.

consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




dufry’s share of post-acquisition net earnings is recognized in the income state-
ment, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income
is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding
adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. when dufry’s share of losses
in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, dufry does not
recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations
or made payments on behalf of the associate. if the ownership interest in an asso-
ciate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of
the amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified
to net earnings where appropriate.

dufry determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence
that the investment in the associate is impaired. if this is the case, dufry calculates
the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of
the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount adjacent to share
of result of associates in the income statement.

profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between
dufry and its associate are recognized in the group’s financial statements only to
the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. unrealized losses are
eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred. accounting policies of associates have been changed where neces-
sary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by dufry.

dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognized in the
income statement.

r) inventories
inventories are valued at the lower of historical cost or net realizable value. the
historical costs are determined using the fifo method. historical cost includes all
expenses incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condi-
tion. this includes mainly import duties and transport cost. purchase discounts
and rebates are deducted in determining the cost of inventories. the net realizable
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. inventory allowances are set up in
the case of slow-moving and obsolete stock. expired items are fully written off.

s) trade and credit card receivables / trade payables
receivables and payables in respect of the sale / purchase of merchandise are
included in these positions.

t) cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand or current bank accounts as
well as short-term deposits at banks with initial maturity below 91 days. credit card
receivables with a maturity of up to 4 days are included as cash in transit. short-
term investments are included in this position if they are highly liquid, readily
convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes
in value. in 2016, there were no short-term deposits due within 90 days (2015:
chf 29.5 million).

u) provisions
provisions are recognized when the group has a present obligation (legal or construc-
tive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that dufry will be required to settle
the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.



                                                                                          109

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




the amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate at the end of the report-
ing period of the consideration required to settle the present obligation, taking into
account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. when a provision
is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its
carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the
time value of money is material).

when some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected
to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is
virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount of the
receivable can be measured reliably.

contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination
contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are initially measured at
fair value at the acquisition date. at the end of subsequent reporting periods, such
contingent liabilities are measured at the higher of the amount that would be rec-
ognized in accordance with ias 37 provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent
assets and the amount initially recognized less cumulative amortization recognized
in accordance with ias 18 revenue.

onerous contracts
present obligations arising under onerous contracts are measured and recognized
as provisions. an onerous contract is considered to exist if dufry has a contract
under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract
exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract.

restructurings
a restructuring provision is recognized when dufry has developed a detailed formal
plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that
it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing
its main features to those affected by it. the measurement of a restructuring pro-
vision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which
are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not
associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.

v) financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. transaction
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets
and financial liabilities, other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss (fvtpl), are deducted from or added to the fair value of the
financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition. transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value
through profit or loss are recognized immediately in the income statement.

trade and other accounts receivable
trade and other receivables (including credit cards receivables, other accounts
receivable, cash and cash equivalents) are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method, less any impairment.




110

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




impairment of financial assets
financial assets, other than those at fvtpl, are assessed for indicators of impair-
ment at the end of each reporting period. financial assets are considered to be
impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events
that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated
future cash flows of the financial asset have been affected. certain categories of
financial assets, such as trade receivables, are assessed for impairment individually.
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the
allowance accounts for these categories. changes in the carrying amount of the
allowance account are recognized in the income statement in the lines selling
expenses or other operational result.

derecognition of financial assets
dufry derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash
flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substan-
tially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. if dufry
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
and continues to control the transferred as set, dufry recognizes its retained
interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. if
dufry retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred
financial asset, dufry continues to recognize the financial asset and also recog-
nizes a collateralized borrowing for the proceeds received.

financial liabilities at fvtpl
these are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on re-measurement
recognized in the income statement. the net gain or loss recognized in the consol-
idated income statement incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability
and is included in the financial result in the income statement. fair value is deter-
mined in the manner described in note 37.

other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

derecognition of financial liabilities
dufry derecognizes financial liabilities only when the obligations are discharged,
cancelled or expired. the difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognized and the consideration paid or payable is recognized in the
consolidated income statement.

offsetting of financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported
in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforce-
able legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle
on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously (see
note 38.10).

w) derivative financial instruments
dufry enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its expo-
sure to interest rate or foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange
forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps. further details
of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 38.




                                                                                         111

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts
are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end
of each reporting period. the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income
statement unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument,
in which event the timing of the recognition in the income statement depends on
the nature of the hedge relationship.

embedded derivatives
derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of
the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at fvtpl.

x) hedge accounting
dufry designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives and non-
derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow
hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. hedges of foreign
exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

at the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk manage-
ment objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. fur-
thermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, dufry documents
whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

hedge accounting is discontinued when dufry revokes the hedging relationship,
when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when
it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. any gain or loss recognized in other
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time, is recognized when
the underlying hedged item is ultimately derecognized in the income statement.

cash flow hedges
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated
and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and
accumulated in the hedging and revaluation reserves. the gain or loss relating to
the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement, and is included in
the interest expenses / income line item.

fair-value hedges
when a hedging instrument is used to hedge the exposure to changes in fair value,
changes in the fair value of the instrument are recognized in other comprehensive
income. the derivative instrument used is interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate
risk on borrowings. if the hedge relationship is discontinued, the carrying amount
of the hedged item is adjusted with the accumulated amount referring to the hedge
relationship.

hedges of net investments in foreign operations
hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash
flow hedges. any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective
portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumu-
lated under the heading of translation reserves. the gain or loss relating to the
ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement, and is
included in the foreign exchange gains / losses line item (see notes 31.1 and 31.2).

2.4      changes in accounting policy and disclosures

new and amended standards and interpretations
the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous finan-
cial year, except for the revised standards and the interpretations adopted in these
financial statements (effective january 1, 2016). their adoption did not have a sig-
nificant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclo-
sures therein.

annual improvements 2012 – 2014 – issued september 2014
– ifrs 5 non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations: changes
  in methods of disposal are clarified, i. e. whether such a change in a disposal method
  would qualify as a change to a plan of sale. this amendment does not currently
  have any impact on dufry.
– ifrs 34 interim financial reporting: disclosure of information “elsewhere in the
  interim financial report” is clarified and requires the inclusion of a cross reference
  from the interim financial statements to the location of this information.

disclosure initiative (amendments to ias 1 –
presentation of financial statements)
– materiality: aggregation or disaggregation should not obscure useful information.
   materiality applies to each of the primary financial statements, the notes and
   each specific disclosure required by ifrs.
– line items in primary financial statements: additional guidance for line items to
   be presented in primary statements and new requirements regarding the use
   of subtotals.
– notes to the financial statements: determination of the order of the notes
   should include consideration of understandability and comparability of financial
   statements.
– equity accounted investments: an entity’s share of other comprehensive income
   would be split between those items that will and will not be reclassified to profit
   or loss, and presented in aggregate as single line items within those two groups.




                                                                                           113

3.       critical accounting judgments and key sources
         of estimation uncertainty

the preparation of dufry’s financial statements requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income,
expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the
reporting date.

key sources of estimation uncertainty

the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation
include uncertainties at the reporting date, which may have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial periods, are discussed below.

concession rights
concession rights acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value
as at the date of acquisition. the useful lives of operating concessions are assessed
to be either finite or indefinite based on individual circumstances and are con-
sidering extensions and renewals. the useful lives of operating concessions are
reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment for
those concessions continues to be sustainable. dufry annually tests the operat-
ing concessions with indefinite useful lives and assesses those with finite lives for
impairment indications. the underlying calculation requires the use of estimates.
the comments and assumptions used are disclosed in note 20.1.2.

onerous contracts
some of the long-term concession agreements described above include clauses
to prevent early termination, such as obligations to fulfill guaranteed minimal pay-
ments during the full term of the agreement. the conditions for an onerous con-
tract will be met, when such a contract presents a non-profitable outlook. in this
event, a provision based on the present value of the unavoidable future negative
cash flows expected by the management is established. the unavoidable costs are
the lower of the costs of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from
failure to fulfil it. further details are given in note 32.

brands and goodwill
dufry tests these items annually for impairment. the underlying calculation requires
the use of estimates. the comments and assumptions used are disclosed in
note 20.1.

income taxes
dufry is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. significant judgment is
required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. there are many
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax assessment is uncertain.
dufry recognizes liabilities for tax audit issues based on estimates of whether
additional taxes will be payable. where the final tax outcome is different from the
amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax
or deferred tax provisions in the period in which such assessment is made. further
details are given in notes 15 and 22.

3 financial report
consolidated financial statements
dufry annual report 2016




deferred tax assets
deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and deductible tempo-
rary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
against which the losses can be utilized. management judgment is required to deter-
mine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the
likely timing and level of future taxable profits. further details are given in note 22.

provisions
management makes assumptions in relation to the expected outcome and cash
outflows based on the development of each individual case. further details are
given in note 32.

share-based payments
dufry measures the cost of equity settled transactions with employees by refer-
ence to the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. estimating such
fair values require determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant
of equity instruments, which depends on the terms and conditions of the grant, as
well as, the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected
probability that the triggering clauses will be met. the result will be the expected
quantity of shares to be assigned. the assumptions and models used are disclosed
in note 28.

pension and other post-employment benefit obligations
the cost of defined benefit pension plans is determined using actuarial valuations.
the actuarial valuation involves assumptions about discount rates, future salary and
pension increases as well as mortality rates. due to the long-term nature of these
plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. further details are given
in note 33.

purchase price allocation
the determination of the fair values of the identifiable assets (especially the con-
cession rights) and the assumed liabilities (especially the contingent liabilities rec-
ognized as provisions), resulting from business combinations, is based on valuation
techniques such as the discounted cash flow model. some of the inputs to this model
are partially based on assumptions and judgments and any changes thereof would
affect the reported values (see note 6).

consolidation of entities where dufry has control,
but holding only minority voting rights
dufry considers controlling certain entities, even when it holds less than the major-
ity of the voting rights, when it is exposed to or has the rights to variable returns from
the involvements with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. these indicators are evaluated at the time of first consoli-
dation and reviewed when there are changes in the statutes or composition of the
executive board of these entities. further details on non-controlling interests are
disclosed in notes 29 and 30 as well as the annex “most important subsidiaries”.




                                                                                             115

4.       new and revised standards and interpretations issued
         but not yet adopted / effective

the standards and interpretations described below are expected to have an impact
on dufry’s financial position, performance, and / or disclosures. dufry intends to
adopt these standards when they become effective.

disclosure initiative – amendments to ias 7 statement of cash flows
(effective january 1, 2017)
requires additional disclosure of changes in liabilities arising from financing
activities.

ias 12
income taxes (effective january 1, 2017)
additional amendments have been issued by the iasb regarding ias 12 on the
recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealized losses. these amendments clar-
ify how to account for deferred tax assets related to debt instruments measured
at fair value.

ifrs 9
financial instruments (effective january 1, 2018)
phase 1: classification and measurement – determines how financial assets and
financial liabilities are accounted for and measured on an ongoing basis.
phase 2: impairment – a new single expected loss impairment model is introduced
that will require more timely recognition of expected credit losses.
phase 3: hedge accounting – the new model aligns the accounting treatment with
risk management activities, users of the financial statements will be provided with
better information about risk management and the effect of hedge accounting on
the financial statements.

the adoption of the first phase of ifrs 9 will have an effect on the classification
and measurement of dufry’s financial assets, but will not impact the financial
liabilities. phase 2 is not expected to have any significant impact on the financial
statements and phase 3 is expected to affect the disclosure requirements.

ifrs 15
revenue from contracts with customers (effective january 1, 2018)
ifrs 15, revenue from contracts with customers deals with revenue recognition and
establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial state-
ments about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. revenue is recognized when a
customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the
use and obtain the benefits from the good or service.

the standard replaces ias 18 revenue and ias 11 construction contracts and re-
lated interpretations. dufry has analyzed the impact of the standard, however, has
not identified any material changes to the current revenue recognition approach,
as dufry does not have customer contracts. dufry considered the following aspects:

(a) sale of goods
dufry’s retail sales are in cash or credit card and the revenue recognition occurs
when the assets are transferred to the customer,

(b) advertising income
advertising income is recognized when the services have been rendered.

dufry annual report 2016




ifrs 16
leases (effective january 1, 2019)
lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make
lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset
for the lease term. the lease liability will be measured at present value of the lease
payments to be made over the lease term. in other words, lessees will appear to
become more asset-rich but also more indebted. to be considered as such, a lease
agreement has to convey the right to control the use of an identified asset through-
out the period of use, so that the customer has the right to obtain substantially all
of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset; and direct the use
of the identified asset (i.e. direct how and for what purpose the asset is used).

the standard will mainly affect the accounting of:

a) concession agreements
dufry enters into concession agreements with operators of airports, seaports,
railway stations etc. to operate retail shops. usually these arrangements require
a variable compensation based on sales or other activity indicators, with a minimum
threshold. in those cases where at the inception of the agreement the minimum
amounts can be calculated reliably over the respective contractual terms, dufry
will account for this part as a lease in accordance with ifrs 16,

b) rent agreements for office and warehouse buildings
these agreements will usually qualify as leases under ifrs 16, except if the dura-
tion is shorter than 12 months.

dufry is currently conducting a detailed survey and compliance analysis of relevant
agreements and expects material changes in its statement of financial position.

amendments that are considered to be insignificant from a current point of view:

sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate
or joint venture (proposed amendments to ifrs 10 and ias 28)
(effective date not yet defined by iasb)
the gain or loss resulting from the sale to or contribution from an associate of
­assets that constitute a business as defined in ifrs 3 is recognized in full. the gain
 or loss resulting from the sale to or contribution from a subsidiary that does not
 constitute a business as defined in ifrs 3 (i.e. not a group of assets conforming a
 business) to an associate is recognized only to the extent of unrelated investors’
 interests in the associate.

annual improvements 2014 – 2016 – issued december 2016
ias 28 investment in associates and joint ventures (effective january 1, 2018)
clarification that the election to measure at fair value through profit or loss is
available on an investment-by-investment basis, upon initial recognition.




                                                                                          117

5.         segment information

dufry’s risks and returns are predominantly affected by the fact that dufry operates
in different countries. therefore, dufry presents the segment information as it does
internally to the group executive committee, using geographical segments and
the distribution centers as an additional segment.

as of january 1, 2016, after the acquisitions of the nuance and world duty free
businesses, dufry implemented the new management organization resulting in five
geographical divisions and one global distribution center segment.

we refer to the annex “most important subsidiaries” for the assignment of these
to the respective segments.

the comparative figures for 2015 were prepared consistently to reflect the above-
mentioned changes.

2016 transactions

2015 transactions

6.1      acquisition of world duty free s.p.a.

 on august 7, 2015, dufry acquired a first stake of 50.1 % in the voting equity interests
 in world duty free s.p.a. (wdf), a publicly listed company in italy for a total consi­
 deration of chf 1,407.1 (eur 1,307) million equivalent of eur 10.25 per share in cash.
 this initial acquisition of wdf triggered a successful mandatory tender offer (mto)
 for the outstanding 49.9 % of wdf shares. the acquisition was mainly financed
 through the issuance of share capital. this acquisition was accounted using the
­acquisition method.

continuing with its strategy to expand its travel retail business, dufry acquired wdf,
one of the top global travel retailers, to complement the geographical presence in
key markets such as the airports of heathrow, gatwick, stansted, manchester in
the uk, madrid, barcelona, las palmas and tenerife in spain, vancouver in canada,
29 destinations in the usa, as well as other key locations in jamaica, mexico, peru,
chile, finland, france, germany, italy, jordan, kuwait, and sri lanka. with more
than 500 shops in 105 locations in 20 countries, wdf achieved in 2014 a turnover
of eur 2,439.6 (chf 2,962.8) million and employed about 9,500 people.

dufry expects to generate significant cost and margin synergies through the inte­
gration of wdf into its common business model and supply chain as well as through
the combination of the global and divisional organizations and support functions,
which are reflected in the value of the goodwill. the resulting goodwill is not amor­
tized, is not tax deductible and is subject to annual impairment testing. wdf will
further enhance dufry’s global position in the travel retail market industry.

for this acquisition, dufry incurred transaction costs of chf 50.7 million in 2015
presented as other operational expenses and financial transaction taxes of
chf 12.3 million presented as other financial expenses in the income statement.




                                                                                            121

    i n cases where fees for concessions are based on determinable amounts of money over the lifetime of
     the contracts, expenses paid are treated as operational leases. when the amounts of operational leases
     are increasing or decreasing over the time, dufry accrues the difference between the amount paid and
     the respective straightlined expense for the period calculated over the overall duration of the contract,
     as linearization. in addition, this line item includes the reduction in concession payments granted based on
     an upfront payment (prepaid lease) done at the inception of two spanish contracts (madrid and barcelona

the expected tax rate in % approximates the average income tax rate of the coun-
tries where the group is active, weighted by the profitability of the respective oper­
ations. the increase compared to previous year in the average expected tax rate is
driven by the fact that wdf-entities are active in countries with higher income tax
rates and that in 2015 these entities where consolidated only since acquisition
(5 months). in 2016, there have been no significant changes in these income tax
rates, with the exception of uk where a decrease of the tax rate in 2020 has been
substantially enacted.

earnings per share adjusted for amortization (cash eps)

cash eps are calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to equity holders of
the parent, adjusted by the amortization effect generated by the intangible assets
identified during the purchase price allocations of past acquisitions through
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. with this cash eps, dufry
aims to facilitate the comparison at eps level with other companies not having
­performed such acquisition activities.

20.1     impairment test

concession rights with indefinite useful lives, as well as brands and goodwill are
subject to impairment testing each year. concession rights with finite useful lives
are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
­carrying amount may not be recoverable.

20.1.1 impairment test of goodwill
for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill recognized from business combi-
nations has been allocated to the following cash generating units (cgu’s). these
groups also reflect the reportable segments that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the business combinations:

* the restatement is commented in note 39. the above units are regrouped according to the new segments

as basis for the calculation of these discount rates, the group uses the weighted
average cost of capital, based on the following risk free interest rates (derived from
past 5 year average of prime 10-year bonds rates): chf 0.15 %, eur 0.83 %,
usd 2.08 % (2015: chf 0.40 %, eur 1.22 %, usd 2.16 %).

for the calculation of the discount rates and wacc (weighted average cost of

sensitivity to changes in assumptions
management believes that any reasonably possible change (+ / – 1 %) in the key
­assumptions, on which the recoverable amounts are based, would not cause the
 respective recoverable amount to fall below the carrying amount.

20.1.2 impairment test of concession rights with indefinite useful lives
concession rights are tested for impairment purposes at company level, which
represents the cash generating unit. at present, the only concession rights with
indefinite useful lives of eur 40.1 (2015: 43.6) million are located in italy. they are
considered to be with indefinite useful lives as the concessions were granted by
the non-controlling interest holder.

the recoverable amounts of each cash generating unit (cgu) is determined based
on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions (see table with
key assumptions below). the calculations use cash flow projections based on finan­
cial forecasts approved by the management covering a five-year period. cash flows
beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate that does
not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the respective market and are
consistent with forecasted growth included in the travel related retail industry
­reports. the financial results of the distribution centers have been broken down
 by cgu and allocated accordingly.

the key assumptions used for determining the recoverable amounts for italy are:

                                       post tax discount rates       pre tax discount rates   growth rates for net sales

sensitivity analysis to changes in assumptions
with regard to the assessment of value-in-use, dufry believes that no reasonably
possible change (+ / – 1 %) in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recov­
erable amount of the concession rights to materially fall below the carrying amount.

20.1.3 key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations
the calculation of value-in-use is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
–– sales growth
–– growth rate used to extrapolate
–– gross margin and suppliers prices
–– concession fee levels
–– discount rates

sales growth
sales growth is based on statistics published by external experts, such as air4cast
or aci (airports council international) to estimate the development of interna-
tional passenger traffic per country where dufry is active. for the budget year, the
management also takes into consideration specific price inflation factors of the
country, the cross currency effect and the expected potential changes to capture
clients (penetration) per business unit.

for the period after 5 years, dufry has used a growth rate of 2.0 % – 3.0 % (2015:
2.0 % – 3.0 %) to extrapolate the cash flow projections.

gross margins
the expected gross margins are based on average product assortment values
­estimated by the management for the budget 2017. these values are maintained
 over the planning period or where specific actions are planned and have been
 ­increased or decreased by up to 1 % over the 5 year planning horizon compared to
  the historical data. the gross margin is also affected by supplier’s prices. estimates
  are obtained from global negotiations held with the main suppliers for the products
  and countries for which products are sourced, as well as data relating to specific
  commodities during the months before the budget.

concession fee levels
these assumptions regarding the concession fee evolution are important and
­monitored in the specific market as well as the renewal conditions and competitor
 behavior where the cgu’s are active. for the cgu’s subject to a value-in-use
 ­calculation, the management expects the competitive position to remain stable
  over the budget period.

discount rates
several factors affect the discount rates:
–– for the financial debt part, the rate is based on the average interest of the past
   5 years of the respective ten-year government bond and is increased by the
   company’s effective bank spread and adjusted by the effective blended tax rate
   and country risk of the respective cgu.
–– for the equity part, a 5 % equity risk premium is added to the base rate commented
   above and adjusted by the beta of dufry’s peer group.

the same methodology is used by the management to determine the discount rate
used in discounted cash flow (dcf) valuations, which are a key instrument to assess
business potential of new or additional investment proposals.




                                                                                           141

20.1.4 brands
dufry presented its new brand strategy in october 2015. while at corporate level
the group is recognized under the name of dufry, for retail purposes, it is apply-
ing a multi-brand concept including, among others, brands like: dufry, hudson,
world duty free, nuance, hellenic duty free, regstaer, colombian emeralds, duty
free caribbean, do brasil and interbaires. the book values of these brand names
remain at fair value recognized at acquisition and are subject to annual impairment
testing. with regard to the assessment of value-in-use, dufry believes that no
­reasonably possible change (+ / – 1 %) in any of the below key assumptions would
 cause that the recoverable amount falls materially below the carrying value of the
 respective brand name.

the recoverable amount is determined using the relief of royalty method that con-
siders a steady cash flow income from the royalty income after tax on projected
sales for each brand. the following table indicates the key assumptions used for
the valuation of the main brands:
                                           royalty income rate after tax      post tax discount rates           growth rates for net sales

these sales growth rates are in line with the assumptions used for the impairment
test of goodwill. the discount rates represent the weighted average cost of capital
(wacc) of the markets where the brand is generating sales.

unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
dufry has not recognized deferred tax liabilities associated with investments in
subsidiaries where dufry can control the reversal of the timing differences and
where it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foresee-
able future. dufry does not expect that these differences result in taxable amounts
in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount
of the investment is recovered.

relationship clause. as of december 31, 2016, no psu award 2016 forfeited, so that
all psu award 2016 remain outstanding.

on october 27, 2016, the board of directors decided, upon proposal by the remu-
neration committee, to pay out half of the 2015 bonus through a share program.
therefore, 85,015 rights to receive shares (rrs) were awarded to the gec and se-
lected members of the senior management. these rrs have a contractual life of
26 months and will vest on january 1, 2019. at grant date the fair value of one rrs
represents the market value for one dufry share at that date, i.e. chf 127.00, ad-
justed by the probability that participants comply with the ongoing contractual re-
lationship clause. as of december 31, 2016, no rrs forfeited, so that all rrs re-
main outstanding.

one psu (award 2016 or award 2015) will give the right to the holders to receive
free of charge up to two dufry shares depending on the effective cumulative
amount of cash earnings per share (cash eps) reached by dufry during the years
of award and the following two years compared with the target (2016: chf 24.59,
2015: chf 24.12). the cash eps equals the basic earnings per share adjusted for
amortization of intangible assets identified during business combinations and non-
recurring effects. if at vesting the cumulative adjusted cash eps is at target level,
each psu grants one share. if the cumulative adjusted cash eps is at 150 % of the
target (maximum threshold) or above, each psu grants two shares at vesting, and
if the adjusted cash eps is at 50 % of the target (minimum threshold) or below, no
share will be granted at vesting. if the adjusted cash eps is between 50 % and 150 %
of the target, the number of shares granted for each psu will be allocated on a lin-
ear basis. additionally, the allocation of shares is subject to an ongoing contrac-
tual relationship of the participant with dufry throughout the vesting period. hold-
ers of psu are not entitled to vote or receive dividends, like shareholders do.

one rrs (award 2016) will give the right to the holders to receive free of charge
one dufry share subject to an ongoing contractual relationship with dufry through-
out the vesting period (award 2016 until january 1, 2019). holders of these rights
are not entitled to vote or receive dividends, like shareholders do.

with the award 2014 dufry granted to the members of the gec 51,486 psu op-
tions. one psu gave the right to receive in 2017, free of charge, up to two shares,
based on the performance achieved by dufry. for the psu award 2014, the per-
formance was measured as the average yearly growth rate to be reached by the
earnings per share adjusted for amortization of intangible assets identified during
business combinations and non-recurrent effects (adjusted cash eps) of dufry
between the years 2013 and 2016. each psu granted the right to receive one dufry
share if the targeted average yearly growth of 7 % would have been achieved; no
share if the average yearly growth rate would have been 3.5 % or lower and two
shares if the average growth rate would have been 10.5 % or higher. if the effective
growth rate would have been between 3.5 % and 10.5 % the number of shares
granted for each psu would have been allocated on a linear basis. additionally, the
allocation of shares was subject to an ongoing contractual relationship of the par-
ticipant with dufry from january 1, 2014, until january 1, 2017. at january 1, 2017,
the psu award 2014 vested achieving an average yearly growth of 5.1 % so that each
psu will be exchanged for 0.45 dufry shares, i.e. 20,020 shares in total.

in 2016 dufry recognized through profit and loss share-based payment expenses
for a total of chf 4.7 (2015: 2.8) million.

management believes that its provisions are adequate based upon currently avail-
able information. however, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in
the areas described below, actual costs may vary from the amounts provisioned.

contingent liabilities

dufry as internationally operating company is exposed to contingent liabilities in
respect of legal and tax claims in the ordinary course of business. it is not antici-
pated that any material liabilities will arise from the contingent liabilities other than
provided for.

in 2016, the contingent liabilities decreased by chf 10.7 million and relate to the
reversal of the provision for vat in argentina. in 2015 restated, the contingent
­liabilities increased by chf 8.9 million based on findings in europe recognized ­during
 the due diligence and the integration process made for the acquisition of the world
 duty free group.

ifrs 3 business combinations requires to reflect these liabilities with uncertain
amounts in the statement of financial position although the risk exposure for some
of these positions has been regarded as medium or low. the identified risks include
a variety of potential liabilities from past periods, mainly related to the import and
sale of merchandise by entities under common control or regarding contributions
owed based on the contractual situation of employees. as the identified risks implied
in these contingent liabilities are subject to interpretations and uncertainties in
the respective regulations, the management made an estimation of the fair value.




                                                                                                                                      159

onerous contracts

concession agreements usually fix the fee for the locations as a percentage on net
sales. some of these long-term concession agreements, which dufry has entered
into, include clauses to ensure a minimal concession fee during the full term of the
agreement. however, in certain circumstances the economic environment around
an activity deteriorates in such a way that it is highly unlikely that the operation
will become profitable during the remaining concession duration. in such cases
dufry does impair the assets subject to amortization or depreciation and creates
a provision for onerous contracts. this provision reflects the present value of the
unavoidable cost (losses) of meeting the contractual obligation. at balance sheet
date, an amount of chf 157.4 (2015: 171.3) million has been provided in relation to
operations in asia, europe and australia.

close down

the provision of chf 8.9 (2015: 42.0) million relates mainly to the closing of operations
in asia and europe.

labor disputes

the provision of chf 3.8 (2015: 2.3) million relates mainly to claims presented by sales
staff based on disputes related to the termination of temporary labor contracts
in brazil.

lawsuits and duties

these provisions of chf 33.3 (2015: 21.7) million cover uncertainties dependent on
the outcome of law suits in relation to taxes, duties or other claims in india, ­turkey,
united kingdom, brazil, ecuador and italy. two of dufry’s dormant operation in india
still keep two open claims (chf 13.2 million) in relation with customs duties and the
other in relation with service taxes. dufry expects that both cases won’t be finally
judged in the next year.

other

these provisions relate mainly to the restoration of leased shops to their original
condition. the charge for the year includes a provision for the expenses expected
to be incurred in relation to the structural improvements and the integration of
support functions of the organization. the utilization of the year is mainly related
to the restructuring program in spain and the united kingdom.

cash outflows of non-current provisions

the expected timing of the related cash outflows of non-current provisions as of
december 31, 2016 is currently projected as follows:
                                                                                                  expected

 law on occupational retirement, survivors’ and disability pension plans (bvg), which
 stipulates that pension plans are to be managed by independent, legally autono-
 mous units. pension plans are overseen by a regulator as well as by a state super-
 visory body. a pension plan’s most senior governing body (board of trustees) must
 be composed of equal numbers of employee and employer representatives. the
 various insurance benefits are governed in regulations, with the bvg specifying
 the minimum benefits that are to be provided. the employer and employees pay
 contributions to the pension plan. in case of an underfunding, various measures
 can be taken such as the adjustment of the pension benefits, by altering the actu-
 arial assumptions or increasing future contributions. the employer can also make
 additional restructuring contributions. the bvg prescribes how the employer and
 the employee have to jointly fund potential restructurings.

these risks consist of demographic risks, primarily life expectancy, and financial
risks such as the discount rate, future increases in salaries / wages, and the return
on plan assets. these risks are regularly assessed by the board of trustees. in
­addition, two annual actuarial reports are submitted, one in accordance with the
 requirements of the bvg, the other in accordance with ifrs requirements.

the investment strategy is defined in form of a long-term target asset-, currency-
and risk-structure (investment policy), which takes into account requirements from
bvg, and aim to obtain a high long-term return on plan assets. the board of
­trustees is responsible for the investment of the assets, reviewing the investment
 portfolio as often as necessary – especially in the case of significant changes in
 the expectations of market developments and at least once a year. when review-
 ing the investment portfolio, it takes into account the limitations set in the strategy.
 the board of trustees delegates the implementation of the investment policy – in
 accordance with the investment strategy as well as various principles and objectives
 – to an investment committee, which consists of two members of the board of
 trustees. they supervise the entire investment process. the plan assets are managed
 by several external specialized and independent asset managers in accordance
 with the investment strategy, whereby the investments in properties are directly
 managed by the fund.

under swiss pension law dufry cannot recover any surplus from the pension funds,
because those belong to the foundations.

the pension funds currently invest in a diverse portfolio of asset classes including
equities, bonds, property and commodities but do not currently use any more
­explicit asset-liability matching strategy instruments such as annuity purchase
 products or longevity swaps.

there have been the following changes made to the swiss retirement benefit
arrange­ments in the periods covered by these financial statements:
–– in october 2015 dufry informed their employees about the planned transfer of
   the pkw into the pvn as of january 1, 2016. combined with this transfer the
   foundation board of the nuance group pension plan decided to change some
   of the plan benefits as from january 1, 2016, resulting in a plan change for all
   pension plan members. the plan change resulted in a past service credit of
   chf 3.3 million which has been recognized in the 2015 pension expenses.

dufry operates another defined benefit pension plan in the uk under specific
­regulatory frameworks. the uk plan provides a retirement benefit in the form of
 a pension payment based on a guaranteed percentage of salary accruing for each
 year of service, revalued to and payable from retirement. in the uk plan, pension
 payments increase annually in line with the retail price index, subject to certain
 limits. the pension payments are made from trustee-administered funds; however,
 where plans are underfunded, the company meets the benefit payment obligation
 as it falls due. the plan is governed by local legislation and its own trust documen-
 tation. the responsibility for the governance of the plan, including investment
 ­decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the board of trustees. the board
  of trustees must be composed of representatives of the company and plan
  ­participants in accordance with the plans’ regulations.

 sensitivities of significant actuarial assumptions
 the discount rate and the future salary increase were identified as significant
­actuarial assumptions.

the following impacts on the defined benefit obligation are to be expected:

                                                                                                      switzerland                                    uk

36.      commitments and contingencies

guarantee commitments

some long-term concession agreements, which dufry has entered into, include
obligations to fulfill minimal fee payments during the full term of the agreement.
some of these agreements have been backed with guarantees provided by dufry
or a financial institution. during the years 2016 or 2015, no party has exercised their
right to call upon such guarantees. all accrued, but still unpaid concession fees
are presented as liabilities in the balance sheet.


37.      fair value measurement

fair value of financial instruments carried at amortized cost

except as detailed in table quantitative disclosures fair value measurement hier-
archy for assets below, dufry considers that the carrying amounts of financial
­assets and financial liabilities recognized in the financial statements approximate
 their fair values.

the following tables provide the fair value measurement hierarchy of dufry’s ­assets
and liabilities, that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,
grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
–– level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted)
   in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
–– level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted
   prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
   directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
–– level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that
   include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
   data (unobservable inputs).

significant accounting policies are described in note 2.3 v) and following notes.

38.1       capital risk management

capital comprises equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent less
­hedging and revaluation reserves for unrealized gains or losses on net investment,
 plus other equity-linked or equity-like instruments attributable to the parent.

the primary objective of dufry’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains
an adequate credit rating and sustainable capital ratios in order to support its
­business and maximize shareholder value.

dufry manages its financing structure and makes adjustments to it in light of its
strategy and the long-term opportunities and costs of each financing source. to
maintain or adjust the financing structure, dufry may adjust dividend payments
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue equity-
linked instruments or equity-like instruments.

furthermore, dufry monitors the financing structure using a combination of ratios,
including a gearing ratio, cash flow considerations and profitability ratios. as for
the gearing ratio dufry includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrow­
ings, less cash and cash equivalents, excluding discontinued operations.

38.3     financial risk management objectives

as a global retailer, dufry has worldwide activities which need to be financed in dif-
ferent currencies and are consequently affected by fluctuations of foreign exchange
and interest rates. dufry’s treasury manages the financing of the operations
through centralized credit facilities to ensure an adequate allocation of these
­resources and simultaneously minimize the potential currency financial risk impacts.

dufry continuously monitors the market risk, such as risks related to foreign cur-
rency, interest rate, credit, liquidity and capital. dufry seeks to minimize the currency
exposure and interest rates risk using appropriate transaction structures or alter-
natively, using derivative financial instruments to hedge the exposure to these risks.
the treasury policy forbids entering or trading financial instruments for specula-
tive purposes.

38.4     market risk

dufry’s financial assets and liabilities are mainly exposed to market risk in foreign
currency exchange and interest rates. dufry’s objective is to minimize the income
statement impact and to reduce fluctuations in cash flows through structuring the
respective transactions to minimize market risks. in cases, where the associated
risk cannot be hedged appropriately through a transaction structure, and the eval-
uation of market risks indicates a material exposure, dufry may use financial
­instruments to hedge the respective exposure.

dufry may enter into a variety of financial instruments to manage its exposure to
foreign currency risk, including forward foreign exchange contracts, currency
swaps and over the counter plain vanilla options.

during the current financial year dufry utilized foreign currency forward contracts
and options for hedging purposes.

38.5      foreign currency risk management

dufry manages the cash flow surplus or deficits in foreign currency of the opera-
tions through fx-transactions in the respective local currency. major imbalances
in foreign currencies at group level are hedged through foreign exchange forwards
contracts. the terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been nego-
tiated to match the terms of the forecasted transactions.

38.5.1 foreign currency sensitivity analysis
among various methodologies to analyze and manage risk, dufry utilizes a system
based on sensitivity analysis. this tool enables group treasury to identify the level
of risk of each entity. sensitivity analysis provides an approximate quantification
of the exposure in the event that certain specified parameters were to be met ­under
a specific set of assumptions.

the sensitivity analysis includes all monetary assets and liabilities irrespective of
whether the positions are third party or intercompany. dufry has considered some
intercompany long-term loans as net investment in foreign operations. consequently,
the related exchange differences are presented in other comprehensive income
and thereafter as translation reserve in equity and dufry has entered into cross
currency swaps to reduce the currency exposure.

the foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign
exchange rate exposure of dufry entities at december 31 of the respective year.
the values and risk disclosed here are the hedged and not hedged positions
­assuming a 5 % appreciation of the chf against all other currencies.

38.5.2 foreign exchange forward contracts and
       foreign exchange options at fair value
as the management of the company actively pursues to naturally hedge the positions
in each operation, the policy of dufry is to enter into foreign exchange forward and
options contracts only where needed.

the following table shows the contracts or underlying principal amounts and fair
values of derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forwards
and foreign exchange swaps as well as cross currency interest rate swaps. con-
tracts or underlying principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstand-
ing at the balance sheet date. the fair values are determined by reference to mar-
ket prices or standard pricing models that used observable market inputs at
december 31 of each year. during 2016, dufry has entered into a number of cross
currency swap contracts in order to optimize interest expenses, which led to
a material increase of contractual underlying amounts as of december 31, 2016
compared to previous year.
                                                                    contract or

38.6     interest rate risk management

dufry manages the interest rate risk through interest rate swaps and options to the
extent that the hedging cannot be implemented through managing the duration of
the debt drawings. the levels of the hedging activities are evaluated regularly and
may be adjusted in order to reflect the development of the various parameters.
dufry had 6 outstanding interest swaps contracts during 2016 (9 in 2015).

38.6.1 interest rate swap contracts
the following table shows the contracts or underlying principal amounts and fair
values of derivative financial instruments. contracts or underlying principal amounts
indicate the volume of business outstanding at december 31. the fair values are
determined by reference to market prices or standard pricing models that used
observable market inputs at december 31. during 2016, dufry has entered into
a number of interest rate swaps in order to optimize interest expenses.

38.6.2 interest rate sensitivity analysis
the sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to
­interest rates derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the reporting date.
 the risk analysis provided here assumes a simultaneous increase of 100 basis points
 of the interest rate of all interest bearing financial positions.

if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher whereas all other variables were
held constant, dufry’s net earnings for the year 2016 would decrease by chf 43.2
(2015: decrease by 33.2) million.

38.7     credit risk management

credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty may default on its contractual
­obligations resulting in financial loss to dufry.

almost all dufry sales are retail sales made against cash or internationally recog-
nized credit / debit cards. dufry has policies in place to ensure that other sales are
only made to customers with an appropriate credit history or that the credit risk
is insured adequately. the remaining credit risk is in relation to taxes, refunds from
suppliers and guarantee deposits.

the credit risk on cash deposits or derivative financial instruments relates to banks
or financial institutions. dufry monitors the credit ranking of these institutions and
does not expect defaults from non-performance of these counterparties.

the main banks where the group keeps net assets positions hold a credit rating of
a – or higher.

38.7.1 maximum credit risk
the carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, after
deduction of any allowances for losses, represents dufry’s maximum exposure to
credit risk.

38.8     liquidity risk management

dufry evaluates this risk as the ability to settle its financial liabilities on time and
at a reasonable price. beside its capability to generate cash through its operations,
dufry mitigates liquidity risk by keeping unused credit facilities with financial
­institutions (see note 31).

38.8.1 remaining maturities for non-derivative financial assets and liabilities
the following tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows
of financial assets and liabilities (based on the earliest date on which dufry can
­receive or be required to pay). the tables include principal and interest cash flows.

             to the general meeting of
             dufry ag, basel

             basel, 7 march 2017


             statutory auditor’s report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements
             opinion
             we have audited the consolidated financial statements of dufry ag and its subsidiaries (the group), which comprise
             the consolidated income statement as at 31 december 2016 and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
             consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement
             of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of
             ­significant accounting policies.

             in our opinion the consolidated financial statements (pages 94 to 191) give a true and fair view of the consolidated
             ­f inancial position of the group as at 31 december 2016, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated
              cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) and comply
              with swiss law.

             basis for opinion
             we conducted our audit in accordance with swiss law, international standards on auditing (isas) and swiss auditing
             standards. our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the auditor’s responsi-
             bilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.

             we are independent of the group in accordance with the provisions of swiss law and the requirements of the swiss
             ­audit profession, as well as the iesba code of ethics for professional accountants, and we have fulfilled our other
              ­ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

             we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

             key audit matters
             key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
             consolidated financial statements of the current period. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
             the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate
             opinion on these matters. for each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in
             that context.

             we have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial
             statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. accordingly, our audit included the performance
             of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
             statements. the results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below,
             provide the basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

             goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
             area of focus
             goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful live represent 29 % of the group’s total assets and 89 % of the
             group’s total shareholders’ equity as at 31 december 2016. as stated in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements,
             the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful live is tested annually for impairment. the
             company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful live in the fourth
             quarter of 2016 and determined that there was no impairment. key assumptions relating to the impairment test are
             disclosed in note 20.1 to the consolidated financial statements. in determining the value in use of cash generating units
             and intangible assets with indefinite useful live, the company must apply judgment in estimating – amongst other
             factors – future sales and margins, long-term growth rates and discount rates. due to the significance of the carrying
             values for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and the judgment involved in performing the impairment test,
             this matter was considered significant to our audit.

             our audit response
             our procedures included, amongst other, an assessment of the company’s internal controls over its annual impairment
             test and key assumptions applied. we also evaluated management’s allocation of reporting units. we involved valuation
             specialists to assist in examining the company’s valuation model and analyzing the underlying key assumptions, including
             future sales, expected margins, long-term growth rates and discount rates (wacc). we assessed the historical accuracy
             of the company’s estimates and considered its ability to produce accurate long-term forecasts. our work moreover
             included an evaluation of the sensitivity in the valuation resulting from changes to the key assumptions applied and
             a comparison of these assumptions to corroborating information, including industry reports and statistics published
             by external experts to estimate the rate of future passenger growth.

             concession contracts / onerous contracts
             area of focus
             capitalized concession rights, amounting to chf 3,822 million, represent 39 % of the balance sheet total as at
             31 december 2016. the useful life of virtually all concession rights are assessed to be finite. concession rights acquired
             separately are capitalized at cost and those acquired in a business acquisition are capitalized at fair value as at the date
             of acquisition and are subject to impairment considerations as outlined in note 3 to the consolidated financial state-
             ments. in many instances, concession agreements include a concession payment, which is defined as a certain percent-
             age on net sales. some of these long-term concession agreements, which dufry has entered into, include clauses to
             ensure a minimal concession fee during the full term of the agreement (minimal annual guarantees, “mag”). under certain
             circumstances, the economic environment around an activity may deteriorate in such a way that it is unlikely that the
             operation will become profitable during the remaining concession duration. in such cases, dufry impairs tangible and
             intangible assets and creates, if still needed, a provision for onerous contracts. the fair value calculation of concession
             rights as well as the determination of provision for onerous contracts comprise significant judgment of management.

             our audit response
             in the course of our audit, we assessed whether valid concession contracts are on hand and evaluated the concession
             fees, including minimal annual guarantees. we assessed management’s process to identify potential impairments for
             capitalized concession rights. in addition, we focused on entities reporting negative cash flows in order to identify
             ­p otential impairment needs and potential onerous contracts. in connection with the acquisition of wdf group, we
              ­assessed the accounting treatment of acquired concession rights.

             tax accounting – deferred taxes as well as tax risks
             area of focus
             the company has operations in multiple countries, each with its own taxation regime. the nature of the group’s activities
             triggers various taxation obligations including corporation tax and employment related taxes. the cross-border n       ­ ature
             of the group’s sale of goods also creates complexities associated with international transfer pricing. application of
             taxation legislation to the group’s affairs is inherently complex, highly specialized, and requires judgement to be exercised
             in relation to estimating tax exposures and quantifying provisions and/or contingent liabilities. as at 31 december 2016,
             the group has current and deferred tax assets of chf 203 million, current and deferred tax payable of chf 563 million,
             and has disclosed a contingent liability of chf 68 million which includes tax-related exposures.

             the company has incurred tax losses of chf 805 million as at 31 december 2016. the company has recognized the tax
             losses to the extent that the realization of the related tax benefits through future taxable profits are probable. based
             on internal calculations with respect to the expected taxable profits in future years the company has recognized
             a ­deferred tax asset of chf 130 million. we refer to note 22 of the financial statements. this area was important to our
             audit due to the amount of the tax losses as well as the judgment involved in management’s assessment of the likelihood
             and magnitude of creating future taxable profits to offset the tax losses. this assessment requires the management
             board to make assumptions to be used in the forecasts of future taxable profits, including expectations for future sales
             and margin developments and overall market and economic conditions.

             our audit response
             in this area, our audit procedures included, amongst others, assessment of correspondence with the relevant tax
             ­authorities and the evaluation of tax exposures. in addition, in respect of deferred tax assets we assessed management’s
              assumptions to determine the probability that deferred tax assets recognized in the statement of financial position
              will be recovered through taxable income in future years and available tax planning strategies. we included tax spe-
              cialists to evaluate the assumptions used to determine tax positions. during our procedures, we also used management’s
              budgets and forecasts. in addition, where considered relevant, we evaluated the historical accuracy of management’s
              assumptions.

             in the annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consoli­
             dated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. if,
             based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we
             are required to report that fact. we have nothing to report in this regard.

             responsibility of the board of directors for the consolidated financial statements
             the board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and
             fair view in accordance with ifrs and the provisions of swiss law, and for such internal control as the board of directors
             determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
             misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

             in preparing the consolidated financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the group’s
             ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going
             concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations,
             or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

             auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
             our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
             free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
             reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
             swiss law, isas and swiss auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. misstatements
             can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
             expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

             a further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located at the
             ­website of expertsuisse: http://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-public-companies. this description forms
              part of our auditor’s report.


             report on other legal and regulatory requirements
             in accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 co and the swiss auditing standard 890, we confirm that an internal
             control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to
             the instructions of the board of directors.

             we recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

notes to the
financial
statements



1.       corporate information

dufry ag (the company) is a publicly listed company. the shares of the company
are listed on the swiss stock exchange (six) in zurich and its brazilian depository
receipts on the bm&fbovespa in sao paolo.

dufry ag was incorporated in 1865 and is registered with the commercial register
in the canton of basel stadt, switzerland.


2.       accounting policies

2.1      basis of preparation

these financial statements of dufry ag were prepared in accordance with the
­requirements of the swiss law on accounting and financial reporting (32nd title of
 the swiss code of obligations).

where not prescribed by law, the significant accounting and valuation principles
applied are described below.

2.2      summary of significant accounting policies

 financial assets
financial assets include loans. a valuation adjustment reserve has not been
­accounted for. loans granted in foreign currencies are translated at the rate at the
 balance sheet date, whereby unrealized losses are recorded through the income
 statement whereas unrealized profits are deferred within accrued liabilities.

treasury shares
treasury shares are recognized at acquisition cost and deducted from shareholders’
equity at the time of acquisition. in case of a resale, the gain or loss is recognized
through the income statement as financial income or expenses.

intangible assets
intangible assets generated internally are capitalized if they meet the following
conditions cumulatively at the date of recognition:
–– the intangible assets generated internally are identifiable and controlled by
   the entity;
–– the intangible assets generated internally will generate a measurable benefit for
   the entity for more than one year;
–– the expenses incurred in the creation of the intangible assets generated internally
   can be separately recognized and measured;
–– it is likely that the resources required to complete and market or use the intangible
   assets for the entity’s own purposes are available or will be made available.

 intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. as soon there
 are indicators that book values may be overstated, these are reviewed and, if
­necessary, adjusted.

share-based payments
should treasury shares be used for share-based payment programs for members
of the management, the difference between the acquisition costs and any consid-
eration paid by the employees at grant date is recognized as personnel expenses.

current interest-bearing liabilities
interest-bearing liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet at nominal value.

exchange rate differences
except for investments in subsidiaries which are translated at historical rates, all
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into swiss
francs (chf) using year-end exchange rates. realized exchange gains and losses
arising from these as well as those from business transactions denominated in
­foreign currencies are recorded in the income statement. net unrealized exchange
 losses are recorded in the income statement; net unrealized gains, as deferred
 within accrued liabilities.

foregoing a cash flow statement and additional disclosures in the notes
dufry ag has decided to forego presenting additional information on interest-­bearing
liabilities and audit fees in the notes as well as a cash flow statement in accordance
with the law, as it has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance
with a recognized accounting standard (ifrs),




                                                                                           199

             to the general meeting of
             dufry ag, basel

             basel, 7 march 2017


             report of the statutory auditor on the financial statements
             as statutory auditor, we have audited the financial statements of dufry ag, which comprise the income statement,
             statement of financial position and notes (pages 196 to 205), for the year ended 31 december 2016.

             board of directors’ responsibility
             the board of directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements
             of swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. this responsibility includes designing, implementing and main-
             taining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
             ­misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. the board of directors is further responsible for selecting and applying
              appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

             auditor’s responsibility
             our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit
             in accordance with swiss law and swiss auditing standards. those standards require that we plan and perform the
             ­audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

             an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
             statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of ­material
             misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor
             considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design
             audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
             effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the
             ­accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall
              ­presentation of the financial statements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appro-
               priate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

             opinion
             in our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2016 comply with swiss law and the company’s
             articles of incorporation.

             report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015
             of the federal audit oversight authority
             key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
             financial statements of the current period. these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
             statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
             for each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

             we have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the auditor’s responsibilities section of our report, including in relation
             to these matters. accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment
             of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. the results of our audit procedures, including the pro-
             cedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.

             recoverability of investments in subsidiaries
             area of focus
             as controlling company of the group, dufry ag directly and indirectly holds investments in various subsidiaries. the
             overview of investments in note 3 lists the significant companies directly held by dufry ag. the carrying amount for
             all investments is reflected in the balance sheet. in case of impairment indicators, management sets up an impairment
             test and makes the required value adjustments should this be necessary. in determining the fair value of the investments,
             the company must apply judgment in estimating – amongst other factors – future revenues and margins, multiples,
             long-term growth and discount rates. due to the significance of the carrying values for investments in subsidiaries and
             the judgment involved in performing the impairment test, this matter was considered significant to our audit.

             our audit response
             we examined the company’s valuation model and analyzed the underlying key assumptions, including future revenues
             and margins, long-term growth and discount rates. we assessed the historical accuracy of the company’s estimates
             and considered its ability to produce accurate long-term forecasts. we evaluated the sensitivity in the valuation resulting
             from changes to the key assumptions applied and compared these assumptions to corroborating information, including
             expected inflation rates and market growth.


             report on other legal requirements
             we confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the auditor oversight act (aoa) and inde-
             pendence (article 728 co and article 11 aoa) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.

             in accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 co and swiss auditing standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
             system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of
             the board of directors.

             we further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with swiss law and the company’s
             articles of incorporation. we recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

                      dufry ag, basel

                      basel, 7 march 2017



                      report of the statutory auditor on the remuneration report
                      we have audited the remuneration report of dufry ag for the year ended 31 december 2016.the au-
                      dit was limited to the information according to articles 14–16 of the ordinance against excessive com-
                      pensation in stock exchange listed companies (ordinance) contained in the tables labeled “audited”
                      on pages 229 to 241 of the remuneration report.

                      board of directors’ responsibility
                      the board of directors is responsible for the preparation and overall fair presentation of the remu-
                      neration report in accordance with swiss law and the ordinance. the board of directors is also re-
                      sponsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual remuneration packages.

                      auditor’s responsibility
                      our responsibility is to express an opinion on the accompanying remuneration report. we conducted
                      our audit in accordance with swiss auditing standards. those standards require that we comply with
                      ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
                      the remuneration report complies with swiss law and articles 14 – 16 of the ordinance.

                      an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence on the disclosures made in the re-
                      muneration report with regard to compensation, loans and credits in accordance with articles 14 – 16
                      of the ordinance. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assess-
                      ment of the risks of material misstatements in the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or er-
                      ror. this audit also includes evaluating the reasonableness of the methods applied to value compo-
                      nents of remuneration, as well as assessing the overall presentation of the remuneration report.

                      we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
                      for our opinion.

                      opinion
                      in our opinion, the remuneration report for the year ended 31 december 2016 of dufry ag complies
                      with swiss law and articles 14 – 16 of the ordinance.
