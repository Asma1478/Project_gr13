an exciting journey
our journey till the stage that we have reached today has been exciting. what
makes it even more treasured is the manner in which we covered the journey so far.
treading through land acquisition challenges, environment clearances, tough terrains, global economic meltdown, rising interest
rates and rising raw material prices, the journey to reach here was not easy. it was our persistent, untiring efforts and unwavering
focus that enabled us to continuously emerge as a bigger, stronger and better organisation.

roads, connecting remote areas and accounting for nearly 65% of freight
movement, are in many ways the lifeline of india’s socio-economic development.
at irb, our robust balance sheet strength, past track record and execution expertise enable us to get pre-qualified to bid for
entire gamut of road development projects. however, we focus only on bot projects that have the advantage of generating
higher rate of return and are marked with low competition with very few players possessing necessary competencies to un-
dertake large size and complex projects. besides, bot projects facilitate us in building a pipeline of income generating assets,
which post stabilisation, can be offered to invits which enables us to realise value of investments which can be reinvested into
new projects.

superior execution
capabilities
in road construction business involving capital intensive projects, the faster the
execution of projects and better the control over resources, better are the rate of
returns.

at irb, our superior integrated execution capabilities play a crucial role in our robust growth. while on one hand, the timely
delivery of projects and quality of work significantly enhanced our brand equity; on the other, it enabled us to maintain higher
internal rate of return through preventing costs overruns driven by project delays, thus providing us faster access to revenues
from toll operations enabling us to break-even operations earlier. this in turn enables us to meet debt obligations and the
resultant improvement in credit rating.

pioneering india’s
first invit
just when people began to think that infrastructure
companies could not possibly grow organically
without further leveraging their balance sheets and
diluting shareholders’ interest, we launched the
country’s first infrastructure investment trust.
a game-changing initiative, our transfer of 6 projects to the irb invit fund not
only reduced our leverage but provided immediate access to investible cash flow
that can be reinvested in new projects. besides being a source of regular cash
flows, the trust has a potential to act as a vehicle to which operational assets can
be offered for unlocking tied-up capital.




     what are invits                                                  why invits

     group has not provided for or disclosed contingent liabilities for matters considered as remote for pending litigations/public
     litigations(pil)/claims wherein the management is confident, based on the internal legal assessment and advice of its lawyers
     that these litigations would not result into any liabilities. the group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings to have

d.   litigation stamp duty matter
	mipl had vide order dated september 9, 2005 received a demand from the government of maharashtra of ` 275.40 millions
  in respect of stamp duty on the agreement dated august 4, 2004 entered into between maharashtra state road developers
  corporation limited (msrdc), mipl and the government of maharashtra for right to collect tolls/fees, the cost of which has
  been provided and capitalized during the earlier year.
	mipl had vide order dated march 12, 2008 received demand from chief controlling revenue authority maharashtra state,
  pune of ` 49.57 millions in respect of penalty on said stamp duty. mipl has filed a writ petition no. 3000 of 2008 in the bombay
  high court for quashing the said order on the grounds that the said order is in violation of the provisions of bombay motor
  vehicles act and also in violation of the concession agreement between the government of india and msrdc.
	the writ petition came up for admission on april 28, 2008 and the hon’ble court was pleased to admit the said writ petition
  and has directed the petitioner to deposit 50% of the demand with the collector of stamps (enforcement i) within eight weeks
  from the said order dated april 28, 2008 and has directed the registrar to seek direction from the chief justice of bombay
  high court for deciding as to whether the matter should be referred to a larger bench. considering the facts and circumstances
  of the case and law, mipl has made a provision of ` 275.40 millions in books of accounts and paid 50% of the amount ` 137.70
  millions under protest on june 19, 2008. further, based on the legal opinion obtained by mipl, the management is of the view
  that the possibility of penalty demanded by the authorities, becoming a liability is remote.

the management assessed that cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
the discount for lack of marketability represents the amounts that the group has determined that market participants would take
into account when pricing the investments.
note 44 : fair value hierarchy
all financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.
level 1: quoted (unadjusted) price is active market for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2: valuation technique for which the lowest level input that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement are observed,
either directly or indirectly.
level 3: valuation technique for which the lowest level input has a significant effect on the fair value measurement is not based on
observable market data.

note 45 : financial risk management objectives and policies
the group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the group, to set appropriate risk
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to
reflect changes in market conditions and the group’s activities.
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s risk management framework.
in performing its operating, investing and financing activities, the group is exposed to the credit risk, liquidity risk and currency risk.
market risk
market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
prices. market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and
commodity risk. financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, fvtoci investments and
derivative financial instruments.
interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market interest rates. the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the group’s long-term
debt obligations with floating interest rates.
the group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate borrowings.
interest rate sensitivity
the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and
borrowings affected, after the impact of hedge accounting. with all other variables held constant, the group’s profit before tax is
affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings, as follows:

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations risk
foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates. the group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the group’s operating
activities (when expense is denominated in a foreign currency) and the group’s foreign currency loan i.e. external commercial
borrowings (ecb).
foreign currency sensitivity
the following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in usd exchange rates, with all other variables
held constant. the impact on the group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary liabilities. the group has

liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the group may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without
incurring unacceptable losses. the group’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and
collateral requirements. the group closely monitors its liquidity position and deploys a robust cash management system. it maintains
adequate sources of financing including debt and overdraft from banks at an optimised cost.
the table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments:

at present, the group does expects to repay all liabilities at their contractual maturity. in order to meet such cash commitments, the
operating activity is expected to generate sufficient cash inflows.
derivative financial instruments
the group holds derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on
foreign currency exposures. the counter party for these contracts is generally a bank . these derivative financial instruments are
valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable
in the market place.
note 46 : capital management
capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders to ensure that it maintains an efficient capital structure and healthy
capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value. the group manages its capital structure and makes
adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements. to maintain or adjust the capital structure,
the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. no changes were
made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended march 31, 2017 and march 31, 2016.
the group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. net debt is calculated as
loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

in order to achieve this overall objective, the group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets
financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. breaches in
meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. there have been no breaches in the
financial covenants of any interest-bearing borrowings in the current period.

note 1 : fair value of mutual fund investments
under previous gaap, mutual fund investments were valued at cost or market value whichever is lower. as per ind as 109, mutual
fund investments needs to be stated at fair value. the difference between fair value and book value as on april 01, 2015 has been
recognised through retained earnings.
note 2 : discounting of non current loans given / taken and retention money
under previous gaap, non current interest free unsecured loans (tenure ranging from 5 to 7 years) given/ taken and retention
money were stated at historical cost. as per ind as 109 “financial instruments” need to be recognised initially at fair value. as per
ind as 113, level iii hierarchy has been used to fair value these loans and retention money as neither the quoted prices for loans and
retention money are available (level i) nor significant observable comparative inputs are available. under level iii income approach
- discounting cash flow method has been used to fair value these loans and retention money retrospectively. the difference between
the carrying amount of the loan and the present value of the loan as on april 01, 2015 has been recognised through retained earnings.

note 3 : remeasurement gain/losses on defined benefit obligation
under previous gaap, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to statement of profit and loss. under ind as,
remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains and losses) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding
debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income (oci).
note 4 : deferred tax
under previous gaap, deferred taxes were recognised for the tax effect of timing differences between accounting profit and taxable
profit for the year using the income statement approach. under ind as, deferred taxes are recognised using the balance sheet for future
tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. the above
difference, together with the consequential tax impact of the other ind as transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences.
note 5 : proposed dividend
under previous gaap, proposed dividends including dividend distribution tax are recognised as a liability in the period to which they
relate, irrespective of when they are declared. under ind as, a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in the period in which it
is declared by the company (usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid.
in the case of the company, the declaration of dividend occurs after period end. therefore, the liability of ` 843.44 millions for the
year ended on march 31, 2015 recorded for dividend has been derecognised against retained earnings on april 1, 2015. the dividend
has been recognised in the year march, 2016 on actual declaration of dividend.
note 6 : borrowings
under previous gaap, transaction costs incurred in connection with borrowings are amortised upfront and charged to statement of
profit and loss for the period. under ind as, transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of financial liability and
charged to profit or loss using the effective interest method.
note 7 : to comply with the companies (accounting standard) rules, 2006, certain account balances have been regrouped as per the
format prescribed under division ii of schedule iii to the companies act, 2013. 						
consolidated statement of cash flows
the transition from previous gaap to ind as has not had a material impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.
note 53 : significant accounting judgement, estimates and assumptions
the preparation of the group’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities. uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future years.
estimates and assumptions
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the
year in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
the group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. existing
circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising
that are beyond the control of the group. such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
taxes
there are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such
differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the tax determination is made. the assessment
of probability involves estimation of a number of factors including future taxable income.

resurfacing expenses
as per the service concession agreements, the group is obligated to carry out resurfacing of the roads under concession. the group
estimates the likely provision required towards resurfacing and accrues the costs on a straight line basis over the period at the end
of which resurfacing would be required, in the statement of profit and loss in accordance with ind as 37 “provisions, contingent
liabilities and contingent assets”.
defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)
a liability in respect of defined benefit plans is recognised in the balance sheet, and is measured as the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the reporting date. the present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments at
the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries. consideration is given to expected future salary levels, experience
of employee departures and periods of service. refer note 35 for details of the key assumptions used in determining the accounting
for these plans.
note 54
(a)	during the year ended march 31, 2017, the group has paid/accrued ` 2,875.11 millions (march 31, 2016: ` 2,571.14 millions)
     as revenue share to national highways authority of india (“nhai”) out of its toll collection in accordance with the concession
     agreements entered with nhai. income from operations in the financials for the above periods is net off the above revenue
     share to nhai.
(b)	during the year ended march 31, 2015, the group has received approval of nhai for premium deferment for ahmedabad
     vadodara super project as well as tumkur chitradurga project. the scheme is applicable to both projects from fy14-15
     onwards. such deferred premium is included in non current / other current liabilities.
(c)	three subsidiary companies i.e. irbav, irbtc and mvr have been awarded contracts on a dbfot basis. as per the terms of the
     concession agreement, the companies are obligated to pay an amount of ` 218,633.62 millions to nhai as additional concession
     fee over the concession period. accordingly, from financial year 2014-15 ,liability for the entire amount of concession fee
     payable has been created and the corresponding amount is shown as toll collection rights under the head intangible assets.
(d)	during the year aetpl has entered into a concession agreement (ca) with nhai for a period of 24 years. as per the terms of
     the ca, aetpl has agreed to pay a premium in the form of “additional concession fee” equal to ` 810.00 millions for the first
     year and each subsequent year such premium shall be determined by increasing the amount of premium in the respective year
     by an additional 5% as compared to the immediately preceding year. management based on the legal opinion obtained and their
     evaluations of the terms of the ca, believes that such premium payable is restricted to the toll collection during the year and is
     in the form of revenue sharing arrangement. accordingly, the premium payable for the year is accounted for as revenue share.

note 56:
on march 9, 2007, aryan infrastructure investments private limited (aiipl) had awarded a contract to aryan constructions
(a proprietary concern of sh. v. d. mhaiskar (huf) for ` 22,600.00 millions to provide amenities like internal roads, sanitation system,
power supply, water supply and other utilities for the real estate project at mauje taje and mauje pimpoli taluka, pune. as per the
terms of the agreement, aiipl had given total advance of ` 2,040.00 millions in the year 2007 and 2008 to aryan constructions to
execute the above contract. later on, in july 2007, aiipl became subsidiary of irb infrastructure developers limited.
however, the work on the proposed township could not be accelerated due to recessionary conditions witnessed by the real estate
sector since 2008. as a result the pace of execution of work had also slowed down. aiipl has been up-keeping the property through
aryan constructions. aryan constructions holds 34% in aiipl.
later on, aryan constructions had agreed with the subsidiary that the work awarded to aryan constructions under the subject
agreement will be executed by march 31, 2017 as per the agreement. if for any reason, the infrastructure development work
awarded to aryan constructions does not get substantially completed till its estimated time of completion i.e. by march 31, 2017 as
per the aforesaid contract, then aryan constructions undertake that :
1.	contract given to aryan constructions will be terminated as per contract terms, in march 31, 2017 and the then outstanding
    advance, if any will be returned to aiipl by aryan constructions;
2.	in case aryan constructions are unable to return the outstanding advance, aryan constructions affirm that aiipl is entitled
    to recover the outstanding mobilisation advance by appropriating the sale proceeds of aryan constructions share holding in
    aiipl, which aryan constructions undertake to sell to group or any other person interested to acquire the same at the then
    market determined valuation to the extent of then outstanding mobilisation advance.
in order to substantiate/support the undertaking given, aryan constructions has pledged the shares with the group as security.
accordingly, aryan construction has returned the outstanding advance to aiipl during the current year as per in accordance with
the undertaking.
note 57 : intra-group turnover and profits on bot construction contracts
the bot contracts are governed by service concession agreements with government authorities (grantor). under these agreements,
the operator does not own the road, but gets “toll collection rights” against the construction services incurred. since the construction
revenue earned by the operator is considered as exchanged with the grantor against toll collection rights, profit from such contracts
is considered as realised.
accordingly, bot contracts awarded to group companies (operator), where work is subcontracted to fellow subsidiaries, the intra
group transactions on bot contracts and the profits arising thereon are taken as realised and not eliminated for consolidation under
ind as 110 “consolidated financial statement”
the revenue and profit in respect of these transactions during the year is ` 34,709.04 millions (previous year - ` 28,396.71 millions)
and ` 10,681.63 millions (previous year - ` 9,008.96 millions) respectively.

for the year ended march 31, 2017
market risk
market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
prices. market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and
commodity risk. financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits and fvtoci investments.
credit risk on financial assets
credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a
financial loss. the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing
activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
financial instruments and cash deposits
credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the company’s top management in accordance with
the company’s policy. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned
to each counterparty. counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the top management on an annual basis, and may be updated
throughout the year subject to approval of the company’s board of directors. the limits are set to minimise the concentration of
risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market interest rates. the company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the company’s
long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates.
the company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
interest rate sensitivity
the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and
borrowings affected, after excluding the credit exposure for which interest rate swap has been taken and hence the interest rate
is fixed. with all other variables held constant, the company’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate
borrowings, as follows:
                                                                                                                        (` in millions)
                                                                                               march 31, 2017         march 31, 2016

liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without
incurring unacceptable losses. the company’s objective is to, at all times maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and
collateral requirements. the company closely monitors its liquidity position and deploys a robust cash management system. it
maintains adequate sources of financing including debt and overdraft from banks at an optimised cost (refer notes 15, 16 & 19) .
the company’s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet at march 31, 2017, march 31, 2016 and
april 01, 2015 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in notes 15, 16 & 19. the company’s maximum exposure relating to financial
guarantees and financial instruments is noted in note 32 and the liquidity table below:

at present, the company does expects to repay all liabilities at their contractual maturity. in order to meet such cash commitments,
the operating activity is expected to generate sufficient cash inflows.
commodity price risk
the company requires materials for implementation (construction) of the projects, such as cement, bitumen, steel and other related
construction materials. however, the company has entered into fixed price contract with the epc contractor so as to manage our
exposure to price increases in raw materials. hence, the sensitivity analysis is not required.

note 35 : capital management
for the purpose of the company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the company. the primary objective of the company’s capital management is to
maximise the shareholder value.
the company manages its capital so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to optimise returns to shareholders.
the capital structure of the company is based on management’s judgement of its strategic and day-to-day needs with a focus on total
equity so as to maintain investor, creditors and market confidence.
the company monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt is calculated as borrowing
less cash and cash equivalent and other bank balances and mutual funds investments.

in order to achieve this overall objective, the company’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets
financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. breaches in
meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. there have been no breaches in the
financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current year.

statement of cash flows
the transition from previous gaap to ind as has not had a material impact on the statement of cash flows.
footnotes :
1.   fair value of mutual fund investments
	under previous gaap, mutual fund investments were valued at cost or market value whichever is lower. as per ind as 109,
  mutual fund investments needs to be stated at fair value. the difference between fair value and book value as on april 01, 2015
  has been recognised through retained earnings.
2.   discounting of long term loans given/taken and retention money
	under previous gaap, long term interest free unsecured loans (tenure ranging from 5 to 7 years) given/taken and retention
  money were stated at historical cost. as per ind as 109 financial instruments need to be recognised initially at fair value. as per
  ind as 113, level iii hierarchy has been used to fair value these loans and retention money as neither the quoted prices for loans
  and retention money are available (level i) nor significant observable comparative inputs are available. under level iii income
  approach - discounting cash flow method has been used to fair value these loans and retention money retrospectively. the
  difference between the caring amount and the loan and the present value of the loan as on april 01, 2015 has been recognised
  through retained earnings.
3.   remeasurement gain/losses on defined benefit obligation
	under previous gaap, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to statement of profit and loss. under
  ind as, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains and losses) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a
  corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income (oci).
4.   proposed dividend
	in previous gaap, dividend payable is recorded as a liability in the period to which it relates. under ind as, dividend to holders
  of equity instruments is recognized as a liability in the period in which the obligation to pay is established. accordingly, proposed
  dividends and the related tax have increased the retained earnings by ` 702.90 millions, at the transition date and as on march
  31, 2016.
5. 	to comply with the companies (accounting standard) rules, 2006, certain account balances have been regrouped as per the
     format prescribed under division ii of schedule iii to the companies act, 2013.

terms and conditions of transactions with related parties
1. 	transactions pertaining to contract revenue and contract expenses with related parties are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length
     transactions. outstanding balances at the year-end are unsecured and interest free (except 4). there have been no guarantees provided or received for any
     related party receivables or payables. this assessment is undertaken each financial year through examining the financial position of the related party and the
     market in which the related party operates.
2.    contract revenue includes consideration with respect to construction and other ancilliary services as per the epc agreement.

note 38 : significant accounting judgement, estimates and assumptions
the preparation of the company’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment
to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future years.
estimates and assumptions
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the
year in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.
the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are
described below. the company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were
prepared. existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the company. such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

fair value measurement of financial instruments
when the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted
prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the dcf model. the inputs to these models
are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing
fair values. judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. changes in assumptions about
these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. see note 32 and 33 for further disclosures.
taxes
there are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded, such
differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the tax determination is made. the assessment
of probability involves estimation of a number of factors including future taxable income.
defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)
a liability in respect of defined benefit plans is recognised in the balance sheet, and is measured as the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the reporting date. the present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments at
the reporting date, calculated annually by independent actuaries. consideration is given to expected future salary levels, experience
of employee departures and periods of service. refer note 27 for details of the key assumptions used in determining the accounting
for these plans.
