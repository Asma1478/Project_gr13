     asustek formulates an internal ecodesign standard, "greenasus energy using product
     technical standard", which includes three key areas of eco design - "material selection",
     "easy disassembly and easy recycling design", and "energy efficiency" – and thus contains
     the concepts of hazardous substances management, design for easy reuse, recycling and
     disassembling, design for life cycle extension, and low energy consumption. this would
     ensure the "green" quality of our products and reduce the carbon footprint from the very
     beginning.

energy consumption during the use stage produces the most ghg emissions. therefore,
besides providing more green products to consumers, we also continue to improve energy
eﬃciency of our products to help consumers save on electricity costs and reduce the use of
energy and the ghg emissions.


we also educate our consumers on how to save on electricity costs through creating the
energy calculator. this tool could help them to estimate their energy consumption, electricity
costs and ghg emissions according to their using habits, as well as promoting the idea of
energy saving and environmental protection.
