corporate social responsibility report




big yellow recognises that a high level of corporate social responsibility (“csr”),
linked to clear commercial objectives, will create a more sustainable business and
increase shareholder and customer value.




         1.0 introduction
            big yellow recognises that a high level of corporate social responsibility (“csr”), linked to clear commercial objectives, will create a more
            sustainable business and increase shareholder and customer value. our csr policy covers all of our operations, as a self storage provider,
            a real estate developer, an employer and a participant in our local communities.
            big yellow seeks to meet the demand for self storage from businesses and private individuals providing the storage space for their commercial
            and/or domestic needs, whilst aiding local employment creation and contributing to local community regeneration.

         2.0 csr executive summary
            big yellow is pleased to deliver another year of steady csr progress across the group. our focus over the last 12 months has delivered the
            following benefits:
            •   our successful entry into the sunday times 100 best companies to work for, after a survey response rate of 81% from our team –
                compared to an average of 63% from other companies. we achieved a two star status in the best companies accreditation, with only
                21% of the entrants bettering our status.
            •   supporting 14 different local charities elected by our stores and by our head office teams; our people undertook a variety of activities
                for these (and a few other) charities and raised over £45,000 of funds during the year. at the same time big yellow and armadillo self
                storage donated the equivalent of over £753,000 of free storage in the same period.
            •   big yellow’s health & safety record on our construction sites and at our stores maintained its exemplary high standards. measured by
                both the number of recorded minor injuries – and by riddor (reporting of injuries, diseases and dangerous occurrences regulation)
                – our high standards of health and safety have continued to be delivered to our customers, staff, contractors and other visitors.
                furthermore, we have continued to manage our construction sites under the controlling factors of the ccs (considerate constructors
                scheme).
            •   our continued investment in led lighting – and in fuel efficient gas heating systems at our flexi-offices – has delivered reduced carbon
                emissions in both absolute and like-for-like measures. our total annual carbon emissions are now 35.2% lower than our peak year of
                2011. furthermore – if we look at these emissions in relation to our occupancy – our carbon per square metre occupied is down 58.0%
                from our 2011 peak.
            •   we have continued to open new stores with sustainable energy generation investments. in the last 12 months our new solar investment
                at enfield (a new store) has added to our electricity supply, which has now grown by 335% since 2011. our 17 stores with solar energy
                systems now generate 15.4% of their total electricity demand from sustainable sources.
            •   we continue to benchmark our csr performance against credible certifications where we consider them to be relevant. 42% of our
                stores hold epc’s (energy performance certificates), the majority of which are rated a or b. we have assessed a selection of stores to
                comply with the uk energy savings opportunity scheme (esos) and are considering the outcome of these surveys for future sustainable
                initiatives. we continue to participate in sustainable benchmarking initiatives such as the ftse4good, epra, carbon disclosure project
                (cdp) and the global real estate sustainability benchmark (gresb).
            finally, we continue to plan for the future and to continue to deliver sustainable benefits to the group. we aim to reduce our greenhouse
            gas emissions (ghg) from the 2008 peak by 40.4% by 2020. we will achieve this by continuing our investment in led lighting, solar pv
            systems on our store roofs and other sustainable initiatives identified from our esos surveys.

                                                                         supporting local community projects
                                                                         and charities through fundraising and
                                                                         donating free storage space.
                                                                         during the year we donated space in
                                                                         our stores worth approximately
                                                                         £753,000 to charities.




2.1 our people
our people are at the heart of big yellow’s business, bringing our values to life through the service that they provide, and bringing the energy
and passion that drives us to become an ever more responsible and sustainable business.
we recognise that recruiting, retaining and motivating individuals with talent and integrity – and ensuring that we listen to our people and
maximise their skills and performance - is key to the continued success of our company.
we encourage a culture of partnership within the business and believe in staff participating in corporate performance through benefits,
such as bonus schemes and share incentives. we recognise and reward the exceptional performance, achievements and ideas of our people
through a points recognition scheme, and awarded £55,000 of points to our staff for the year ended 31 march 2016.

wellbeing and support
we aim to promote employee wellbeing through a range of flexible working options which include flexitime, staggered hours, home working
and sabbaticals. we provide childcare vouchers along with a comprehensive range of medical support and advice through our private
healthcare scheme and occupational health providers. we have arranged corporate gym membership on a national basis, as well as a “cycle
to work” scheme and employee assistance programmes.

communication and engagement
we continue to recognise the importance of communication and consultation with our people and provide an annual spring conference,
regular formal and informal meetings, quarterly newsletters and weekly operational updates. in addition, the directors and senior
management spend a significant amount of time in the stores and are accessible to employees at all levels.
in february 2016, we were named as one of the sunday times 100 best companies to work for. we are particularly proud of this achievement
given a total of 1,336 companies initially applied to participate in this process and we achieved a survey response rate of 81%, compared
to an average of 62.6%.
in addition, we also achieved two star status in the best companies accreditation. in total, 768 companies gained accreditation, with only
21% having bettered us in achieving three stars. our two star status demonstrates that we have achieved outstanding levels of employee
engagement within the company.

training and development
we continue to promote the development of staff through ongoing training and regular performance appraisals. for the year ended 31 march
2016 a total of 960 days training was provided across the company, comprising of both sales and operational training and personal and
management development.
our “big impressions” customer experience programme continued throughout the year, with one element of the programme being re-designed
to further support our teams in completely understanding and fulfilling the needs of our customers.
during the last year, ten staff have completed our personal development programme designed specifically for assistant store managers,
with four of those people having subsequently been promoted to the position of store manager. eight assistant store managers are currently
participating in the programme, to prepare them for their future progression within the company.
as a result of this programme and our other internal training and development programmes, 55% of our store based staff have been promoted
from within the business to their existing position.

            2.1 our people (continued)
            community
            we recognise the importance of contributing within the local community and we encourage our people to develop close links with charities,
            schools and other institutions, both locally and nationally, to help to build more economically sustainable environments.
            for the year ended 31 march 2016, we recognised and supported 14 different company charities which were elected by our store and head
            office teams. our people undertook a variety of activities for both these and other charities, with donations also being made by the company.
            throughout the year a total of £29,000 was raised for our company charities and £16,000 was raised for other charities.
            examples of our fundraising activities have included:

            the anne rowling clinic
            one of our team members ran the edinburgh half marathon, great north run and great birmingham run and raised nearly £1,600 for the
            anne rowling clinic, which is a charitable university of edinburgh research facility focusing on a wide range of neurological conditions,
            especially neurodegenerative diseases.

            “donations from the dedicated fundraising efforts of john laffey, from big yellow self storage are already making an impact on the
            lives of patients with ms and other neurodegenerative diseases. the research work at the anne rowling regenerative neurology clinic
            will help us to apply the latest discoveries in regenerative medicine to neurodegenerative diseases and we are committed to discovering
            therapies that will slow, stop or even reverse the damage that these diseases cause. our patients are grateful for the generous donations
            and have asked us to pass on their thanks to both john and big yellow. we would like to thank john for running so hard and far to raise
            awareness and funds for the anne rowling clinic”.
            kerry mackay, individual giving officer, the anne rowling clinic

            british heart foundation
            nine of our stores have acted as “donation stations” for the british heart foundation, raising a total of just under £23,000 for the year from
            bags of unwanted clothes and household goods, which will support the charity’s pioneering heart research, as well as the care of people
            living with heart disease.
            in addition a further £3,200 has been raised across the year by various members of staff completing sponsored swims, runs and cycle rides.

            grateful for the unwanted items that have been donated. by selling these in british heart foundation shops and stores, and fundraising
            activities that have taken place, over £45,000 has been raised to date which will help fund our life saving research. it’s wonderful to
            have the support of big yellow and we are looking forward to another successful year of our partnership”

            “big yellow storage have always been a keen supporter of southwark tigers rugby club, the first inner city rugby club in britain.
            whenever the club needs a boost, when the kit starts to look tatty, or new balls are required, the company steps up immediately to
            help. the support of big yellow has helped us immensely. we are now encouraging southwark council to build an artificial rugby pitch
            that will allow us to really develop rugby in the area”.
            vernon neve-dunn, chairman, southwark tigers rugby club




                                                                                                                                                             05

            participating in a high quality club which is free of charge and have done well in the leagues this season. we hope for even greater
            success in the upcoming season and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff and directors at big yellow self storage
            for making this possible".
            tameeka smith, director, caius house

            free storage
            in addition to our fundraising activities, we have also provided charities with free storage. for the year ended 31 march 2016, the space
            occupied by charities in big yellow and armadillo stores on this basis was 46,000 sq. ft., worth approximately £753,000 per annum at
            standard rents. some of the many charities that have benefited from this storage include cancer research, macmillan, the national childbirth
            trust, the british heart foundation and a number of food bank and children’s charities.

            young enterprise
            a number of team members within our head office and stores have continued to support students in schools or colleges within their local
            communities in conjunction with young enterprise, a charitable organisation that creates and develops programmes that complement the
            school experience with business skills and encourages young people to realise the extent of their own talents. our volunteering has taken
            the form of providing classroom support, mentoring students to create their own businesses and participating in young enterprise regional
            board meetings.

            2.2 our health & safety
            big yellow recognises the importance of maintaining high standards of health and safety for everyone who may be affected by our business,
            such as our customers, staff, contractors and other visitors to our stores. the group’s health and safety committee reviews its policy, risk
            assessments, performance and records on a quarterly basis. the policy is applied in two distinct areas – our construction activities and
            our routine store operations. the committee meet to discuss any issues that have been reported from meetings held at our head office,
            maidenhead (our distribution warehouse), the stores and any construction sites. the policy states that all employees have a responsibility
            for health and safety, but that managers have special responsibilities. additional duties are placed on adrian lee, operations director, to
            keep the board advised on health and safety issues and ensure compliance with the policy in respect of construction via the construction
            director and store operations, via the facilities manager. externally, other interested stakeholders include the health and safety executive
            (hse) and local government.
            the health and safety committee minutes are distributed to the ceo, csr manager, human resources manager, facilities management and
            our external health and safety consultant. the external consultant reviews our policy and performs audits of our stores on a rolling
            programme, to ensure the implementation of the group’s health and safety policies. any actions recommended by our consultant are
            considered by the committee and, if required, then implemented into the operations or construction systems. health and safety audits are
            also carried out by external consultants on each construction site prior to the opening of a store.
            our health and safety reporting covers all of our stores, our head office, maidenhead and our ‘fit-out’ construction sites. incidents are
            recorded for staff, customers, contractors and visitors. the board receives reports which monitor health and safety performance in all these
            areas. annual store health and safety meetings take place for all stores and maidenhead. agendas are provided for these meetings by the
            facilities team and the minutes are reviewed by area managers to raise any issues with facilities or human resources, where necessary.
            health and safety performance and incidents are reported in the tables below:

            the number of customer move-ins increased this year by 0.5%. there were a total of 62 incidents, four of which were sustained by customers

            breaks, cuts and bruises from the handling of customer possessions, equipment and vehicles. the 58 minor injuries occurred while
            customers (on the whole) handled possessions, bins and pallets. this year our staff training schedules provided customers with fire, health
            and safety risk assessments, which raised awareness of the potential for personal injuries. 12 minor injuries were due to visitor deliveries,
            involving minor cuts and bruises from doors and pallet handling. there were no fatal injuries, notices+ or prosecutions during the year

            the number of man days worked was more than double the previous year, mainly due to the fit out of our newly acquired cambridge building.
            three minor injuries and eight near misses were recorded, with high safety standards being maintained. the cambridge site was also
            managed under the considerate constructors scheme (ccs) which promotes high standards of health and safety management. no fatal
            injuries, notices, reportable injuries or prosecutions occurred, indicating a well-controlled environment for staff, contractors and visitors.
            health and safety performance continues to be reviewed in preparation for our next new store development at guildford in 2016.
            at cambridge a new storage facility was provided after the extensive refurbishment of a former warehouse, located adjacent to a
            well-established retail park close to the city centre. under the ccs big yellow construction was rated ‘excellent’ for ‘securing everyone’s
            safety’ and scored ‘very good’ ratings in: ‘valuing the workforce’, ‘respect for the community’, ‘protecting the environment’ and ‘caring
            about site appearance’.

corporate social responsibility report (continued)




         3.0 environmental responsibility
            our csr policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local environment, to control our risks and manage
            our opportunities in a sustainable manner.
            big yellow has been classified as having a “low environmental impact” by the ethical investment research index series (“eiris”) because it
            is involved in ‘support services’. notwithstanding this, and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for its stakeholders,
            big yellow has continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of its storage operations, real estate
            portfolio, new store developments and site acquisitions.
            we report energy use carbon emissions in compliance with the companies act and climate change regulation on reporting greenhouse gas
            (“ghg”) emissions for listed companies. for the detailed application of our report see our ‘basis of reporting’ at: http://corporate.bigyellow.co.uk/csr.
            we therefore provide a summary in the directors’ report of scope 1 (onsite gas, solar electricity generation and refrigerant use) and scope 2
            (off site power station grid supplied electricity) for carbon dioxide equivalent (co2e) emissions. we have used the defra decc version 2.1
            (2015, expiry 31 may 2016) conversion factors, for annual ghg emission calculations.

            3.1 energy use, efficiency and reductions from 2011 (peak energy benchmark)
            this year we are reporting our key performance indicators and identifying them using the codes from the global reporting initiative (gri)
            and the european public real estate association (epra), at the request of some of our stakeholders. a comparable annual ‘same store’
            portfolio electricity use and carbon emission kpi will also be used. our materiality threshold for energy use is 5% and for carbon emissions
            is > 1%. a limited level of assurance is provided for our scope 1 and 2 energy use and ghg emissions. this assurance was undertaken by
            deloitte llp in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (isae 3000 revised).

            note: 2012 was peak gas use benchmark.
            gas use for the heating of our eight flexi offices reached a peak in december 2012, due to the coldest winter month since records began.
            the annual reductions in gas use to 2016 have been mainly due to milder but wetter winters. flexi-office occupancy variations also reduce
            heating demand occasionally, but occupancy has been relatively constant, ranging from 82.5% to 87.9%. this year, gas use reduced by 20.2%
            from the peak use in 2012.

            our combined energy use has reduced by 31.6% our from peak energy use in 2011, mainly due to our investment in motion sensor lighting,
            energy efficient led re-lamping and 17 roof top solar electricity installations. over the last year combined gas and electricity use reduced
            by 2.7%. our gas use ‘materiality’ is 5.9% of total gas and electricity use and remains just above the materiality level (>5%). this is partly
            due to significant long term annual reductions in electricity use, compared to reductions achieved in gas use.

our combined energy use has reduced by
31.6% from our peak energy use in 2011,
mainly due to our investment in motion
sensor lighting, energy efficient led
re-lamping and 17 roof top solar
electricity installations.

            total scope 1 gas and refrigerant greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 reduced to 122.7 tco2e, similar to the low 2011 emission levels.
            this represents a 74.2% reduction from our peak use in 2014, due to less heating gas use and less refrigerant ‘top up’ required in air
            conditioning units, following significant replacements in 2013 and 2014.

            note: 2016 crc emissions and tax will be reported in june 2016.
            the crc tax on emissions from our use of electricity, gas and self-supplied solar electricity generation rose from £12.00/tco2 to £16.40 in
            2015, and will continue to rise to £18.30 in 2019. under the crc tax scheme, our total tco2 emissions reduced by 28.9%, but our crc tax
            reduction from 2011 to 2015 was 2.9%, due to a 26.8% increase in the 2015 tax rate. big yellow has further plans to invest in external energy
            efficient lighting; solar ‘roof top’ installations and accurate solar performance monitoring to manage costs and savings efficiently, until the
            merger of the crc tax with the ‘climate change levy’ is confirmed in 2020.
            this year we disclose our ’scope 2’ (off site) power station electricity use and emissions, as our most ‘material’ energy use by ‘dual reporting’.
            this is to compare the difference in our ‘location based’ (national grid) and ‘market based’ (british gas electricity supply) emissions.
            the table below shows that carbon dioxide emissions that are ‘location based’ are almost double the ‘market based’ conversion factor (tco2).
            this is because the british gas ‘fuel mix disclosure’ for electricity generation is based on a lower carbon mix of: 33% natural gas; 31% nuclear
            energy; 23% renewables; 11% coal; and 2% of ‘other fuels’. this disclosure raises consumer awareness of the lower carbon content of ‘market

            *   peak emissions for scope 1.

            2011 was the peak emissions and benchmark year for long term performance assessment for scope 2
            these reductions were mainly due to scope 2 supplied electricity emissions. our energy use strategy aims to reduce emissions, annual
            energy costs and carbon taxation by proportional percentages. it has also created an income from energy company payments for generation
            and exporting excess electricity to the grid from our solar electricity generation investments.
            scope 1 emissions from our stores represent only 2.8% of our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions. in the year ended 31 march 2016, less
            refrigerant replacement was required for the third year in succession and the type used had a lower ghg emission conversion factor, resulting
            in a significant reduction in ghg emissions from our peak refrigerant replacement in 2015. ghg emissions from flexi office gas heating are
            also indicating a constant reduction in tco2e in the year ended 31 march 2016, due to milder but wetter winters since 2012.

            ghg emission intensity (scope 1 and 2)
            our key emission “intensity” indicators are based on annual growth using customer occupancy and revenue and gross internal floor area (“gifa”).

*   2011 peak electricity use due to occupancy growth.

note: 2008 peak use due to new store development and occupancy growth.
we have been achieving a 4.5% annual average reduction of ghg emissions from 2008 to 2016. from 2017, we will adopt the uk commercial
property sector ‘real estate environmental target’ of a 3.5% annual ghg emission reduction to align with the government’s 2050 goal.
to achieve this target our future programmes of re-lamping stores externally with energy efficient lighting is planned to begin in the year
ending 31 march 2017. additional investment in roof mounted solar installations at our new and existing stores is also proposed for the year
ending 31 march 2017. we will also use our ‘energy saving opportunity scheme’ (esos) report to implement other energy efficiency
investments where we consider they are appropriate.

            energy performance certification (‘epc’) legislation
            as owners of property who lease space to members of the public, we were required to display epcs to our customers from 1st october 2008.
            certification is required at new store openings, store acquisitions and when solar panels are retrofitted onto older stores. we have provided
            30 epcs to date in our stores, representing 42% of the portfolio. of the stores certified 73% have high ‘a’ or ‘b’ ratings, mainly due to energy
            efficient internal led re-lamping and investment in low carbon electricity, heating and cooling ‘self-supply’, such as solar and ground source
            heat pump installations. considering that the whole portfolio has internal energy efficient led lighting, apart from a few recent acquisitions,
            we are comfortable that the pre-october 2008 stores will at least achieve the epc ‘b’ rating in the future, when the opportunity arises.

            building research establishment environmental assessment methodology (‘breeam’)
            breeam certification is sometimes a local planning requirement for our stores, especially for new developments in high density urban
            environments. the methodology assesses impacts and opportunities for enhancing the design and construction environmental aspects.
            the certification includes a review of new store energy, sustainable building materials, water efficiency, waste recycling and ecology.
            the review also includes social aspects of the building life include its resource management, health, well-being, modes of transport and
            pollution reduction. our breeam ratings are mainly ‘excellent’ scoring in the 75 – 76% range and highest in the areas of land use and ecology;
            transport; waste; pollution; and energy efficiency.

                                                                                                                                                                      15

            waste generation in self storage is assessed as a “low environmental impact”. the majority of non-hazardous bulk office waste is segregated
            by our staff and then further recycling by our waste contractor for paper and cardboard takes place after collection. this year 296 tonnes
            of waste was recycled and 58.9 tonnes went to landfill. landfill ghg emissions are estimated to be 17.0 tco2e. these emission levels
            represent a negligible percentage of our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions and are below the materiality threshold for future carbon
            emission reporting.

            (41%); wood (31%); plastic (11%); metals (9%); card/paper (3%); polythene (2%); bagged waste (2%); and plasterboard (1%). all of our new
            stores sign up to the ‘considerate constructors scheme’ and achieve energy performance certification (epc) ‘b’ rating with led lighting as
            standard and roof top solar installations installed where viable.
            water use has been assessed as a “low environmental impact” for self storage (usage of 28,486 m3). our data has provided an average of
            (20.3 tco2e) emissions per year. this represents less than 0.5% of combined scope 1 and 2 emissions, which is below the materiality
            threshold for carbon emissions. water use monitoring is continued in order to review water use efficiency.

            by the environment agency (“ea”) and involved the audit of four representative stores from our portfolio. we assessed future energy savings,
            other than the technologies that we had already programmed and invested in. we completed the audits in november 2015, before the
            december deadline, and have considered changes to our future budget for investing in viable energy saving technologies as a result.

            performance indicators, such as energy efficiency, ghg emission, water and waste reductions. the survey also covers broader issues such
            as sustainability risk assessments, performance improvement, and engagement with employees, customers, suppliers and local
            communities. gresb continued to rate big yellow with a ‘green star status’ in 2015. in europe (and globally) we were ranked with sustainability
            scores in the top quartile of ‘management and policy’ and ‘implementation and measurement’. the benchmark results allow us to identify
            the areas where we can improve, both in absolute terms and relative to our peers. we are able to provide our existing and potential investors
            with information regarding our environmental and social governance performance, in the current real estate investment market.

corporate social responsibility report (continued)




            assurance statement
            independent assurance statement by deloitte llp (‘deloitte’) to big yellow group plc (‘big yellow’) on their corporate
            social responsibility report 2016 (“report”)

            what we looked at: scope of our work
            big yellow engaged us to perform limited assurance procedures on selected group level corporate social responsibility (csr)
            performance indicators for the year ended 31 march 2016. the assured data are indicated by the + symbol in the report.

            carbon footprint indicators:
            >   store electricity (tco2e)
            >   store flexi-office gas emissions (tco2e)
            >   refrigerant emissions (tco2e)
            >   absolute carbon dioxide emissions (tco2e)
            store electricity use, co2 emissions and carbon intensity:
            >   electricity use (kwh)
            >   absolute carbon emissions (tco2e)
            >   carbon intensity (kgco2e/m2 gross internal area)
            >   carbon intensity (kgco2e/m2 occupied space)
            >   carbon intensity (kgco2e/£ revenue)
            renewable energy generation and co2 emissions reductions:
            > total renewable energy (kwh)
            > renewable energy percentage of total store use (%)
            staff health and safety:
            >   average number of employees
            >   minor injuries
            >   reportable injuries (riddor)
            >   annual injury incidence rate (aiir) per 100,000 staff
            >   notices
            what we found: our assurance opinion
            based on the assurance work we performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected csr
            performance indicators, as noted above, have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with big yellow’s definitions
            and basis of reporting.

            what standards we used: basis of our work and level of assurance
            we carried out limited assurance in accordance with the international standards on assurance engagements 3000 revised (isae 3000).
            to achieve limited assurance isae 3000 requires that we review the processes and systems used to compile the areas on which we
            provide assurance. this standard requires that we comply with the independence and ethical requirements and to plan and perform
            our assurance engagement to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence on which to base our limited assurance conclusion. it does not
            include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness of processes and internal controls. this is designed to give a
            similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information.
            the evaluation criteria used for our assurance are the big yellow group definitions and basis of reporting as described at:
            http://corporate.bigyellow.co.uk/csr.aspx




                                                                                                                                                    19

corporate social responsibility report (continued)




            what we did: our key assurance procedures
            considering the risk of material error, our multi-disciplinary team of csr assurance specialists planned and performed our work
            to obtain all the information and explanations we considered necessary to provide sufficient evidence to support our assurance
            conclusion. our work was planned to mirror big yellow’s own group level compilation processes, tracing how data for each indicator
            within our assurance scope was collected, collated and validated by corporate head office and included in the report.
            key procedures we carried out included:
            > gaining an understanding of big yellow’s systems through interview with management responsible for csr management
              and reporting systems at corporate head office;
            > reviewing the systems and procedures to capture, collate, validate and process data for the assured performance data
              included in the report. we did not test back to source data; and
            > reviewing the content of the 2016 csr report against the findings of our work and making recommendations for improvement
              where necessary.
            big yellow’s responsibilities
            the directors are responsible for the preparation of the report and for the information and statements contained within it.
            they are responsible for determining the csr goals, performance and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance
            management and internal control systems from which the reported information is derived.

            deloitte’s responsibilities, independence and team competencies
            our responsibility is to independently express a conclusion on the performance data for the year ended 31 march 2016. we
            performed the engagement in accordance with deloitte’s independence policies, which cover all of the requirements of the
            international federation of accountants code of ethics and in some cases are more restrictive. we confirm to big yellow that we
            have maintained our independence and objectivity throughout the year, including the fact that there were no events or prohibited
            services provided which could impair that independence and objectivity in the provision of this engagement.
            this report is made solely to big yellow in accordance with our engagement letter. our work has been undertaken so that we might
            state to the company those matters we are required to state to them in an assurance report and for no other purpose. to the fullest
            extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than big yellow for our work, for this report, or
            for the conclusions we have formed.
