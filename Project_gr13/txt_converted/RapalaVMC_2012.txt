our responsibility is to express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements, on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
and on the report of the board of directors based on our audit. the auditing act requires that we comply with           ernst & young oy, elielinaukio 5 b, 00100 helsinki
the requirements of professional ethics. we conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in
finland. good auditing practice requires that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the ﬁnancial statements and the report of the board of directors are free from material misstatement,
and whether the members of the board of directors of the parent company or the managing director are guilty
of an act or negligence which may result in liability in damages towards the company or have violated the limited
liability companies act or the articles of association of the company.
   an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
ﬁnancial statements and the report of the board of directors. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. in mak-
ing those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of ﬁnancial
statements and report of the board of directors that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presenta-
tion of the ﬁnancial statements and the report of the board of directors.
   we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

in most cases allowances are determined individually, when there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant over-
due of receivables and unsuccessful dunning attempts or known ﬁnancial difficulties and thus increased probabil-
ity of customer insolvency) that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms
of the receivables. allowances have not been made on other receivables.

sensitivity analysis
below is presented the effect of liabilities with variable interest rate and interest rate swaps on net income and
equity if there was a 1% increase in interest rates. the sensitivity analysis is based on following assumptions and
factors:
 all other variables, in particular foreign exchange rates, are assumed to remain unchanged.
 the sensitivity is analyzed against interest rates applicable on dec. 31.
 the sensitivity analysis includes the liabilities and interest rate swaps with variable interest rate in force on dec.
   31.
 the sensitivity analysis of interest rate swaps is based on calculations received from the bank.
 the tax effect included in the sensitivity analysis is calculated by using the group’s total effective tax rate.

market risks and mitigation actions are analyzed in more detail in the section “financial risks” ”and in note 22 to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
    in respect of manufacturing activities, the group is not critically dependent on any single external production
factor supplier. the group uses several subcontractors in china, but the group is not as such critically dependent
on any of these subcontractors. this risk has been further reduced as the new production facility in indonesia has
taken over some production previously done by chinese subcontractors. availability of competent production labor
is essential and the group aims to maintain good employer reputation and labor relations.
    there are signiﬁcant dependencies between the group’s manufacturing units, which could cause supply
problems e.g. in case of ﬁre or other hazard. such hazard could lead to property damages but also to business
interruption losses throughout the supply chain. therefore, rapala has increased the emphasis of hazard risk
management. the group has together with its insurance company continued to conduct annually several hazard
prevention reviews to group’s key locations. group management has also continued to build risk awareness
throughout the organization.
    the group is, with assistance of its insurance broker, further developing the global insurance programs, which
cover most of the group companies. global insurance policies, which take into account the group’s interdepend-
ency, are in place for property damage and business interruption, transportation as well as general and product
liabilities.
    the board evaluates the group’s operational risks at least once a year as part of operational plans and budgets.
group management monitors and coordinates the continuous management of operational risks, which is the
responsibility of the management of each business unit.

financial risks
the group’s ﬁnancial risks consist of market risks, credit and default risks and liquidity risks. the board evaluates
ﬁnancial risks several times during the year and group management monitors and manages them continuously.
financial risks are discussed in detail, as required by ifrs 7, in note 22 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
