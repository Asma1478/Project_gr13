towards a sustainable environment
during the first industrial revolution the planet had abundant natural resources so the focus
was on economic growth by increasing labor productivity. since then, businesses have
rapidly and extensively altered ecosystems and their capacity to sustain life, human well
being and economic and social development. the true cost of which will be borne by future
generations unless industries and corporations take responsibility for their actions and
focus on minimizing their ecological footprint to sustainable levels.

rainwater harvesting area in our mysore campus



we are implementing an integrated water management
approach focused on rain water harvesting, improving the
efficiency of water use, and recycling all the human touch
water in our waste water treatment plants to meet our
long-term goal of becoming water sustainable.
in order to reduce wasteful consumption, we started a
number of initiatives this year. these include recalibration
of hydro pneumatic pump controls and adding multiple
variable frequency drives (vfd), deployment of
sensor-based low flow faucets and shower heads and
introduction of low flow, dual flush systems in water
closets. all water consumed at most of our campuses is
recycled and utilized for irrigation. rainwater harvesting is
now the key criteria for designing and planning of all our
large campuses. as an it services company, water is used
only for human sustenance and not for any production
purpose. therefore we believe that our operations do not
have a significant impact on water sources. the domestic
waste water generated in the campus is treated in our
waste water treatment plants. the treated water quality
is monitored and meets all state pollution control board
norms. we need to improve our monitoring systems to
quantify the water which is recycled.
protecting and nurturing our biodiversity
all our operational sites in india are located outside
protected land or habitats. our activities do not threaten
any endangered species of flora or fauna. we have also
focused on preserving endangered native tree species.
we have over 118,000 trees above the height of 1.5
meters in our campuses.

assurance statement
introduction
det norske veritas as (‘dnv’) has been commissioned by the management of infosys technologies limited (‘infosys’) to
carry out an assurance engagement on the infosys sustainability report 2008-09 (‘the report’).
infosys is responsible for the collection, analysis, aggregation and presentation of information within the report. our
responsibility in performing this work is to the management of infosys only and in accordance with terms of reference
agreed with the company. the assurance engagement is based on the assumption that the data and information provided
to us is complete and true.
scope of assurance
the scope of work agreed upon with infosys includes the following:
•   the full report as well as references made in the report to the annual report and corporate website;
•   review of the report against global reporting initiative (gri) sustainability reporting guidelines version 3.0 (gri g3)
    and confirmation of the application level;
•   reporting boundary as set out in the report;
•   visits to the infosys’ head-office in bangalore and development centres in mangalore, pune and trivandrum, india.
the verification was carried out during may 2009.
verification methodology
dnv is a leading provider of sustainability services, including verification of sustainability reports. our environmental
and social assurance specialists work in over 100 countries. our assurance engagement was planned and carried out in
accordance with the dnv protocol for verification of sustainability reporting.
the report has been evaluated against the following criteria:
•   adherence to the principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness, responsiveness, reliability and
    neutrality, as set out in the dnv protocol*, and
•   the gri g3 application levels.
as part of the verification dnv has challenged the sustainability-related statements and claims made in the report and
assessed the robustness of the underlying data management system, information flow and controls. for example,
we have:
•   examined and reviewed documents, data and other information made available to dnv by infosys;
•   conducted interviews with 55 representatives (including data owners and decision-makers from different divisions
    and functions) of the company;
•   performed sample-based reviews of the mechanisms for implementing the company’s own sustainability-related
    policies, as described in the report, and for determining material issues to be included in the report;
•   performed sample-based audits of the processes for generating, gathering and managing the quantitative and
    qualitative data included in the report;
•   reviewed the process of acquiring information and economic-financial data from the 2008-09 certified consolidated
    balance sheet.

infosys sustainability report 2008-09


conclusions
in dnv’s opinion, the report is a fair representation of the company’s sustainability-related strategies, management
systems and performance. the report, along with the referenced information in the annual report and on the
company website, meets the general content and quality requirements of the gri g3, and dnv confirms that the gri
requirements for application level ‘a+’ have been met. we have evaluated the report’s adherence to the following
principles on a scale of ‘good’, ‘acceptable’ and ‘needs improvement’:
materiality : acceptable. the company’s materiality process has not missed out any significant, known material issues,
but the process should be validated with more specific inputs for each business area to bring out material issues that
reflect short, medium and long term impacts.
stakeholder inclusiveness : good. the company’s engagement process effectively identifies the expectations of
stakeholders in several business units through different engagement channels.
completeness : acceptable. within the reporting boundary defined by infosys, we do not believe that the report omits
relevant information that would influence stakeholder assessments or decisions or that reflect significant economic,
environmental and social impacts.
responsiveness : acceptable. within the reporting boundary defined by infosys, the expectations expressed by
stakeholders have generally been addressed through corporate policies and management systems which are reflected
in the report.
reliability : acceptable. the company has developed its own data management system for capturing and reporting its
sustainability performance. this has enabled the company to improve the reliability of data resulting in certain
re-statements for year 2007-08. although no systematic errors have been detected, dnv has identified some manual
discrepancies on data which have subsequently been corrected.
neutrality : good. the company has reported sustainability-related issues in a balanced manner, in terms of content and
tone. challenges and limitations are presented together with commitments to future improvements.
opportunities for improvement
the following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported back to the management of infosys.
however, these do not affect our conclusions on the report, and they are indeed generally consistent with the
management objectives already in place.
•   implementation of systematic quality assurance procedures of internal data management systems will help further
    improve the reporting process by increasing the reliability of reported data.
•   expanding the boundary of environment, health and safety performance reporting to global operations will provide
    stakeholders with a fuller picture of infosys’ impact in these areas.
•   best practices in reporting among peer organisations should be used to improve the quality of disclosures.
dnv’s independence
dnv was not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in the report except for this assurance
statement. dnv did not provide any services to infosys during 2008-09 that could conflict with the independence of
our work.
dnv expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or entity would make based on this
assurance statement.
