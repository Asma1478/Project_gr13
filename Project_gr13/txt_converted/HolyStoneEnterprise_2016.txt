                 1.1    company profile

                 holy stone enterprise co., ltd.
                 a passive components manufacturer and an electronic components merchandiser,


holy stone
                 possesses capabilities of the development and manufacturing of multilayer
                 ceramic capacitors (mlcc) and ceramic metallized substrate. the company also
                 merchandises electronic components from world-class brands, varying from logic
                 and analog ics, to microcontroller (mcu) and power amplifier.

                 communication, consumer, and automotive electronic products, making our life a
                 breeze. holy stone will be launching new product lines for lighting, power supply,
                 and industrial/automotive use in the near future.



                                                                                                      5

2. ceramic metallized substrate: holy stone has been investing considerably in the development of ceramic thermal substrates for led lighting
applications, and started mass production since 2012 and has seen gradual increase in capacity. since the coefficient of thermal expansion of
ceramic is similar to that of an ic chip that gives higher stability, ceramic substrate is the most ideal material for energy-saving lighting. with
advancement of techniques, we have made adjustment in the product name from ceramic thermal substrate to ceramic metallized substrate.



                                                                            in addition to manufacturing capacitors, holy stone also merchandises

✔ raw material recognition: material safety data sheets (msds) and third-party inspection report must be prepared for the approval of new raw
materials. only materials approved can be included in our development and production plan. approved materials still need to be inspected annually
for hazardous substances by a third party. guarantee and certification of hazard free substances must also be renewed annually for complete
implementation on restriction management. changes in information on the guarantee such as raw materials, production process, plant location, and
equipments must be notified to the company immediately to facilitate the pollution control.

✔ green design: hazardous substances control is in place from recognition phase. product is sent for sgs inspection during
sampling phase. only product passed the inspection can enter trial production and mass production.

✔ risk management: records of production, use of material, and quality inspections are kept electronically in our system file
checker (sfc). sources and areas of pollution can be tracked for specific products with pollution concerns, and such products
can also be effectively controlled within the plant before shipping out.

in addition to iso14001 certified, we also file environmental information accurately to the authority in accordance with regulations. this allows us
to track the flow of wastes, in order to eﬀectively manage and avoid secondary pollution. in addition, we also carry on waste reduction and recycle

wastewater and waste solvents also help with waste reduction.


waste recycle
for waste recycle, diverging management for waste water with high/medium/low intensity was implemented at plating station in october 2015,
and recovery of tin prepregging function was underway at the same time, aiming to avoid the decrease in output of highly intensive solvent. the
project was scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of 2016, with the hope of decreasing waste water and processing fee. by carrying
out diverging management above, a total of 594.5 liters of highly intensive solvent was reduced in 2015 within department of ceramic substrate.
the company will continue to keep an eye out for latest regulations and act on relevant proposals. for 2016, the company will be planning
processing agency audit, aiming to increase eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness in waste recycle.

         ✔ when a department purchases or reimburses environmental expenses, they need to include the environmental activity code in

holy stone scholarships- ongoing support to help children spread their wings

receiving education is a basic right for every child, and it is a cornerstone to grow out of poverty especially for the underprivileged kids. one of the most
pivotal services holy stone foundation provides each year is to give scholarships to support outstanding students and those in need. apart from financial
support, the foundation also invited students to scholarship’s meeting, not only to get to know more about holy stone, but to spread the spirit and
inspiration of charity to which the foundation is built on, and to pass on the love and warmness they perceive, with the aim of creating a positive cycle to
spread love.

in 2015, the number of students receiving scholarships is 66. as of 2015, the total amount of scholarship granted has reached nt$6.80 million. the
company also focuses on helping students to learn more about real-world corporations and workplace. therefore, starting from 2011, we have been
inviting students to participate in the company’s activities, including lectures, seminars, rummage sale, and community services. from these after-school
activities, the students have the opportunity to broaden their horizons and to start to plan for future career path.


art gallery featuring “love is not rare because of you”

arts and humanities are two things that can heal people’s body, soul and spirit, and can also clear people’s mind and bring forth inspiration. holy stone
has been sponsoring for artistic development for the underprivileged for years. the documentary of rock me to the moon in 2013 touched numerous
hearts with the story of families aﬀected by rare medical conditions. in addition, holy stone invited the rock band from the movie called sleepy dads to our
year-end party, so that more people can have a chance to learn more about taiwan foundation for rare disorders. the relationship between holy stone
and taiwan foundation for rare disorders has also begun since then. starting from 2014, holy stone has been sponsoring for artistic courses with taiwan
foundation for rare disorders, aiming to spread love to families with rare disease patients. at the end of 2014, taiwan foundation for rare disorders held
a concert titled “love is not rare because of you”, and a member of artistic class chien-fung hsieh was responsible for background illustration with
colourful and exceptionally narrative expression. in 2015, hsieh was also invited to exhibit his artwork at holy stone oﬃce for six months.

during the exihibit period, hsieh and his mother paid a visit to holy stone headquarters and
held a meeting with our employees, sharing the stories behind his paintings, the setbacks and
how he overcame them, and how gained his confidence back. many of the employees related
to his feelings. hsieh also drew a painting based on the courtyard of holy stone headquarters
with delicate strokes and gave it as a gift to holy stone, memorizing this special moment in
life.
