our sustainability governance has been further
enhanced through the establishment of a
sustainability committee, comprising members of
the titan board and its executive committee,
overseeing our long term commitment to sustainable
development.
indicative highlights of our sustainability efforts in 2016

include the group’s continuing focus on safety,
which resulted in a reduction in lost time incidents;         chief executive officer
the increased use of waste or by-products as raw
materials; the recognition of our pennsuco
operations in florida for their “zero waste”
performance; and the enhancement of the group’s
partnerships with academia and educational-
support programs, in line with our european “pact for
youth” commitment.
our investment in emission control and reduction,
where needed, continued, leading to a further
significant improvement in dust emissions; on the
other hand, co2 emissions increased marginally, as
the improvement achieved through the increased
use of alternative fuels was not sufficient to
counteract an unfavorable fuel and product mix. in
the process of detailing our strategy in alignment with
the un agenda 2030, we will define within 2017 our
new long-range emissions targets.
a positive outlook for 2017
prospects for titan in 2017 appear positive, despite
the considerable challenges and uncertainties
around the globe. the usa business is expected to
remain the main driver of growth and profitability,
thanks to the growth in demand and the benefits
accrued from our extensive investments.
in greece, demand may decrease further due to a
timing gap in the infrastructure projects pipeline;
exports will continue, but under increasingly
competitive pressures. southeastern europe, in a
broader region of political instability and economic
weakness, will remain at its current levels of activity.
in egypt, in spite of volatility in the short term,
demand is likely to be sustained and our operations
will benefit from the impact of the investment
program completed in late 2016. in turkey, the
positive trend is likely to be reversed, as additional
cement production capacity comes on stream and
domestic challenges may affect demand. finally, in
brazil, demand is expected to begin to stabilize in
2017.
based on the 2016 results and the outlook for 2017,

position as of 31 december 2016 and the separate and consolidated income statement and
statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement
for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.

management’s responsibility for the separate and consolidated financial
statements

management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate and
consolidated financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting
standards, as adopted by the european union, and for such internal control as management
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate and consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

auditor’s responsibility

our responsibility is to express an opinion on these separate and consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with international
standards    on     auditing    which    have     been    transposed   into  greek   law
(gg/b’/2848/23.10.2012). those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements
and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate
and consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
disclosures in the separate and consolidated financial statements. the procedures selected
depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the separate and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
entity's preparation and fair presentation of the separate and consolidated financial
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal
control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the separate and consolidated financial statements.

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

opinion

in our opinion, the separate and consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the “titan cement company s.a.” and its
subsidiaries as of december 31, 2016, and their financial performance and cash flows for the
year then ended in accordance with international financial reporting standards, as adopted
by the european union.

taking into consideration, that management is responsible for the preparation of the board of
directors’ report and corporate governance statement that is included to this report
according to provisions of paragraph 5 article 2 of law 4336/2015 (part b), we note the
following:

a) in the board of directors’ report is included the corporate governance statement that
   contains the information that is required by article 43bb of codified law 2190/1920.

b) in our opinion, the board of directors’ report has been prepared in accordance with the
   legal requirements of articles 43a and 107a and paragraph 1 (c and d) of article 43bb of
   the codified law 2190/1920 and the content of the board of directors’ report is
   consistent with the accompanying financial statements for the year ended 31/12/2016.

c) based on the knowledge we obtained from our audit for the company “titan cement
   company s.a.” and its environment, we have not identified any material misstatement to
   the board of directors report.

deferred tax assets are recognized for the carryforwards of unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. the determination of the amount of tax attribute carry-forward to
recognize requires management judgment in assessing future profitability and recoverability (note 2.3).

on 31 december 2016, certain group entities had tax carry forward losses of €441.2 million (2015: €499.9 million). these entities
have recognized deferred tax assets amounting to €156.2 million (2015: €74.1 million), attributable to losses amounting to €393.7
million (2015: €206.1 million), as these deferred tax assets will be recoverable using the estimated future taxable income based on
approved business plans (note 18).

for the remaining tax carry forward losses €47.5 million, no deferred tax asset has been recognized, since they did not meet the
recognition criteria according to ias 12. tax carry forward losses amounting to €45.6 million expire up to 2021, while losses
amounting to €1.9 million may be carried forward indefinitely.

the group subsidiary in usa, titan america llc (tallc), recorded a deferred income tax benefit and related deferred tax asset of
€89.6 million in 2016 financial statements. the majority of this benefit was associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset
for previously unrecognized net operating losses carry-forward generated in periods prior to 2016. following consistent year on
year profitability improvements in 2016 and a favourable outlook for 2017-2019, management concluded that profitability trends
and projections for tallc provide sufficient and objectively verifiable evidence to conclude that future profitability overcomes
the weight of negative evidence generated by successive loss years prior to 2016.

on 31 december 2016, the company recognized deferred tax assets amounting to €6.6 million (2015: €13.9 million) on tax carry
forward losses which met the recognition criteria. the tax losses of the company can be utilized up to (and including) 2018.

the diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume
conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. the company has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share
options. for the share options a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value
(determined as the average annual market price of the company's shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights
attached to outstanding share options. the number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that
would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options. the difference is added to the denominator as an issue of
ordinary shares for no consideration. no adjustment is made to net profit (numerator).

during 2016, the group received €0.9 million (2015: €1.1 million) from the disposal of tangible assets with total net book value of €4.2
million (2015: €3.2 million). thus, the group recognized €3.3 million losses (2015: €2.2 million) on disposal of ppe in the consolidated

of ppe in the income statement (note 4).

impairments of property, plant and equipment
during 2016, the group recorded an impairment amounting to €5.2 million mainly due to machinery impairment in greece and
western europe segment. the machinery was impaired as its recoverable amount was lower than its carrying amount. the
recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell and was determined using a sale price quote from an unrelated third party as
the amount that the buyer would purchase this machinery. this quote is not from an active market and represents a level 3 in the
valuation hierarchy.

during 2015, the group’s subsidiary in u.s.a., titan america llc (tallc), decided to suspend of development activities at the site of
a proposed cement plant in eastern north carolina, usa (the “castle hayne” project). as a result of this, tallc recorded an
impairment provision of €12.4 million to bring the asset to its recoverable amount of €1.0 million within the december 31, 2015
financial statements. the fair value was obtained through an independent valuator and represents a level 3 in the valuation
hierarchy.

the assets of the company have not been pledged. on the turkish subsidiary adocim marmara cimento beton sanayi ve ticaret
a.s. assets, there is mortgage of €4.6 million, securing its bank credit facilities.



12. investment property
the group's investment property does not include certain investment properties of the company, which are leased to group
subsidiaries, and as a result, are included in property, plant and equipment in the group statement of financial position. investment
property is measured at fair value by external, independent, certified valuators, members of the institute of the certified valuators
and certified from the european group of valuers' associations (tegova) & rics (royal institution of chartered surveyors).

the provision of goodwill impairment is charged to the income statement.


key assumptions
the recoverable amount of all cgus has been determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations use pre-tax
cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. cash flows beyond the
five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
the calculation of value-in-use for the group's evaluated cgus is most sensitive to the following assumptions:

• sales volumes;
• selling prices;
• gross margin;
• growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the specific projection period; and
• discount rates

sales volumes:
volume assumptions have been provided by local management and reflect its best estimates as derived from sales forecasts for
the development of which a combination of factors have been taken into consideration: past performance, local market growth
estimates, infrastructure projects in which the company will participate (public investments), etc. in the usa, sales volume growth
rates are also based on published industry research and take into account demographic trends including population growth,
household formation, and economic output (among other factors) in the states where the group operates. in addition to
demographic trends, long-term growth rates take into account cement/concrete intensity in construction which has historically
varied from state to state based on building codes, availability of raw materials, and other factors.

selling prices:
price assumptions have been provided by local management and reflect its best estimates. factors that have been taken into
consideration involve inflation, brand loyalty, growth rate of the regional economy, competition, production cost increases, etc.
τhe group has assumed the following compound annual growth rates for sales for the five year period.

gross margin :
illustrates all cost of goods sold related factors and incorporates among others, the evolution of energy cost. τhe group has
assumed the following gross margin compound annual growth rates for the five year period:

perpetual growth rates:
factors that have been taken into consideration are estimates from the local central banks in the countries where the group
operates relating to the growth of the local economies over the next years along with the co-relation that exists between the
growth of the economy and that of the construction sector.

discount rates:
discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each cgu, taking into consideration the time value
of money and individual risks of the underlying assets that have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. the discount
rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the group and its operating segments and is derived from its weighted
average cost of capital (wacc). the wacc takes into account both debt and equity. the cost of equity is derived from the
expected return on investment by the group’s investors. the cost of debt is based on the interest bearing borrowings the group is
obliged to service. country-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. the beta factors are evaluated
annually based on publicly available market data.

sensitivity of recoverable amounts
on 31 december 2016, the group analyzed the sensitivities of the recoverable amounts of each cgu to a reasonable possible
change of a key assumption (notably to a change of one point in the discount rate or the perpetual growth rate).

impairment of goodwill
in greece, a significant reduction in demand of construction materials due to the persisting economic recession led to the
reduced revenues compared to the last year forecasts. as a result, the group recorded an impairment loss of €2.5 million (2015:
€4.0 million) on the goodwill, based on the respective value in use as calculated using a discount rate of 9.5% (2015: 11.6%).

in south eastern europe, the significant decrease of a terminal's commercial viability resulted in the recognition of an impairment
loss of €2.8 million. the calculation of value in use was based on a discount rate of 8.2%.

2010 programme
on june 3, 2010 the company approved the introduction of a new, three-year stock option programme (2010 programme). in the
years 2010, 2011 and 2012, executive members of the company’s board of directors and senior executives of the company and its
affiliates in greece and abroad were granted options, vesting of which is subject to the financial results of the company and the
performance of its ordinary share, to acquire up to 1,000,000 ordinary shares of the company at a sale price equal to the share’s
nominal value, that is €4.00 per share.

under this programme, the options granted each year have a maturity period of three years and can be exercised within two years
after the completion of the three year period. each option must be exercised within the year following the one in which the final
number of options that can be exercised is determined. if the deadline is exceeded, those particular options will irrevocably lapse. all
vesting is conditional upon the employees' continued employment throughout the vesting period. the number of options that vest
each year will be determined as follows:

1) one-third of options granted vest based on the financial results of the company.

2) one-third of options granted vest based on titan cement’s stock performance relative to three athens stock exchange indices
during the three year period.
3) one-third of options granted vest based on titan cement’s stock performance relative to that of ten predefined international
cement producing companies during the three year period.

payments”.

22. share capital and premium (continued)
2014 programme
on 20 june 2014, the general meeting approved the introduction of a new, three-year stock option programme. according to this
programme, the company’s board of directors can grant option up to 1,000,000 ordinary shares of the company at a sale price
equal to €10.00 per share. beneficiaries of the stock option plan are the executive members of the board of directors of the
company, the managers and the employees who have the same rank in affiliated companies inside and outside greece and finally
a limited number of the other employees who stand out on a continuous basis for their good performance and have a high potential
for advancement.

the vesting period of the stock options that were granted in 2014, 2015 and those that will be granted in 2016 shall be three years.
therefore, the relevant option rights shall become mature in december of 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively, provided that the
beneficiaries are still employees of the group. after the completion of the three-year vesting period, the final option rights number,
which the beneficiaries will be entitled to exercise, shall be determined by the board of directors, within the first four months of 2017,
2018 and 2019 respectively and shall depend:

a) by 50% on the average three year return on average capital employed (roace) compared to the target of each year period, as
this will be determined by the board of directors before granting the relevant option rights.

b) by 50% on the overall performance of the company's common share compared to the average overall performance of the shares
of the ten predefined international cement producing companies.

the beneficiaries shall be entitled to exercise their stock option rights, either in whole or in part, within the first five days of each month,
paying the company the relevant amounts until the expiration date of their stock options, i.e. until december of the third year after
these stock options have been vested.

the options granted under the 2014 programme have been accounted for in terms of the requirements of ifrs 2 “share based
payments”.

the number of share options that were granted during 2014, 2015 and 2016 was 250,190, 313,080 and 303,150 respectively.

the fair value of the options granted in 2014 was €7.39 per option, determined using the binomial method and the monte carlo
simulation valuation model. the significant inputs used in the aforementioned methodologies were the share price at grant date of
€25.32, the employee forfeiture rate 9.2%, the volatility of the share price estimated at 47.2%, the dividend yield of 0.376% and the
yield of the 3 year eu benchmark (deutsche bund) government bond yield rate of 0.083%.

the fair value of the options granted in 2015 was €4.14 per option, determined using the binomial method and the monte carlo
simulation valuation model. the significant inputs used in the aforementioned methodologies were the share price at grant date of
€19.55, the employee forfeiture rate 9.2%, the volatility of the share price estimated at 40.61%, the dividend yield of 0.59% and the
yield of the 1 year euribor rate of 0.166%.

the fair value of the options granted in 2016 was €5.17 per option, determined using the binomial method and the monte carlo
simulation valuation model. the significant inputs used in the aforementioned methodologies were the share price at grant date of
€20.38, the employee forfeiture rate 9.2%, the volatility of the share price estimated at 42.80%, the dividend yield of 0.87% and the
yield of the 1 year euribor rate of -0.15%.
on 31 december 2016 the number of the cancelled share options that were granted during 2014, 2015 was 4.300 and 2.100
respectively.

23. other reserves (continued)
certain group companies are obliged according to the applicable commercial law to retain a percentage of
their annual net profits as legal reserve. this reserve cannot be distributed during the operational life of the
company.

the contingency reserves include, among others, reserves formed by the company and certain group
subsidiaries by applying developmental laws. these reserves have exhausted their tax liability or have been
permanently exempted from taxation, so there is no additional tax charge for the group and the company
from their distribution. based on the decision of the general meeting of 17 june 2016 the "special & contingency
reserves" have increased by €31.8 million due to the transfer from "retained earnings".

the tax exempt reserves under special laws, according to the greek tax legislation, are exempt from income
tax, provided that they are not distributed to the shareholders.

the distribution of the remaining aforementioned reserves can be carried out after the approval of the
shareholders at the annual general meeting and the payment of the applicable tax. the group has no intention
to distribute the remaining amount of these reserves and consequently, has not calculated the income tax that
would arise from such distribution.

the revaluation reserve includes: a) €42.8 million (2015: €48.2 million) as the fair value of tangible and intangible
assets that the group had in egypt through its participation in the joint venture lafarge-titan egyptian
investments ltd, until it fully acquired the joint venture and b) the €0.2 million (2015: €1.4 million) debit difference
between the fair value and the book value arising from the recognition of the put option of the non-controlling
interests for the sale of antea cement sha's shares.

the actuarial differences reserve records the re-measurement gains and losses (actuarial gains and losses)
arising from the actuarial studies performed by the group's subsidiaries for various benefit, pension or other
retirement schemes (note 25).
the foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.

moreover, foreign currency translation reserve includes the currency translation differences reserve on
transactions designated as part of net investment in foreign operations. during the last quarter of 2016, the
group subsidiary titan egyptian investment ltd (teil) decided to renew the loan of €76.9 million that had entered
into with its subsidiary in egypt, alexandria portland cement co. s.a.e. (apcc) in 2010. according to its
accounting policy, the group recognizes in its consolidated financial statements the aforementioned intergroup
loan as part of the net investment in the egyptian operation. on 31 december 2016, this reserve has a debit
balance of €23.2 million.
the currency translation differences on derivative hedging position reserve illustrates the exchange differences
arising from the translation into euro of loans in foreign currency, which have been designated as net investment
hedges for certain group subsidiaries abroad. it also illustrates the exchange differences arising from the
valuation of financial instruments used as cash flow hedges for transactions in foreign currencies.

25. retirement and termination benefit obligations

greece
greek labor legislation requires that the payment of retirement and termination indemnities is based on the
number of years of service to the company by the employees and on their final remuneration. the group grants
retirement indemnities which exceed the legal requirements. these retirement indemnities are unfunded and the
liabilities arising from such obligations are actuarially valued by an independent firm of actuaries. the last
actuarial valuation was undertaken in december 2016. the principal actuarial assumptions used were a discount
rate of 1.5% (2015: 1.9%), future salary increases of 1.75% (2015: 2%) and no change in future pensions.


usa
the group's u.s. subsidiaries operate defined benefit plans and other post-retirement benefit plans. the method
of accounting for the latter, as well as the valuation assumptions and the frequency of valuations are similar to
those used for defined benefit plans.

all of the group's u.s. subsidiaries' defined benefit pension plans and all but one of its other post-retirement plans
have been frozen as to new participants and credited service. one post-retirement benefit plan exists (for certain
active and former employees) whereby eligible retirees receive benefits consisting primarily of assistance with
medical insurance costs between the dates of early retirement and medicare eligibility.

on 31 december 2016 the plan assets of the group's subsidiaries in the us have invested approximately 58%
(2015: 57%) in equity instruments quated in us and international stock markets and 42% (2015: 43%) in fixed
investments (us and international bonds). the discount rate that has been adopted for the study of the pension
plans of the group's subsidiaries in the u.s. was 4% (2015: 4%).


multi-employer plan
certain employees participate in a union sponsored, defined benefit multi-employer pension plan. this plan is not
administered by the group's u.s. subsidiaries and contributions are determined in accordance with the provisions
of the negotiated labor contract. these contributions are affected by the funded status of the plan.

excess benefit plan
this plan is intended to constitute an unfunded plan of deferred compensation for a selected group of highly
compensated employees under the employee income security act of 1974 ("erisa"). for this purpose the group's
u.s. subsidiary created an irrevocable trust to facilitate the payment of deferred compensation to participants
under this plan. under this plan the participants are eligible to defer from 0% to 20% of eligible compensation for
the applicable plan year. in 2012, the group's u.s. subsidiary suspended its matching amounts for all
contributions. on 31 december 2016 and 2015, plan assets totaled €4,364 thousand and €4,578 thousands,
respectively, and are classified as other non current assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of
financial position (note 17). there were no costs for the plan for the year ended 31 december 2016 or 2015.

litigation matters in egypt

a.    privatization cases

1. in 2011, two former employees of beni suef, filed an action before the administrative court of cairo, seeking the
nullification of the privatisation of beni suef which took place in 1999 through the sale of beni suef’s shares to financiere
lafarge after a public auction. titan group acquired in 1999 50 per cent and in 2008 the balance of lafarge’s interest in
beni suef. approximately 99.98 per cent in the share capital of beni suef is held today by alexandria portland. the
administrative court of cairo issued on 15 february 2014 a first instance judgment which entirely dismissed the request for
cancellation of the privatisation of beni suef. the court further judged the re-employment of ex-employees who had left
the company in the framework of voluntary redundancy schemes. beni suef and the plaintiffs have already appealed
against the judgment of the first instance court. on 19 january 2015, the supreme administrative court issued a judgment
suspending the case until the issuance of a ruling by the supreme constitutional court on a lawsuit challenging the
constitutionality of law no. 32/2014 (‘‘appeal procedures on state contracts law’’). the case is still suspended and no
further action has been taken until now. the view of beni suef’s lawyers is that the plaintiffs’ action is devoid of any legal or
factual ground.

2. in june 2013, beni suef was notified of another action filed before the administrative court of cairo seeking as in the
above case to cancel the sale of the shares of beni suef to financiere lafarge. the administrative court of cairo issued on
25 june 2015 a first instance judgment referring the case to the investment circuit no. 7. the latter has recently referred the
case to the commissioners’ panel and no hearing date has been scheduled until now. the view of beni suef’s lawyers is
that the action is devoid of any legal or factual ground.

3. in 2012, an ex-employee of alexandria portland brought an action before the administrative court of alexandria against
the president of the republic of egypt, the prime minister, the minister of investments, the minister of industry, the governor
of alexandria, the manager of the mines and salinas project in alexandria and the manager of the mines and quarries
department in alexandria seeking the annulment of the sale of the shares of alexandria portland to blue circle cement
group in 1999. alexandria portland was not named defendant in the action. following a capital market transaction
concluded in 2001, blue circle cement group was acquired by lafarge group, which subsequently sold its interest in
alexandria portland through two private transactions to titan group in 2002 and 2008. the administrative court of
alexandria issued on 31 january 2015 a first instance judgment which suspended the case initially until 28 may 2016 and
subsequently until 15 october 2016, provided that by such date the supreme constitutional court had ruled on the lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of law no. 32/2014 (‘‘appeal procedures on state contracts law’’). the case has been
referred to the administrative court of cairo, investment circuit no.1 but no hearing has been scheduled until now. the
view of alexandria portland’s lawyers is that the action is devoid of any legal and factual ground.

4. in may 2013, a new action was filed by three ex-employees of alexandria portland seeking as in the above case the
annulment of the sale of the shares of alexandria portland to blue circle cement group. the action has been raised
against the prime minister, the minister of investment, and the chairman of the holding company for chemical industries,
the president of the central auditing organization, the legal representative of alexandria portland and the legal
representative of blue circle industries. the case has been repeatedly adjourned and no judgment will be handed down
from the administrative court until the issuance of a ruling by the supreme constitutional court on the lawsuit challenging
the constitutionality of law no. 32/ 2014. the view of alexandria portland’s lawyers is that the action is devoid of any legal
and factual ground.

31. contingencies and commitments (continued)

b.    other cases
1. an individual residing in the vicinity of the plant of alexandria portland has filed a claim before the administrative court
of alexandria against the governor of alexandria, the head of el-agamy district, the minister of trading and industry, the
minister of environment, the president of alexandria environmental affairs agency, the president of industrial development
authority and alexandria portland, seeking the abolition of the administrative decision of the competent egyptian authority
which issued the operating license for the alexandria portland plant in alexandria, alleging violations of environmental and
related regulation. on 25 may 2014 the court decided to refer this case to the cairo administrative court due to lack of
jurisdiction. the case has been repeatedly adjourned and on 24 october 2015 it was referred to another division of the
court for deliberation. the case has been again repeatedly adjourned and a new hearing has been scheduled on 3 may
2017. alexandria portland’s view is that the plant’s operating license has been issued lawfully and in full compliance with
the relevant egyptian laws and regulations.

2. in 2007, beni suef obtained the license for the construction of a second production line at the company’s plant through
a bidding process run by the egyptian trading and industrial authority for the amount of egp 134.5 million. the egyptian
industrial development authority subsequently raised the value of the license to egp 251 million. in october 2008 beni suef
filed a case before the administrative court against the minister of trade and industry and the chairman of the industrial
development authority requesting an order obliging the industrial development authority to grant the expansion license to
beni suef for egp 500. alternatively, if the court rejects this request, beni suef is requesting the price to be the egp134.5
million offered by beni suef in the bid. the case was referred to the state commissioners in august 2014 and it has been
postponed until 24 may 2017 for reviewing. the view of beni suef’s lawyers is that the outcome of the case will be positive.

3. a non-governmental organisation, the nile agricultural organization, has raised a court case against beni suef claiming
that beni suef has illegally occupied the plaintiff’s land and is seeking compensation to the amount of egp 300 million. the
contested land however had been legally allocated to beni suef many years ago by the relevant authority, the new urban
communities agency, and since 1988 beni suef has held the licenses for the exploitation of the quarries on this land. a new
hearing of the case has been scheduled for 26 september 2016. the case was then postponed until 27 march 2017 for
reporting. the view of beni suef’s lawyers is that the case has a high probability of being won.


put option in antea
the group had granted to non controlling interest shareholders, european bank for reconstruction and development
(ebrd) and international finance corporation (ifc) the option to sell their shares in antea cement sha (antea) at
predetermined conditions.

on 5 february 2015, the group acquired from ebrd the 20% of its share in antea. instead, ifc continues to have the
aforementioned exercisable option to sell an equivalent percentage. on 31 december 2016, the option’s fair value of €9.7
million (31.12.2015: €8.3 million) is recognized as a current liability in the statement of financial position.


contingent tax liability
the financial years, referred to in note 35, have not been audited by the tax authorities and therefore the tax obligations of

b) market risk
market risk comprises three main types of risk: currency risk, price risk, such as commodity risk and interest rate risk.
group exposure to exchange rate (fx) risk derives from existing or expected cash flows denominated in currencies other than the euro
(imports / exports) and from international investments.

fx risks are managed using natural hedges, fx derivatives / swaps and fx forwards. borrowings denominated in the same currency as
the assets that are being financed and these create a natural hedge for investments in foreign subsidiaries exposed to fx conversion
risk.
however, part of the financing of group activities in the usa, egypt and albania, is in different currencies (euro) than their functional
ones. their refinancing in local currencies along with fx hedging transactions are examined at regular intervals.

33. financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
the ratio of fixed to floating rates of the group’s net borrowings is determined by market conditions, group strategy and financing
requirements. occasionally interest rate derivatives may be used to mitigate the relevant risk and balance the mix of fixed and floating
rates of the group’s borrowings.

on 31 december 2016, following the issuance of €300 million notes, by which part of existing fixed rate notes of 8.75% coupon rate were
refinanced prior their maturity, the group’s ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, taking into account outstanding cross currency swaps,
stood at 62%/38% (31 december 2015: 43%/57%).

the impact of interest rate volatility is limited in the income statement and cash flow from operating activities of the group, as shown in
the sensitivity analysis table below:

note: table above excludes the positive impact of interest received from deposits.

interest rate trends and the duration of the group’s financing needs are monitored on a forward looking basis. consequently, decisions
about the duration and the mix between fixed and floating rate debt are taken on an ad-hoc basis.

c) credit risk
the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. trade accounts receivable consist mainly of a large, widespread customer
base. all group companies monitor the financial position of their debtors on an on-going basis.
when considered necessary, additional collateral is requested to secure credit. provisions for impairment losses are made for special
credit risks. as at 31 december 2016, there are no outstanding doubtful significant credit risks which are not already covered by a
provision for doubtful receivables.

credit risk arising from financial institutions’ inability to meet their obligations towards the group deriving from placements, investments
and derivatives, is mitigated by pre-set limits on the degree of exposure to each individual financial institution. these pre-set limits are set
in accordance to the group treasury policies. at 31 december 2016, the group’s majority financial assets and derivative financial
instruments were held with investment grade financial institutions.
on 31 december 2016, the group's cash and cash equivalents were held at time deposits and current accounts. note 21 includes an
analysis on cash and cash equivalents.

33. financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)

d) capital management
the primary objective of the group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to
support its operations and maximize shareholder value.

the group manages its capital structure conservatively with the leverage ratio, as this is shown from the relationship between
total liabilities and total equity as well as net debt and profit before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
impairment.
titan’s policy is to maintain leverage ratios in line with an investment grade profile.
the group includes within net debt, interest bearing loans and borrowings, less cash and cash equivalents.

the management assessed that the cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities
(excluding the put option) approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

fair value hierarchy
the group and the company use the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of the assets and liabilities by valuation
method:

level 1: based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

level 2: based on valuation techniques whereby all inputs having a significant effect on the fair value are observable, either directly or
indirectly and includes quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not so much actively traded.

level 3: based on valuation techniques whereby all inputs having a significant effect on the fair value are not observable market data.

the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the group's and the company’s assets and liabilities as at 31 december
2016 and 2015.

34. fair value measurement (continued)
the fair value of level 3 investment property is estimated by the group and the company by external, independent, certified
valuators (note 12).
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. the following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair values:

level 1

level 1 available-for-sale financial assets are banks' listed securities acquired by the company through the greek banks
recapitalization, during 2015. part of these shares has been disposed in the fiscal year of 2015 and the remaining part has been
disposed in the 1st half of 2016.

level 2
level 2 long and short term borrowings are evaluated by the group and the company based on parameters such as interest rates,
specific country risk factors, or price quotations at the reporting date. especially for long-term borrowings, quoted market prices or
dealer quotes for the specific or similar instruments are used.

level 2 derivative financial instruments comprise cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and oil swaps (note 33).

τhe group and the company use a variety of methods and make assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each
reporting date. the aforementioned contracts have been fair valued using: a) forward exchange rates that are quoted in the active
market, b) forward interest rates extracted from observable yield curves, c) oil prices extracted from observable yield curves, which
are quoted in the active market.

level 3
level 3 available-for-sale financial assets refer mainly to investments in foreign property funds in which the group owns an
insignificant percentage. their valuation is made based on their financial statements, which present the assets at fair value.

level 3 put option consists of the put option that the group has granted to non-controlling interest shareholder of its subsidiary in
albania, antea cement sha. the put option is valued using a discounted cash flow model. the valuation requires management to
make certain assumptions about unobservable inputs to the model. certain significant unobservable inputs are disclosed in the
table below:

                                                                               2016          2015
gross margin growth rate                                                      26.0%         35.4%
discount rate                                                                  8.2%         10.6%

in addition to the above, forecast cash flows for the first five years are a significant unobservable input. the management regularly
assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs and determines their impact on the
total fair value.

an increase of the forecast cash flows or the change in gross margin for cash flows in the subsequent periods would lead to an
increase in the fair value of the put option. on the other hand, an increase in the discount rate used to discount the forecast cash
flows would lead to a decrease in the fair value of the put option.

the significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. the fair value of the put option is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable
change in the forecast cash flows or the discount rate; however it is sensitive to a reasonable fluctuation of the change in gross
margin, as described in the following table:

          accordance with the reporting criteria;
         the disclosures relating to ‘identified material aspects and boundaries’ and ‘stakeholder engagement’ have been prepared in
          accordance with the standard disclosures g4-17 to g4-27 of the ‘gri g4 guidelines’;
         the relevant non-financial disclosures in the reports are aligned with:
          a) wbcsd/csi co2 and energy accounting and reporting standard for the cement industry (version 3.0 may 2011);
          b) csi guidelines for emission monitoring and reporting in the cement industry (version 2 march 2012 for sox, nox and dust;

         the integrated annual report 2016 meets the un global compact criteria relating to a communication on progress (cop) advanced
          level.


our reasonable assurance activities
a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability, ghg and assurance specialists performed the following activities:

         a review of external media reports to identify relevant sustainability issues in the reporting period.
         a review of the internal reporting guidelines, including conversion factors, estimates and assumptions used.
         an initial visit to titan head office in athens, greece to:

               o     interview relevant staff to understand titan’s strategy, policies, management and reporting systems for the non-financial
                     performance;
                o interview relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and processes (including internal
                     review processes) used for collecting and reporting performance information.
         visits to titan operations in albania (antea cement) and egypt (cairo and beni suef) to verify the source data underlying the
          performance information and review local activities regarding environmental and safety management, labour and human rights and
          stakeholder/community engagement.
         an analytical review and desktop testing of the year end data submitted by all sites included in the consolidated performance
          information, including an assessment of the conclusions of accredited third-party verification bodies relating to the verification of
          scope 1 ghg emissions that fall within the scope of the eu emissions trading scheme (eu ets).
         a second visit to titan head office in athens, greece to:
                o review the activities and results of stakeholder engagement and evidence underlying titan’s updated materiality
                     assessment;
                o test the effectiveness of internal controls in relation to the accuracy and completeness of the corporate consolidated data
                     for the relevant indicators;
                o collect additional evidence through interviews and documentation review to support management assertions covered by
                     our engagement.
         reviewing selected evidence related to the design, information collection, and production of the report in accordance with the
          report criteria.
         reviewing the presentation of information relevant to the scope of our work in the report to ensure consistency.


the limitations of our engagement
the reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating
the underlying information. it is important to understand our assurance conclusions in this context. our independent assurance statement
provides no assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular whether any
changes may have occurred to the information since it was first published.


our observations
we have provided titan with a separate detailed management report. without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the
following key observations:
         titan has a comprehensive set of group policies and has strengthened and revised a number of these in 2016 including human
          rights, anti-bribery and corruption, and competition law. titan should consider enhancing the implementation of group policies by
          developing performance standards to provide operations with a set of comparable and auditable performance expectations (beyond
          local legislation and market norms) through which alignment with group policies can be measured.
         titan identifies corruption as a strategic and operational risk in a number of countries in which it operates. while titan has
          implemented whistleblowing hotlines in greece and the usa, employees in other countries have limited mechanisms to
          anonymously report potential non-compliances with the company’s code of conduct and related group policies. we recommend
          that priority is given to an early extension of an anonymous local language hotline system to all countries of operation in order to
          improve corporate monitoring of possible non-compliances with the group policies.

notes
1)  active quarries within, containing or adjacent to areas designated for their high biodiversity value.
2)  sites with high biodiversity value where biodiversity management plans are actively implemented.
3)  since 2011, coverage of wholly owned active quarries has expanded, to include both quarries attached to titan’s cement plants
    and quarries for aggregates production.
4)  indirect co2 emissions are related to emissions released for the production of the electrical energy consumed at titan’s facilities.
    for their calculation we use emission factors provided by the supplier of the electrical energy or other publicly available data. if no
    such data are available, the most recent data provided by csi are used.
