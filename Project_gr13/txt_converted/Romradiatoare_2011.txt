anti-corruption

romradiatoare s.a. complies with national legislation against corruption and one of the company goals is to maintain its
integrity.
the main policies and management systems that support anti anti-corruption rights are:
     • code of conduct.. every business contract issued by romradiatoare s.a. has an appendix named code of conduct
                                                                                         anti-corruption
          which binds the business partners (suppliers, contractors etc.) to respect the anti corruption rights.
the most important practical activities undertaken to support anti-corruption rights are:
     • providing trainings for employees.       our employees behave honestly, are trustworthy and set a good example.
                                      employees.our
          furthermore they use the resources of the company in the best interest of romradiatoare s.a., and do not misuse these
          resources. our employees do not pay or accept bribes. as employees, they make a clear distinction between the
          interests of our company and their private interests, and avoid possible conflicts of interest. they do not accept gifts,
                            er benefits which could contradict this principle.
