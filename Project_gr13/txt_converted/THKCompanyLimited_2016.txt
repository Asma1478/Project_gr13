thk csr report
 2015/2016

         introduction

         from the very start, the thk group (usually referred to in
         these pages simply as thk) has been mindful of the im-
         portance of conducting its business operations in a manner
         that yields beneﬁts for society as a whole.
            this year’s csr report includes a three-part feature sec-
         tion examining thk’s efforts to honor its corporate social
         responsibilities in a number of key areas. the ﬁrst part looks
         at ways in which thk technology is used to protect proper-
         ty and vital assets as japan marks the twentieth anniversary
         of the great hanshin-awaji earthquake. the second part
         focuses on an experiment in hydroelectric power genera-
         tion using irrigation canals, intended as a contribution to
         regional revitalization. the third part examines efforts by
         thk rhythm to help combat global warming, an initiative
         that won the ﬁrm a commendation from japan’s minister of
         the environment.
            the section entitled “management system” includes a
         discussion of risk management efforts, while “involvement
         in society” focuses on thk’s relationships with its various
         stakeholders. “harmony with the environment” offers a look
         at thk’s environmental initiatives in ﬁscal 2014, including
         some quantitative results.
            the thk csr report is an essential tool for communi-
         cating with everyone who is connected in any way to thk
         and its activities. please take the time to ﬁll out the enclosed
         questionnaire—your comments and feedback will be great-
         ly appreciated.

    thk seismic isolation systems



    providing the optimal system to
    protect valuable property
    as japan marks the twentieth year since the great hanshin-awaji earthquake, amid lingering apprehension about the ability to withstand such
    vast destruction, there is renewed interest in earthquake preparedness. in the interest of safeguarding lives and valuable property as well as to
    ensure business continuity, increasing attention is being paid to seismic isolation systems that protect ofﬁce buildings, hospitals, dormitories,
    government buildings, public facilities, and private homes, as well as to seismic isolation devices that provide local protection for server comput-
    er, artwork, and measuring instruments and other high-precision devices. thk, determined to offer the most suitable and reliable product for each
    situation, is proud to help provide protection from menacing earthquakes. below we offer a look at these types of thk products and their uses.

meiwa hospital
nishinomiya, hyogo prefecture




attracted by reliable performance
backed up by actual testing

information technology has spread throughout the society
we live in. in recent years the medical industry has rapid-
ly incorporated electronic information systems. we now
have electronic health records and other kinds of medical
information systems that contain all sorts of information,
from ct and mri images and treatment plans for incoming
patients to explanatory documents and consent forms for
surgeries, and the enormous volumes of data collected are
stored on server computers. if the servers were destroyed
in a big earthquake or some other disaster, it’s no exagger-
ation to say that virtually all medical activity would come to
a halt. not only that, the data in an electronic health record
is important private information belonging to the patient,
and we have a responsibility to properly protect it. another                akinobu kitagawa, assistant manager, information service division.

enable a patient to give informed consent for an operation,

ordered by a court to produce them. as a medical institution     is needed to protect our servers, for our patients’ sake and

     strong protection, simple setup


     our company develops logistics systems and manages
     operations for hardware stores and supermarkets. in logis-
     tics systems, rapid response is extremely important. when
     products are sorted, for instance, split-second timing is
     required. cloud-computing is all the rage nowadays, but it’s
     very hard to achieve a rapid response with cloud-computing
     alone. server computers, the mainstay of our business, are
     therefore absolutely crucial.
        during the 1994 offshore sanriku earthquake, a major
     seismic event, our servers survived but had to endure con-
     siderable displacement, and we were worried about lan
     cables being severed and power cords being unplugged.
     that earthquake motivated us to start considering seismic
     isolation, and when we upgraded our servers we decided                                             tsuyoshi matsumura, manager.

     thk’s water-powered generating system



     carving out a new future with technology and imagination
     light, heat, and motion, from flowing water

     thk entered the ﬁeld of wind-powered generation in 2009 when it launched an internal project aimed at developing key compo-
     nents for wind turbines. exploring new uses for the technology developed in that initiative, thk has now applied it to water-pow-
     ered generation. following an initial test in taiwan in 2012, thk tested its new system at the kanagawa prefecture sagami river
     left bank land improvement district in 2014, continuing its campaign to help unleash the vast potential of renewable energy.




     thk technology stands out
     the use of irrigation canals for water-powered generation is relatively new. there are strict limitations on the extent to which
     irrigation canals can be modiﬁed, since any obstruction of the water ﬂow would have a major negative impact on the crop
     being watered. for conventional water-powered generation, falling water must be devised, which enables large volumes of
     power to be generated but requires major construction work that often costs at least ten times as much as the generating
     equipment itself.
         thk’s system, which generates electricity by means of a water wheel alone, costs relatively little and neither damages nor
     obstructs irrigation canals. since it doesn’t require damming the ﬂow to create falling water, there’s little likelihood of ﬂooding,
     and refuse and other ﬂoating matter can easily be cleared to permit stable operation.

as someone who works with irrigation, i’ve always thought
people should be more aware of the importance of irrigation
canals, and not just because they carry water, which is a
source of life. i’m glad to have had the chance to help ex-

it will help the public better understand the ways in which
canals can help improve living conditions.
   when i got my ﬁrst look at thk’s water-powered gen-

that goes into the water. i knew this would be a valuable

     japanese manufacturers are considered to be among the world’s best at reducing
     environmental impact, confronting the task with passionate effort and advanced tech-
     nology. in the workplace this goal is relentlessly pursued at a very high level. this type
     of tireless dedication to environmental protection earned thk rhythm’s hamamatsu

as a student at yamanashi prefecture’s kaede school of special support, i
attended seven on-site training sessions at the kofu plant. i never forgot how
nice everyone was, so when it came time to find a job i chose thk. in the
morning i work in the office scanning the order slips and drawings that get sent
to the factory, and in the afternoon i do packing work. this is only my first year
as an employee, but i was able to use my packing experience and ended up
representing yamanashi in the abilympics. coming into this year’s competition,
thk employees had won the gold medal in the product-packing event three
years in a row. i had my sights set on winning a medal, too, so i worked hard
to get better and ended up winning the bronze. a fellow thk employee from
the yamaguchi plant won the gold medal, so now thk has taken four in a
row, which is really great. to show my appreciation to all the people who have
supported and encouraged me, i hope to win and make it five in a row next year.
  thk doesn’t hold back—they give us their full support to tackle new challeng-
es. so far i’ve only been involved in packing and processing orders, but i’d like
to try my hand at other kinds of work in the future.
                                                                                                              kaga competing in the product-packing event.

i learned about thk from older students in high school, and i decided i wanted
to work there. when i joined the company i found my fellow employees to be
very considerate, and i felt the work environment would encourage my own
personal development. although i have a hearing disability, i participate in track
and field events. in november 2014 i represented yamagata prefecture in the
100-meter and 200-meter race at a national sports competition for people with
disabilities, held in nagasaki. my goal now is to compete in a tournament called
the deaflympics in 2020. i practice with a club for disabled people in yamagata.
  ever since i was in high school i’ve worked on improving my word-processing
skills. in september 2014 i competed in the word-processing division of the
regional abilympics. i didn’t make it into the national tournament, but i’m still
acquiring more skills. i have level-four certification now, and i’m aiming for level
three.
  at work i’m in charge of pre-assembly processing. i realize that the way i do
my job affects the next process and job performance down the line. in the future
i’d like to expand my horizons and do assembly processing work at other plants,
even overseas.

     harmony with the environment




     environmental management


     basic environmental policy
     thk has contributed to social and economic progress through its pioneering role as a manufacturer of linear motion systems and
     machine components. thk recognizes that businesses have a vital responsibility to help maintain a healthy global environment for
     the benefit of future generations. accordingly, thk has undertaken a broad range of initiatives to steadily reduce its environmental
     impact and preserve and improve the natural environment.




                                  the thk group’s basic environmental policy (revised june 3, 2013)
               1. preserving the environment is one of our most important tasks. we will strive to accurately determine the en-
                  vironmental impact of our products, services, and overall business activities and to ensure that every unit
                  within the group establishes and observes appropriate environmental targets.
               2. we will abide by all laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and establish and observe volun-
                  tary environmental standards, reviewing these whenever necessary in pursuit of more efﬁcient and effective
                  environmental management.
               3. we will continually strive to develop products that help reduce environmental burdens.
               4. we will continually strive to reduce our overall energy usage as well as speciﬁc energy consumption and re-
                  duce our greenhouse-gas emissions.
               5. we will continually conserve and recycle resources, primarily by reducing and recycling waste from our man-
                  ufacturing divisions, and strive to prevent environmental pollution.
               6. to extend our environmental efforts throughout the entire group, we will assist and help guide efforts by afﬁl-
                  iates and partner businesses and cooperate and collaborate with the communities where thk conducts busi-
                  ness.
               7. this basic environmental policy will be communicated to every division in the thk group through education,
                  training, and other means of raising environmental awareness. we will disclose relevant environmental data
                  to parties both within and outside the group in a timely manner.

at thk niigata, improvements have been made to the roof
to enhance the efficiency of the plant’s air conditioning and
thereby reduce power consumption. a layer of insulation has
been installed on the 2,800 square-meter roof of factory 1
in the plant’s old wing, which occupies about 20% of the
entire plant. this has lowered the summertime temperature
on the roof’s inner surface by as much as 17°c, resulting
in a 2.0% reduction in energy use compared to 2013 and
decreasing peak power-consumption, which is especially
important in summer, when demand is high. other sections
of the roof are expected to
undergo similar improve-
ments, which will result in
further energy savings.

co2 emissions generated by the shipping of products
and parts jumped from 3,689 tons in 2013 to 4,178 tons
in 2014, a major increase of 489 tons, or approximately
13.3%. basic-unit energy consumption (the volume of ener-

improved load ratios for trucks, and more consolidated ship-

co2 emissions in 2014.
