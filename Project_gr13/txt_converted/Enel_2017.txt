       model
during 2016 the organizational model was updated with the merger of the upstream gas and trading global business lines,
the integration of enel green power into the group’s organizational matrix, the establishment of the renewable energies
global business line and the shifting of the management of major hydroelectric plants from the generation global business
line (subsequently renamed thermal generation) to the renewable energies global business line, as well as the creation
of two new regions, north and central america and sub-saharan africa and asia, in order to guarantee effective organiza-
tional control over these areas which are constantly growing.

brand equity and digital strategy
at the start of 2016 a thorough corporate reorganization and a new industrial strategy saw the launch of the new enel
brand, dynamic, open and which tells the story of the profound changes inside and outside the company. the new brands
were launched for enel and its subsidiaries enel green power and endesa, and the global rebranding process started in the
countries where it operates, going from over twenty brands to just three. awareness and dissemination of the new logo are
ensured through commercial and promotional activities involving sport and culture which have always been a feature of enel.

enel decided to launch a project to redefine the methods to analyze the brand equity and image of the brands at global level,
in order to deepen its understanding and knowledge of its consumers. the main activities concern the periodic monitoring
of the presence of the group’s companies in the media (newspapers and audio-visual media, radio, tv and online), meas-
urement of the perceived image by analyzing the characteristics of the brand and their development over time, as well as
analysis of specific issues linked to the brand itself.


in 2016 the new global digital identity was launched which led to the restructuring and standardization of the websites of
the main group companies and the rationalization and concentration of contact points with stakeholders. as well as the new
website www.enel.com, which was created with a “user centric” approach with useful information and which can be ac-
cessed from any mobile device (such as a smartphone or tablet), the next step was to replicate the model on the whole net-
work of the group’s websites: a further 12 new websites were launched, a tangible example of the new open power identity.
in particular, the main sustainability and innovation projects are set out in the “stories” section of the website www.enel.
com, while the data relating to non-financial information and the materiality matrix are in the “investors” section.

enel shareholders
enel builds its relationship with all shareholders through dedicated corporate structures and, in particular, through the in-
vestor relations unit in the administration, finance and control department and a unit dedicated to dialogue with all share-
holders in the legal and corporate affairs department. in 2016 there were 615 meetings with institutional investors and 148
responses were provided to information requests from retail shareholders.
in order to further strengthen dialogue with investors, in 2016 the structure of the contents of the company’s website was
revised (www.enel.com, “investors” section), on which it is possible to find both economic, financial, environmental, social
and governance information and updated data and documents of particular interest, which make possible a multidisciplinary
and integrated view.

            enel and the financial market
enel has continuous dialogue with institutional investors, who generally follow the announcement of the industrial plan and/or
the interim results, collecting their indications and needs in a structured way.
on an annual basis an independent study is carried out on the perception of the company by the financial community. enel’s
commitment in the transition towards a new energy model has been recognized, characterized by the increase in genera-
tion from renewable sources and by the development of networks. in 2016 the aspects of enel’s strategy which were most
commonly analyzed and appreciated were: the digitalization of assets, people and customers as enabling factors in the move
towards a low carbon economy, the increased level of communication and involvement on risks and opportunities linked to the
actions included in the plan, as well as the conservative approach in assumptions about the macroeconomic scenario.


in the last year enel further reinforced its commitment to promote sustainable growth, also by setting up inside investor re-
lations a specific area dedicated to relations with the financial market on esg issues. the sustainability and investor relations
units periodically organize specific activities and meetings to monitor the information needs and non-financial requests of the in-
stitutional funds. in particular, in june 2016 the first road show was held dedicated to esg issues in london, paris and frankfurt.


in 2016, 68% of institutional investors had a long-term investment style, confirming enel’s commitment to a business model
which is sustainable over time. in particular enel’s share capital included 150 socially responsible investors (132 in 2015) hold-
ing around 8% of total enel shares in circulation (7.7% in 2015). the increase is clearer if account is taken of the greater number
of shares making up enel’s share capital (following the integration of enel green power) compared to 2015. in absolute terms
the shares held by sri funds rose by 13%.

after being appointed by the ordinary shareholders’ meeting of may 22, 2014, at december 31, 2016 the board consisted of
nine members. during 2016 the board met 13 times, dealing at 12 meetings with issues linked to governance, sustainability,
the code of ethics and the 231 compliance program. the board has set up the following four committees internally:


>> nomination and compensation committee: supports, through proper enquiry, the assessments and decisions of
     the board of directors relating to the size and composition of the board itself, as well as to the compensation of
     executive directors and key executives;
>> control and risks committee: supports, through an adequate review process, the assessments and decisions of
     the board of directors relating to the internal control and risk management system as well as those relating to the
     approval of the periodic financial reports;
>> corporate governance and sustainability committee: assists with preliminary functions, also by providing advice
     and proposals, the board of directors in its assessments and decisions relating to the corporate governance of
     the company and of the group, and oversees sustainability issues connected to the company’s business and to
     the trends in the company’s interaction with all the stakeholders;
>> related parties committee: it provides reasoned opinions on enel’s interest – as well of companies that are
     directly and/or indirectly controlled as necessary – in undertaking transactions with related parties, expressing
     a judgment on the substantial expediency and correctness of the related conditions, after receiving timely and
     adequate information flows.

during 2016 the board of directors completed its assessment regarding the succession plans for executive directors,
following the hopes expressed on the outcome of the board review in 2014. in particular, in september 2016 the board of
directors, at the proposal of the nomination and compensation committee formulated together with the corporate govern-
ance and sustainability committee, shared the contents of a specific contingency plan aimed at regulating the actions to be
taken to ensure the company’s regular management should the chief executive officer leave the position early compared
to the ordinary deadline for their mandate (a crisis management situation).

remuneration policy                                                                                          g4-44 g4-51 g4-52




enel’s remuneration policy is consistent with the recommendations of the corporate governance code and aims to (i) at-
tract, motivate and keep those persons that have the skills to manage the company successfully, (ii) incentivize the achieve-
ment of the strategic objectives and the sustainable growth of the company, (iii) align the interests of management to the
primary objective of creating sustainable value for shareholders in the long term and (iv) promote the corporate mission and
values. in defining the policy adopted by enel spa on remuneration for the members of the board of directors, the chief
executive officer/general manager and executives with strategic responsibilities in reference to 2017, the nomination and
compensation committee took account of the recommendations contained in the corporate governance code, best nation-
al and international practice and the indications that emerged from the approval by the shareholders’ meeting in 2016 of the
remuneration report.


in particular, the variable remuneration for the chief executive officer/general manager is made up of:


>> a short-term variable component (mbo) which considers both internal financial indicators (such as consolidated
   net income from continuing operations, the ratio between operating cash flows (ffo – funds from operations)
   and net financial debt, and value of consolidated cash cost), and non-financial indicators (such as occupational
   health and safety);
>> a long-term variable component (lti) which considers both enel’s average tsr (total shareholder return) com-
   pared to the average tsr of the euro stoxx utilities emu index over a 3-year period, and the group’s accumu-
   lated roace (return on average capital employed) for the same 3-year period.


in addition, the bonus plan envisages the deferment of the payment of long-term variable remuneration. specifically, 30% of
the total is paid during the year subsequent to the 3-year performance period, the so-called control year, while the payment
of the remaining part, 70% of the total, is deferred by two years compared to the 3-year period, thus making de facto com-
pletion of the plan last over a 5-year time horizon.

in regard to financial risks, such as market risk (including the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commod-
ity prices), credit risk and liquidity risk, the governance adopted by the group envisages:


>> the presence of specific internal committees, consisting of the group’s top management and chaired by the enel
   chief executive officer, responsible for policy setting and supervision of risk management;
>> the issue of specific policies and procedures, at the group and individual division/country/business line levels,
   which establish the roles and responsibilities for risk management, monitoring and control processes, ensuring
   compliance with the principle of organizational separation of units responsible for operations and those in charge
   of managing risk;
>> the definition of a system of operating limits at the group and individual division/country/business line levels for
   the various types of risk, which are monitored periodically by risk management units.


detailed information is available in the group annual report 2016 available on the company’s website (www.enel.com).




          analysis of counterparties
the ability to adequately assess counterparties and to promptly intercept any threats and risk elements is increasingly an
essential requirement not only to protect organizations’ reputation but also for their very survival.
the analysis of the counterparties is requested by the business lines, departments and services, the request is facilitated
and supported by an instrument and by a methodology provided by the security unit which at the same time is responsible
for formally verifying and optimizing the operations requested.
even if the analysis may also be assigned to third parties, the process and the methodology must guarantee the application
of a criterion for standard assessment, monitoring and reporting.


the analysts are required to collect all the relevant information regarding the reputation of the subjects involved within
the defined scope. this work is carried out by making searches from all sources which are open, private, and available,
including at least: internet – social networks; public administration – chamber of commerce; public database of the judicial
system; corporate database, paying attention not to violate the company’s policies/procedures or the laws of the country (for
example protection of personal data, anti-trust laws, etc.); international databases (for example world check).

enel’s commitment on human rights
enel is aware of the fact that a company is responsible for the respect of human rights not only in the actions which involve
it directly, but, more generally, also indirectly in the context in which it operates. as required by the guidelines and on the
basis of policy principles, the human rights compliance assessment (hrca) project is continuing in the various countries,
through the establishment of multi-function and multi-country work groups which enable the definition of global policies and
their exposition while taking into account local situations. as part of the work to define the group’s priorities (see “analysis of
priorities”) various stakeholders are asked their opinion on human rights in various aspects. in general, enel’s policy focuses
on two fundamental areas: labor practices and relations with communities.




the new due diligence process

during 2016 enel redesigned its due diligence process in order to align it to international best practice, focusing the analysis
at first on the perceived risk assessment for human rights in the various areas where the group operates.
in particular the process envisages 5 stages:


1. assessment of the country risk on labor rights;
2. assessment of the country risk on rights of the community and the environment;
3. impact assessment;
4. development of an action plan;
5. monitoring of the plan and remedies.


during 2016, enel designed the aforementioned process through the involvement of representatives of the various countries
where the group operates, after defining the country risk assessment questionnaire and launching two parallel projects in latin
america to verify its operation.

the country risk assessment on labor rights

on the basis of the statement by the international labor organization (ilo) on labor principles and fundamental rights, and,
in line with the indications of unicef and the recent regulatory proposals (such as for example the modern slavery act of
2015), a country risk assessment questionnaire has been prepared connected to labor rights and in particular: freedom of as-
sociation, child labor, forced labor, diversity and inclusion. the questionnaire was administered, both through local interviews
and with an online survey, to various stakeholder categories (communities, institutions, customers, etc.), defined in line with
the provisions of the priority analysis, and concerned 5 countries: argentina, brazil, chile, colombia and peru. the assessment
of perceived risk is based on both the severity of the issue and on the likelihood of an actual violation. the combination of its
components enables identification of the risk prioritization number - rpn, in accordance with the following matrix.

from the analysis of the results it emerged that the perception of the risks linked to labor rights in latin america, albeit taking
into consideration the due local differences, tends to be medium to low.
for each issue and for each country the areas to be monitored have been identified to guarantee their constant control

to provide an integrated report on performance.




during 2016, enel further enhanced the materiality analysis, launching in the main countries where it is present a pilot pro-
ject to monitor stakeholders’ level of satisfaction with the company’s means of controlling the various issues. the results
obtained, which are compared with the stakeholders’ priority analysis, allow an overall vision to be obtained of stakeholders’
expectations and help identify the issues that the company must focus on.


the supporting it tool has been further enhanced in order to guarantee greater traceability and sharing of best practices to
involve and monitor stakeholders and to enable a level of cover which is aligned to the company organizational model. it is
thus possible to identify priorities not only at group and individual company level, but also by business line/company func-
tion, by individual project which is to be developed or is ongoing and also by the various stakeholder categories.

technologies, in the sense of optimizing the energy mix and reconverting traditional plants, as well as to management, devel-

economic and financial value creation, occupational health and safety, sound governance, responsible use of water re-
sources, fair corporate conduct, mitigation of environmental impacts, sustainability in the supply chain, biodiversity and
protection of natural capital are also key elements of enel’s sustainable business model (the so-called backbone issues) and
are, like the pillars, evaluated by the stakeholders.

        the b corp community (bcorporation.net) is a global movement of companies which “uses business as a positive force” and
        which satisfies the highest standards of responsibility and transparency to address and resolve environmental and social
        problems. worldwide there are over 2 thousand certified b corp members and over 50 thousand companies use the b im-
        pact assessment as an instrument for measurement and continuous improvement.
        with the new mission defined in the “open power” context, enel is engaged in resolving some of the greatest challenges
        of our world, in line with the principles of the change promoted by the b corp.
        during 2016, in order to measure itself against the most innovative experiences, enel decided to undertake the b impact
        assessment in order to integrate its own analysis and evaluation models and to have a complete vision of the impact caused
        by the organization and by the initiatives launched. the work is undertaken in collaboration with nativa (the first b corp in
        europe and country partner of b lab, nativalab.com).
        the b impact assessment, which was developed by the non-profit body b lab, was created from the integration of global
        and independent measurement standards for the evaluation of social and environmental performance. it allows a company
        to measure its absolute impact and to compare it with the reference benchmark.


        the impact evaluation is carried out on 4 analytical areas:

        the comparison of enel’s performance with the reference benchmark has already enabled the identification of some areas
        for improvement which have been included in the sustainability report 2016 or which will be included in future processes
        for defining the sustainability plan.

results in 2016 and progress
on the sustainability plan 2016-2020
in 2016 significant progress was made in realizing the strategy, in both industrial terms and in esg (environmental, social and
governance) performance, and in particular compared to the commitments entered into as part of the sustainable develop-
ment goals defined by the united nations at the end of 2015. these concrete facts and data reflect enel’s daily commitment
to protecting the environment, relationships with local communities, the motivation of people, and customer relations.

the economic-financial results show ebitda from ordinary operations for 2016 of 15.2 billion euro, up for the first time since
2013. the net profit from ordinary operations, on which the dividend is calculated, rose by 12%, reaching 3.2 billion euro
compared to 2.9 billion euro in the previous year. the ratio of ffo to net debt, which indicates the level of financial solidity,
reached 26%, surpassing the objective which the group had set and up compared to 25% in the previous year. net debt re-
mained largely stable at 37.6 billion euro, despite the significant increase in investments for growth, which rose by 1.5 billion
euro compared to the previous year.


2016 recorded significant progress compared to the commitments entered into as part of the united nations sustainable
development goals (sdgs), which are an integral part of the strategic plan:


>> sdg 4 (quality of education): 300 thousand beneficiaries, compared to the target for 2020 of 400 thousand beneficiaries;
>> sdg 7 (clean and affordable energy): 1.2 million beneficiaries, compared to the target for 2020 of 3 million bene-
         ficiaries mainly in africa, asia and latin america;
>> sdg 8 (dignity of labor and economic growth): 1.1 million beneficiaries, compared to the new target for 2020 of
         1.5 million beneficiaries (initial goal of 500 thousand beneficiaries);
>> sdg 13 (combating climate change): ~395 gco2/kwheq compared to the target for 2020 of <350 gco2/kwheq and
         being carbon free in 2050.

            enel launches its first green bond 				
            on the european market
on january 9, 2017 enel finance international successfully placed its first green bond for institutional investors on the eu-
ropean market backed by a guarantee issued by enel spa. the issue totaled 1,250 million euro and envisages repayment
in a single payment falling due on september 16, 2024 and the payment of a fixed-rate coupon of 1%, payable each year in
arrears in september, starting from september 2017. the issue price was set at 99.001% and the effective yield on expiry is
1.137%. the green bond has been listed on the market regulated by the irish stock exchange and on the regulated market
of the stock exchange of luxembourg, and, subsequent to the issue, also on the unregulated market of the italian stock
exchange.


the operation saw take-up for around 3 billion euro, with significant participation by socially responsible investors
(“sris”) which enabled the enel group to further diversify its investor base. the net income from the issue – which was
undertaken as part of enel and enel finance international’s euro medium term notes program (emtn) – will be used to
finance the enel group’s eligible green projects which have been identified and/or are to be identified in conformity with the
“green bond principles 2016” published by the international capital market association (icma).


in particular, by way of example, eligible green projects include:


>> development, construction and repowering of power generation plants using renewable sources;
>> development of transmission and distribution networks, as well as the activation of smart grids and smart meters
    in the geographical areas where enel operates.


the operation is in line with the financial strategy of the enel group set out in the strategic plan 2017-2019, which envisages
refinancing of 12.4 billion euro also through the issue of green bonds as instruments dedicated to the financing of projects
that can help achieve the decarbonization of the production mix.


in this regard, the enel group prepared and published a “green bond framework” in order to assist the transparency and
quality of the green bonds issued. an external advisor, vigeo eiris, issued the “second party opinion” which confirmed
the adherence of the enel green bonds to the key principles and evaluated as “reasonable”3 the level of assurance on sus-
tainability. in particular enel’s esg (environmental, social and governance) performance was considered “advanced”4, the
framework used for the issue of the green bonds as “robust” and the related means of reporting the commitments defined
in the framework as “robust”.


the key documents are available on the enel website (https://www.enel.com/en/investors/main-programs/green-bond.html).


the operation was led by a group of banks, involving banca imi, bofa merrill lynch, crédit agricole cib, citi, deutsche bank,
hsbc, j.p. morgan, mizuho securities, natixis, smbc nikko, and unicredit bank.


in addition, enel is among the first companies in the world which committed to setting up a “green bond committee” with
the aim of selecting projects that can be financed with the funds collected through the issue of bonds and monitoring the
progress of the projects themselves.

sustainability plan 2017-2019
we are seeing major transformations in our reference framework, which are taking place ever more quickly and offer the
energy sector new challenges and opportunities. they are interconnected changes which are reflected in a new global sce-
nario characterized by a technological and digital revolution, by growth in the population and its expectations, in a context of
climate change and pressure on the use of natural resources.
in a world which is growing in terms of its energy needs, there is ever greater penetration of electric vehicles. energy con-
sumption is increasing but with still more than 1 billion people who do not have access to energy or have limited access.
renewables are the energy source which is growing most strongly, while the others are stable or falling slightly. distributed
generation plays an increasingly important role and in this context electricity networks, both for transmission and distribu-
tion, are ever more important and various industrial sectors are converging on them, thus de facto changing the competitive
context.
so it is increasingly important not only to be aware of and anticipate technological developments, but also what society
around us wants, thus ensuring that communities understand and share the strategy and investments which a large group
such as enel can provide.


in relation to this context, enel has identified some key emerging risks:


>> cyber security, which represents an essential element in the digital transformation plan. enel has developed a
     strategy aimed at protecting information, assets and emerging technologies (for example iot). in this context a
     dedicated unit has been created and a new operating framework has been defined in order to unify management
     of the issue with a risk based strategy and to disseminate security by design practices, launching training and
     awareness-raising projects;
>> the paradigmatic change in the world of energy and the transformation in utilities’ business model. new macro-
     economic and energy trends, technologies and key players can potentially support and disintermediate the tradi-
     tional business model of utilities, in particular the combination of factors linked to digitalization and decentraliza-
     tion and changes in customer needs. enel’s strategy and the “open power” vision are the reference framework to
     respond to the challenge of the transition towards becoming the utility of the future.


the main trends, the emerging risks, the stakeholder engagement, and enel’s strategy all enable the preparation of enel’s
priority matrix (the so-called materiality analysis). the matrix, which has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of
the most common international standards, such as the global reporting initiative (gri), represents the priorities among the
issues of interest to stakeholders, cross-checking them with the industrial strategy and with the group’s priority actions (see
the chapter “defining priorities”).


in order to respond in a sustainable and flexible way to this context, enel’s business model is based on a strategic plan bro-
ken down into four main pillars from the industrial and the environmental, social and governance (esg) viewpoints. these
pillars are flanked by digitalization and customer focus as levers to promote further growth and efficiency.

in 2015 enel adopted a creating shared value (csv) model which integrates social and environmental factors into business
processes and throughout the value chain. the dissemination of this model required a process of definition and consolidation
within the company at both cultural and operational level. in 2016 policy no. 211 “csv process definition and management”
was published, which defines how sustainability must cut across company processes and be a shared responsibility.

through specific context analysis tools, the mapping of stakeholders and the definition of materiality matrices and action
plans, the development of a business project is accompanied from the initial exploratory approaches to its final definition.
these analyses, and in particular the materiality matrix of the site, enable the identification of short-, medium- and long-term
actions which combine the corporate perspective with the needs of the local communities through concrete and acknowl-
edged initiatives. this is all done while guaranteeing particular attention to identifying and protecting ancestral communities
which are affected by projects, in compliance not only with convention 169 of the international labor organization and local
laws, but above all the respective traditions and cultures.


in 2016, 320 applications5 of the csv (creating shared value) model were used in the various stages of the value chain:
business development – bd, engineering & construction – e&c, operation & maintenance – o&m.

5   csv applications means the use of csv tools on an asset, at any stage of the value chain and for any business line. the total number of assets refers to the
    operating scope set out in the sustainability report 2015 integrated with projects at the bd stage. in particular: bd includes business development projects,
    both those which are ongoing and those which left the pipeline in 2016. the total number includes projects for new assets (m&a, greenfield) and current
    assets for which refurbishment is being studied.
    e&c includes both greenfield and brownfield sites relating to power plants which are being refurbished.
    o&m includes all current power generation plants less those which are at the refurbishment stage. for the network, it is calculcated as the number of con-
    cessions by country; the number of csv applications may be higher should the analyses refer to different areas of the same concession. the total number
    includes 9 assets/projects in new countries for thermal generation (south africa, indonesia, mexico, with one csv application per country).

rethinking the relationship with communities in the canaries, in puerto del rosario


the thermoelectric plant of las salinas is a diesel powered generation plant consisting of 12 units, with net installed capacity of 160
mw, which is currently being modernized. it is in the municipality of puerto del rosario, the capital of the island of fuerteventura
in the canary isles (spain) and has been in operation since 1992, when the first production unit was connected to the network.
the presence of urban centers near the las salinas facility has required particular handling of the relationship with the
community. the plant’s operation has in fact in the past triggered complaints from citizens about the noise levels and the
emissions caused by the generators, despite many of the local homes having been built subsequent to the start-up of the
plant and the plant’s emission levels conforming to spanish environmental laws.
with the aim of improving the relationship with the local community in a spirit of transparency and development of the local
area, a short- and medium-term csv plan was drawn up. through meetings with the main stakeholders and with the city
and district associations, as well as thanks to analyses of the socio-economic and political context, the main issues were
recorded for the local area on the basis of which the csv plan was drafted.


for 2016, as the first year, three areas for action were identified:


>> 1. open plants. actions aimed at opening up the plant to the local context with measures aimed at disseminating
   knowledge of the world of energy and of the company; at facilitating dialogue with citizens; and at promoting
   visits to the plant and educational programs in schools.
>> 2. access to energy for people living in poverty. programs were developed for “energy volunteering”, involving
   25 families through 20 volunteers and training programs for social services in order to optimize invoicing and
   energy efficiency. in agreement with the local institutions, other initiatives are also being drawn up to protect the
   most vulnerable categories.
>> 3. socio-economic development. two initiatives have been drawn up: “actívate y empléate” and “art energy”.the
   first is aimed at young people at risk of social exclusion and offers employment opportunities, while the second
   is an urban art competition realized in collaboration with the municipality: eight endesa transformer stations have
   been made available as well as the wall of the plant to be decorated with murals painted by local artists and schools.




thermal generation – peru – e&c stage
promoting local development in the area of malacas


the gas powered plant in malacas has installed capacity of 286 mw and is located in the province of talara in the north of
peru. in order to increase its efficiency, it was decided to build a new 51 mw tg6 unit, which will take the place of other
more obsolete units which are currently in operation. malacas is the first plant on which the creating shared value (csv)
model has been applied to move from the business development stage of the new unit to the current e&c stage: the results
of the analyses, as well as the csv plan with the related capex and opex of the various projects identified, were an integral
part of the assessment of the business project approved by the investment committee.
from the analysis of the socio-economic and environmental context launched in the design stage and from the profound
knowledge of the stakeholders which has consolidated over the years of operation of the plant, the following priority issues
emerged: protecting the environment which is seriously impacted by waste, the promotion of local entrepreneurship, also
in response to the high unemployment rate, and women’s empowerment. the csv plan drawn up to address these shared
priorities includes various initiatives aimed at improving the quality of life in the long term. among the early results record-

ed, the technical apprenticeship program, which involved governmental institutions and entrepreneurs of the punta sal and
máncora beach hotels, trained 30 students in 2016, 12 of whom found employment. the “olitas verdes” program, which
seeks to promote tourism in the area and is aimed at young people, held educational workshops on the reuse and recycling
of waste and on plans to collect and sell waste from beaches and from areas around the plant. in addition, in agreement with
the municipalities, a plan was drawn up to transform the pallets used on site into beach infrastructures, thus increasing the
safety of the shoreline and providing more structures for water sports.
in addition, in order to guarantee the utmost transparency towards stakeholders, during the construction works an informa-
tion panel was installed about the realization of the new tg6 unit, at the same time summarizing the various ongoing social
and environmental projects.
since the malacas plant has been in operation for a number of years, the surrounding area is also involved in other projects which
promote better quality of life. together with the ministry of health, in 2016 three disease prevention and dietary education cam-
paigns were promoted, with the carrying out of medical checks and providing assistance to over 760 people. in addition, for the
scuola santa elena di piedritas, which enel helped to build and electrify, the creation of a sports centre and an it lab are underway.

rethinking the relationship with communities at torrevaldaliga nord


enel has a very important role for the local communities present in the area around the torrevaldaliga nord plant in civitavec-
chia, and for many years has supported initiatives to protect the environment, the health and local development. the innova-
tive csv approach adopted by enel aims at a business model which recognizes the strategic value of the interdependence
between the company and the social, environmental and economic context in which it operates, and has strengthened in
the company the belief that its role must thus take the form of a contribution to the development of the local communities
also from the business viewpoint, with a view to creating shared value.
in 2016 this belief took the form of the search for sustainable initiatives which can generate lasting benefits over time for
the communities. the first step was an accurate and detailed analysis of the context (single event effect criticality analysis -
seeca), followed by intensive work to consult all stakeholders, in order to identify the intervention areas which are perceived
as priorities by the local communities and which offer potential development opportunities for all the local area.
then at the end of 2016 innovative agreements were signed with each of the four municipalities involved (allumiere, santa
marinella, tarquinia, tolfa) which define collaboration aimed at a process of inclusive and sustainable growth in the local area. in
addition, the agreements set out the shared value initiatives which enel intends to develop together with the local administra-
tions, also through forms of partnership with businesses and/or non-profit associations which are active locally.


in particular, great attention was paid to the issue of resilience with training programs and initiatives aimed at the adoption by
the local administrations of a development plan for the town compatible with the environment, to be safeguarded and protected.
again with a view to creating shared value, actions are envisaged to increase the efficiency of public lighting and to pro-
mote sustainable transport through the realization of a public cycle path for electric bikes, with networks of recharging
points, smart hubs and video surveillance.
in addition, educational films are envisaged aimed at creating new technical and business skills, initiatives in favor of
the disabled, and the recovery of sporting structures.
this model marks an important turning-point in the means of managing relations with local administrations in the territories
where enel is present with power plants, and is ready to be adopted also in other areas, starting from the federico ii plant
in brindisi, where the process, which was started at the end of 2016, will be developed during 2017.

infrastructure and networks – brazil – bd stage
the acquisition of the celg network in the state of goiás


in operation since 1956, celg is the network of over 200 thousand km in length which links 237 municipalities in the state
of goiás, where there is also the capital brasília, with around 2.9 million customers served covering residential, industrial,
rural, and commercial users and local administrations in a relatively prosperous area of the country.
enel acquired the celg network in a competitive process and has planned investments aimed at modernizing and expanding
the distribution system to introduce the most advanced automation techniques, integrating the concept of smart networks
to improve the quality of services. this project is based on the sustainability of the business and customer satisfaction.
in this light, the operation was accompanied by application of a csv plan which, through quali-quantitative analyses of the
socio-economic and geographical situation, enabled the identification of three main areas for intervention in the local area:


>> 1. intelligent energy consumption: the growth of the population generated by migration, in particular in the city
   of brasília, has triggered an increase in the propensity to steal energy in a context of widespread violence. in this
   sense, the following were launched
         a. actions aimed at the population for safe use of energy;
         b. the creation of a leadership network to promote and share values;
         c. a training program on the maintenance of solar panels.
>> 2. support activities for young people: projects in collaboration with schools, to offer the possibility to students of
   taking part in cultural and sporting activities by improving leisure facilities and digital inclusion activities.
>> 3. boost to rural business: most of the rural producers in goiás are organized in cooperatives and have problems
   marketing their production and managing their business. in this light the following were planned:
         a. the construction of a communication platform and internet access, in order to include small rural producers in the
         large scale market and to promote business skills;
         b. the installation of batteries to stabilize energy consumption and to facilitate production processes.




infrastructure and networks – argentina – e&c stage
energy efficiency improves life in the district of los piletones


in buenos aires, in the district of los piletones, the electrification project was started with the installation of smart meters
which enable more efficient use of the network and customers in a poor, highly unstable area. the district is characterized
by a high percentage of foreign communities (over 60%), by a very high rate of occasional employment equal to 75% and
by residents 63% of whom receive state subsidies, where 50% of homes do not have hot water. in such a difficult context,
the socio-environmental analysis undertaken during the planning of the installation of the meters recorded as priority, urgent
issues: access to energy, protecting the health and safety of the communities, mitigation of the environmental impact and
local economic development.


in order to address these needs, while generating at the same time stable conditions for the network, the following initia-
tives were identified:


>> meetings and workshops with the communities involved to explain the innovations from the new smart meters
   which can provide information on consumption and allow a choice to be made of the tariffs which are best suited
   to particular needs, facilitating responsible and optimal use of energy and lower emissions and costs, thus im-
   proving the energy efficiency profile;

>> educational programs for pre-school and primary school children who are given a teaching kit with material on
     the history of electricity and on sustainable development with curious facts, games, experiments to do at home
     and quizzes on energy security, with tips on how to avoid domestic accidents linked to electricity;
>> illumina: a plan aimed at the promotion of social entrepreneurship with a business incubator, professional train-
     ing plans and measures for efficient energy use in order to develop the business from the bottom up. in the con-
     text of this initiative, activities were planned to install and maintain the district’s public lighting;
>> vivienda sustentable: information-sharing plan aimed at customers with suggestions for efficient energy use in
     homes, to optimize natural lighting, turn off lights in empty rooms, paint walls and ceilings with light colors, and
     replace traditional light bulbs with more efficient led lighting.




renewables – mexico – bd stage
the mexican way to cooperation between industry and agriculture


in mexico enel green power signed a collaboration project with the autonomous university of chapingo, with the aim of
strengthening productive skills (in particular in the agricultural and forestry sector and in research into sustainable irrigation
systems) in the chinampas, majoma and primero de mayo communities located near various wind farms which are at the
business development stage such as villanueva, or at the construction stage such as palo alto with 129 mw and vientos del
altiplano with 100 mw.
for years now the company has been working to identify and finalize solutions aimed at applying a positive sum model for
both the renewable industry and for local farmers. starting from the experience in oaxaca, where wind farms coincide with
farming areas, the collaboration with the autonomous university of chapingo is a step forward in making the agricultural
areas of the rural communities around our plants more productive and sustainable from the environmental viewpoint.
thanks to the analyses of the socio-environmental context undertaken during the planning stage of the plant of vientos del
altiplano, in the area affected by the plant a project has been established which envisages a plan to recover and identify new
areas to be used for agriculture and includes the study of a system to collect rainwater. in addition, it is planned to create
together with the community six school allotments for the cultivation of medicinal plants, vegetables and high value agricul-
tural produce, in order to seek new market opportunities.
in addition, since the availability of water is a critical factor for the development of agriculture in the region, mainly due to the
high salinity levels, a possible treatment is being studied to replace “rainwater” agriculture with irrigation based agriculture,
thus enabling up to three annual crop cycles.
in the area of palo alto, the project aims to increase the population’s access to agricultural techniques and knowhow. thanks
to the involvement of women, young people and children, who will receive theoretical and practical training, five test envi-
ronments have been identified as well as five school allotments. evaluations will be made of the crops, the sowing density,
seeds, and organic and traditional management, thus arousing the interest of young people in taking up agricultural work
again, using new technologies and production techniques.

hydroelectric plants of the alto bío bío (ralco, pangue y palmucho)


endesa chile (now enel generación chile) manages 3 hydroelectric power plants in the area of the alto bío bío, an area
which is characterized by the historic presence of the indigenous pehuenche populations. the pehuenche population in the
area affected by the plants, with 12 communities, consisting of over 1,500 families, numbers around 7 thousand people.
during 2016 the relationship with these communities was mainly focused on two negotiating groups with representatives of
the families who have complained about the impact of “sitio 53” and other working groups dedicated to the planning of ini-
tiatives for local development. the communities involved in these activities were pitril, callaqui, el avellano, aukiñ wallmapu,
quepuca ralco, ralco lepoy, el barco, and ayin mapu. the negotiations were conducted in accordance with the principles of
transparency and access to information. at the end of december 2016, the negotiations were still ongoing, with the parties
showing themselves willing to find a solution. these opportunities for dialogue saw the active involvement of executives
nominated by the communities and of the enel generación chile group which operates in the local area and which includes
people from the sustainability and operations areas.
among the development programs which emerged from the dialogue with these communities, we may highlight the launch
of new business initiatives. in particular the production, transformation and sale of local produce such as cherries, jams,
hazelnuts and their derivatives. the activity, which was based on the transfer of analytical and technological tools, involved
27 people in its first test stage. the project was conducted in collaboration with the center for agro-industrial technological
development of the university of concepción.



our commitment                                                                                                              73

as well as with the indigenous communities, the company maintains constant contact also with the municipality of the alto
bío bío. one of the main results achieved in 2016 was the signing of the long-term agreement with the municipality of the
alto bío bío with the aim of promoting the educational, cultural, social and economic development of the area. the agree-
ment will be in force until 2022 and will benefit all the families in the area, including the 4 communities in the area of the
queco which are not part of the reference scope. under this agreement, enel generación chile financed the construction of
the apr ralco pipeline in order to guarantee the continuous supply of water for the community of callaqui bajo and contrib-
uted funds for the realization of the drinking water project, which 116 families will benefit from directly.


other projects concerned:


>> the regularization of the drinking water system and of the sewer system for the children’s garden in chenqueco,
     which benefitted 10 children from the ralco lepoy community with an investment of 25 million chilean pesos
     (around 35 thousand euro);
>> the maintenance of the photovoltaic panels which supply energy to the homes of the alto bío bío, with an invest-
     ment of 15 million chilean pesos (around 21 thousand euro);
>> support for the municipal emergency plan of the alto bío bío, including the purchase of raw materials and train-
     ing with an investment of around 15 million chilean pesos (around 21 thousand euro);
>> the purchase of agricultural machinery for the communities of ayin mapu and aukiñ wallmapu, with an invest-
     ment of 15 million chilean pesos (around 21 thousand euro).


design of the future homes of the community of ayin mapu
in 2016 enel generación chile established a program to improve the homes of families from the ayin mapu community in
santa bárbara. these families were relocated in 2000 following the construction of the ralco plant. this program is run under
the environmental license (resolución de calificación ambiental – rca) of the plant and is based on the principle of co-cre-
ation. the families which will benefit from the program are taking part in the design of the new homes so that they have
available space which respects their lifestyle and their traditions. proposals have been prepared which will be presented to
the community to include the latest recommendations and start the requests to obtain the related permits.


drinking water for the ayin mapu and el barco communities
16 years ago enel generación chile relocated the families of the pehuenche ayin mapu community, in the municipality of
santa bárbara, and of the el barco community in the municipality of the alto bío bío, under the agreements for the construc-
tion of the ralco hydroelectric power plant. the passage of time and the significant increase in the population have made it
necessary to enhance the drinking water system to ensure its supply to families.
in 2016 following intensive work with communities, the projects were presented to the authority (seremi de salud) of the
bío bío for the related assessment. during the proceedings the communities directly received all the information regarding
the revision of the solutions, the scope of the works, the timeframes and the various steps to be taken.


finally, through the energía para educación project, enel generación supports the training of students in the municipalities
of santa bárbara and alto bío bío, where the power plants of ralco and pangue operate, in order to facilitate the sustainable
development of the communities. these are students of the ayin mapu, callaqui, pitril, el avellano, quepuca ralco, aukiñ
wallmapu, ralco lepoy and el barco communities who cannot access the educational system due to economic reasons and
owing to the distance from the urban centers.
in 2016 they were provided with school kits with everything necessary for each educational level. over 400 young people
received teaching at middle school, technical and professional school level, receiving grants, clothing and trips provided by
enel generación. in addition, support was envisaged for the educational centers through training for teachers on renewable
energy, development of the cinema at school program, and the supply of books for the library.

el quimbo


el quimbo is the most important engineering project undertaken by the enel group in recent years and one of the biggest
hydroelectric investments realized in south america. with installed power of 400 mw the plant is located in the region of
huila, around 350 km south-west of bogotá. the plant, which is fed by the río magdalena, the country’s biggest river, cross-
es 6 towns (gigante, garzón, altamira, el agrado, paicol and tesalia). it represents an overall investment of around 1.2 billion
us dollars, which was accompanied by a major action plan in favor of the local populations, including the construction of new
homes, the building of new bridges, including the largest viaduct in the country, as well as initiatives to protect biodiversity
in the area, such as the restoration of over 11 thousand hectares of tropical vegetation on the left bank of the basin and the
realization of veterinary help centers. right from the start of the project, emgesa, the group’s power generation company
in colombia, has shown its openness to dialogue with the regional and national stakeholders and has developed a social
and environmental management plan. on an agreed and participatory basis, specific initiatives have been established for
resident or landowning families in the area affected by the project, as well as those who work or have commercial activities
or services in the area. the program is also targeted at people who undertook informal business locally. the families, which
have been surveyed and have the envisaged prerequisites, can decide between (collective/individual) relocation or sale of
their land.


social and cultural management
152 families have opted for relocation: 112 of these have chosen 4 collective facilities, with new 100 m2 homes equipped with
essential services and set in an urban context with 3 schools, 3 churches, multifunctional sports centers, 1 football pitch, 4 parks,
4 waste recycling collection centers and 5 waste water treatment plants. 40 families have chosen individual relocation, either
receiving five hectares of land to undertake a business project together with a related technical plan or a 180 m2 home. in addi-
tion, since the start of construction 244 cases of compensation have been completed for families who did not opt for relocation.
in 2016, 594 requests were presented for the survey, of which 549 have been analyzed also through interviews and 45 will be
handled during 2017. during the year 34 plans were launched for agricultural/livestock production which involved the families
resident in the municipalities of santiago palacio, montea and llano de la virgen, after checking the conditions of the land and
the availability of water. in 2016 various initiatives were organized aimed at promoting the social development of the local area.

as part of the “project to repay the commitment”, a specific strategy was defined, empreendedores con energía, which
involves providing initial capital and training courses to people who carried out their business in the area affected by the
project (non-residents or residents who do not have property). training courses were provided by sena (servicio nacional de
aprendizaje), which, since the start of the project, over 2 thousand people have benefitted from and around 21 million euro
have been destined for development of the province.

environmental management
during 2016 specific environmental programs continued in order to prevent, manage and monitor environmental impacts
connected to the project. in conformity with the provisions in the environmental license, in particular the following were
established: 1. management plan for wildlife, which enabled the assistance and saving of 30,635 animals; 2. management
program for fish and fishing; 3. program to save fish; 4. ecological restructuring plan; 5. management plan to cover the flora
and land habitats. besides the recovery of over 11 thousand hectares of tropical vegetation on the left bank of the basin and
the realization of veterinary support centers, 20 new species were identified and classified, where possible, in accordance
with the red list of the international union for the conservation of nature (iucn).


emgesa established specific communication channels to inform and respond to all the questions from the community re-
garding the project (dedicated webpage, twitter, official channel on youtube, a magazine). monthly meetings were held with
national and international groups, as well as periodic monitoring meetings with the government of huila, municipalities,
environmental authorities, control bodies and representatives of the company, and guided visits were organized to the pro-
ject. further information is available in the emgesa sustainability report 2016 and on the website dedicated to the project
(www.proyectoelquimboemgesa.com.co).


legal proceedings
despite this intensive relationship-building and involvement of the communities, there are also some legal proceedings (ac-
ciones de grupo and acciones populares – class action) launched by local inhabitants/fishermen. in particular, a first acción
de grupo, which is now at the preliminary investigation stage, was taken by around 1,140 residents of the municipality of
garzón who complained that the construction of the power plant would reduce revenue from their business by around 30%.
a second case was brought between august 2011 and december 2012 by inhabitants and companies/associations from
the five towns of huila for alleged damage in relation to the closure of a bridge (paso el colegio). in relation to the so-called
acciones populares, in 2008 some local inhabitants started proceedings to ask, among other things, for suspension of the
environmental license. a further acción popular was launched by some fishing companies in relation to the alleged impact of
the refilling of the el quimbo basin on fishing in the betania basin, downstream from el quimbo. in february 2015 the court
ordered the suspension of the refilling until some specific requirements were met.
the suspension was subsequently modified, thus allowing the filling of the basin, which started on june 30, 2015. however,
on july 17, 2015 emgesa received a notice modifying the precautionary measure to prohibit generation activities until anla
(the national environmental authority) certifies that the company has removed biomass and forest waste from the quimbo
reservoir basin.
pending the ruling, as an energy emergency had been declared, the ministry of energy issued a decree authorizing emgesa
to begin electricity generation. subsequently, on december 16, 2015 the constitutional court ruled that the presidential de-
cree was unconstitutional and as from that date emgesa suspended electricity generation.
on december 24, 2015, the ministerio de minas y energía and the aunap (agriculture and fishing authority) filed a joint
motion (acción de tutela) asking the criminal court to authorize generation as a precautionary measure. on january 8, 2016,
the court granted the precautionary measure requested by the ministry and the aunap, authorizing the temporary and im-
mediate production of energy at the el quimbo plant. the precautionary measure granted by the court would remain in force
until the huila court issued a ruling on the substance of the case, i.e. on the revocation or upholding of the precautionary
measure previously issued by the local administrative court. with a decision of february 22, 2016 the huila court issued a
ruling allowing generation to continue for six months. the court ordered emgesa to prepare a technical design that would
ensure compliance with the oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20,000,000,000 colombian pesos
(around 5.5 million euro). with the decision of the administrative court of huila of april 11, 2016 the temporary withdrawal
of the precautionary measure was once again confirmed for six months up to october 16, 2016, a deadline which was then
extended again for a further six months as from february 2017. in this time period, emgesa will have to show that the system
of oxygenation used allows attainment of the oxygen levels imposed.

bocamina plant


as from the construction of the second unit of the thermoelectric power plant of bocamina in 2008, in the area of the municipality
of coronel, agreements were signed with the local communities, to manage the processes to relocate the families, who lived in
the area of the plant (plan de relocalizaciones a familias vecinas al complejo térmico bocamina). at the end of 2016, out of a total
of 1,337 families, 946 had been relocated. the power plant started operating in 2012 and in august 2013, the sma (superintend-
encia del medio ambiente) informed endesa chile of the opening of sanction proceedings for alleged environmental infractions
in relation to the second unit of the thermoelectric power plant of bocamina (bocamina ii), in the municipality of coronel, which
ended in august 2014 with the imposition on the company of penalties for a total of around 7.6 million us dollars. endesa chile
(now enel generación chile) and the local fishermen appealed this decision. the tribunal ambiental of valdivia, with its decision
of march 27, 2015, rejected endesa chile’s appeal and also ordered the sma to increase the fine taking into consideration the fact
that endesa had committed the infraction intentionally. subsequently, the sma arranged to increase the amount of the fine by
500 unidad tributaria anual (uta). endesa chile appealed this decision to the environmental court and the appeal was partially
accepted. the sma appealed to the cassation court and that court confirmed the amount of the fine applied with its decision of
december 13, 2016. in regard to relationships with communities the main objective of enel generación chile is to guarantee the
progress and sustainability of the plan defined with the community of coronel, which stresses a long-term approach, as well as
promoting initiatives with the involvement of various social actors. during the last year enel worked together with the servicio
de vivienda y urbanización – serviu of the region of the bío bío and of the municipality of coronel, for the ongoing relocation
processes. the process follows a series of agreements signed between 2012 and 2014 and dialogue with the chilean government
to take part in the relocation plan for the families who used to live in the areas around the power plant, which were then declared
uninhabitable following a study by sernageomin – servicio nacional de geología y minería, following the earthquake in 2010. this
led to the signing of the agreement mentioned previously in 2012 and to the consequent establishment of a public/private work
group. during march, the families had the chance to receive housing subsidies and, in september, signed the purchase agreements
for their new homes. in particular programs were defined for environmental and social recovery, including the project relating
to the parque urbano coronel to create parks and sports areas around the plant. during 2016 the energía para tu emprendimiento
(energy for your entrepreneurship) program continued to promote a relationship based on the development of people and the crea-
tion of shared value, also thanks to the establishment of a fund to support entrepreneurship. this fund has allowed small business
owners to enhance their knowhow, to create relations with local industry and develop a network. the fund for 2016 of 300 million
chilean pesos (around 420 thousand euro) enabled the financing of 73 individual production projects which were able to count on
the support and consultancy of experts. six months after the investment, monitoring will be undertaken of each initiative in order to
understand the real impact on small business. another important initiative is the fondo de valor compartido (fund for the creation
of shared value) which, with an allocation of 180 million chilean pesos (around 250 thousand euro), aims to support projects for the
community over the whole useful life of the bocamina plant.
social and community responsibility
as part of the social plan for coronel, the 2016 version was held of the copa enel coronel, a sports competition for the
schools of coronel which is part of the energía para the educación (energy for education) program.
the dome of bocamina ii
in august 2016, enel generación started the construction of the first dome for the storage of coal in chile in the area north
of the second unit of the bocamina plant. this system covers 22,300 m2 of surface area, measures 51 meters in height and
has a capacity of 150 thousand tons. it enables improvement in the logistics for the handling of coal and guarantees for the
nearby communities compliance with environmental standards. the dome consists of a self-supporting metal structure,
which is light and adaptable to the type of land; characteristics which enable it to be built quickly and with low impact. the
same technological innovation will be applied in the storage area to the south of the plant. the activation of this project joins
other environmental improvements made by the company thanks to an investment of around 102 million us dollars, which
make the bocamina plant one of those which operate in accordance with the highest standards in this field, aligned to all the
rules and permissions required by the environmental authorities.

neltume (chile)
neltume is a project relating to a hydroelectric run-of-the river plant, with installed power of 490 mw, in the municipality of
panguipulli, in the region of los ríos. the environmental assessment process started in 2010 and is still ongoing. in 2006
endesa chile (now enel generación chile) started a consultation process with the indigenous communities in order to in-
corporate their requests into the development of the project. in particular, since 2007 there have been information offices in
the towns close to the project area and in 2011 some contact points were opened with the casas abiertas communities to
facilitate their participation. currently in neltume there is a company information office which handles relations with civil so-
ciety organizations and the local authorities to reach specific agreements. on april 29, 2013 the environmental assessment
service (sea) of the region of los ríos issued “resolución exenta n. 002” which envisages as part of the environmental
assessment of the project the realization of an indigenous consultation process, in accordance with the provisions of “convenio
oit n. 169”, with the communities, populations and groups in the area affected by the plant. the sea met each of the eight
communities identified to set out in detail the consultation process, inviting them to nominate their representatives.
in december 2015, after the conversations with the communities, the environmental impact assessment associated with
the project was withdrawn since the impact generated according to the design of the project was not sustainable.
in may 2016, endesa chile (now enel generación chile) communicated that it would start assessment of design alternatives,
which are currently underway. at the same time, enel generación chile is working to provide sustainability and self-sufficien-
cy to the local development initiatives undertaken in recent years. among these is the creation of the fiera lelilen lafken,
which is a space for the sale and promotion of various crafts products and mapuche food and drink built with the active
support of the beneficiaries themselves on the shores of lake neltume and visited by over 400 thousand tourists annually.
the beneficiaries of this project are around 50 wood and wool artisans. the organization and the management of this space
is collective and is delegated to an executive committee consisting of members of the community.


thermoelectric plant of porto tolle (italy)
in august 2011 the public prosecutor’s office of rovigo indicted some directors, former directors, executives, former ex-
ecutives and employees of enel and enel produzione for the crime of willful omission of measures to prevent disasters,
relating to alleged emissions from the porto tolle plant; subsequently, the public prosecutor added the alleged crime of willful
disaster. during 2012 the preliminary hearing judge of rovigo, following the requests from the public prosecutor’s office of
rovigo, ordered the indictment of all those under investigation for both crimes. after various levels of judgment, on january
18, 2017 the court of appeal of venice absolved all the accused on the grounds that there was no case to answer. for further
details see the enel annual report 2016 – potential assets and liabilities.


hidroaysén (chile)
hidroaysén is a partnership between endesa chile (now enel generación chile) and the chilean company colbún for the
development of a hydroelectric project with a capacity of 2,750 mw. in 2014 the chilean government withdrew the license
for the project after the protests of environmental groups. enel wishes to develop only projects that create shared value for
the company and for its stakeholders and therefore at the start of 2015 it stated that the project was not part of the portfolio
of projects at the development stage. currently negotiations are underway with the partner colbún to find the best possible
solution for the communities and the companies.


hydroelectric projects (chile and peru)
enel has decided to waive hydroelectric use rights for some projects in latin america following the analysis of their profita-
bility and their socio-economic impact. the projects are the following: puelo, futaleufú, bardón, chillán 1 and 2, and huechún
in chile (capital loss of 166 million euro) and curibamba and marañón in peru (capital loss of 30 million euro). the waiver is in
line with the strategy of the enel group which intends to develop only projects which are not only technically and econom-
ically feasible, but also shared with the local communities. the rights for water use, for which the waiver was expressed,
were returned to the states to be used for any other type of development project.

at december 31, 2016 the enel group had 62,080 employees, of whom 51% were in companies based in italy and 49%
abroad. the balance between the numbers at the start and end of the year shows a fall of around 5,800, due mainly to the
removal from the scope of slovenské elektrárne. new hires, totaling 3,360, occurred in italy for 34%, while the remaining
66% were spread across other countries. the percentage of women in the workforce remained stable compared to 2015.

the open power model: 		
strategy, values and behaviors
the “open power” model: vision, mission, values and behaviors was broken down during 2016 into various operational
aspects in order to increase the involvement and participation of the people who work in enel. this model is a reference point
for all the processes for managing and developing people.




     behaviors
     >> adopts and promotes safe conduct and acts proactively to improve the conditions of health, safety and wellbeing
     >> takes decisions in their daily work and accepts responsibility for them
     >> achieves results by aiming for excellence
     >> proposes new solutions and does not give in when faced by obstacles or failure
     >> quickly changes their priorities if the context changes
     >> shares information and is collaborative and open to the contribution of others
     >> recognizes the merits of colleagues and gives them feedback which improves their contribution
     >> in their work is careful to guarantee the satisfaction of customers and/or colleagues, acting effectively and quickly
     >> is engaged in integrating everyone, recognizing and valorizing individual differences (culture, gender, age,
        disability, personality, etc.)
     >> maintains the commitments they have taken on, taking forward activities with determination and passion


in 2016 a training program on “storytelling” was launched aimed at top management, to enhance their ability to recount the
new strategy. it is a 7-part program, which involved all the top managers of the various group countries, so that they become
the first ambassadors for the new open power culture.
in addition, an internal network was created of trained professional coaches with a view to establishing a skill center to sup-
port people in order to facilitate the organizational and cultural transformation (internal coaches network).

ment, in cooperation with the oecd (organization for economic cooperation and development) under the coordination of
the ministry of economy and finance, the ministry of labor and social policies, the ministry of economic development,
the ministry of education, university and research and the prime minister’s office. this participation enables a concrete
contribution to be made to the development of policies and future decisions on the issue of skills development as a lever for
growth and the sound functioning of the labor market, and to the preparation of the national skill strategy, in keeping with
what has already happened in various oecd countries (norway, spain, portugal, the netherlands, etc.).

             feiea grand prix award 2016
two internal communication projects won prestigious recognitions at the feiea grand prix award 2016, the competition
which rewards the best internal communication projects in europe:
>> the road safety campaign – first place in the best multinational communication strategy category;
>> (il)legal factor campaign – second place in the best internal communication event category. the staff in the legal
     and corporate affairs division launched a competition among teams of lawyers to realize the best research on legal
     themes of interest to the group. the aim is to offer the lawyers the opportunity to get to know each other and to have
     visibility in the company, to stimulate the preparation of high quality work which offers innovative solutions and to
     disseminate ideas. under the mock title of “who has the (il)legal factor” three semi-finals were organized: 3 loca-
     tions – rome, santiago del cile and bucharest – as well as 3 examination rooms and a court for the final held in rome.

diversity and inclusion
diversity and inclusion are two key elements in the company culture and the strategy of enel, which operates in over 30
countries worldwide. for this very reason a direction has been taken aimed at encouraging an inclusive culture to support
people in expressing their potential, each with their own experience and different cultural strength regardless of gender, age
and other features representing diversity. the policy on diversity and inclusion, which was published in september 2015, is
based on the key principles of non-discrimination, equal opportunities and equal dignity for all forms of diversity, inclusion,
work-life balance, and includes specific actions to valorize diversity in terms of gender, age, nationality and disability as well
as cross-cutting actions to improve awareness and the impact on behavior.

in may 2016, in the human resources and organization division, a diversity manager was appointed who is responsible
for leading, overseeing and valorizing diversity, by promoting inclusion in the group. a periodic global reporting process was
also started, which has enabled an overall view of the progress of the policy actions in the various countries. the results
are shared at the various levels of the organization to guarantee complete awareness of progress on the objectives and to
promote the sharing of best practice.




          enel leader in respecting diversity			
in november 2016 thomson reuters included enel among the leading 100 companies globally in terms of respecting diver-
sity and in terms of the inclusion of its employees. enel in particular is the first of the 5 italian companies included in the top
100 and is one of only 2 electricity utilities in the top 50. its inclusion in the index is witness to how non-discrimination, equal
opportunities and inclusion underpin an industrial strategy based on innovation and sustainability.

here below are the main projects which characterized 2016:                                                                        g4-dma la


gender
as from 2016 the percentage of women in recruitment pools is monitored through a detailed reporting system
which is common to all the recruitment units in the various countries. this model envisages that, should it not be possible to
reach an equal gender representation, it is necessary to provide a written motivation, in order to identify any support actions.
this arrangement has made it possible to raise the awareness of the line units regarding the importance of fair selection
criteria. the result of the first year’s monitoring showed 33% of women in candidate pools for external recruitment and 29%
for internal recruitment.


to increase female presence in recruitment pools, awareness-raising initiatives were launched to promote the access of
female students to technical faculties (science, engineering, mathematics), both through the direct testimony of enel man-
agers at schools and universities, and through events in company offices, involving a total of over 2,600 female students.
in particular, in italy two initiatives were undertaken inviting female students to the company to give them some familiarity
with business issues: girls go tech, a challenge among seven teams of girls who competed to identify new hi-tech services
to be offered to customers, and girls in enel ict, on the un day for this theme, to encourage access to jobs which have
historically been considered the preserve of men. the two days saw the participation at the company of over 150 girls.


the maternity accompaniment project (parental program) continues and has been extended beyond italy to spain and ar-
gentina. it consists of a series of structured meetings between the manager, female employee and hr business partner, to
be held before the obligatory maternity leave starts and then on the mother’s return to work. the program aims to valorize
the new skills acquired during maternity (management of complexity, responsibility, leadership) and to build among all those
involved a program which never leaves the future mother alone at any time during the pregnancy and subsequently, support-
ing her also in the decisions linked to reconciling private life and work.


besides the actions envisaged by the policy, monitoring also regards the presence of women in managerial positions and
equal pay. periodically the data is analyzed to identify support actions.

the enel orange day project also continues, which, drawing on the idea of the united nations, promotes, on the 25th day
of each month, specific information-giving initiatives on internal media with the contribution of internal and external experts.
in particular, on november 25, 2016, international day for the elimination of violence against women an awareness-raising
meeting against violence was organized, exploring the issue of the psychology of aggression and setting out, with interactive
simulations, some personal protection techniques for dangerous situations. these techniques were made available to all
colleagues through the company intranet.
in spain, in collaboration with the fundación integra, a volunteering program was launched to support women who are the
victims of violence.


age
during 2016 over 250 people were identified, with a senior profile, to be involved as internal trainers to ensure a
transfer of information to more junior people in the company, and various projects were launched in the individual countries
to support the sharing of knowhow. in particular, argentina started a train the trainers project thanks to which 40 senior tech-
nical staff who are close to pension age were trained and transferred their knowhow to over 5 thousand junior staff, covering
both internal employees and external suppliers. colombia, italy and romania launched similar programs. spain and russia in-
stead launched mentoring programs for senior employees, who thus became reference points for younger colleagues (spain)

or teachers at secondary schools (russia). as for the transfer of knowhow from junior to senior staff, following the 6digital
project, young digital experts were identified and appointed “digital ambassadors” within the organization, with the aim of
disseminating the use of digital technologies and supporting the identification of solutions and innovative it instruments.


as for young new recruits, in line with the provisions of the policy, brazil, italy, spain, romania and russia started a tutorship
program to support the entry of young colleagues into the company, while colombia planned a structured program of meet-
ings with key people that the young recruit must proactively take forward.




          the european pact 4 youth			
in 2016 the enel group continued its commitment to the european pact 4 youth (p4y), which was signed by enel in no-
vember and is designed to promote the culture of business-education partnerships to increase the opportunities for young
europeans to enter the world of work, also thanks to the support of the member states which are engaged in the develop-
ment and implementation of national action plans. a year on from the launch of p4y over 15 thousand business-education
partnerships have been created, involving around 2.9 million students. under italy’s national plan, enel is active in the co-
ordination and orientation of the initiatives and in promoting and strengthening partnerships among companies. in addition,
it chairs the working group dedicated to developing apprenticeships and professional training, which involves around 35
stakeholders such as companies, employment agencies, training bodies, and employer associations. enel’s apprenticeship
program, which was signed in 2014 with the ministry of education, university and research and with the ministry of labor
and in collaboration with seven technical institutes, continued in 2016 with the recruitment of 140 students on first level
apprenticeship contracts and the activation of around 500 internal and external training courses.




nationality
to facilitate integration among different nationalities and cultures within the group, tutorship programs have been
launched. in particular, in order to support internal mobility, every high potential employee aged under 35 (young mobility
program) has been assigned a tutor, who facilitates their start in their destination country. in particular, chile also envisages
an online course on chilean culture. as for expatriates aged over 35 (technical internal mobility), tutors have been arranged
in argentina, brazil, chile, spain, italy and romania.


disability
managing diversity also means guaranteeing people with disabilities the instruments, services and working
methods to let them work completely independently. in line with the provisions of the policy, in 2016 focal points for dis-
ability were identified in brazil, chile, colombia, peru, spain, italy, romania and russia.
in particular, in brazil since 2014 there has been a project for the inclusion of disabled athletes, which envisages 12
months’ training in the company, allowing them to continue their sports preparation; this project won the global award for
best practice, recognized by the un, on the 10th anniversary of the approval of the convention on the rights of disabled
people.
in italy a global analysis has been started of the needs of disabled employees as well as specific related initiatives. guidelines
have been established on the usability of canteens and refreshment points which address both the structure and the internal
support available; in addition, an accompaniment service inside offices has been finalized which will be launched in 2017. fi-
nally, a procedure has been created to reimburse the expenses of those accompanying disabled people who are on work-re-
lated travel, and the mapping of the accessibility of the hotels used by the company for work-related travel has started.

work-life balance is one of the general principles of the policy on diversity and inclusion. in this light, enel promotes solu-
tions to improve the balance between private life and work and to support people’s effective daily needs in order to respect
all the situations, including contingent events, which a person may find themselves in during their working life.

          smart working			
internet and digital communication are leading to a revolution in the management of work: smart working, a new model
which permeates the companies which are most innovative and careful about their management of people. the objective
of smart working is to use new technologies to increase the flexibility of work, relying on people’s sense of responsibility
and on trust in the relationship between the person and the company, and paying attention to environmental sustainability.
it means greater freedom and autonomy in the choice of the organization of space and the instruments to be used at work,
accompanied by greater responsibility in achieving results.


in june 2016, a pilot project was launched in italy which envisaged the involvement of 550 people. at the end of the year a
survey was undertaken of all those involved (both managers and staff) to understand their level of satisfaction and to test
the effectiveness of the program. the results were very positive and the possibility of extending smart working to a greater
number of participants is being assessed, to disseminate a cultural change throughout all the organizational units.

in brazil the home office program is now in its tenth edition. this project allows the possibility of working from home one
day a week. the population involved is around 5% of the total headcount and every 6 months there is a rotation of the par-
ticipants. at the end of each cycle, the human resources function carries out a survey to test the program’s effectiveness
involving both the participants directly involved in the program and those indirectly involved.
finally, in colombia since 2012 there has been a smart working program which allows people to work from home for a max-
imum of two days a week. around 200 people are involved.

            management of risks 						
            connected to business travel
during 2016 enel’s travel policy was updated, with the goal of systematically guaranteeing the risk assessment and manage-
ment of all business travel, from planning travel right up to the safe return. enel colleagues who are travelling to destinations
which are considered at risk are given a specific memo on the healthcare situation and the security conditions in the coun-
tries they are going to. in particular, through the booking system for company travel, before departure, the security travel
guide and the health guide are sent automatically, while any updates are supplied during travel. in relation to the specific
risks in the country of destination, enel arranges, when necessary, suitable protection measures (expert guides, security de-
tails, etc.). to coordinate the whole process, a unit is active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which supports travelers, monitors
news from around the world and coordinates the response in the case of dangerous or emergency situations. this model is
currently used in italy and enel is gradually extending it to all the countries where it operates.

   points, therefore in a new business model, in the technological solution applied in a point of the value chain. the idea or the proposal of an innovative solution
   become projects following formal approval so that the testing may go ahead as well as the allocation of a project budget.
   if the test is successful, the commercial or wide-scale adoption of the validated solution can follow.




             discovering blockchains
blockchains, thanks to which it is possible to certify the exchange of information, ownership rights and contracts without the
need of a third party acting as guarantor, are considered as one of the technologies which could revolutionize the global econ-
omy. in a world where machines autonomously exchange information and take decisions on the basis of that information,
it is likely that new architectures will emerge inspired by the blockchain. in april 2016 enel created a cross-cutting working
group to look at the possible impacts on the business, involving the innovation division and some outstanding people from
the various business lines. the group defined the specifications of three possible cases linked respectively to networks,
trading and renewables. enel is also launching some challenges for a series of start-ups, to identify the best partners to
develop these projects.

          enel idea factory
enel idea factory proposes to transform work places into laboratories for ideas and to promote integration among the differ-
ent company units and openness to the outside, supporting dialogue among a number of interlocutors, inside and outside
the company. in 2016, 19 ideas sessions were held involving 578 people from enel and 22 people from outside the group
(including representatives of universities, consulting companies, suppliers and managers from sectors other than the elec-
tricity sector). 447 ideas were generated, and 24 of these led to 3 initiatives during the year (for example, the launch of addi-
tional services for the market in romania). during 2016, creative sessions were also held on sustainability themes: climate
change adaptation and the circular economy, as well as meetings with the main data owners of the sustainability report.

enel’s commitment
net installed capacity

at the end of december 2016, the group’s net installed capacity was around 83 gw.
new installed capacity from renewables in 2016 was around 2 gw, mainly in the united states, latin america and south africa.
today the group can therefore count worldwide on plants powered by renewable sources for around 36 gw of net capacity,
which represent 43% of the group’s electricity generation assets.

the removal from the scope of consolidation in july 2016 of slovenské elektrárne entailed a reduction in installed capacity
from thermoelectric and nuclear plants of around 2.4 gw and the removal of around 1.6 gw of installed capacity from the
hydroelectric sector. in order to favor growth, a new development model was launched called “bso” (build, sell and op-
erate), which is not so capital intensive and will further accelerate the development of enel’s broad portfolio of projects in
renewable sources worldwide. the reduction in the net installed capacity on wind and geothermal plants in the united states
and canada (around 1 gw) is, for example, due to the removal from the consolidation of some power plants.




production

currently 46% of enel’s power generation comes from zero emission sources.
the net energy produced by enel in 2016, of 262 twh, fell by 22.2 twh compared to the value in 2015 (-7.8%), due to the
lower quantity generated in italy (-7.6 twh) and abroad (-14.6 twh). in particular, the reduction in the energy produced in italy
was mainly due to the fall in demand, lower hydroelectric production and the greater unavailability of some thermoelectric
power plants owing to maintenance. abroad the reduction involved the removal from the consolidation as from the end of
july of slovenské elektrárne, the drought conditions in latin america owing to the “el niño” phenomenon, as well as the

greater quantities of imported energy in spain. as for the production mix, the change was due mainly to the lower production
from coal (-13.3 twh), nuclear (-6.4 twh) and hydroelectric (-5.9 twh); these effects were partly offset by the higher gener-
ation from wind (+2.1 twh) and solar (+0.5 twh).


the existing power plants enabled total production of around 86 twh from renewable sources during 2016 (which represent
33% of the net energy produced by enel in 2016, 31% in 2015), thus avoiding the atmospheric emission of around 56 million
tons of co2. the nuclear plants enabled the avoidance of a further 28 million tons of co2.

the specific co2 emissions stood at 395 g/kwheq in 2016, down compared to the figure for 2015 by over 3%, due mainly
to the reduction in thermal production from coal in italy and spain. compared to 2007, the base year for the definition of
enel’s reduction target to 2020 of specific co2 emissions, this value fell by 15%. compared to 1990, the base year for the
kyoto protocol, the specific co2 emissions (in other words those relating to the production of a single kwh) of the enel
group fell by 36%.


over the years the reduction target for specific co2 emissions to 2020 has increased (compared to the values in 2007), going
from -18% to -25%, setting a target for that date to produce specific emissions below 350 g co2/kwheq.

change. the scenarios set out 14 decarbonization trends to be applied to the main sectors of the economy, including for
electricity generation. following a review of the emission reduction data and strategy, enel’s target to 2020, in regard to co2
scope 1 emissions, was below the trajectory for electricity companies and consequently was approved as “science-based”.
the target includes the operations to close 13 gw of generation from fossil fuels in italy and represents a medium-term
objective compared to the long-term goal of being carbon neutral by 2050.



an important recognition of enel’s strategy in combatting climate change and moving towards a low co2 emission economy
was its admission to the “a-list” of the cdp.




          enel admitted to the a-list of the cdp
                    in 2016 enel was admitted to the a-list of the cdp, the index most widely used by sustainable finance to
                    orient investors towards companies with greater awareness of climate change issues. the a-list of the
                    cdp index includes those companies which, from among around 2 thousand participants worldwide,
                    stand out for the effectiveness of their strategy in taking up the opportunities and managing the risks of
                    climate change. the score allowing admittance to the index also takes account of the completeness and
                    the transparency of the information provided relating to greenhouse gas emissions. this year admittance

for some years enel has also been active in the voluntary emission reductions sector aimed at those subjects (companies,
institutions, end users, etc.) which intend to monitor or neutralize their carbon footprint, in other words the impact in terms
of emissions of their activities (events, publications, products and services, both internal and external).

operational environment

besides the aforementioned project, in terms of adaptation enel started to map the environmental risks which include the
risks associated with climate change through the weighting of the vulnerability of production sites. a pilot project for the
assessment of vulnerability was carried out at sites in iberia and latin america to identify and prioritize climatic events
which may impact on the operativity of the service. the project initially, on the basis of a unfccc method, assessed natural
phenomena, such as for example hurricanes, which can represent a threat for the group’s assets, assessing the potential
associated risk and subsequently the capacity to adapt the plants to face the impacts of the phenomena analyzed. to minimize
these risks in the long term enel has accelerated its decarbonization process, developing new business opportunities in
the field of renewable sources, energy efficiency and new digital technologies in the market for end uses. among the
main opportunities: the digitalization of networks, the development of new products and services for energy efficiency for
consumers and the promotion of electric vehicles in the sectors of transport and residential use.




carbon pricing

the process of strategic and industrial planning assesses the impact of the carbon price on operations and on short-, medi-
um- and long-term investment decisions. decarbonization is one of the four strategic esg (environmental, social and gov-
ernance) pillars and consequently the investment choices in new capacity are automatically in line with the goal of keeping
the rise in the global temperature to below 2 °c. in this regard, enel’s strategy is focused, on the one hand, on increasing
renewable capacity and, on the other, the gradual and selective reduction of the thermoelectric power plants present in
various countries. for example, in italy, the futur-e project aims to lead this transition with the widest possible involvement
of all those concerned.
with reference to the medium term, the group’s strategic and industrial plan for 2017-2019 envisages investments in the
renewables sector of 5.2 billion euro and further growth in renewables through the development of the “build, sell and op-
erate” (bso) model. the group’s new renewable production capacity globally will be 6.7 gw by 2019 including both organic
growth (3.5 gw) and the bso model (3.2 gw).
as for the short term, the internal reference price of co2 is set in the range of 7-13 €/t, in keeping with the recommendation
internationally and with the orientations for the ets. the short-term prospects reflect regulatory scenarios and market ex-
pectations and enable assessment of the impact of the price of co2 on enel’s operations.

          from brazil to romania: the ferentari community
in the logic of creating shared value and customer focus, there are some programs promoted by enel in brazil, such as the
reta, ecoenel, and social electricity bill rio projects. with ecoenel, for example, all the customers resident in the brazilian
state of ceará and in the metropolis of rio de janeiro can benefit from a program which entitles them to subsidies on en-
ergy costs by differentiating their waste and taking it to waste collection centers. on the model of ecoenel and in line with
sustainability development goal 7, enel has started a similar project in the community of ferentari, one of the poorest and
most degraded districts of bucharest with a high level of commercial losses. the application of a creating shared value (csv)
approach enables the creation of an advantage both for the company through the recovery of commercial losses and an
increase in the number and loyalty of customers in the district, and for the community whose quality of life improves thanks
to the offer of social services, educational projects and protection of the environment.


enel romania has started collaborating with two local ngos, the policy center for rom and minorities (pcrm) and carusel,
and has designed a community action program based on three pillars:

defined in 2015 and launched in 2016, the project is still at a preliminary stage but has already provided a lot of information
useful to improve services by meeting the needs of vulnerable consumers.
with the help of the mothers club and the newly appointed “energy mediator” from the community, consumers have start-
ed to approach enel of their own accord to ask to become regular customers. on the basis of the results of this pilot project,
other initiatives are underway to contribute to defining a legislative framework which could offer systematic solutions for the
various needs of vulnerable consumers, in particular the rom community.

          italy - management of the earthquake
during the second half of 2016, central italy was hit by a series of large earthquakes. the first occurred on august 24, 2016
and was of magnitude 6.0, with its epicenter located along valle del tronto, between the municipalities of accumoli (rieti)
and arquata del tronto (ascoli piceno). two further tremors occurred on october 26, 2016 with epicenters on the border
between umbria and le marche, involving municipalities in the province of macerata, i.e. visso, ussita and castelsantan-
gelo sul nera, while on october 30 the strongest quake was registered, of magnitude 6.5, with its epicenter between the
municipalities of norcia and preci, in the province of perugia.


enel immediately took action with dedicated task forces to restore the electricity service, which was completed over 24-36
hours, respectively in buildings which were still useable and for public lighting systems. in addition, towers were installed
to guarantee lighting in the “red zones” and work started to monitor the hydroelectric plants affected by the earthquakes.


in addition, enel started, in accordance with the creating shared value (csv) approach, a series of initiatives to accompany
the reconstruction stage, such as:


>> mobile “enel retail outlets” to facilitate the collection of requests from customers in amatrice and other affected areas;
>> running of safety coordination groups at the prefectures of rieti and ascoli piceno;
>> fund-raising among employees in favor of those affected by the earthquakes promoted by confindustria/cgil-
   cisl-uil: around 320 thousand euro was the total amount paid into the account of the italian civil protection
   dedicated to initiatives for those affected by the earthquakes;
>> donation of 2 containers to valfornace.


in addition, an experimental project was launched in cittareale in collaboration with athonet for the realization of a mobile
phone data network to guarantee lte (long-term evolution) connectivity in the areas hit by an environmental disaster and
during which primary services are not available.
enel cuore, the group’s non-profit organization, promoted initiatives in favor of the elderly and children with the involvement
of the sant’egidio community (also with a consultation point) and of the reggio children foundation.

in all the companies in the enel group, in conformity with the code of ethics, all contracts, communications addressed to
customers and advertising must be:


>> clear and simple, using language that is as close as possible to that normally used by the interlocutors;
>> compliant with the laws in force, without using evasive or unfair practices;
>> complete, without neglecting any detail that is significant in terms of customers’ decisions;
>> accessible to customers.


enel is developing a digital transformation process which positions customers at the center (see also the chapter “open
innovability”). in italy, during 2016 various communication initiatives were undertaken aimed at making information on the
energy world clearer for customers, including:


>> review of the usability of the website in order to make it easier for customers;
>> new online commercial assistance service;
>> making available to 9.5 million customers the online “bolletta genius” platform, which can be accessed from
   the reserved area of the enel energia website, which enables customers to consult their own electricity and gas
   bills, analyze their consumption, check the trend in consumption over time and compare themselves with other
   customers in the same area;
>> new authentication and authorization system and social login available as from july 25 online and from the
   mobile app of enel energia, enel servizio elettrico and enel sole. this system replaces myenel to guarantee sep-
   aration and autonomy in the management and storage of data. the social login function is also available on the
   enel energia portal and the mobile app of enel energia with a social account on facebook, google+ and twitter;
>> possibility of consulting the enel energia website also in english;
>> new store locator on online portal and app which can be used from all mobile devices.


in italy, enel energia, in keeping with the provisions of the law, indicates on the website and on bills the mix of energy
sources used to produce the electricity supplied, as well as information on the energy mix required by european directives.


in iberia, endesa guarantees attention to customers online and through phone assistance. the website www.endesacli-
entes.com has more than 1.5 million customers registered (12% more than in 2015), electronic invoicing continues to spread
together with the use of the apps. two channels have been launched for whatsapp and facebook.
of particular importance in latin america in 2016 was the rebranding project which follows that already launched in italy and
spain. a new identity, colors and logo represent the group’s integration in the various countries where it is present and wish
to respond jointly to the great challenges and opportunities of the energy market, in line with the open power approach.

for communication with customers to be really transparent, correct and effective, it is necessary to ensure that any cultural
or linguistic barriers, illiteracy or disability do not nullify equal access to information. among the various initiatives are for
example:


>> italy: a simultaneous translation service is in operation at enel retail outlets in 13 languages (english, french,
   spanish, german, chinese, arabian, russian, romanian, punjabi, albanian, serbian, croatian and slovenian). as
   part of the “servizi enel per il sociale” program, which was created in collaboration with the prime minister’s of-
   fice, enel servizio elettrico sends bills in braille to visually-impaired customers. finally, enel energia has activated
   the chat function on its website.
>> spain: the website www.endesaclientes.com has a large section to provide detailed explanations of electricity
   and gas bills, for both the free and regulated market, concept by concept. the website is available in castilian,
   catalan and english. in addition, endesa seeks to overcome any barriers, whether physical, social or linguistic,
   thanks to its commitment to digitalization, through methods and support to guarantee access to the customer
   service for the disabled and the elderly (for example, a channel dedicated to people with hearing and speech diffi-
   culties to receive information on invoices and contracts). the phone channel, as well as being available in several
   languages, envisages a specific application to facilitate communication with people with speech problems. con-
   tact points with customers are all on ground floors to guarantee access for the disabled.
>> colombia: visually-impaired customers receive bills in braille. in total for 2016, 420 invoices were issued to facili-
   tate the interpretation of consumption for customers.
>> romania: recently the enel website and the app were completely redesigned to facilitate interaction and enable
   access to users remotely through their smartphone and tablet: an online consultant is available directly from the
   myenel account. in addition, in the areas where there is no enel retail outlet, there are digital self-service kiosks
   in public places, where customers can view all the necessary information.

in all the countries where it operates, enel acts in compliance with the laws in force on privacy protection for customers. enel
is also committed to careful monitoring of all the third-party companies which may use the personal data of enel’s custom-
ers. specific clauses are envisaged for this in contracts with partners who use personal data to carry out specific activities,
such as for example sales or customer satisfaction surveys.

in all the countries where enel operates, a vast range of high performance energy products has been launched to guarantee
savings in terms both of consumption and emissions.
in italy there are commercial offers based on differentiated time bands which facilitate the overall efficiency of loads on
the electricity network and for customers access at a lower price in the set time bands, which enables a significant saving in
costs. in addition, customers are made aware of and responsible for their consumption choices and in their bills can easily
check how much they have consumed in each time band, if necessary correcting possible misalignments in order to ensure
the greatest saving possible.

during 2016 the speciale luce offer was launched which envisages the use of only certified energy produced from renewa-
bles such as water, sun, wind and the heat of the earth, underlining enel’s strong commitment to environmental themes. the
offer, which was available from april to july 2016, is reserved to all residential customers. throughout 2016 the energiax65
and energiaxoggi offers were confirmed following their launch in 2015. both the offers comply with the exclusive use of
certified energy produced from renewables and have a significant social impact. for each contract activated for energiaxog-
gi, enel energia, through enel cuore, undertakes to donate 2 euro to support digital teaching in kindergartens and primary
schools. in the residential segment, enel energia has consolidated the offer of innovative added value products and the
launch of some initiatives for smart homes and e-mobility.


also in iberia in 2016 the offer of added value services was intensified and they help promote economic, environmental and
social sustainability. the initiatives were focused on energy efficiency, electric mobility, use of renewables, and digitalization.


in chile in 2016 the solar electric and full electric projects continued: the former enables the heating of water through a
solar-electric mix, the latter includes the integrated use of electrical equipment, using hi-tech and high efficiency devices
(kitchen equipment, hot water and heating solutions).
finally, in brazil too the attention to the themes of energy saving and efficiency took the form of specific projects such as
enel comparte consumo consciente – an education program on energy saving which envisages the replacement of old
lightbulbs with new generation lighting – and enel comparte eficiencia – regarding the replacement of old white goods.




          from collecting points to involvement: enelpremia
in italy in 2016 enel energia transformed enelpremia, the historic loyalty program, into an active, informed and loyal digital
community, which at year end numbered 1.2 million members. through enelpremia, enel energia has encouraged virtuous
behavior using quizzes, games and competitions oriented at respect and environmental and social sustainability. it covers
promotion of sustainability from the correct recycling of waste, to the seasonal nature of food, to efficient consumption in the
home up to concrete initiatives, such as participation in solidarity events or crowdfunding activities and the use of car sharing.




          e-goodlife
at the end of 2016 e-goodlife was launched on the italian market, a system of useful and innovative home automation
services, starting from the world of energy (awareness of consumption and remote control of the home) and covering also
security, to help customers save time and energy in managing their home and life.

       digital-e



facilitating the digital transformation enables traditional business to be improved, but also to explore completely new market
opportunities, contributing to valorizing the large quantity of information available. the strong awareness that through infor-
mation and communication technologies it is possible to influence the profound and rapid changes in the social, productive/
economic and environmental fabric has led enel to undertake a path aimed at disseminating a spirit and culture oriented at
sustainability and creating shared value. the ict (information and communication technology) strategy, in line with the new
strategic plan presented in november 2016, focuses on digitalization directed towards customers, assets and people, and us-
ing as strategic levers the cloud, platforms and cyber security. such a model also has an impact on communities and suppliers.

to respond to the challenges and consolidate the strategies, the organizational model of global ict was reviewed and broken
down into global and local functions, to provide services and it solutions, as well as infrastructure, telecommunications and
technology to the business lines in an “end-to-end” logic.
to guarantee effective dissemination of the digital culture and to facilitate the progress of digitalization throughout the com-
pany, the digital enabler unit has been created and, for each division or function, digital managers have been appointed who
collaborate with the digital enablers, analyzing processes and systems from a digital viewpoint.


to focus effectively on the aspects of it security with a risk-based and cyber security by design approach, the model has also
equipped itself with a cyber security unit to define the strategies and it security plans, the design, control, monitoring and
dissemination of the awareness of it risks. as part of this unit, it is also planned to establish a cyber emergency readiness
team (cert) to respond to and proactively manage incidents relating to it security.


2016 was also the year of awareness-raising in the global information and communication technology (gict) unit on the
issues of sustainability through the publication of the sustainability indicators in the executive gict dashboard (indicators
relating to printing, telepresence and pc power management). this program has seen it address also the issues of diversity
and inclusion during a dedicated event: girls in ict day, which was held in rome in april 2016, adhering to the international
day promoted by the international telecommunication union (itu) to attract young girls to scientific and technological studies
and to make them aware of the potential and opportunities provided by the digital world.




          ict open day
to promote the new global model of ict services, temporary
spaces were set aside, both in spain and italy, where the ict
open day was held and saw the attendance of thousands of
enel people over two days. during the event the benefits of
the model and the ict products and services were set out.

being digital
enel’s digital challenges are characterized by technologies
which are highly pervasive and which must enable fast, ef-
ficient and timely production processes, in order to drive
the incentivization of innovation. cloud, big data, data
analytics, internet of things are in this sense an essential
step. the development of added value services for virtual
storage, minigrids, electric mobility or smart homes neces-
sarily envisage the creation of platforms to collect data in
a standard way and make it available using a common lan-
guage. salesforce is the interface which also enables sim-
plification of the interaction with customers’ smart devices.




          salesforce
thanks to the agreement with salesforce, the intention is to digitalize processes, simplify architecture and layers of inte-
gration, guarantee greater efficiency and reduce the time-to-market, concentrating and focusing the company knowhow.
salesforce was set up in 1999 with the vision of reinventing crm - customer relationship management in a cloud archi-
tecture which was absolutely ahead of its time for that period. since then, thanks to the use of cloud computing, salesforce
has revolutionized the way in which company software is conceived and used, offering an integrated and tailorable solution
to maximize interactions with customers.
sustainability and innovation are incorporated into all the aspects of the salesforce business strategy, which has as its main
goal the reduction of the environmental impact on the planet, from management of offices to the organization of events. by
2050 salesforce has committed to totaling eliminating emissions of carbon dioxide, and at the same time supports projects
and initiatives based on renewable and clean energy. in addition, an important pillar is the efficiency of data centers: from
careful design and management of the platforms to the choice of partners with greater environmental and energy efficiency.
initiatives have been adopted to minimize the environmental impacts, such as water and waste, thanks to programs which
certify large offices as “green”. finally, various company actions support worldwide socially useful projects through the 1-1-1
model, according to which 1% of working hours, 1% of share capital and 1% of products are donated to the community.




our commitment                                                                                                            139

one of the most important examples of enel’s transfor-                          deployment of internal resources and increased safety at

            a new use of company it assets in a spirit 			
            of the circular economy
a sustainability project has been launched to reward primary schools with the group’s it assets (pcs, laptops and monitors)
which were not bought by employees at the time of their scheduled replacement. this project has been implemented in italy,
in the north east, through a competition involving drawings and essays on the theme “energy in all its forms”. 400 students
took part in the competition from 9 primary schools, from the first to the fourth year. the 153 essays presented were exhib-
ited at the enel retail outlet in verona until september. the protagonists of the project were also the customers at enel retail
outlets who, together with the parents of the children, took part in voting to decide the winning primary school which was
then celebrated at enel retail outlets with a final ceremony.
the idea is an example of the application of the circular economy: the computers which would have gone out of service were
reused to create a genuine computing room in the primary school which won the competition, thus allowing the education
of the pupils, right from an early age, on it and its applications.
in addition, in romania a project has been taken forward based on the principles of the circular economy, which aimed to re-
use it devices, around 500 computers, for donation to 60 non-profit organizations (ngos, educational and social institutions)
which proposed, through the adoption of it technologies, to develop education, training and integration projects in villages
and small rural towns in the regions of banat, dobrogea and muntenia.

ict for people
since 2015 there has been a transformation program aimed at designing and adopting a new global service model, “one
click”, focused on the needs of the people who work at enel and to ensure streamlined processes, innovative solutions and
a unique and global approach.
the new model, which has been in operation in the main countries of the group since 2016 (italy, portugal, spain, chile,
peru, colombia, brazil), has enabled the rationalization and unification of request and approval processes and ict services
globally, the simplification and standardization of the types of ict products and services available (from 500 to 100), and the
provision of an it support and assistance service, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, always in the local language of the
caller, from any country in the group.
in 2016 the tech bar was launched at offices in rome, madrid and santiago del cile, a permanent physical space where peo-
ple can see at first hand the new service model, take part in training sessions, resolve configuration problems for devices
and ask for information on distributed it.

in 2016 the telepresence service was joined by a further video communication service based on the cloud platform (blue
jeans). this service, taking advantage of internet connectivity, allows the sharing of content and can be used, also when
travelling, from a person’s laptop, iphone, ipad, smartphone and tablet. in 2016, 26,805 meetings were held, avoiding air
travel for around 182 million km and car travel for around 2 million km, thus saving the emission of 20,779 tco2 (data
source: blue jeans).
in addition, the traditional video conferencing service has been enhanced with the planned installation of 249 new sets.




17 the number of people taking part has been estimated as: (number of devices - 1). the co2 emissions for travel also consider the movement from the city
   center to the airport by taxi (distances from wikipedia). in 2014 only booked meetings were considered, while in 2015 and 2016 it was the number of meet-
   ings which took place.

printing and optimizing the use of paper

for some time there has been operative in all enel offices a
printing service which, besides leveraging the latest generation                                printing services
printers which are programmed for more ecosustainable use,
                                                                                                  23.2
has been conceived on an advanced business model which has                                                                             22.18
                                                                                                                     21.6
enabled the development from a product based concept to a
service. the particular features of this service, together with
more rational use of printing, have enabled a reduction over the                                 236.2

years in paper consumption and consequently a reduced impact
on the environment.
                                                                                                 2014               2015               2016
in particular, starting from the number of pages printed and the
technical characteristics of the printer models, each month a                                      millions of pages          tco2 produced
calculation is made of the quantity of co2 associated with the
electric consumption of the printers during printing, applying the
emission coefficient (data source: enerdata) of each country,
which considers the specific mix of energy sources18.


in the continuous search for economically sustainable optimization of processes, enel is working on the realization of various
initiatives aimed at digitalizing the activities based on the use of paper. among the main projects in 2016 were:


>> up paper: for the digitalization of work-related expense claims, which has enabled around one million sheets
    fewer to be printed each year and reduced handling times;
>> online bills: for the free market and for the protected market, in italy, it has reduced the issue of printed invoices,
    thus obtaining significant benefits from an environmental viewpoint connected to lower paper consumption. in
    2016, it is estimated that around 39 million fewer sheets were printed for invoicing on the free market, and around
    18 million fewer sheets printed for invoicing on the protected market;
>> the online billing project, in iberia, enabled a reduction in the issue of printed invoices, obtaining significant ben-
    efits from an environmental viewpoint linked to lower paper consumption. in 2016, it is estimated that there were
    around 10.8 million online invoices, with a saving of around 21.6 million printed sheets;
>> the “cero papel” initiative, in colombia: for informed and responsible use of paper through the promotion of
    the use of digital instruments to file and disseminate information, through awareness-raising campaigns on the
    improvements, in terms of environmental impact, following the reduction in paper use.




18 it considers the data in the following areas: italy, iberia, russia, romania, brazil, chile, peru, colombia.
   the tco2 produced in 2016 is higher than in 2015 by around 0.5 t, although enel employees printed around 12 million sheets fewer in 2016 compared to
   2015, owing to the worsening emission coefficient (gco2/kwh), for spain and italy, in 2016 compared to 2015 (data from enerdata on may 23, 2016). if we
   calculated in 2016 the quantity of tco2, applying the same coefficient values (gco2/kwh) as in 2015 for the various countries, we would have obtained 20.41
   tco2 instead of 22.18 tco2.

pc power management

2016 saw the continuation of the project, which started in september 2015, to monitor the consumption of electricity by
employees’ pcs in italy outside of normal work hours19, thanks to the presence on it work stations (desktops, laptops,
monitors) of a microsoft function which enables the identification of when a work station is on but not being used and to
calculate the related environmental impact in terms of co2 produced.
following the analyses made, specific awareness-raising initiatives will be established aimed at mitigating electricity con-
sumption.

cyber security
in a context in which managing cyber risks, which are continually growing, has become a global priority, for enel cyber secu-
rity is an essential element of the digital strategy.
the company, as other key players in the electricity sector, uses digitalized systems to manage its own generation plants,
distribution network and relationship with customers; business critical systems, smart grids, smart meters are increasingly
digitalized and integrated into the hi-tech panorama. in addition, the use of the internet of things is spreading and this leads
to the growing dissemination of devices in smart and interconnected environments and systems. traditional it is evolving
towards mobile computing or cloud computing.


the cyber security strategy is aligned with that of the enel group and is based on a pre-
cise assessment of the possible risks and on the definition of the related cyber security
initiatives at global level. it is defined with an iterative process which envisages the involve-
ment of the various business areas, gradually consolidating aspects such as the forecast
scenario for it security, the objectives and strategic initiatives for security. the cyber
security strategy is approved by the top management and then broken down into
operating plans for implementation of the planned initiatives. the activities
are implemented with a security by design approach which focuses
on security aspects right from the first stages of the design of
applications, systems and processes.




           cyber security in figures
spending on cyber security during 2016 was over 10 million euro.
dedicated people: 66 people (51 men and 15 women) in december 2016 (58 in 2015).


in 2016 the enel group’s protection systems each day blocked around:


>> 600 thousand incoming emails, that were malware or spam;
>> 800 viruses;
>> 700 thousand incoming malware connection attempts.


during 2016 on average 150 cyber security incidents were handled every day of varying degrees of severity and over 400
suspect domains were identified and notified which use the group’s brand illegally as well as around 80 hostile actions
by hackers. in addition, 300 actions were undertaken for systematic checking (“ethical hacking”) of the protection level
achieved by it systems and applications.

group assessment

in january 2016, the assessment was completed of the group’s cyber security. the assessment, which was conducted in
conformity with key international standards (nist, nerc, etc.), regarded it systems, industrial control systems, the organiza-
tion, processes and the practices adopted. on the basis of the results of this work the necessary organizational and design
actions were identified.




the new organizational model

in september 2016, the enel group redefined its organizational structure for the management of cyber security. a specific
cyber security unit was created reporting directly to the chief information officer (cio) and whose head covers the role of
chief information security officer (ciso) of the enel group. this has also made the decision-making chain more streamlined
and flexible in a context in which the speed of response to events is essential. the unit is structured to manage the govern-
ance and assurance of cyber security, the definition and supervision of the architecture and systems of it security in a range
of contexts (information technology, industrial control systems and emerging technologies, internet of things, etc.), solu-
tions and services for the prevention, protection and response to any it attacks and the definition and supervision of systems
to manage ids and access control. the new organizational structure envisages the involvement of the business lines in the
activities connected to cyber security through the figures of the risk managers and response managers.




main actions and projects

in 2016 enel started the project to define the new cyber security framework, which describes the processes for the man-
agement of cyber security in the enel group in line with risk based and security by design approaches.


2016 was also characterized by the launch of new and important projects for it security:


>> the introduction of the new system of identity access management (compac) which enables the activation of
   security policies for access, verifying the compatibility of the assignment of each role with the rules dictated by
   the principle of the segregation of duties;
>> the creation of enel’s cyber emergency readiness team (cert), which is based in italy and with contact points in
   the main countries where enel is present with its assets and infrastructure. during 2017 the project will lead to
   the official accreditation of the cert in the various group countries. the existence of the cert allows supervision
   and monitoring of cyber security events on it systems and on industrial control systems and allows centralized
   coordination of the management of cyber security incidents, as well as guaranteeing constant updating on the
   risks for it security and close collaboration with national and international organizations which deal with cyber
   security and with other certs;
>> the development and installation of a new generation of probes (advanced deep packet inspection probes) aimed
   at improving the capacity to record cyber security events;
>> the protection of web applications (web application protection through advanced cyber security solutions),
   through advanced services which allow the protection of information exchanged with visitors to websites, im-
   proving performance in terms of response time and mitigating the effects of any attacks aimed at interrupting the
   service (ddos attacks).




our commitment                                                                                                           145

information and awareness-raising

during the year the ict security awareness program continued, a permanent and continuous initiative at group level which
proposes to create and constantly promote a cyber security culture, thus improving behavior in response to it threats and at-
tacks which seek to exploit the habits and expectations of users. the program envisages both campaigns on general themes
and specific initiatives linked to specific risks.
the global cyber risks campaign (november 2015-december 2016) involved all the people who work in enel and was divided
into four themed modules: risks deriving from the ease of connection, security of data and information, use of secure tech-
nologies also outside of the workplace, and security in the use of mobile devices.




           main collaborations
in 2016 the active participation in standardization groups continued, in particular in the international electrotechnical commis-
sion tc57/wg15 “data and communication security” on the theme of the cyber security by design approach to cyber security.


in addition, the support of the national observatory on cyber security, resiliency and business continuity of electrical sys-
tems continued, a group of experts (of which enel is a founding member) which represents a reference point for research
initiatives in the field of critical electricity infrastructure.
in september 2016 enel organized an international hackathon, called hackathon cyber security; a contest between the pro-
posals of seven emerging companies to combat it attacks in four areas: industrial control systems (supervisory control and
data acquisition - scada), internet of things (iot), data protection, and protection of mobile devices. the winning company
of the hackathon was involved in field testing of the proposed solution.
collaboration was started with companies producing innovative it security solutions, thus making it possible to influence their
development with the goal of maximizing the benefit that can be obtained from their use in the group’s industrial context.


finally, enel supported the cyber security for infrastructure of the energy & transport (cset 2016) observatory which was
held in genoa in june 2016.

and technological innovation
technology, through innovation, can support h&s activities: from training to preventative analysis, to corrective controls.


in 2016 some safety innovation projects launched in 2015 continued and some new ones were introduced:


>> virtual reality 3d simulator for health and safety training: a project created in 2015 and developed in 2016 to
   apply virtual reality to health & safety training and raising worker awareness on safe behaviors through learning
   from mistakes;
>> augmented reality: in 2016, several devices were introduced to remotely manage and monitor activities on work-
   site, in order to increase safety conditions. through a mobile application installed on smartphone, operators can
   have real-time access to all the information connected to a specific activity;
>> man down detection: the project is currently experienced on contractors; it has the purpose of ensuring the safety of
   alone workers through the use of a digital technology equipment. this personal device monitors the worker’s move-
   ments and sends an alarm message to the control room if the worker falls to the ground or lies down for too long;
>> active safety at work (asw): it is an application which enables self-verification of the use of personal protection
   equipment (ppe) according to the specific activity to be undertaken;

>> intrinsic safety: project focused on using new technologies on both design and existing machinery in order to
   reduce exposure to risk in the workplace and/or during work activities. project key factor is the sharing of infor-
   mation among h&s and engineering units in order to define, validate and make available a method to identify
   the latent risks which may be hidden in a piece of machinery, system or equipment;

   with a remote operator. the helmet is equipped with video-audio communication system which allows the person
   working in a confined space to exchange information with a remote operator.


in latin america contractors are also required to record the activities of their workers and to share the videos with enel.
this allows a systematic verification of the daily execution of the works, the identification of best practice, near misses and
non-conformity and the exchange of feedback.

black boxes able to provide assistance and support to drivers both while driving and in emergency situations.




health in enel
the enel group promotes the culture of mental and physical health and organizational wellbeing and focuses on the work-
life balance. in this light global and local awareness-raising campaigns are carried on in order to promote healthy lifestyles,
screening programs aimed at preventing the occurrence of illnesses, and the supply of medical services is guaranteed. in
italy healthcare records are digitalized and health surveillance is managed through a dedicated it system.


the global initiatives and programs are developed in accordance with the calendar of the world health organization and with
local needs. alongside global initiatives, also specific activities at country level have been implemented, focused mainly on
screening programs and early diagnosis.


the policy “stress at work prevention and wellbeing at work promotion” enables the identification and management of
stress at work, providing also a series of indications aimed at promoting the culture of organizational wellbeing. in addition,
in 2016 the travel policy was issued in order to standardize the prevention process against risks from environmental factors
linked to the local social and healthcare context and from biological agents.

safety of communities
and third parties
enel plants present locally are built in compliance with legal provisions and good practices and are equipped with health
and safety management systems with the aim of eliminating/minimizing risks both for workers and for communities. plant,
machinery and equipment are subject to systematic inspections and periodic maintenance in order to guarantee normal
operation, in compliance with the law and in accordance with the highest standards.


in order to guarantee the health and safety of the community and reduce the impact of company production activities on
the external environment, periodic measurement campaigns are conducted in the company to monitor indicators such as:


>> the level of the electromagnetic fields generated by electrical distribution plants;
>> the noise level generated by electrical machinery installed at production plants, substations and transformer centers.


these periodic measurement campaigns permit to keep risks under control and within the legal limits also for the communi-
ties in the areas where the company operates. the following environmental aspects are monitored: atmospheric emissions
(polluting gases, greenhouse gases, particulates, vapors, aerosols); discharges to surface water; waste production, recy-
cling, reuse and disposal; land contamination; physical agents (noise, vibrations, dust, etc.); impacts following accidents and
emergencies; biological impacts and impacts on ecosystems (biodiversity, etc.).

enel carries out a risk assessment on 100% of its tier-                           tal impacts. in 2016 the detailed analysis was completed
1 suppliers25, totaling around 8,600 companies, 80% of                            of all the sectoral groups with the aim of identifying spe-
which have been considered critical in relation to their                          cific risks associated with each category. the main risks

volumes, and potential economic, social and environmen-                           utational.


25 tier-1 suppliers are all those with whom enel has a current direct contract worth over 25,000 euro.




            requirements of good standing
in 2016, new operating practices were established and implemented regarding checks at group level on the “requirements
of good standing” aimed at consolidating the existing control system through more incisive action to contrast corruption and
in particular through:


>> the determination of specific documentary criteria to certify the legal requirements and good standing, which are stand-
    ard and applicable to the procurement process (from the approval stage to the assignment of the individual contract);
>> the identification of operational verification methods aimed at enhancing the prevention instruments available
    and impacting in a rational, complete and decisive way on cases of corruption and on the factors which favor its
    dissemination;
>> the promotion of a widespread culture of respecting the rules and ethics.

          sustainable supply chain project
the sustainable supply chain project continued, which was launched in 2015 and aims to standardize across the whole
scope of the enel group the criteria for monitoring companies from the viewpoint of their environmental impact, safety, and
respect of human rights. the project aims to strengthen the group’s positioning regarding the supply chain and valorize the
company’s key role in the process of changing and innovating its suppliers. in particular in 2016 the sustainability require-
ments were defined which will become obligatory during 2017, which the supplier must satisfy to be included in the enel
register of approved companies. these requirements are broken down into three different sections for which the supplier
must provide information and documentation linked to safety, environmental and human rights aspects. the supplier will be
selected and constantly monitored also on issues such as: inclusion and diversity; the protection and privacy of workers, and
verifying its own supply chain on issues linked to forced labor/child labor.

          circular economy in the sustainable 				
          supply chain
the circular economy is an economic
system which describes the steps to
be taken for sustainable reform of the
production of goods and services.
as part of global procurement the
evolution towards a circular ap-
proach requires profound knowl-
edge of material flows, in terms
of components, environmental
impacts and the possibility of recy-
cling products. part of this context
is also the project on the “environ-
mental product declaration (epd)”. the
purpose of these declarations is to quantify
and present objective data (water consumption,
co2, soil, atmospheric emissions, etc.) relating to the whole life
cycle of our supplies, which have never previously been defined in a standard way that allows comparisons to be drawn. the
advantages from this process will concern the definition of reference benchmarks for the supplies that we acquire (triggering
a continuous improvement process in both internal performance and that of our suppliers); control of the group’s environ-
mental footprint and a reduction in costs as a result of the monitoring of consumption and the optimization of production
processes.
the epd project falls within the work to operate sustainable worksites promoted by renewables and global thermal gen-
eration as inputs and outputs of the system. the sustainable worksite is a model for efforts to construct and restructure
plants where safeguarding the environment, rational use of resources and a focus on health characterize every detail of the
daily work carried out. the worksite model also envisages the constant monitoring of activities in terms of environmental
performance, in order to generate continuous improvement mechanisms and realize a virtuous and effective collaboration
also with contractors and suppliers. the adoption of innovative solutions on the worksite, both in terms of materials and in
terms of engineering and infrastructure, as well as the increasingly marked orientation towards the reuse of materials and
equipment, confirm that enel is gradually shifting from a linear economy to a circular and more virtuous economy, which puts
resources back into the production cycle instead of considering them as waste to be disposed of.

purchasing fuel is a strategic activity for the group, since it plays a leading role in guaranteeing the security and continuity
of thermal energy production. the selection of fuel suppliers is done by assessing economic and financial aspects of the
counterparties and the possession of the technical and commercial prerequisites. suitable counterparties are subsequently
included in specific vendor lists. purchase contracts signed with such suppliers are subject to the rules adopted by the
group regarding the code of ethics and the zero tolerance of corruption plan, to which suppliers must adhere.


in relation to purchases by sea from the international market, a check is made that suppliers are not on specific blacklists
of the un, european union and the us office of foreign assets control, lists which respectively identify individuals or or-
ganizations connected with terrorist organizations, organizations subject to financial sanctions by the eu and so-called sdn
(specially designated nationals) organizations which are subject to sanctions by the united states for accusations, among
other things, of terrorism or drug-trafficking. finally, in order to mitigate the risks from fuel transport by sea, enel has adopted
a tool to assess and select the transporters used, known as vetting. vetting is a recognized industry standard for oil transport,
but for some years enel and a small number of operators have started to apply the same methodology also in the sector of
dry bulk transport (minerals, coal, cereals).

environmental policy                                                     (last update: march 2017)

managing environmental issues, combating climate change, protecting the environment and sustainable environmental
development are strategic factors in carrying out and developing the enel group’s activities and decisive in consolidating its
leadership in energy markets.
since 1996 enel has had an environmental policy which is based on four fundamental principles:
>> protecting the environment by preventing impacts on it and pursuing the efficient use of natural resources;
>> improving and promoting the environmental and sustainable features of products and services;
>> creating value for the company;
>> satisfying systematically the legal obligations of compliance and voluntary signed commitments, going beyond
   mere legislative conformity;
and pursues, with a viewpoint to the development of the “circular economy”, ten strategic objectives.


1. applying to the entire organization internationally acknowledged environmental management systems in-
   spired by the principle of continuous improvement and defining environmental indicators to measure the
   environmental performance of the entire organization
>> annual maintenance of iso 14001 certifications
>> rationalization and simplification of certifications present in the various organizational areas; search for synergies
   and sharing of environmental management experiences under the iso 14001 certification of the enel group


2. achieving the ideal insertion of industrial plant and buildings in the local area, while protecting biodiversity
>> projects to protect biodiversity (conservation of the habitats of protected species, reintroduction of particular
   species, collaboration with research centers and nature observers, replanting of indigenous flora)
>> bio-monitoring (land, seas, rivers)
>> gradual replacement of bare cables on electricity power lines with buried power lines to protect birds
>> works to mitigate the visual impact of generation and distribution plant and mines
>> development and update of a group plan for biodiversity


3. reducing environmental impact by applying the best available technologies and best practice in the stages of
   plant design, construction, operation, maintenance and decommissioning
>> assessment of the environmental impact from the construction of plant or significant changes
>> identification, assessment and sustainable use of bat (best available technologies)
>> protection and monitoring of the quality of surface water, soil and subsoil in areas around the plants
>> identification and development best practices inside and outside the group and promotion of their application
   throughout the group


4. leadership in renewable sources and in low-emission electricity generation and efficient use of energy and
   water resources and raw materials
>> gradual expansion of plant for generation from renewable sources
>> improvement of the efficiency of generation plant (use of higher yield components and/or processes, reduction in
   the consumption of auxiliary services)
>> reduction in grid losses associated with electricity distribution (optimal grid design, use of larger diameter cables
   and electric components with lower level of losses)

spills
for 2016 the total quantity of the most important spills was around 22 m3, linked mainly to grid construction and maintenance.




          spills as part of distribution
as part of the distribution of electricity, possible environmental accidents derive mainly from the discharge of insulating mi-
neral oil following breakdowns to equipment or vehicles or electrolyte acids in primary cabins. except for rare cases of spills
from large transformers, environmental accidents are mainly marked by small spills for which prompt intervention is envi-
saged and subsequent environmental recovery by a specialist firm, in accordance with the methods imposed by local law.
for more careful safeguarding of the environment affected by the accident, the parts of the plant potentially at risk of spills
and company vehicles are equipped with kits with absorbent material, in order to isolate possible routes for further disper-
sion in the case of an accident.
to further mitigate the risk connected to holding potentially harmful substances from the environmental viewpoint various
tests are underway which envisage the use of vegetable – and therefore biodegradable – oil in place of the traditional insu-
lating mineral oil.

          as pontes
as pontes, an open coal mine in the north west of spain, has for many years powered the endesa power plant of puentes de
garcía rodríguez, near la coruña. in 2007 the mine was closed with the consensus of most of the population, the workers
were reabsorbed into other companies and an extended program of environmental denaturalization started. the program
was created with the aim of recreating the different stages of nature in the area (meadows, shrubbery, wood) so as to rec-
reate habitats for vegetal and animal species. the recovery operations envisaged the planting of 600 thousand trees and the
sowing of 130 tons of seeds, among other initiatives.
the mining area was filled naturally with the flow of rain water and with the water from the river eume and today there is an
artificial lake which is 205 meters deep and with a perimeter of 17.8 kilometers.
the physical and chemical quality of the water has been monitored since 2008 and the observations have enabled verifica-
tion of the gradual recolonization of the basin by local fish species, such as the brown trout (salmo trutta), the three-spined
tickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus), and the northern straight-mouth nase (pseudochondrostoma duriense).
the overall effect on the biodiversity of the location has been considerable: 168 animal species have been surveyed and
numerous species of flora have reappeared. among the most important in terms of conservation are the iberian frog (rana
iberica), the little bustard (tetrax tetrax), the european otter (lutra lutra), and the iberian emerald lizard (lacerta schreiberi).
the as pontes project is a genuine global reference point for industrial reconversion in sustainable fashion.

          rolex award 2016 – chile
vreni häussermann, since 2003 director of the huinay science station, supported by the catholic university of valparaíso and
by enel, in 2016 won the rolex award for enterprise, which is given to five main winners and five youth winners who have
demonstrated that they have the passion, the determination and, above all, the enterprising spirit needed to make the world
a better place. in particular, vreni häussermann is exploring the fjords of the chilean patagonia to document the mysterious
life of the marine depths. it is a project half-way between scientific research and divulgation, which seeks to create public
support for the conservation of the area with its unique and tremendously rich biodiversity.

other activities
besides operating in the production of electricity and heat, the enel group also operates worldwide in electricity distribution,
the storage and movement of fuel, and work in mines and on worksites, while constantly monitoring any environmental
impacts from such activities (see the chapter “quality for customers”).

the materiality analysis 2016

the process followed for the materiality analysis 2016 envisaged the updating of the results of the analysis obtained in the
previous year. the methodology adopted envisages the annual updating of the results from the involvement of stakeholders
and, every two years, the realization of new ad hoc engagement and listening activities, in parallel to a possible revision of
the categories of stakeholders and of the issues subject to analysis, should the sustainability context make it necessary.
the materiality analysis was conducted on the basis of the guidelines in aa1000ses, for the stages of mapping and prior-
itizing stakeholders and analyzing the results, and of the criteria of accountability and of the gri-g4 for the definition of key
issues and the application of the principle of materiality.
the definition of the issues to be analyzed is based on various sources, including the corporate policies and principles of
conduct, dialogue with stakeholders, the issues of greatest interest for sustainability rating agencies, and relevant bench-
marking studies.


the following aspects were investigated in relation to these issues:


>> on the stakeholder side, the relative importance of each issue in the perception of stakeholders and the “direc-
   tion” of their expectations (i.e. an expectation of engagement rather than disengagement on the part of enel). to
   better understand the expectations of stakeholder, during 2016, a pilot project was launched to monitor the level
   of satisfaction of stakeholders regarding the company’s control of an issue;
>> on the company side, the level of impact of the issues on industrial strategies, determined on the basis of the
   current and future commitment taken on for each issue.


in particular, the results were integrated that emerged from numerous initiatives to listen to, involve and talk to key stake-
holders that enel undertook during 2016, together with a structured analysis of the positions independently expressed by
“authoritative” stakeholders, such as national and transnational institutions, authorities, stakeholder associations, and multi-
lateral bodies on sustainability issues. examples of the sources considered were customer satisfaction and customer com-
plaints, dealings with analysts and investors, questionnaires from sustainability rating agencies, dealings with representative
and category associations, institutional relations at national and local level, union relations, media monitoring, and surveys.


the impact of the various issues on enel’s strategies was determined by involving the strategic planning unit and other com-
pany functions for analyses on specific issues, and was then confirmed by the chairman and the chief executive officer. this
analysis reflects the strategic guidelines defined by the 2017-2019 strategic plan, the objectives of the functions/divisions
and the commitments taken on by the group through its policies and conduct criteria.
analysis of these two aspects enabled the attribution of various priority levels for the issues and their positioning in a matrix,
as set out in the specific chapter on the materiality analysis. the materiality analysis summarizes the various perspectives
and provides an overview of the issues with the greatest potential to influence the actions and performance of enel and the
decisions of its stakeholders, as well as the degree of “alignment” or “misalignment” between the priorities attributed by
stakeholders to the various issues and the group’s level of commitment in this regard.
below is the table of the issues included in the materiality analysis in the “aspects” of gri-g4, with the related indication of
the internal boundary and of the external boundary within the organization.

(1)    the institutional investor is a subject who, under a specific mandate or on their own account, undertakes equity and/or property investment on a
       continuous and professional basis. the category includes: mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, investment and merchant banks, insurance
       companies.
(2)    calculated as the ratio between the number of shares held by identified socially responsible investors and the number of shares held by identi-
       fied institutional investors.
(3)    sris are investors who state that they include environmental, social and governance (esg) factors in traditional financial analysis in order to direct
       their investment decisions (the inclusion of at least one esg criterion and adhesion to the main international principles approved by organizations
       such as unpri, uksif, eurosif are among the key factors in order to be able to classify an investor as an sri).
(4)    calculated as the difference between the valuation on the last open market day of the year and the valuation of the previous year.
(5)    source: bloomberg and company filings.
(6)    as from 2015 only certified meetings are considered (meetings held during the different road shows). the historic data has been reformulated in
       accordance with this methodology.
(7)    only requests received have been considered and not the responses provided also.
(8)    outlook updated 26/02/2016.
       the revision of the outlook is mainly due to the reduction in electricity prices in europe which has been ongoing since the start of 2016. on the
       basis of current market conditions we believe that enel will find it difficult to achieve and maintain the targets of the main indicators of the rating,
       including the value of the index “adjusted funds from operations to debt” at a level above 20% in 2016-2018.
       outlook updated 05/05/2015: standard & poor’s rating services has today updated its outlook from stable to positive on enel spa and endesa
       (vertically integrated spanish subsidiary of enel spa).
(9)    2015 figure updated.
       outlook updated 27/03/2015: moody’s changes its outlook on enel from negative to stable; confirms rating.
(10)   the number of independent directors pursuant to the consolidated law on finance (tuf) is 8 (including the chairman). the number of indepen-
       dent directors pursuant to the code of self discipline is 7 because the code does not allow the chairman to be considered independent since
       she is a “senior representative” of the company.
(11)   during 2016 the analysis was completed of the notifications received in 2015, for this reason the number of confirmed violations for 2015 was
       restated from 32 to 34. the violations for 2016 concern the notifications received in 2016 and confirmed in 2016.
(12)   during 2016 the analysis of the notifications received in 2015 was completed, of the 16 notifications 2 concluded with violations (misappropria-
       tion and other reasons) and the remaining 14 concluded without violation.
(13)   corruption consists of the abuse of power conferred with the goal of private gain and can be instigated by individuals in the public or private
       sector. it is interpreted here as including corrupt practices such as bribes, fraud, extortion, collusion, conflict of interest and money laundering.
(14)   the two cases for egp in 2016 happened in italy.

(1)   investments in research and development were about 36% in the infrastructure and networks division and for around 25% the renewables division.
      the fall compared to 2015 was due to a process of refocusing the portfolio which led to a reduction in both the budget for and the overall number of
      projects (12 projects completed or cancelled) so as to focus activity on the scope of gtgx innovation, for example transferring some less innovative
      activities to technical support; the hydro carve out with the consequent transfer not only of the activities previously undertaken on the hydro plants
      but also of the people directly or indirectly involved.
      in spain the reduction is essentially due to the end of digitalization projects.
(2)   customers with whom a currently active meter was installed.
(3)   following a methodological change, the figure for 2015 was recalculated in line with the request made by the aeegsi; the number relates to the
      meters whether activated or not (it does not include connections which are not active and connections which are not active without a meter since it
      has been destroyed).

(1)  supplies to major customers and heavy consumers (annual consumption over 1 gwh).
(2)  customers 2015 figure updated.
(3)  customers 2015 figure updated.
(4)  the green energy declared in the sustainability report corresponds to the energy consumed in 2016 by the end users of enel energia who signed
     up for a green offer. enel energia is then required to acquire and subsequently cancel the “gos” – certificates issued by gse to producers which
     certify to the renewable origin of the energy sources used by their generation plants – to anw extent that corresponds to the energy underpinning
     this particular family of offers.
     as from january 1, 2016, as envisaged by the ministerial decree of july 6, 2012, the mechanism of green certificates (gc) is replaced by a new
     form of incentive. the subjects who have accrued the right to the gcs keep the benefit for the remaining subsidized period, but in a different form.
     the new incentive is obtained by accessing grin, gse’s it system which manages the recognition of tariffs.
(5) includes residential customers and microbusiness.
(6) the figure 2015 was recalculcated due to the change in methodology
     >> efficiency of the power plants was calculated on the basis of the operation of the plants at the load level where there is the maximum efficiency
        for those plants for which the load curve is available. this approach was not applied to the heat component since it already has a high yield;
     >> availability was calculated by removing the internal causes of non-availability.
(7) in migrating to the suite system 40,000 disputes were archived just for the scope of italy. as part of the electricity market, 11,532 cases were
     archived relating to the mass dispute about the free payment of bills.
(8) the figure for 2015 was restated: the values for 2015 and 2016 do not take into consideration the contribution from slovakia for either availability
     or efficiency; slovakia was removed from the scope as from july 31, 2016.
(9) the figure for 2015 was restated.
(10) the index given is the csi (customer satisfaction index).

(1)   the emissions avoided are calculated as the sum of the emissions avoided in the various areas taking as a reference the specific emission of co2 in
      the average thermoelectric production of the individual country, taken from the enerdata database in april 2017 (http://services.enerdata.eu).
      the figure is the product of the electricity production obtained with each renewable or nuclear source by the average co2 emission from thermoe-
      lectric production in the country where enel is present.
(2)   specific emissions are calculated considering the total emissions from simple thermoelectric production and the combined production of electricity
      and heat with respect to total renewable, simple thermal and nuclear production and the combined production of electricity and heat (including the
      contribution from heat in mwh). for “minor” pollutants (such as metals, including mercury), enel has undertaken wide-scale measurement campaigns
      of the concentrations in rivers produced by thermoelectric power plants – in a range of situations by type of fuel and abatement system – obtaining
      results which comfortably respect the precise limits established by the laws in the various countries where enel operates. in particular, for mercury
      emissions, which are typical of electricity produced from coal, in 2016 a total of around 0.396 tons was recorded only for italy and spain which currently
      represent 68% of thermoelectric production using coal throughout the group.
      the mercury emissions are communicated to the competent authorities for registration in the european pollutant release and transfer register (epr-
      tr) in application of eu regulation no. 166/2006 and are subject to associated controls in terms of completeness, coherence and credibility (article
      2 of regulation no. 166/2006).
(3)   “scope 2” emissions: the estimate of the indirect emissions of co2 relating to 2016 due to the consumption of electricity for electricity distribu-
      tion, moving fuel, extracting coal, property management and, since 2013, also the electricity purchased from the grid from hydroelectric plant, is
      the product of the electricity consumption, including grid losses, multiplied by the respective weighted specific emission coefficients of the whole
      generation mix of the countries where the enel group operates (source: enerdata - http://services.enerdata.eu). “scope 3”: the estimate of indirect
      emissions of co2 relating to 2016 and arising from the transport of coal by sea is calculated starting from the quantity transported (equivalent to 68%
      of the total coal used), taking into consideration panamax ships with a 67,600 ton capacity, which cover average distances of 700 nautical miles in
      22 days, consuming 35 tons of oil a day, and an emission coefficient of 3.2 kg of co2 per liter of oil consumed, considering also three days stopover
      for unloading, to which consumption of 5 tons of oil is associated. the estimate of the indirect emissions of co2 from rail transport of coal is calcu-
      lated starting from the quantity transported (equivalent to 32% of the coal used) and taking into consideration trains with a capacity of 1,100 tons,
      which cover average distances of 1,400 km with consumption of 6.9 kwh/t for each 100 km transported and an average emission coefficient of enel
      worldwide. the estimate of the indirect emissions of co2 from the transport of consumable materials, oil, gas oil, solid biomass, wdf and waste is
      calculated, starting from the quantities of raw materials transported, taking into consideration trucks with capacity of 28 tons, which cover average
      (return) distances of 75 km with consumption of 1 liter of gas oil for each 3 km travelled and an emission coefficient of 3 kg of co2 for each liter of gas
      oil consumed. the figure is a rough estimate of the fugitive emissions of methane (ch4) from the coal which is imported and used by the enel group
      for thermoelectric production. the figure does not take into account the emissions due to the transport of lignite.
(4)   the figure for 2015 and 2014 was restated to better consolidate the value.
(5)   the values relating to “current expenditures for waste disposal, emission treatment and environmental restoration” do not consider either insurance




performance indicators                                                                                                                                     253

       or environmental liability or the amortization for environmental protection investments since the current accounting system does not allow a reliable
       attribution to specific environmental items of the insurance premiums and the investments are set out as such, since the related amortization has still
       not been uniquely coded.
(6)    slovakia is present in terms of operations in the group scope until july 2016, even if in financial terms it left in 2014.
(7)    tax due for exceeding the limits of water discharge at the plants of reftinskaya and sredneuralskaya.
(8)    the figure for 2016 confirms the gradual fall in this percentage owing to the progressive disposal in italy and spain of registered thermoelectric power
       plants. the emas regulation is an eu regulation which is applied almost exclusively in europe and is not universally recognized internationally, as
       instead iso 14001 is. for this reason for some years enel has decided to certify its whole scope according to the criteria of the international standard
       iso 14001, requiring double verification, also in accordance with the requirements of emas registration, only for some power plants (mainly ther-
       moelectric) located in italy. in some cases, when neither the certifications nor the registrations were widespread, emas registration was promoted
       locally, in regard to the communities, instead of iso 14001 certification.
(9)    in the calculation for absolute consumption and specific consumption of water, the consumption of water for open-cycle cooling is not included and
       nor is the plant’s consumption of renewable sources.
(10)   the analyses are carried out on different groups of plant from year to year, depending on the specific audit needs, and therefore relate to differing
       power plant levels.								
(11)   the figure for 2016 cannot be compared with previous years owing to the change in methodology in 2016 for the calculation of environmental fines.
(12)   the values relating to “solid” nuclear waste (low/medium and high activity) are recorded in tons in slovakia and in cubic meters in spain. both figures
       are given since they cannot be summed together.
       the trend in the quantities of radioactive waste produced depends on the maintenance work and fuel movements, and therefore is subject to consi-
       derable fluctuations over the years.
(13)   the provision for “nuclear decommissioning” fell compared to 2013 mainly due to the reclassification under assets held for sale of the subsidiary slo-
       venské elektrárne. in 2013 the latter held a provision of 2,175 million euro relating to the plants v1 and v2 at bohunice and emo 1 and 2 at mochovce
       and included a provision for the disposal of nuclear waste for 114 million euro, a provision for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel for 1,296 million euro
       and a provision for the dismantling of nuclear power plants for 765 million euro. therefore at december 31, 2014 the provision held solely the costs
       which will be incurred on disposal of the nuclear power plants by enresa, a spanish public company entrusted with this task. the figures for 2015 and
       2014 refer to endesa generación. the 2013 figures include endesa generación and slovenské elektrárne.
(14)   the cabling ratio is calculated by proportioning the km of cabled lines (both underground and airborne insulated cables) to the total km of lines.
       the increase in the cabling ratio over the years is due to a general increase, in terms of length, of air-borne and underground cable sections at the
       expense of bare conductors.
       this results in not only the continuous and natural replacement of bare lv conductors with airborne/underground cables, but also the more decisive
       adoption of the mv air-borne cables, with considerable benefits in terms of the resilience of the network and limiting the cutting of plants. in parti-
       cular, in the distribution companies in latin america, the increase in the cabling ratio is mainly due to the systematic introduction of the air-borne lv
       cable, which was already familiar but not previously much used.
