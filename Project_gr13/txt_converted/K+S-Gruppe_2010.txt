                         dear readers,


                         the global economic and financial crisis has shown clearly that short-term thinking and
                         actions can have dramatic consequences. as a raw materials company, we think in the
                         long term and it is our overriding goal to run our business successfully in a sustainable
                         way and to act responsibly. the growth of the k+s group is focused, both internally and
                         externally, on the raw materials and raw-material-related sector. this becomes clear in
                         our vision “source of growth and life through nutrients and minerals” and is expressed by
                         the largest acquisition in our company’s history, that of the us salt producer morton salt.


                         passion for salt!
                         we and morton salt share the same passion for the salt business. in addition to this,
                         there are only minor overlaps with our existing salt activities in business operations:
                         these are the best prerequisites for a smooth integration. already months before
                         “day one“ – the symbolic first day together of k+s and morton salt on 5 october 2009
                         – a team of german, and later also american employees commenced preparations for
                         the integration. the resulting processes will accompany us during this year and the next.


                         as a result of the acquisition, we have established a broader base in the salt business,
                         made ourselves less dependent on developments in the fertilizer business and have
                         become the world’s largest salt producer. already now, morton salt has changed us
                         considerably. morton salt makes the k+s group stronger and morton salt will show
                         that it is not short-term action, but long-term and, if necessary, anticyclical action that
                         promises success.


                         preserving jobs despite the crisis
                         the year 2009 made it clear to us how important a balanced relationship between our
                         core business sectors, fertilizers and salt, is. in the wake of the financial crisis, the fertilizer
                         markets shrank at an unprecedented speed and to an extent that was previously uni-
                         maginable. within a year, sales volumes of globally operating potash producers plunged
                         by about 50 %. as a consequence, we were compelled to cut back production sharply
                         as well as to adjust it in terms of specific product groups and sites. about 88 % of the
                         employees at the german sites of the potash and magnesium products business seg-
                         ment were therefore forced to work short time. this tool has, however, made it possible
                         for us to preserve jobs, despite these difficult times for the economy.

preface




              a fair balance of interests: potash production and water protection
              in 2009 too, water protection on the werra and weser and the demands taken to us were
              our main issues. we know and accept that the balance of interests has become more
              difficult than ever not only in our industry and that constant dialogue is required. we
              therefore regard the constructive cooperation on the „round table on water protection
              werra/weser and potash production” as a success. our cooperation with the federal state
              governments, residents and environmental associations combined expertise and tech-
              nical knowledge, and more than 70 concepts were examined to see whether further im-
              provements in water protection could be made. a key factor here was that proposals
              had to be technically, politically and economically feasible as well as meaningful.


              in february of this year, the round table argued that k+s should completely cease the
              discharging of saline waste water into the werra and its underground injection from 2020
              at the latest, and construct a pipeline to the north sea costing several hundred million
              euros, even though important prerequisites for this have not been examined or fulfilled.
              we could not agree to this.


              we are convinced that, with our integrated package of measures and the related invest-
              ments of up to € 360 million, we can harmonise economic interests and ecological re-
              quirements, while at the same time meeting our corporate responsibilities for ensuring
              thousands of jobs in the potash industry. from 2015, the measures will result in the re-
              duction of saline water by 50 % and that of the salt concentration by 30 %!


              this report is intended to make a contribution to communicating even better our con-
              cerns and our efforts to achieve a fair balance between the economic, ecological and
              social interests of our stakeholders. we not only present in detail our efforts to protect
              water, but also explain how potash fertilizers work, which supply the soil with the
              nutrients necessary for healthy plant growth and replace the nutrients removed by the
              harvest. we invite our stakeholders to engage in a dialogue with us.

we also note that companies extracting raw materials in germany are in an increasingly
difficult position. but extracting and processing raw materials forms the basis of our
industrial society and therefore also of the prosperity created here! if we are to remain an
industrial and exporting society and want to preserve the related jobs as well as continue
to create considerable value, interventions in nature cannot be avoided. however, the
current discussion about sustainability, particularly in the industrialised nations, is largely
conducted from ecological perspectives. the needs of a growing global population are
almost ignored. meeting them is, however, an important social issue and can only be
achieved together with the economy.


successfully coping with the demographic change
as a result of the increasing internationalisation of our k+s and ever more complex tasks,
the demands on our employees are increasing. we also have to anticipate that, in future,
we will have an older workforce, while the employment market is providing fewer and
fewer young people. how are we to cope with this demographic change successfully?
by means of a demographic analysis, in 2010, we want to examine more closely the spe-
cific circumstances in our group in germany and derive measures for our succession
planning from this. already in 2009, we again increased our trainee ratio. we will continue
our training activities at this high level.


shaping the future together!
i would especially like to wholeheartedly thank the employees of our k+s group, which
has now grown considerably after the takeover of morton salt, for their tireless coope-
ration, their determination and the exemplary flexibility that they have demonstrated
during the serious crisis. currently, the sales volumes in the fertilizer business are picking
up again appreciably, and the salt business this year is again profiting from good demand
for de-icing salt. nevertheless, we will face great challenges also in 2010: we are there-
fore counting on the commitment of every individual employee.


i thank our shareholders, customers and partners of the k+s group for your trust,
support and the open dialogue in the past financial year. we want to continue to shape
the future and impress you with our performance.

    we are conscious of the responsibilities involved in using natural resources.
    we handle our raw materials carefully and efficiently, taking into consideration
    the latest state-of-the-art technology and keeping the inevitable interventions
    in nature as minor as possible. we nurture our employees and give young people
    solid training. we ensure sustainable growth and never lose sight of the impor-
    tance of a balanced relationship between economic, ecological and social issues.
    this benefits mankind, nature and society.

how we see ourselves
our sustainability strategy




                              sustainable corporate management
                              how we see ourselves
                                 we are a raw materials company, which – essentially with in german raw materials –
                                 is one of the world’s leading suppliers of standard and speciality fertilizers. in the salt
                                 business, we are the leading producer worldwide, with sites in both europe as well as in
                                 north and south america.


                                 through acquisitions in the fertilizer and salt business, k+s has changed fundamentally
                                 over the past decade. we have gained new markets, products and strategic options.
                                 at the same time, other corporate cultures and ways of thinking have enriched the com-
                                 pany. however, there is a recurring theme that runs through the successful history of
                                 our company: for 150 years, we have been mining and processing raw materials, and the
                                 depth of our value added is enormous. in future too, the raw material and raw material-
                                 related sector will form the basis of our growth. we have formulated this as our vision:


                                 our vision

                                   “source of growth
                                  and life through nutrients
                                 and minerals”
                                 it reflects the ambitions, development and objectives of our company. we have derived a
                                 concrete mission from it in which we make a commitment to sustainable management.


                                 our mission
                                 on the basis of our core values, we want:

                                our sustainability strategy
                                       with our vision and mission, we have underpinned our roadmap for a sustainable cor-
                                       porate growth strategy – in the interest of all our stakeholders.


                                       economic, ecological and social goals are treated with equal importance. the concept
                                       of sustainability is closely related to our business operations. we are conscious of the
                                       responsibility associated with the use of natural resources. we handle our resources
                                       carefully and efficiently, always taking into consideration the state-of-the-art technol-
                                       ogy, minimise as much as possible unavoidable interventions in nature, nurture our
                                       employees as best we can and give young people solid training. that is how we remain
                                       future-oriented.


                                       for us, acting sustainably and in a socially responsible way means finding responses to
                                       new challenges early on. on the one hand, this requires the implementation of innovative
                                       solutions at every stage in the value chain, and on the other hand, it means observing
                                       global megatrends attentively and assessing their relevance to our business. in this way,
                                       responsibility becomes future viability, and thus leads to an increase in corporate value
                                       and added value for the company.


                                       group-wide control of this sustainability strategy is the responsibility of the board of
                                       executive directors.




                                                                                                                                             13

                                  our compliance system creates the organisational prerequisites for making sure that
                                  the given applicable law, our internal regulations and guidelines as well as those regula-
                                  tory standards recognised by the company are known across the group and compliance

                                  fines together with other financial disadvantages for the company, but also to ensure
                                  the positive perception of the company and its employees by the public.


                                  the board of executive directors has entrusted a chief compliance officer with coordi-

                                  and business segments as well as the heads of those holding units that perform tasks
                                  relevant to compliance (auditing, risk management, law, human resources, environmental

                                  it security). the audit committee of the supervisory board concerns itself regularly with
                                  key compliance matters of the k+s group.


                                  every employee is made familiar with the core values and the code of conduct that apply
                                  throughout the group as well as with the resultant corporate guidelines. obligatory

                                              the united nations estimates that, in the mid-21st century, more than nine billion people
                                              will be living on our planet, about 2.3 billion more than today. at the same time, the
                                              amount of available areas of arable land will, in relative terms, decreases further: if, in
                                              1970, 0.38 hectares of agricultural land were available per head there will only be 0.18
                                              hectares available in 2050. the most recent estimates indicate that agricultural produc-
                                              tion will have to increase by 70 % by 2050 in order to feed mankind. the rising demand
                                              for food can be met by the world if productivity is increased for the existing agricultural
                                              land and the total amount of land for cultivation is expanded. however, in many parts
                                              of the world there are no notable reserves of land. what remains as a realistic option is
                                              to increase productivity on existing agricultural land through advanced cultivation

opportunities and challenges

                               china and india, more people are achieving affluence, their eating habits are changing
                               and calorie consumption per head is growing. demand for higher-quality food is increas-
                               ing, especially for meat and dairy products. while in western europe, meat consumption
                               has essentially remained at a constant level over the past 30 years, in asia it has more
                               than tripled. the more of these products are on the shopping list, the more feed has to be
                               produced for the animals. for example, up to 8 kilos of feed are required to produce
                               1 kilo of beef. it is very doubtful whether the calls to be heard in the developed countries
                               for less meat to be consumed will be echoed in the emerging market countries.

                               economy, science, politics and society are required to limit the further increase in green-
                               house gases and to use existing resources more efficiently. we are convinced that the
                               industry can make effective contributions to climate protection.


                               a large number of processing steps are required for the manufacture of our fertilizers,

                               exceed 90 %. they are already operating so efficiently that, given the current state of tech-

                               further reduction in and avoidance of production residues
                               we mine crude salts underground, e. g. potash and magnesium, which we process into
                               high-quality mineral fertilizers and industrial products in complex and multi-phase refin-
                               ing processes. production residues from this are inevitable. in addition to solid residues,
                               which we primarily place in tailing piles, liquid production residue and saline waste water
                               also arise, which we dispose of by discharging them into flowing waters and by pump-
                               ing them into deeper layers of rock.


                               already in october 2008, we presented a package of measures intended to improve
                               the quality of water of the werra and weser, which we implemented in an integrated
                               package of measures in november 2009. it describes in detail the planned implemen-
                               tation of the individual measures for protection of groundwater and water, with the goal
                               of halving the occurrence of saline waste water by 2015. we are thus going to the limits
                               of what is technically feasible and economically viable today, and creating the basis for
                               our plants in the hesse-thuringia potash district to work successfully in future too.

                               within the framework of this concept, we are investing a total of up to € 360 million
                               in environmental protection.

                               met by fewer and, at the same time, older employees. fewer and fewer young people
                               are available for the employment market. at k+s too, we are reckoning overall with an
                               older workforce. in 2010, by means of a demographic analysis, we want to more precise-
                               ly investigate the specific circumstances in our group and derive measures from that to
                               secure the ability to work, qualifications and motivation of our employees, even when
                               working lives become longer.

                                                the dialogue with our partners is firmly anchored in our basic values. this is necessary
                                                if we want to understand the concerns of others, to repeatedly review our operations and,
                                                if necessary, to develop alternative solutions.


                                                exchange with all stakeholders, including our critics, is thus very precious to us. a lively
                                                exchange of views with our interest groups is taking place at a wide variety of levels.

                                      a good relationship with neighbours in the communities near our sites is very important

the acquisition of morton salt in 2009 consistently implements our 2-pillar
strategy, which is oriented towards both organic and external growth. with
morton salt, we have strengthened our presence on the north american market
and gained access to new market regions in north america and canada that are
normally less volatile. the acquisition does not only strengthen our salt busi-
ness, in which we now have the leading position worldwide, but also the whole
k+s group in germany and abroad.

potassium chloride – a fertilizer with universal areas of applications
potassium chloride is the top-selling product. the single-nutrient fertilizer with universal
areas of application is used globally for major crops, such as cereals, corn, rice and soy
beans. as a granulate, potassium chloride is spread evenly over fields using fertilizer
spreaders. operators of bulk blenders use granulate in order to mix it with other single-
nutrient fertilizers in accordance with various formulas. we sell fine-grain potassium
chloride as a raw material to the complex fertilizer industry.


fertilizer specialities with different nutrient formulas
our fertilizer specialities are mainly used for crops that have a greater need for magne-
sium and sulphur in addition to potassium, such as rape or potatoes. potassium sulphate,
patentkali®, kieserit® and epso top®, are preferably used for chloride-sensitive special
crops like citrus fruits, grapes and vegetables. our epso product family as well as hortisul®
are especially suitable for liquid fertilization, which is gaining in importance in the light
of climate change entailing longer dry periods.

                                   high requirements of the pharmaceutical, cosmetics and food industries. in the pharma-
                                   ceutical industry, our raw materials make an important contribution to preserving human
                                   health. high-purity potassium is indispensable in the manufacture of numerous pharma-
                                   ceutical products, for example, insulin.


                                   the food industry uses our potassium chloride foodgrade to manufacture dietary sup-

                                   the strengths of this high-purity product are that it enables the proportion of sodium

complex fertilizers – a balanced mix
in addition to nitrogen, k+s nitrogen’s complex fertilizers contain the nutrients potas-
sium and phosphate as well as magnesium, sulphur or trace elements, depending on
needs and the application. the raw materials are combined in the production process
in a liquid or semi-liquid state, and then granulated. as a result, each fertilizer grain
contains precisely the same combination of nutrients to allow for controlled, even spread-
ing on the field. the complex fertilizers containing potassium chloride branded as
nitrophoska® are used for arable crops such as cereals or corn. the nitrophoska® pro-
ducts containing potassium sulphate are recommended for chloride-sensitive fruit,
grapes and vegetable crops.


special nitrogen efficiency
the nitrogen-stabilising entec® fertilizers have achieved broad acceptance on the
market in only eight years. they are characterized by their nitrogen efficiency and thus
reduce the number of applications necessary in comparison with traditional products.
entec® fertilizers are used both for arable crops and special crops such as fruit, grapes
and vegetables.


needs-based nitrogen supply
the straight nitrogen fertilizer calcium ammonium nitrate (kas) can be used for all agri-
cultural crops. ammonium sulphate nitrate (ass®), which contains sulphur next to
nitrogen, is suitable for crops requiring sulphur, such as rape. furthermore, we market
ammonium sulphate nitrate with boron (ass bor®) for crops requiring boron, such as
sugar beet.


leading with ammonium sulphate
k+s nitrogen is one of the leading suppliers of the sulphur-containing nitrogen fertilizer
ammonium sulphate, a by-product arising during the production process of caprolactam
in the chemical industry. fine-crystalline ammonium sulphate is used in europe predo-
minantly as a raw material in fertilizer production. overseas, farmers spread it directly
onto the fields. granammon®, a coarse-grained ammonium sulphate, is suitable both
for direct application in agriculture and as a component in bulk blenders.

                            morton salt smoothly. in the de-icing salt segment, the acquisition has enabled us
                            to gain access to new and generally less volatile market regions in north america and
                            canada; here, we want to expand our positions. also, we will be able to further improve
                            the logistics flows between chile, brazil and north america. and we want to consistently
                            continue our specialisation strategy aimed at higher value added.

salts, but also rock salts in their natural form. food grade and pickling salts convey taste
and are used as a preservative in the production of foodstuffs such as meat, sausages,
bread and cheese. consumers have been well introduced to our food grade salt brands:
in the united states, products with the famous umbrella girl are the best-known brand,
while in chile, the brand sal lobos® is the leader. in france, the brand cérébos® is the

                                      industrial salt – a raw material with diverse application possibilities
                                      industrial salts are used at dye works, in the textile industry, in the production of feed for
                                      animals, to preserve fish, in drilling fluids used in the extraction of oil and natural gas
                                      and in many other industrial areas. the famous morton pellets with the patented system
                                      saver® are the leading product for water softening in the united states. in europe, the
                                      esco water softening salts sold under the brand names axal® and regenit® are the top-
                                      sellers. morton pool salt is used to disinfect swimming pools and offers advantages
                                      over conventional chlorine products, since it eliminates irritation and avoids dealing with
                                      hazardous chemicals. pharmaceutical salts are a component in infusion and dialysis
                                      solutions as well as medicines. salt lickstones for livestock and nondomesticated animals
                                      are marketed by esco under the solsel® brand.


                                      salt for chemical use – essential for the chemical industry
                                      salt for chemical use is one of the most important raw materials for the chemical indus-
                                      try. in electrolysis plants, it is split into chlorine, caustic soda and hydrogen. it reaches
                                      the end user, for example, in the form of polyvinylchloride (pvc), a synthetic material with
                                      numerous application possibilities such as flooring, window frames, piping systems and
                                      industrial packaging.

bulk customers procure de-icing agents from esco, morton salt, and spl. in addition
to dry de-icing salt, we offer prewetted salt, which makes it possible to reduce the quan-
tity applied, but at the same time improve the de-icing effect. the latter is of particular
advantage in the extremely cold winters experienced in the united states and canada.
with safe-t-power®, morton salt offers a product that works at temperatures as low
as -31 °c. in europe, esco offers private households the tried and tested de-icing salt anti-
rutsch®, and in the united states, blizzard wizard® and halite® as well as action
melt® und safe-t-plus® are well-known consumer brands. moreover, under licence spl
produces ice-b-gone®, a de-icing agent for low temperatures, with a greatly reduced
corrosive effect.


brine and other businesses round off the assortment
while sodium chloride brine is used in our evaporated salt production and by the chemical
industry as a raw material, magnesium chloride solutions are mainly used in prewetted
de-icing agents employed by winter road maintenance services. a service offered by esco
at its bernburg site is the storage of liquid gas in caverns.

   waste management and recycling
                                the waste management and recycling business segment uses the
                                underground openings created as a result of the extraction of crude
                                salts for the long-range safe disposal of waste and for waste recy-
   www.ks-entsorgung.com
                                cling while employing the available infrastructure of active potash
   and salt mines. we offer long-lasting solutions that meet market needs using the latest
   in waste management and recycling systems.


   strong market positions in germany and europe
   in europe, we are the largest service provider and the technological leader in the long-
   range safe underground disposal of contaminated waste, both in terms of volume and
   revenues. however, the market is subject to fierce competition; we are able to defend
   our position successfully with particularly customer-oriented disposal solutions. in the
   case of recycling salt slag from the secondary aluminium industry, we are a leading
   provider in germany and in the rest of europe. our core markets are located in western
   and central europe. the eastern european countries, primarily poland and the baltic
   states, offer potential since the demand for eu-compliant underground waste manage-
   ment solutions for waste will increase.


   waste isolated permanently and safely from the biosphere
   the waste management and recycling business segment operates two underground
   storage sites. the waste stored there is isolated from the biosphere in a permanent
   manner – a service no landfill facility can offer. if necessary, we can access the waste
   again in order to recycle the reusable materials it contains. both the situation on the
   raw materials markets and new recycling processes have resulted in a significant in-
   crease in the removal of stored waste, for example of pcb-contaminated transformers.




                                                                                                              41

                                  residue from flue gas cleaning is reutilised underground
                                  furthermore, we operate five underground plants for the reutilisation of waste. approved
                                  waste is used here to fill caverns. for example, residues from flue gas cleaning are suit-
                                  able for underground reutilisation. the prohibition of the storage of untreated residential
                                  and industrial waste has resulted in part of this waste going to substitute incineration
                                  plants.


                                  recycling – ecologically meaningful
                                  moreover, the business segment markets high-quality smelting salts from potash pro-
                                  duction that optimise yields for smelting aluminium waste. we take back the salt slag
                                  produced during the process and completely recycle it in our rekal® facility. the alu-
                                  minium granulate extracted from the salt slag is then introduced into the substance cycle.
                                  in a further plant, soil and construction waste are processed. a large part of the mate-
                                  rial is used for the recultivation of a potash tailings pile, where it forms the basis for grow-
                                  ing plants. additionally, secondary building material is created for road construction
                                  and civil engineering projects.

increasing:
in future, the agricultural sector will not only have to feed more and more people,
but will also have to cope with changed climatic conditions in important regions
of cultivation all over the world. we are conducting research into new nutrient
combinations and develop solutions, in order to support our customers in carry-
ing out this task. for example, our potash fertilizers increase the efficiency of
water use by plants, because if the current trend persists, water will become
the most important bottleneck factor for agriculture during the next 50 years.

                                               customers for transparent goods flows. since 2007, we are not only able to retrace the
                                               product, but also the additives and packaging used down to the individual batch.


                                               in 2009, spl surveyed more than 700 industrial salt customers in chile and 18 customers
                                               for salt for chemical use throughout south america about their degree of satisfaction
                                               with products and services. very good results were achieved. the extensive information
                                               provided important indications of how to further develop the business. as a consequence,
                                               spl has developed an individual action plan for each of the 18 industrial salt customers.

                                      brazilian spl subsidiary salina diamante branco (sdb) has set itself firm goals in relation
                                      to customer satisfaction: at least 90 % customer satisfaction and no more than 30 com-
                                      plaints per year. a survey confirmed that the first goal has been achieved, however, a
                                      total of 42 complaints were received in 2008. sdb used 2009 for causal research and
                                      already introduced targeted improvements. this included setting up a call centre in order
                                      to improve customer service and enhancing quality control, in particular the testing of
                                      the grain size spectrum.


                                      an increasing number of customers are themselves conducting audits at our production
                                      sites, which we are passing with good result. in 2009, sites of k+s kali gmbh were
                                      audited by companies including braintree, b.braun, fresenius medical care north
                                      america, novo nordisk, merck and baxter. at esco, companies like gambro, nestlé,
                                      b.braun, fresenius, kabi south africa and baxter convinced themselves of the high
                                      quality of the processes, and spl was audited by, for example, nestlé, gutland,
                                      mcdonald, basf, unilever and pepsico.


                                      the type and scope of our product information are oriented towards national and eu
                                      law (e. g. the fertilizer ordinance and regulations on the labelling of foodstuffs). across
                                      the group, safety information relevant to our products is stored in product databases
                                      and continuously updated safety data sheets are available, which we also distribute
                                      among our customers. packaging too is continuously checked and, if necessary, modified
                                      to ensure that up-to-date information is always provided.


                                   research and development
                                      when it comes to new research projects and product development, the principles of
                                      sustainable and socially responsible management are also followed from the start.

                           we constantly review our production processes in relation to the sustainable use of the
                           resources available to us, further develop our processes and test new technologies and
                           materials in order to improve those processes. we operate a research institute of our own
                           focussing on processing, process technology and analytics.


                           when developing new and improved products, the main emphasis is on needs-based
                           plant nutrition throughout the whole vegetation cycle. products are developed in accord-
                           ance with din en iso 9001. new products are initially tested in experiments conducted
                           over a number of years under realistic conditions. we work on their composition until
                           we are certain that the product not only achieves the desired benefits but neither impairs




                                                                                                                                      p r o d uct r e sp o n s i b i l i t y
                           the health of our customers nor the environment.


                           before a product is launched on the market, the german federal institute for materials
                           research and testing carries out comprehensive tests and classifies the product accord-
                           ingly. product safety is re-investigated at least every 10 years.


                     fertilizers
                           we offer our customers the important plant nutrients potassium, nitrogen, phosphate,
                           magnesium, sulphur and trace nutrients. it is only through the selective and balanced
                           application of these nutrients that it is possible to cover the growing global demand for
                           agricultural products.


                           cooperation with education and research
                           we are constantly further developing our products and nutrient combinations, so that
                           they are even better suited to fulfilling the specific requirements of individual crops, and
                           so that we can offer our customers innovative solutions for improving efficiency and
                           increasing yields, also with regard to predicted climate changes. in our fertilizers business
                           sector, we collaborate closely with the k+s research institute and basf’s limburgerhof
                           agricultural centre. moreover, we cooperate with universities and colleges in order to
                           apply the findings obtained from basic research to fertilizing practice. in this way, we
                           also create the opportunity for colleges to conduct research that takes account of current
                           practice.


                           in 2009, in cooperation with the weihenstephan university of applied sciences,
                           k+s nitrogen started a project for the assessment of different nitrogen fertilizing strate-
                           gies, taking the use of stabilised fertilizers into special consideration.

              furthermore, k+s kali gmbh participates in international research programmes of
              organisations as ipi, harvestplus and ipni. these programmes bundle capacities and
              specialist knowledge in order to answer complex questions in a global manner.


              250 field tests all over the world
              field tests are indispensable for the success of our work. the knowledge we obtain allows
              us to assess the correct form of nutrient, volume of fertilizer and time of application
              for specific locations. k+s kali gmbh, k+s nitrogen and compo are currently supervising
              approximately 250 field tests all over the world.

              we normally cooperate with local universities and academic institutions in the design
              and conduct of field tests. these obtain the publication rights as well as financial support
              for dissertations and doctoral theses. many tests are carried out directly at farms that
              profit directly from the knowledge gained. we focus on three different fields of research:


              increasing acreage yields
              in order to achieve higher yields, plants have to absorb quantities of nutrients that meet
              their specific needs, in particular during their growth period. together with its test part-
              ners, k+s kali gmbh has trialled systems, which use sensors to measure the status of the
              supply of nutrients to crops. as a result of this, indeed a more precise determination of
              the nutrient content was possible than was previously. in the next step, new methods
              for more precisely determining the nutrient content of the soil will be tested, since in
              particular potassium, magnesium and phosphate remain in the soil over a relatively long
              period of time.

                           enhancing the quality of plant products
                           we are investigating the effect that the application of fertilizers to plants has on their
                           capacity to resist disease, as well as the effect on the presence of certain plant consti-
                           tuents (vitamins, minerals), which improve human health.


                           making better use of limited resources
                           climate change, for example, higher temperatures, drought and the associated increas-
                           ing salt content of the soil, will have an adverse effect on crop conditions. if the current
                           trend persists, water will become the most important bottleneck factor for agriculture
                           during the next 50 years. if deserts and steppes continue to expand as a result of the




                                                                                                                                      p r o d uct r e sp o n s i b i l i t y
                           absence of precipitation, by 2025, almost two billion people could be living in regions
                           with an absolute shortage of water, according to estimates published by the un.


                           it is therefore the aim of our currently most important research project to improve the
                           efficiency of water use by the soil and plants. the fundamental point is this: only plants
                           with balanced nutrition can optimally utilise the available water. furthermore, however,
                           potassium has a quite specific impact: the results of a project carried out jointly between
                           k+s kali gmbh and the universities of halle, giessen and kiel demonstrate that the soil
                           can store more water if potash and magnesium fertilizers are regularly applied. addition-
                           ally, a positive effect on root formation can be detected – and strong roots are able to
                           tap into additional water reserves. the project has also provided the first indications that,
                           with an increased level of potassium supply, the metabolism of plants can better adapt
                           to dry conditions and thus handle water more efficiently. we want to devote more atten-
                           tion to this aspect in future.


                           liquid fertilization is becoming more important
                           liquid and leaf fertilizers are growing in importance in the light of predicted changes
                           in climate. the plant can hardly absorb the nutrients contained in the soil when the soil
                           is dried out. the consequence: falling yields despite well-fertilized soil. however, if fer-
                           tilizers and water are combined (fertigation), the supply of nutrients can be regulated
                           more efficiently and the nutrients are absorbed by the plant more evenly during the en-
                           tire growth period. within the past five years, the area subject to fertigation worldwide
                           has doubled. k+s, with the products of k+s kali gmbh (epso® family and hortisul®)
                           and compo (hakaphos®, kamasol® and novatec solub®), is well-positioned in this prom-
                           ising segment.


                           application advice for good professional practice
                           on the basis of our research activities and field tests, we are creating individual fer-
                           tilization recommendations for our customers, which are the conditions for “good
                           professional practice” as defined in the federal soil protection act [bundesboden-
                           schutzgesetz (bbodschg)]. the free interactive consultancy software with which the
                           customers of k+s kali gmbh and k+s nitrogen can efficiently plan their use of fertilizers
                           has proven successful.




                                                                                                                                53

fertilizers
salt




              in emerging market and developing countries, the proper use of fertilizers is usually gov-
              erned less comprehensively than in europe. k+s therefore trains the sales consultants
              of local partners as well as those responsible for the plantations and supports local author-
              ities and educational institutions with information material.


              fertilizers regulated by thresholds
              our potash and magnesium fertilizers are natural products, the majority of which are
              approved for ecological farming in accordance with eu law which do not constitute a
              hazard to the environment if applied correctly. this also holds true for nitrogen fertilizers.
              for water conservation areas, the european legislator has set thresholds and imposed
              particular conditions.


              if high concentrations of potash fertilizers reach the water or soil as a result of improper
              use and storage or due to transport accidents, this can lead to salt damage. if nitrogen
              fertilizers are used improperly, this may result in an overfertilization of waters and have
              an impact on the nitrate content of drinking water. we make this clear to our customers
              and provide safety data sheets describing which safety measures are to be adopted for
              storage and transport.


              nitrogen-stabilising fertilizers produce less laughing gas
              even when nitrogen fertilizers are used properly, it is not possible to completely prevent
              the emission of climate-relevant laughing gas. k+s nitrogen and compo both offer
              nitrogen-stabilising fertilizers. these contain a nitrification inhibitor, which ensures that
              nitrogen is converted more slowly from the soil bacteria, thus reducing laughing gas
              emissions by up to 50 %. moreover, the plant is supplied with nitrogen for longer and
              more consistently.


              in close cooperation with basf, compo and k+s nitrogen systematically examine
              possible washing-out and ammonia volatilisation losses for new product lines at the
              basf agricultural centre limburgerhof. in an eco-efficiency analysis, entec®, a
              nitrogen-stabilising product of k+s nitrogen was compared with two competing pro-
              ducts not contain nitrification inhibitors during a crop rotation period of three years.
              the findings show that, when entec® is used, significantly more nitrogen is utilised and
              the losses are therefore lower than in the case of comparable conventional products.

                                               the use of de-icing salts by winter maintenance services has proved successful going back
                                               many decades. it has been demonstrated in a number of independent studies that
                                               there are neither economic nor ecological alternatives to de-icing salt for ensuring safety
                                               on roads and motorways. for example, following comparative research into grit and
                                               de-icing salt, the ökoinstitut freiburg came to the conclusion that de-icing salt, spread
                                               using the modern prewetted salt process, is the most environmentally friendly and
                                               effective method for winter road clearance services. this technique, which involves the
                                               spreading of a mixture of 70 % dry salt and 30 % brine, allows the amount of de-icing
                                               salt spread to be reduced while at the same time enhancing the de-icing effect and thus

                                               salt is in the greatest demand when temperatures are around freezing point. we there-

                                               prewetted salt technology is state of the art
                                               while the prewetted salt technology is regarded state of the art in germany and is used
                                               all over the country, its application varies elsewhere in europe. where the cost of invest-

                                               decisive role. nevertheless, at the european level, there is a lively exchange of information
                                               regarding best practices in winter road maintenance services. the european research

                                               in the united states too, in addition to the traditional spreading system, there is a grow-

                                    the newest winter road maintenance service trend comes from scandinavia: tests there
                                    have resulted in the recommendation that only brine be used within the context of
                                    preventive spreading. the aim of this is to spread the saline solution at high speed and
                                    in the lowest possible concentration, but so evenly on the road surface that it is com-

                                    spreading, which remains the optimal method in winter road maintenance services
                                    when the road surface is already icy. however, it involves considerable investments in
                                    spreading and storage techniques, and there are not yet sufficiently reliable test find-

                           the reutilisation facilities are approved under the terms of mining legislation and the

                           legislation and with the waste disposal and stowing directives. as part of the extensive
                           approval procedures, the geological, hydrogeological, mining-technical and geomechanical
                           suitability of the sites was proven in several expert opinions. the sites are regularly in-
                           spected by state regulatory bodies and are certified as professional waste disposal sites as
                           well as certified in accordance with din iso 9001:2000.


                           underground disposal of waste
                           suitable for underground disposal is inorganic toxic waste, which must not be explosive,




                                                                                                                                      p r o d uct r e sp o n s i b i l i t y
                           easily combustible, radioactive, gas emitting, or independently flammable. moreover,
                           neither free liquids may be stored nor any solid substances that could cause a chemical
                           reaction with the salt rock. substances suitable for storage are, for example, incinerated
                           waste, arsenic or mercury-containing waste, pcb transformers, as well as contaminated
                           soil and construction waste.


                           the waste is packed in big bags,in barrels or containers made of steel sheet. if the stor-
                           age in a chamber is finished, the chamber is secured by a wall or a salt wall and thus
                           separated from other groups of substances. when a site is shut down, its shafts are made
                           watertight and sealed off safely over the long term using state-of-the-art technology.


                           given the current quantities of waste to be stored, the caverns that have been approved
                           for storage at the two underground facilities are sufficient for several decades. because
                            of the mining of potash, further caverns are coming into existence all the time, and these
                           may also be used for waste storage once they have been granted the necessary approval.


                           reutilisation of waste
                           in contrast to disposal, the objective of reutilisation is to make use of the waste. approved
                           non-mining waste is exploited for the purpose of filling suitable caverns. by means of
                           special techniques and using the particular properties concerning the construction physics
                           of the waste, a supporting effect is achieved that ensures the stability of the caverns
                           over extremely long periods of time. suitable for underground reutilisation are ashes left
                           over from the combustion of sludge, filter dust from the flue gas cleaning of domestic
                           and special waste incinerators, contaminated soil, construction waste and residue from
                           the evaporation of stockpile waste water.

                        business framework
                           core business sector fertilizers
                           2009 was characterised by a very low demand for fertilizers in almost all markets, above
                           all in europe and north america: the reluctance on the part of agriculture in sourcing
                           fertilizers also continued against a background of no sustainable recovery as yet of prices
                           for agricultural products. the trade sector pursued the goal of keeping the inventories
                           which had been largely scaled back in the first half of the year as low as possible and
                           delaying the normally customary stocking up. however, in the case of straight nitrogen
                           fertilizers, sharp price declines led to a revived demand in the second half of the year, as
                           a reaction to the significantly lesser demand at the beginning of the year and to falling
                           gas prices and the high availability of ammonia. many fertilizer producers cut back their
                           production significantly during the year, in order to counteract an excessively high accu-
                           mulation of stocks on their part.


                           core business sector salt
                           in the first quarter, both the west european and the north american de-icing salt markets
                           were marked by above-average severe and long-lasting winter weather conditions. in
                           some regions this even led to supply bottlenecks. the early procurement of de-icing salt
                           during the summer months was below the normal level in west europe, despite custo-
                           mers’ depleted inventories as a result of the severe and long-lasting winter weather con-
                           ditions at the start of the year, presumably due to the difficult situation faced by public
                           authorities. in north america, however, tenders were comparable to the very good
                           previous year in terms of volume. however, prices dropped slightly after the previous
                           year’s tenders still benefitted from supply bottlenecks. in the fourth quarter, the de-icing
                           salt business in west europe was above all positively influenced by the onset of winter
                           in the last two weeks of december. while winter weather conditions also favoured the
                           de-icing salt business on the north american east coast, the weather in the other regions
                           of north america was milder.


                           in europe, the effects of the financial crisis on the business with salt for chemical use
                           already made their mark at the beginning of the year, and because of the continuing
                           poor economic situation, the demand also remained low over the year. in 2009, the
                           food-grade and industrial salt segments by contrast proved to be relatively stable and
                           were hardly affected by the economic crisis.

revenues and earnings
   at € 3.6 billion, revenues fall 26 % year on year
   in financial year 2009, we achieved revenues of € 3,573.8 million, which was 25.5 % below
   the figure for the previous year. fourth quarter revenues benefited by € 237.6 million
   from the first-time consolidation of morton salt. adjusted for this effect, revenues would
   have totalled € 3,336.2 million.


   a slight seasonality was evident from the quarterly revenues figures posted during the
   course of the year: thus, the first quarter tends to be the strongest and third quarter
   the weakest. in terms of volumes, the fertilizers business sector usually profits in the first
   quarter from the start of the spring fertilizing season in europe; although the autumn
   fertilizing season occurs in the third quarter, it is, however, less important than the spring
   fertilizing season in terms of sales volumes. the de-icing salt business is normally focused
   on the first and fourth quarters of a year, while during the second and third quarters,
   customers stock up at prices that are usually more favourable.

   the decline in revenues in 2009 can be particularly attributed to negative volume and
   price effects, which it was not possible to compensate for by means of positive currency
   effects and consolidation-related growths in revenues during the fourth quarter. the
   potash and magnesium products and nitrogen fertilizers business segments had to accept
   declines in revenues due to significantly lower sales volumes and prices. in the salt
   business segment, on the other hand, high sales volumes of de-icing salt during the first
   and fourth quarters and the first-time consolidation of morton salt in the last three
   months of the year had a positive impact on revenues.


   the potash and magnesium products business segment again posted the highest rev-
   enues of all the k+s group’s business segments, accounting for 40 % of the total, and was
   followed by nitrogen fertilizers and salt. in europe, we achieved revenues of € 1,896.3
   million (-42 %). thus, despite the sharp decline against the previous year, a good 53 %
   of total revenues were still generated in this region. the european market is very impor-
   tant for us because we can normally leverage shipment cost advantages. revenues in
   the overseas markets, which will be even more important in future as a consequence
   of the acquisition of morton salt, rose by 10 % to a total of € 1,677.5 million.




                                                                                                           63

                        development of selected cost types
                        the most important cost types in detail: at € 756.4 million, the personnel costs of the
                        k+s group increased by € 17.9 million or 2 % against the previous year. in 2009, energy
                        costs too declined by € 40 million to about € 210.7 million, € 8.7 million of which was
                        accounted for by morton salt. the picture was similar in the case of freight costs: these
                        declined due to the lower sales volume in the fertilizers business segment and despite
                        the first-time inclusion of morton salt in the fourth quarter (€ 23.1 million) by just under
                        € 52 million to € 385.8 million.


                        operating earnings (ebit i) significantly under the peak figure of 2008
                        at € 238.0 million, operating earnings were down € 1,104.7 million or 82 % on last year’s
                        peak figure (2008: € 1,342.7 million). in the case of the operating earnings, the customary
                        seasonality referred to in relation to revenues was concealed by various effects: the
                        extreme drop in demand and the resulting lower capacity utilisation and the decline in
                        fertilizer prices during the course of the year resulted in sharp declines in earnings in the
                        potash and magnesium products and nitrogen fertilizers business segments. the operat-
                        ing earnings in the salt business segment, however, were significantly higher than the
                        figure for the previous year particularly due to the persistent wintry weather conditions
                        in the first quarter and in the last weeks of the year.


                        earnings after operating hedging transactions (ebit ii)
                        earnings after operating hedging transactions (ebit ii) achieved € 241.9 million during
                        the year under review, having been € 1,192.3 million in the previous year. ebit ii benefited
                        from earnings effects arising from operating anticipatory hedging transactions totalling
                        € 3.9 million, after an adverse effect in the previous year of € 150.4 million. the difference
                        of € 3.9 million corresponds to that part of the earnings from operating anticipatory hedg-

                        capital expenditure
                        in 2009, we invested a total of € 177.6 million in property, plant and equipment and
                        intangible assets, about 10 % less than in the previous year. in comparison to our last
                        published forecast, at the end of the year, there were capital expenditure overhangs of
                        about € 10 million, which were mainly attributable to the postponement of projects.


                        during the course of the year, a certain degree of seasonality is evident for capital ex-
                        penditure; investment undertakings are largely implemented predominantly in the third
                        and fourth quarters, since we use the pauses in production that arise then to implement
                        large-scale investment undertakings. in 2009, these seasonal effects were, however, of a
                        lesser magnitude, after we, already in the first half of the year, utilised the lower capacity
                        utilisation at the plants increasingly for measures intended to secure future production.
                        at the end of the year, there were still capital expenditure obligations totalling € 45.2 mil-
                        lion; this is attributable to not yet completed investment undertakings from 2009. about
                        two thirds of the investments made were in measures relating to replacing and ensuring
                        production; this share was thus less than the write-downs of € 173.8 million.


                        outlook
                        the fertilizer business is again increasing appreciably in terms of volume, and the salt
                        business is again profiting from a good de-icing salt demand this year. for the business
                        development in 2010, we are therefore expecting, from today’s perspective – above all
                        as a result of the first-time inclusion of morton salt for the entire year – a significant
                        increase in revenues. in the case of earnings too, on account of the impending operating
                        turnaround in the nitrogen fertilizers business and morton salt’s first-time earnings
                        contribution for the entire year, we are confident that we will again be able to report
                        significant gains as compared with the previous year.


                        in view of the agricultural land which is only available to a limited extent globally, a
                        fertilizing intensity which was slight in the past year across all nutrients and which will
                        still be insufficient in the years to come, and probably a more normal and therefore less
                        favourable overall weather situation in important producing regions of the world as com-
                        pared with the previous year, the future cereal supply should not keep pace with the
                        demand; a positive price impulse would be the logical consequence and should addition-
                        ally support the pent-up demand for fertilizers. in 2011, we therefore expect to see a
                        further increase in the sales volumes of the mineral fertilizers we offer, so that there are
                        good opportunities for both revenues and earnings of the k+s group to increase further
                        in relation to the expected values for 2010.

   k+s share performance is 5.6 % over the year (incl. dividend +11.9 %)
   at € 39.99, the 2009 closing price was higher than the price at the end of the previous
   year following adjustment for the subscription right (€ 37.87). however, price performance
   was by no means straightforward.


   the following important events impacted the price trend in 2009:
      ollowing a short-term recovery at the beginning of the year, the k+s share price fluc-
   n f
     tuated between € 32 and € 42 until the start of february. as a result of general market
     turmoil, the price then fell again signifi-cantly. additionally, the cautious outlook pub-
     lished within the framework of financial reporting in march had an adverse effect on
     the price trend, so that the share closed at an annual low of € 29.85 on 12 march 2009.


      t the start of the second quarter, the announcement of the takeover of the us salt
   n a
     producer morton salt on 2 april had a positive effect on the k+s share price. this
     development was supported by the figures for the first quarter, published on 13 may,
     which turned out to be better than the capital market had expected. in spite of the
     dividend markdown of € 2.40 on 14 may, the k+s share rose to over € 50 during the
     course of the month.


      he high for the year of € 53.04 was reached on 2 june, before an ad hoc disclosure
   n t
     on 17 june regarding lower sales volumes and results prospects resulted in a significant
     price decline.




                                                                                                      economy
      t the start of july, falling grain prices and a weaker market environment weighed on
   n a
     the k+s share price. on 10 july, the trade press reported the conclusion of a contract
     between india’s state import company ipl and ipc, the export company of the russian
     potash producer silvinit, regarding the delivery of potassium chloride standard at a
     price of us$/t 460 including freight. as this price was tangibly below the price level
     prevailing on the global markets until the beginning of july 2009, the share prices of
     potash producers came under renewed pressure.


      hile the equity markets again experienced an upswing starting from mid-july, un-
   n w
     certainties about the duration of weak demand on the market for potash continued
     to impact negatively on the k+s share.


      n 18 september, canadian competitor potashcorp published a profit warning, which
   n o
     also had an adverse effect on the k+s share price, even though the capital markets
     had already been informed by k+s in june about the anticipated poor earnings position.


      he figures for the third quarter, published in november, matched expectations with
   n t
     an unchanged outlook. nevertheless, rumours concerning a possible capital increase
     prevented a price recovery.

             n t
                put an end to these speculations and ushered in an upward trend.

                mas. on 30 december 2009, our share was quoted at € 39.99 and was thus slightly
                above the level at the end of 2008 (€ 37.87; retroactively adjusted for the subscription
                right markdown of the 2009 capital increase). if the dividend paid in may 2009 is
                taken into consideration, the growth in value amounted to 11.9 % in total.


             at the start of 2010, the k+s share price rose by just under 12 %
             the year 2010 began with a marked price increase. the reasons for this were analysts’
             positive comments regarding the outlook for the fertilizers business in 2010. this was
             also helped by the prospects for good earnings in the salt business segment due to the
             cold weather conditions in europe at the beginning of the year. after a short phase of
             weakness at the end of january, the price rose to € 44.62 up to the end of february. in
             comparison to the end of 2009, the k+s share closed 11.6 % up; the dax lost 6 % in the

                                            k+s is conscious of the special responsibilities involved in using natural resources. sus-
                                            tainability in potash and rock salt mining also means coordinating the goals of economic
                                            efficiency, environmental friendliness and social responsibility. the basis for our commer-
                                            cial success is therefore closely related to the efficient use of all substances and materials
                                            available to us in the value chain.


                                            it is our aim to minimise the inevitable interventions in nature as much as possible. we
                                            therefore utilise state-of-the-art exploration and extraction processes and are constantly
                                            developing our process technologies further. this is why we have continuously reduced
                                            the specific use of raw materials and energy in recent years and decades. we are optimis-

                                              results.
                                            2. the environment, occupational safety and quality management holding unit. it co-
                                              ordinates the cross-segment activities and offers professional support to the third pillar.

                                we mine potash crude salts underground, which we process into high-quality mineral
                                fertilizers and industrial products, in complex and multi-phase treatment and refining
                                processes. due to the nature of the deposits, the extraction process in germany is, in
                                part, technically significantly more sophisticated than that of our competitors abroad,
                                but our deposits are the only ones to contain, in addition to potassium (13 % to 27 % po-
                                tassium chloride), the important plant nutrients magnesium and sulphur (11 % to 27 %
                                magnesium sulphate). thus, in addition to the standard fertilizer potassium chloride, we
                                are also able to produce speciality fertilizers for agriculture and industrial applications.


                                specific processing – depending on crude salt type
                                potash production is inseparably associated with the necessity to manage solid and
                                liquid residues, which arise during treatment and further processing in various production
                                processes.

                                depending on the type of crude salt and site, a combination of the production processes
                                thermal dissolution, flotation or electrostatic separation (esta process) is employed.
                                while the first two processes inevitably involve the use of water, electrostatic separation
                                is a dry and energy-saving form of treatment. overall, we use this technology to treat
                                over 60 % of the crude salt. however, due to its composition, not every crude salt is suit-

                                obtained from carnallite by means of the wet method, which produces a saline solution.


                                within the limits of existing permits, we dispose of liquid production residues and saline

                                         in february 2009, k+s, jointly with the state governments of hesse and thuringia, signed
                                         a public law agreement. the common objective: continuing and ensuring potash pro-

                                         basis of sustainable economic activity, while protecting the natural environment. in
                                         this regard, the partners to the agreement have therefore implemented the resolutions
                                         adopted by the hesse state parliament in july 2007 and the thuringia state parliament
                                         in october 2007, and have created a binding framework for the implementation of the
                                         package of measures on water protection already presented by k+s in october 2008.


                                         there is unanimity between the parties to the agreement to constantly further reduce
                                         the impact on the environment associated with potash production. this particularly
                                         concerns the prevention and reduction of residue from potash production. in the agree-
                                         ment, k+s has committed itself to:

                                         n work out an overall strategy to reduce the impact on the environment by 31 may 2009
                                           and
                                         n submit an integrated package of measures by 31 october 2009.


                                         parallel to this, by 2008, it had proved possible to lower the annual occurrence of saline
                                         waste water arising from treatment processes through a large number of individual
                                         measures by about 1.8 million m3 to about 12 million m3 per year in comparison to 2006.


                                         the federal states, for their part, are offering k+s the highest possible level of investment
                                         security within the applicable legal framework, by means of an appropriate structuring
                                         of administrative procedures.


                                         measures for the short-term reduction of injection in hesse
                                         we proposed the following significant measures for the short-term reduction of injection
                                         to the authorities and ministries of hesse and thuringia in due time on 31 march 2009:

                                overall strategy for reducing the impact on the environment
                                in may 2009, in accordance with the public law agreement, we presented our overall
                                strategy for reducing the impact on the environment. this shows how the form of
                                injecting liquid residues used until now can be concluded in hesse by 2015 and how a
                                further significant reduction in saline waste water occurring up to now can be achieved.
                                we are thus implementing a change in direction in the underground injection of saline
                                waste water and paving the way towards a further lowering of today’s thresholds for
                                discharge into the werra by about 30 %.


                                integrated package of measures
                                on the basis of the overall strategy, we presented our integrated package of measures
                                (ipm) in october 2009. it describes in detail the planned implementation of the individ-
                                ual measures, to be implemented by 2015, for the protection of groundwater and water,
                                including the new integrated saline waste water control system (nis) as well as the
                                examination of further measures. the ipm was submitted to the environmental commit-
                                tees of all five states bordering the werra/weser still in november.


                                with the completion of the first facilities, the currently occurring saline waste water
                                can thus be further reduced and gradually halved to 7 million m3 a year by 2015 at the
                                latest. moreover, the chloride threshold value and the water hardness threshold value –
                                a biologically particularly relevant variable – can be reduced by almost one third each.
                                as a result, north of bad karlshafen, the weser will almost become a river of freshwater
                                quality again. in terms of its salt content, the weser at bremen will be of drinking water
                                quality.

                                investments of up to € 360 million
                                the associated investments in improving water quality will total up to € 360 million by
                                2015. from today’s perspective, we are thus at the limits of what is technically achievable
                                and commercially viable. we are even better harmonising commercial interests and
                                ecological requirements and particularly fulfilling our corporate responsibility to secure
                                thousands of jobs in the potash industry.

potash production and water protection




                                         the measures planned from today’s perspective at the werra plant (hattorf, wintershall
                                         and unterbreizbach sites) are:


                                         n creation of a saline waste water network across federal states and establishment of
                                           a new integrated saline waste water control system (nis) across federal states
                                           the nis is intended to end existing injection. additionally, it will be possible to ease
                                           the burden on the subsoil through the recovery of saline solutions. the first step in
                                           implementing the nis is the saline waste water network across federal states between
                                           thuringia and hesse, approval for which has already been applied for.
                                           total investment: about € 50 million
                                           implementation: end of 2015


                                         n construction of a facility for the evaporation of magnesium chloride solution
                                           at this facility, arising saline solutions shall be evaporated. the highly concentrated
                                           magnesium chloride solution that then remains can be sold, if the corresponding
                                           demand exists, or placed underground. the occurrence of saline water will be reduced
                                           by about two million cubic metres per year as a result.
                                           total investment: about € 97 million
                                           implementation: end of 2012


                                         n switching from the wet extraction of kieserite to the dry esta process
                                           at the werra plant, the dry esta process is already being used to produce potassium
                                           sulphate and kieserite. it is intended to replace the existing “kieserite washing”
                                           with the esta process also. as a result of this, the occurrence of saline water will be
                                           reduced by about 3.5 million cubic metres per year.
                                           total investment: about € 55 million
                                           implementation: end of 2012


                                         n construction of a solution deep-freezing facility for saline solutions
                                           the production process of the werra plant produces part of the saline solutions (approx.
                                           2.2 million m3 per year) at a temperature of about 30 degrees celsius. by cooling this
                                           solution to minus 10 degrees celsius, the content of potassium chloride and magne-
                                           sium sulphate is halved and these reusable materials still extracted.
                                           total investment: about € 70 million
                                           implementation: start of 2015

                                moreover, we have to invest about € 53 million in infrastructure measures. with the com-
                                plete implementation of the package of measures, we are exhausting all the possibilities
                                for improving environmental friendliness, given state-of-the-art technology. in order to
                                fulfil the goals described in the public law agreement and the requirements formulated
                                in the eu water framework directive beyond 2015, in future too, there will be no let-up
                                in our efforts.


                                pressing ahead with research and development
                                we will continue our intensive research and development, whose pioneering technical
                                developments define the state of the art in the processing of potash salts and have
                                set global standard for our competitors. the main focuses of these efforts are both in the
                                sphere of mining and in the technological processing and treatment of production
                                residues. we pay particular attention to all issues relating to the prevention and use of
                                residues and to environmentally friendly tailings management.


                                reviewing off-site disposal
                                furthermore, the integrated package of measures (ipm) provides for the examination
                                of further measures, particularly of the off-site disposal of saline water through a long-
                                distance pipeline to the north sea or the upper weser. in this regard, the partners to the
                                public law agreement together with the round table developed four evaluation criteria,
                                the fulfilment of which constitutes an essential precondition for the implementation of
                                the project:
                                n the measure has to be ecologically meaningful – also with regard to the attainment
                                   of the overall objectives of the european water framework directive.
                                n there must be sufficient and documented common political will at both federal state
                                   and national levels.

                                                                                                                                                 ec o l o g y




                                   as the discharge of saline solutions being approved must be ensured in the long term.

                                until the end of 2010, we will examine the feasibility in principle of different pipeline
                                variants. the feasibility study, which has already been commissioned by the round table,
                                will also be taken into consideration.

potash production and water protection




                                         recommendation of the round table
                                         at its final meeting held on 9 february 2010, the round table recommended that, start-
                                         ing from 2020 at the latest, the discharge of saline waste water into the werra and its
                                         injection underground be discontinued completely and a long-distance pipeline to the
                                         north sea be implemented. however, it did not provide an answer to the question of
                                         how this should be achieved on the basis of the jointly defined decision-making criteria.


                                         prerequisites for the construction of the pipeline unfulfilled
                                         we doubt that the prerequisites for the construction and operation of a pipeline, accord-
                                         ing to the test criteria defined collectively between the round table and the federal states
                                         of hesse and thuringia, are clarified, although the recommendation of the round table
                                         suggests they are. the recommendation also does not take into consideration the deci-
                                         sion made by the lower saxonian state parliament against the construction of a pipeline.
                                         thus, the necessary political consensus does not exist. furthermore, the round table has
                                         ignored issues of economic appropriateness and the ability of the pipeline to be financed.
                                         finally, the question also remains open of whether, as a result of the construction of a
                                         pipeline, the aims of the eu water framework directive can be fulfilled, in spite of the
                                         many other different burdens on the werra/weser water system.


                                         we cannot agree to a goal the prerequisites for which do not exist according to current
                                         knowledge. it is rather necessary to achieve a balanced compromise between ecolog-
                                         ical improvements, economic requirements and social obligations. unfortunately, the
                                         round table has not achieved this.


                                         water protection has to examine all factors impacting the werra
                                         regardless of setting priorities in relation to the possibilities of reducing the salt load
                                         in the werra and weser, the round table should also examine the other adverse effects
                                         on bodies of water. if the round table continues its work after having made its recom-
                                         mendation, we will also pursue our cooperation and make further efforts to examine the
                                         issue of water protection as a whole. because the decline in salt contamination during
                                         the last decade has directed attention towards further sources of contamination: high
                                         nutrient contents (phosphorous and nitrogen), structural deficits due to riverbank
                                         straightening and barrages and insufficiently treated waste water. for the future, it will
                                         therefore be necessary to develop packages of measures which take all contamination
                                         caused by mankind into equal consideration.

                                   agreement on a package of measures
                                   in order to achieve the challenging goals by 2015 and implement the individual measures
                                   in good time, it is necessary to agree the ipm with the federal states of hesse and
                                   thuringia in a timely manner. already in the first half of 2010, we want to prepare and
                                   submit the necessary applications for approval of the projects in unterbreizbach and
                                   hattorf. thus already in 2012, together with the savings already achieved today, about
                                   90 % of the planned reductions in saline waste water can be achieved.


                                   applying for an integral water law permit
                                   the current permits for discharge into the werra expire at the end of 2012. the permit for
                                   injection and recovery expires on 30 november 2011. the public law agreement provides
                                   for the permits granted so far to be replaced by a longer-term, integral water law permit.
                                   this should also provide the necessary investment security for the package of measures.
                                   we will ensure that we comply with the objectives and deadlines of the water framework
                                   directive for the achievement of a good ecological state.

                                                 our chilean subsidiary spl operates with a very low level of energy consumption: the salt

                                                 no evaporated salt is produced. in brazil, salt is obtained by vaporising seawater through

                                international leader in energy efficiency
                                six of the seven potash plants have their own power stations, which are equipped with
                                state-of-the-art cogeneration technology. at the neuhof-ellers and zielitz sites as well
                                as at the werra verbund plant, caloric value technology is also used. thanks to successful
                                optimisation measures, utilisation levels for our power stations exceed 90 % in the mean-
                                time. our sites are therefore operating close to the theoretically attainable level of energy
                                efficiency, so that, given the current state of technology, even further capital expenditure
                                could hardly yield additional tangible reductions in emissions.


                                in 2009, we further improved the energy efficiency of the evaporated salt facility at the
                                bernburg site as well as of the saltworks at the borth site.

                                in future, we want to further cut our co2 emissions by utilising the waste heat given
                                off by non-production processes. in november 2009, the energy group e.on put a waste
                                heating plant in heringen into operation following a trial phase lasting several months.
                                this facility, functioning as a cogeneration plant in combination with the power plant
                                at the werra site of wintershall, will take over an important part of the energy supply
                                for the site. in comparison to the previous use of natural gas, we will therefore achieve
                                a reduction in co2 emissions of about 150,000 tonnes per year. this corresponds to 58 %
                                of the emissions of the wintershall site and 13 % of the entire emissions of german
                                potash plants.

                                                 of processed crude salt to 29.4 kg per tonne. this corresponds to a reduction of 68 %. by

                                emissions trading
                                reduction of greenhouse gases is the goal
                                emissions trading is one of the instruments envisaged by the 1997 kyoto protocol for
                                reducing greenhouse gases. the european system for trading in emission certificates
                                entered into force in 2005. companies that emit more co2 than has been allocated to
                                them can choose whether to invest in projects to reduce emissions or to buy emission
                                certificates on the market.


                                first trading period completed
                                the eu commission has drawn conclusions from the practice of the first trading period
                                (2005 to 2007). the european emissions trading system was developed further, and the
                                allocation rules for the subsequent trading period (2008 to 2012) were simplified. how-
                                ever, the allocation volume has also been reduced.


                                second trading period started
                                the second trading period for emissions trading started in january 2008. 16 facilities*
                                of the k+s group continue to be obliged to engage in emissions trading. however, by
                                granting emission rights in accordance with the benchmark system, the energy effi-
                                ciency of the individual facilities is not fully taken into consideration in germany. instead,
                                plants in the energy sector are assigned a “flat-rate” percentage reduction obligation.
                                this particularly affects efficient industrial energy production facilities, such as our power
                                plants, which already have an efficiency level of over 90 % thanks to cogeneration. applied
                                in this way, emissions trading lacks the desired steering effect and results in unjustified
                                higher costs.


                                third trading period in preparation
                                currently, the eu commission is preparing the framework conditions for the third trad-
                                ing period (2013-2020). an eu emissions trading directive was already issued in december
                                2008 in relation to this. at this point in time, the complete content has not yet been
                                finalised, but we assume that the fulfilment of the ambitious eu climate protection goals
                                will present a major challenge for the european industry and therefore for k+s too. it
                                remains to be seen how, following the failed un climate summit in copenhagen, the sub-

                                           at the sites belonging to k+s kali gmbh, we pile up solid production residues arising
                                           mainly from the use of esta technology. we are aware of the fact that the use of land

                                           we compensate for these unavoidable impairments by means of a variety of measures
                                           intended to conserve nature and maintain the wide variety of species. moreover, we carry
                                           out various projects for covering tailings piles with the objective of reducing pile waste
                                           water. already since 1983, we have, for example, been pursuing a greening programme for
                                           tailings piles in cooperation with the university of kassel. after they have been covered

                                             of salt, the surface of this tailings pile consists of the low-soluble gypsum mineral
                                             anhydrite, which contains hardly any rock salt. it is also planned to create a secondary
                                             biotope on the site. the goal is to landscape at least 60 % of the tailings pile’s surface
                                             by 2010.

                                             be trialled. however, it is hardly to be expected that the large tailings piles could be
                                             covered extensively in the foreseeable future.


                                           compensatory measures for extensions of tailings piles
                                           in germany, compensatory measures are a fixed component of the approval decision
                                           for the extension of a tailings pile and are coordinated with the nature conservation
                                           authorities. associations for nature conservation also have the possibility of proposing
                                           projects to the authorities. the following principle applies: a larger area close to nature
                                           has to be recreated by compensatory measures than that which is lost by construction

                                            with the aim of carrying out the aftercare of inactive plants in a structured way. the
                                            costs for this total over € 120 million so far. the program covers 28 disused sites in lower

                                            further use. if no reasonable subsequent use of the mines is possible, we are under an

                                            we have succeeded in harmonising economic, ecological and social aspects: a company
                                            belonging to the mars group decided in 1993 to shift the entire catsan production to
                                            salzdetfurth after it had previously only obtained a raw material from there. since 1995,
                                            a further company has moved to the plant site, which produces an intermediate product
                                            for cat litter.

                                        salt extraction in the chilean desert
                                        our chilean subsidiary spl mines salt in one of the world’s driest regions, the tarapacá
                                        desert. of course, our k+s environmental standards also apply there. after a mining
                                        area has ceased to be used, we remove all the technology and any waste deposits and
                                        secure the edges of the mine by levelling the differences in height; complete filling is
                                        not necessary. recultivation plays a secondary role in this region since flora and fauna
                                        barely exist in the mining area.


                                        recultivation and nature conservation at morton salt will be covered in the 2010 report.


                                        peat extraction and renaturation
                                        essentially, in germany, peat extraction is only allowed in areas already used by people.
                                        when extracting peat for compo’s potting soil production, after dewatering, we relocate
                                        the soil and the special seeds it contains that was on top of the peat. after the peat has
                                        been extracted, the moorland is returned to its natural state. this involves re-spreading
                                        the stored soil, re-moistening the areas and thus creating the conditions for natural re-
                                        generation. this renaturation is monitored by experts from the relevant authorities and is
                                        subject to scientific examination. as a result, the flora and fauna typical of undisturbed
                                        highmoor soon flourishes. in particular, rare species of animals and plants return that are
                                        often no longer found in these areas before peat was extracted. the renaturation meas-
                                        ures comply with the eu conservation of wild birds directive and the flora/fauna/habitat
                                        directive. the renatured areas also form part of the european “natura 2000” system of
                                        protected habitats.


                                        moreover, in germany and france, compo supports research projects with the goal of
                                        finding substitute products for natural peat. one alternative could be sphagnum, which
                                        as a wetland plant is the main constituent of peat, and another the use of composted
                                        bark or plant waste.

                                in 2009, direct capital expenditure on environmental protection amounted to € 18.4 million.
                                in comparison to the previous year, this represents a decrease of 8 %. although the sum
                                total of capital expenditure on the environment decreased against the previous year,

                                increased, in part significantly. operating expenses relating to environmental protection
                                decreased against the previous year by 5 % to € 111.1 million.

                                in 2009, we employed a total of 37 million tonnes of raw materials, 54,100 tonnes of
                                auxiliary materials and 24,600 tonnes of factory supplies at our sites.


                                of the raw materials employed, 35.9 million tonnes applied to crude salts and 1.1 million
                                tonnes to organic raw materials such as peat, soil and composts as well as mineral

                    recycled materials
                    in the framework of potting soil production at compo, approximately 39,000 tonnes of
                    compost were used last year.


                    at the sigmundshall site, we produce the smelting salt montanal for use in the second-
                    ary aluminium industry. the salt slag arising from the aluminium smelting process is
                    recycled and reutilised up to 100 % in the rekal facility. the recycling process provides
                    aluminium granulate, which is sold to the metallurgical industry, as well as the ferti-
                    lizers potassium chloride and ammonium sulphate, which we also market. we use a gas
                    mixture arising during the recycling process in potash production at the site as a sub-
                    stitute for natural gas. the tailings pile is covered with the remaining residue so that it
                    can then be landscaped.


                    energy consumption
                    in 2009, total energy consumption amounted to 5,029 gwh (previous year: 6,548 gwh).
                    specific energy consumption per tonne of product produced was 283 kwh/t (previous
                    year: 304 kwh/tonne of product). natural gas accounted for 4,371 gwh, heating oil for
                    8 gwh and outside electricity for 380 gwh. furthermore, for the first time, 268 gwh
                    of steam was obtained from the waste heating plant of e.on at the werra/wintershall
                    site. in absolute terms, there was a significant reduction in energy consumption, which
                    is attributable to restraint in the purchase of potash fertilizers. an additional factor is
                    the relatively higher proportion of rock salt in overall salt production in comparison to
                    evaporated salt as a consequence of higher sales volumes of de-icing salt. we have fed
                    52 gwh of electricity into the public network.


                    it has been possible to constantly reduce energy consumption per tonne of produced
                    goods in recent years. we have set ourselves the goal of decreasing specific energy con-
                    sumption to less than 270 kwh per tonne of goods by 2014.


                    however, due to the inclusion of morton salt into reporting on the fiscal year 2010, a
                    reassessment of the development of specific energy consumption is required.

                                of so2). the emissions per tonne of manufactured product were 87 g/t of no2 (previous
                                year: 84 g/t no2) and 2 g/t so2 of product (previous year: 2 g/t of so2 product). in com-
                                parison to the previous year, both in absolute terms and in terms of volume specificity
                                (except for no2), there was a decline in emissions of the respective pollutant. this de-
                                crease can mainly be attributed to the considerably lower sales of fertilizers in combina-
                                tion with a very large increase in sales of de-icing salt. because de-icing salt can be pro-
                                duced with far lower co2 emissions than can fertilizers, specific co2 emissions in 2009
                                were especially low. this special feature of 2009 will probably normalise again in the
                                coming years. due to the numerous prevailing uncertainties, we assume that co2 emissions
                                per tonne of product will not decline further by 2014, but may stabilise at around 50 kg.


                                however, due to the inclusion of morton salt into the reporting on the fiscal year 2010,
                                a reassessment of the development of specific co2 emissions is required.


                                in our cooling facilities, coolants are contained in a closed circuit, so that no substances
                                that deplete the ozone layer are released. we do not use any other substances that de-
                                plete the ozone layer.

                                               use of water
                                               in 2009, we used 76 million m3 of water (previous year: 104 million m3 of water). it was
                                               possible to reduce specific use of water from 4.8 m3/t to 4.3 m3/t. in the meantime, a
                                               level has been reached that comes very close to the process-related minimum of water
                                               consumption. measures intended to avoid and reduce the use of water have resulted
                                               in constantly declining water consumption. we want to continue to support and further
                                               this development and expect that, by 2014, a reduction to less than 4 m3 per tonne of
                                               goods, i. e. a further reduction by approx. 10 % will be possible. however, due to the in-

                                               in 2009, the quantity of saline waste water totalled 9.5 million m3 or 0.5 m3/tonne of
                                               product (previous year: 13.5 million m3 or 0.6 m3/tonne of product). of this, 7.5 million m3
                                               or 0.4 m3/tonne of product were discharged (previous year: 8.1 million m3 or 0.4 m3/tonne
further information regarding our package of
measures can be found on page 75 et seqq.      of product) and 2.0 million m3 or 0.1 m3/tonne of product injected (previous year:
                                               5.4 million m3 or 0.2 m3/tonne of product). the absolute amount has thus decreased sig-
                                               nificantly due to the lower production volume. the specific amounts have remained
                                               the same (discharge) or were further reduced (injection). provided that we implement

                                             in the potash industry, river water is almost exclusively used for cooling purposes. it is not
                                             chemically treated, but merely heated, after which it is channelled back into the surface
                                             water. if there is a surplus of rinse water, sewage and cleansing water that cannot be
                                             reutilised, it is discharged into the surface water in accordance with water law permits.


                                             reutilisation of waste
                                             all our sites generate waste that is subject to the german act on promoting closed sub-
                                             stance cycle waste management and ensuring environmentally compatible waste dis-
                                             posal [kreislaufwirtschafts- und abfallgesetz]. this waste is chiefly packaging material,
                                             scrap metal, used oil and grease, solvents and construction waste. a total of 72,000 tonnes
                                             of waste was generated in 2009, which corresponds to 4 kg of specific waste per tonne
the environmental balance sheet can be
found in the tabular appendix on page 132.   of product. of this amount, 68,800 tonnes were recycled, with construction waste almost
                                             completely recycled. 3,200 tonnes of waste were disposed of.


                                             over the five-year period starting from 2005, the specific quantity of waste did not dis-
                                             play a uniform trend, with volumes fluctuating between 2.1 kg/t and 4.0 kg/t. this can
                                             mainly be attributed to construction measures, which are executed independently of
                                             the products manufactured and discontinuously. insofar as capital expenditure and con-
                                             struction measures did not reach a particularly high level in 2014, we expect a specific
                                             occurrence of waste of 2.5 kg of ware per tonne of product.


                                             however, due to the inclusion of morton salt into reporting on the fiscal year 2010, a
                                             reassessment of the development of specific waste occurrence is required.

protecting our employees against work-related hazards and maintaining their
health has top priority at k+s. during his or her work, every employee has to
take on responsibility for safety – both their own and that of their colleagues.
our underground safety system also includes shift tokens – small metal plaques
with imprinted names. every miner is equipped with one. we are therefore able
at any time to identify who is still underground in the mine district and who has
already returned to the surface.

                                   our employees
                                      number of employees has risen significantly
                                      on 31 december 2009, the k+s group employed a total of 15,208 people. compared
                                      with the previous year (12,368 employees), the number has thus risen by 23 %. this is
                                      attributable to the acquisition of morton salt (2,933 employees).


                                      in the nitrogen fertilizers business segment, in 2009, we have merged the activities of
                                      fertiva with parts of compo’s professional business to create k+s nitrogen. this involved
                                      the transfer of 105 compo employees to k+s nitrogen. furthermore, in order to make
                                      the inevitable job losses (-145 employees) as socially acceptable as possible, we agreed
                                      with the employees’ representatives on a reconciliation of interests with a social plan,
                                      which provides, for example, offers of alternative jobs within the company and train-
                                      ing and qualification measures as well as financial help with moving and transfers or

                               in 2009, the personnel expenses of the k+s group were € 756.4 million and therefore
                               slightly above the level of the previous year (2008: € 738.5 million). savings connected
                               with short-time working were faced with the increase due to the initial consolidation of

                               € 83.7 million or just under 11 %).


                               in 2009, we paid a total of € 592.8 million in wages and salaries (+ 1 %) and € 146.5 million
                               in social security contributions (+ 1.9 %). the expenditure on company pensions and
                               support amounted to € 17.1 million in the year under review and was therefore, primarily
                               because of unscheduled payments of contributions to the pension insurance associa-
                               tion and to the basf pension fund, € 9.2 million above previous year’s level. during the
                               year under review, personnel expenses per employee amounted to € 57,989 (previous
                               year: € 60,463) and therefore decreased by about 4 %.


                               high proportion of male employees
                               as a result of the mining operations of the potash and magnesium products and salt
                               business segments, k+s has a large number of industrial employees working under-
                               ground. in germany, these positions were largely reserved for male employees until
                               31 july 2009, pursuant to legal regulations (sec. 64a of the german federal mining act).
                               these regulations have now been revoked by the legislator.


                               this complies with the efforts of k+s to interest more women in careers in technology.
                               starting in summer 2010, we will train the first female mining technologists.


                               the proportion of female employees in the k+s group is 10 % and, at those sites with
                               a greater number of administrative posts, 38 % on average. the share of women in man-
                               agement positions accounts for 5 %.


                               high level of loyalty towards the company
                               the turnover rate is the ratio of departures to the average staff level. it stands at about
                               4 %. the turnover based on handing in one’s own notice of termination is about 1 %.
                               the average length of service is 18 years. both document the high loyalty felt by employees
                               towards the company.


                               the average age of our employees is 43. due to demographic circumstances, we antici-
                               pate that in future, we will have an older workforce because the employment market
                               is providing fewer and fewer young people. through a demographic analysis, we want
                               to investigate the specific circumstances in our group in germany in more detail, and
                               derive measures from it that will secure the ability to work, qualifications and motivation
                                                                                                                                              s o c i a l r e sp o n s i b i l i t y

work safety




                                    we also promote the safety awareness of our employees through operation instructions
                                    and training at regular intervals. in cooperation with the professional association “roh-
                                    stoffe und chemische industrie” (bg rci), we are currently developing videos in which
                                    we explain the main causes of accidents at work and demonstrate exemplary behaviour.
                                    one of these films deals, for example, with the use of vehicles in potash and salt mining,
                                    which poses different challenges for our employees than does driving in normal traffic.


                                    targeted retrofitting of machines and vehicles
                                    last year, at the sites of k+s kali gmbh and esco, we started to retrofit all our all-terrain
                                    vehicles used underground with height and tilt limitation features. if accidents should
                                    occur, the occupants are now even better protected against injury.


                                    in 2009, in pilot projects in both the zielitz potash plant and at the borth rock salt plant,
                                    we equipped a diesel loader with a new system for reducing emissions. these so-called
                                    scrt systems not only filter the soot particles from the diesel engine fumes, but also re-
                                    duce gaseous pollutants. the nitric oxide emissions can thus be cut significantly and the
                                    air quality in the mine further improved.

                               accidents at work maintained at a low level
                               in 2009, we had to report 66 accidents at work at our european sites (previous year: 71).
                               the average number of working hours lost per accident at work was 171 (previous year:
                               253). at just under 35 %, most of the accidents involved so-called “mechanical impact”,
                               such as bruising and impact effects, followed by stumbles, sprains and slips, which ac-
                               counted for 15 %. the number of accidents that occurred on the way to and from work
                               fell from 27 to 23. we reported one accident involving employees of external companies
                               (previous year: 8).


                               the analysis of these accidents shows that many of them are attributable to behaviour
                               on the part of employees that is not sufficiently safety-oriented. here, we will taking coun-
                               termeasures more intensively in 2010.


                               in 2009, the “accidents at work per one million working hours” key ratio in relation
                               to all european sites was 4.3 (previous year: 4.1). the increase is attributable to the lower
                               number of hours worked as a result of short-time working.

                               at spl in chile, we reported 16 accidents, which is 3.6 accidents at work per one million
                               hours worked. spl is thus significantly below the average of the chilean industry (7.0). it is
                               for this reason that, in november 2009, the company received an award from the chilean

                               of ideas and facts with our colleagues.


                               internal audits provide greater safety
                               since 2005, we have, through internal audits, been examining the effectiveness of meas-
                               ures regarding environmental protection and work safety at our european sites. the audits
                               provide sites with the certainty that all binding statutory provisions are being complied
                               with and guarantee that employees are receiving a high level of protection from work-
                               related dangers. the production sites are being audited in a 3-year cycle. in 2009, we
                               carried this out at 11 sites and did not identify any violations of law or internal standards.
                               of the 47 sites currently covered, 17 have already been audited twice. for 2010, 14 audits
                               are planned.

                                               – bgm) has developed into a permanent element of the corporate culture
                                               of k+s, with a large number of activities being carried out at individual
                               sites. with a sustainable company health management, we ensure that our employees

                               networking is the assessment of offers and measures at individual sites. the working

                               the body works closely together with company doctors, works councils and experts on
                               addiction issues as well as health insurance funds and professional associations.

                               acceptance and promotion throughout all levels of the hierarchy are equally important:

                               by offering corresponding training programmes, we will boost awareness of ergonomic

                               readiness to change one’s behaviour.


                               in the medium term, we want to demonstrate the effectiveness and positive impact
                               of the health management system with evaluation tools and suitable figures. because
                               transparent communication increases the success of our work.


                               our fields of action
                               1. preventative occupational medicine
                               in occupational medicine, mandatory check-ups are an important instrument for the
                               early detection of health defects and for minimising the risk of vocational diseases and
                               work-related health risks. our internal company preventative medicine goes far beyond
                               the statutory check-up requirements. in 2009, physicians have carried out 9,071 check-
                               ups; of these, 8,616 disclosed no health symptoms that could affect the activity at the
                               workplace. in 391 cases, no health concerns have been declared assuming certain pre-
                               mises. the doctors issued “limited health clearance” to 23 employees. and in 33 cases,
                               they diagnosed chronic health problems and in 8 cases, no final assessment has yet been
                               made. the medical reports on the check-ups disclosed above-average good results com-
                               pared to other mining companies and the remaining trade and industry.


                               in 2008*, we recorded 81 suspected cases of vocational diseases for potash and rock salt
                               mining as well as salt works. of these, 5 new pension cases were recognised. in compa-
                               rison to the total number of suspected cases in mining in 2008 (3,559), this shows that
                               in mining, the risk of work-related illness is relatively low. as far as the recognised voca-
                               tional diseases are concerned, in most cases, these were illnesses of the musculoskeletal
                               system and hearing problems.


                               no health impairments resulting from dme and nitric oxides
                               within the framework of a 10-year study, k+s physicians conducted 60,000 preventative
                               check-ups in germany, at which people’s lungs were examined for substances having
                               a toxic effect. in the underground mining of potash and rock salt, diesel motor emissions
                               (dme), nitric oxides (no and no2) and carbon monoxide (co) may become relevant,
                               as they are released as a result of employing explosives to extract crude salts. no lung
                               diseases causally related to underground activity were identified during these regular
                               preventative check-ups. our research findings are confirmed by the institut für gefahr-
                               stoff-forschung (institute for dangerous substance research), operated by the
                               mining professional association.

                               * suspected cases of a vocational disease can be reported for 2009 until the end of february 2010; final figures
                                 for 2009 are not available until may 2010.

                                    campaigns and thematic information events on subjects ranging from cancer prevention
                                    through nutritional advice to anti-smoking programmes as well as information on the
                                    prevention and treatment of back pain have become established. a number of sites offer
                                    courses on movement and nutrition as well as relaxation and stress management tech-
                                    niques, which are promoted by the health insurance funds within the framework of pre-

                                    in 2009, severely handicapped employees accounted for 7.4 % of the workforce. we are
                                    thus far above the german national average. in close cooperation with the relevant au-
                                    thorities and our representatives for severely handicapped persons, we create workplaces
                                    adapted for handicapped persons, thus fostering the integration of these employees.
                                    we support employees in overcoming their inability to work and prevent new cases of

                                    according to statistics, the proportion of employees with alcohol and other addiction
                                    problems in production and service companies is between 5 % and 10 %. this is an issue
                                    that k+s also has to address. we have issued a ban on addictive drugs and implemented
                                    binding regulations on how to deal with those employees affected in the workplace. we
                                    focus on the concept of prevention: we emphasise education, responsible action, and
                                    providing support and assistance. we want to remove the taboos and look at it to counter
                                    dependency problems at an early stage and, above all, consequently. an important role
                                    is played by our experts on addiction issues at our sites. as voluntary persons in a position
                                    of trust and as contact persons, they offer information and support. they have been

                           flexible working hour models
                                 working hours in the k+s group are based on the particular national circumstances.
                                 the average working hours of our employees in germany and in the united states are
                                 40 hours a week. while our employees in france work an average of 35 hours a week,
                                 the weekly working hours in chile are 45 and in brazil 44 hours.


                                 our working hour models are oriented towards the requirements of production flows
                                 and are characterised by a high level of flexibility. the production sites work in one-, two-
                                 or three-shift operation as well as in fully continuous shift systems (three shifts per day;
                                 seven days a week). employees at the production sites of esco and compo (a total of 6 %
                                 of our workforce) have annual working time accounts, so that we are able to react with
                                 flexibility to the seasonal peak demand. employees earn working time credits in the
                                 months with high production, which they can then consume out of season.


                                 short-time working secures employment

management culture




                                      in 2009, the overtime ratio of 0.4 % at our german sites was far lower than during the
                                      previous year (1.6 %), due to a decline in sales volumes. across the group, the overtime
                                      ratio was 1.3 %.


                                      working time honour system, part-time work and parenting absences
                                      approximately 9 % of our workforce – all non-pay-scale employees in germany as well
                                      as employees working under collective bargaining agreements in kassel, mannheim and
                                      hanover, together with those at the k+s research institute in heringen – enjoy a work-
                                      ing time honour system. this working hour model is orientated towards the actual volume
                                      of work done and strengthens the employees’ sense of personal responsibility. moreover,
                                      it makes it easier to combine professional and family life and leisure time, respectively.


                                      at present, about 2 % of our employees are working part-time. this relatively low rate is
                                      due to the fact that predominantly women take advantage of part-time work, but women
                                      only make up 10 % of the entire workforce.


                                      since the introduction of the new parenting absence regulations in germany we have
                                      observed, that employees who use them are already back at work on average after one
                                      year. more fathers are also choosing to benefit from parenting absences. we welcome
                                      this development and support our employees with family-friendly measures, such as in-
                                      dividual part-time working models, additional release periods possible for cases when
                                      employees have to provide urgently needed care, further education available to employ-

                                            promotion of reintegration at spl and morton salt
                                            to promote the reintegration of mothers into their profession, companies in chile and
                                            brazil with more than 20 female employees are obliged either to organise a nursery
                                            system within their companies or to finance the attendance of employees’ children at
                                            state-approved nurseries for two years. spl has decided on the financing of external
                                            nursery places at all sites and additionally bears the transport costs to and from the
                                            nursery.


                                            as private schools with flexible care options are very widespread in chile, but school
                                            fees are a heavy burden on many families, spl bears part of the matriculation fees of the
                                            children of employees.


                                            beyond the legal requirements, morton salt promotes the swift reintegration of young
                                            mothers by offering them flexible working hours, compressed working weeks or telework-

                                             as an annual average, we employ 276 people within the framework of temporary em-
                                            ployment. in comparison to the previous year (on average 425 temporary employees),
                                            this is a significant decline, which is attributable to the sales volume situation in the
                                            potash and magnesium products business segment. within the framework of temporary
                                            employment, k+s works exclusively with temporary employment companies that apply
                                            the collective bargaining agreements of the temporary employment sector (gz, bza and
                                            ig bce). the remuneration practice is based on the above-mentioned collective agree-

                                            our management structure is based on mutual trust. we want to actively shape change
                                            and support our employees, but also present them with challenges. we are convinced
                                            that the diversity of our employees is a factor in our commercial success. nobody is given

                                             new management guidelines
                                             in 2009, we resolved new management guidelines and communicated them to the en-
                                             tire group. they form the basis for our personnel development processes and show the
                                             k+s group’s understanding of management. we assume that our managers implement
                                             these guidelines consistently, live them and measure themselves by them. all employees
                                             can expect to be managed in accordance with the guidelines.

                                             morton salt has established promotional and qualification programmes specifically for
                                             women with the goal of recognising the potential of a new generation of female em-
                                             ployees early on and increasing the proportion of female managers in the company over
                                             the long term. moreover, morton salt supports organisations like the “network of
                                             executive women“ and “society of women engineers“, which are dedicated to the pro-
                                             fessional promotion of women. in 2008, morton salt hosted the national “women’s

                         participation in the company’s success and pension provisions
                               variable remuneration system
                               we want our employees to think and act in an entrepreneurial manner. we can achieve
                               this by also enabling them to participate materially in the company’s success. in this way,
                               we strengthen their interest in commercial success as well as in the share performance
                               and increase their loyalty to our company in the long term. our remuneration system in
                               germany therefore consists of three components:
                                  ay-scale wages or fixed salary
                               n p
                                  rofit participation in the form of variable remuneration
                               n p
                               n s tock ownership through employee shares


                               our variable remuneration system also contributes to the reduction of risk in the event
                               of temporary declines in earnings, as personnel expenditure is to some extent automa-
                               tically adjusted to the results of the company. we regard the flexibility that we have
                               thus gained as indispensable, since we are interested both in economic efficiency and
                               the sociopolitical responsibility arising from the jobs we provide.


                               variable remuneration for employees covered by collective pay agreements is paid in
                               two instalments: the first part is paid in november of the current year, and the second
                               in april of the following year, once the annual financial statements are available. the
                               amount of the second part depends on the success of the k+s group and of the respec-
                               tive business segment.


                               we reward non-pay-scale employees in accordance with a remuneration system which
                               takes into consideration not only the success of the company, but also personal per-
                               formance in relation to agreed objectives. in an annual interview, employees and super-
                               visors evaluate the objectives and work results that have been achieved, look at the
                               prospects of vocational advancement and promotion and agree on the objectives for the
                               following year.


                               the remuneration systems of our foreign companies correspond to the respective national
                               regulations. however, across the group, k+s defines minimum standards in relation to
                               the amount and adjustment of remuneration as well as to participation in the company’s
                               success. positions which correspond to the german non-pay-scale sector are paid in
                               accordance with the german principle.


                               demand for employee shares
                               in 2009, we again offered the employees of our german companies employee shares
                               on attractive terms. of all employees, 50 % have taken advantage of the offer and 295,959
                               shares were issued. the total value of these measures amounted to € 5.0 million (includ-
                               ing the employer’s share of the social security contributions).
                                                                                                                                             s o c i a l r e sp o n s i b i l i t y

participation in the company’s success and pension provisions




                                             already in 2008, we introduced a share option model for the managing directors of our
                                             foreign companies. an employee share ownership programme for all employees of our

                                             company pensions information campaign
                                             we cannot make up for the gradual reduction in the statutory basic retirement pension,
                                             but we support our employees actively in securing their standard of living in old age by
                                             offering various possibilities for individual provision under our company pension scheme.


                                             in 2009, we continued our campaign regarding the company pension scheme, during
                                             which we presented not only our various offers, but also the legal and demographic facts.
                                             the response to our events and the participation rates indicate that there is growing
                                             awareness of the necessity of providing for oneself. it is precisely the younger employees
                                             who are more concerned with their pensions than was the case in the past. they have
                                             realized that additional safeguards are necessary to guarantee a reasonable standard of
                                             living in old age.

                               since 2000, we have been offering our older employees subsidised semi-retirement em-
                               ployment. in the so-called block model, employees are in full-time employment in the
                               first half, and are released from the obligation to work in the second half. employees are
                               thus able to retire up to three years earlier. their vacated posts are preferably filled by
                               young people who have received training from the company. within the framework of

                               is subsidised by the employment agency (agentur für arbeit). the employment agency
                               has granted a total of € 25.3 million in grants, of which € 5.4 million in 2009. a total of

                               pension provision at morton salt
                               the retirement plan programme of morton salt consists of a defined contribution
                               pension savings plan, which is predominantly financed by the employee and subsidised
                               by the employer. additionally, morton salt offers a purely employer-financed, defined
                               contribution plan. participation in these plans is possible for non-pay-scale employees
                               (comparable to germany). those employed under collective bargaining agreements
                               (similar to germany) in the united states can also pay into the employer-financed pension
                               savings plan and receive corresponding subsidies. furthermore, those employed under
                               collective agreements (similar to germany) are offered a performance-based company
                               pension. however, the gradual transition to a defined contribution pension savings plan
                               is also being aimed for in this case.

                                            for k+s, vocational training is an important investment into the future – also in the light
                                            of demographic change. our training activities are also part of our social responsibilities

                                            as at 31 december 2009, 639 young people in germany were being trained with k+s
                                            at 15 sites and in 17 apprentice professions in preparation for their careers. the train-
                                            ing ratio at the end of the year was thus 6.3 % (previous year: 6.0 %). in total, we have
                                            invested € 13.5 million in training (previous year: € 12.6 million). the increase results
                                            from the higher number of trainees as well as higher trainee remuneration under collec-

                                            in the commercial and chemical occupations, the number of female and male trainees
                                            is balanced. the ratio of male trainees is higher in the industrial-technical and it profes-

                                            a permanent position if they have performed well. in recent years, we have taken on
                                            90 % of our trainees.


                                            we are only describing our german education system here, since a dual education is
                                            hardly widespread in our foreign sites.


                                            arousing interest at an early stage
                                            traditionally, our sites maintain good contact with the schools in their locality. in 2009,
                                            we developed a new concept for recruitment and early education, which is intended to
                                            support children and young people in their professional orientation and develop enthu-
                                            siasm for careers in the natural sciences/technology. by means of lectures, professional
                                            information days and further training for teachers we want to arouse the interest of
                                            pupils in k+s at the earliest stage possible and simultaneously convey a clear picture of
                                            the apprentice professions offered and of the associated requirements.


                                            we also promote an improved teaching of the natural sciences and champion a higher
                                            level of practical relevance. thus, for example, in cooperation with the werratalschule
                                            in heringen, k+s offers a dual qualification consisting of the abitur (german high school
                                            diploma) and cta training (chemical-technical assistant) as well as a researcher class
                                            for pupils starting from the fifth form, which is sponsored by k+s.

                                 versations has, in some cases, doubled. we presented ourselves at 12 university fairs
                                 in 2009.

                                 particular engineers, technicians and project managers, we need fewer staff for 2010.

                                            as a result of the growing internationalisation of the company and ever more complex
                                            tasks, the demands on our employees are constantly increasing. in particular, we prepare
                                            our managers systematically for international tasks.


                                            by seconding employees to foreign group companies, we deliberately promote cooper-

                                            the specialist and intercultural skills of our employees. the majority of secondments are
                                            currently still from germany to foreign subsidiaries. in future, we also want to increase
                                            the number of secondments from abroad to germany.

                                  good prospects for industrial employees
                                  we provide promising employees from the technical, mining and production areas with
                                  training as a technician or a more advanced qualification which brings with it the pros-
                                  pect of a management career. our main partner is the technical college for economy
                                  and technology (fachschule für wirtschaft und technik – fwt) in clausthal-zellerfeld.
                                  at present, 80 employees are completing the first year of their technical training.


                                  increase in employee qualifications
                                  in the annual or employee interviews, employees and their superiors jointly determine
                                  further training requirements. in addition to further education measures required by
                                  law, the k+s group also offers occupation-specific, occupation-transcending, as well as
                                  it and language training. employees receive direct support for new and complex tasks
                                  by means of process-accompanying training measures.


                                  in 2009, 6,977 employees completed measures leading to qualifications (previous year:
                                  5,550 participants). thus, the average number of training hours per year and per employee
                                  was 10.8 hours (non-pay-scale: 23.81 hours, pay-scale: 9.6 hours).
                                                                                                                                                s o c i a l r e sp o n s i b i l i t y

training, further training and promotion of new talent
exchange of know-how and experience




                                            by centrally organising further training, we can systematically and economically put into
                                            practice locationwide measures leading to qualifications. the costs for further training
                                            amounted to about € 7.0 million (previous year: € 6.2 million). a decisive factor in the re-
                                            newed increase in further education costs is the higher number of participants and the
                                            new modular management training structure.

                                            we not only support new talent but also our experienced employees, in order to expand
                                            their know-how throughout their whole professional life. thus, last year, more than 50 %
                                            of the participants in further education measures were over the age of 40.

                               systematically record, utilise and secure the knowledge that exists within the company.

                               since march 2010, we give our employees the opportunity to submit ideas and sugges-
                               tions for improvements from home via the internet. we will, of course, also try to again
                               increase the participation rate through increased teamwork within the framework of
                               cultivating good communications.

co-determination




                   co-determination
                      for us, co-determination means involving employees in important decisions early on.
                      because we are convinced that informed employees are better motivated and more ready
                      to share the consequences of difficult decisions which will therefore be implemented
                      more quickly and, above all, more efficiently. co-determination promotes and presents
                      a challenge for taking on responsibility, not only in the short term, but also in the medi-
                      um and long term.


                      at k+s in germany, corporate co-determination is represented by 21 elected works councils
                      with a total of 170 members. instead of individual collective works councils, a “potash
                      and salt” joint collective works council represents the interests of the employees of
                      k+s aktiengesellschaft, k+s kali gmbh, k+s entsorgung, k+s it-services, ktg and
                      esco. the highest-level body for worker representation is the group works council. the
                      “potash and salt” and compo collective works councils as well as the works council of
                      k+s nitrogen are represented in it. the work of the group and collective works councils
                      is supported by eight committees.


                      high level of organisation of employees
                      in the k+s group, the relationship between the company and the works councils as well
                      as with the bergbau, chemie, energie trade union (ig bce) is marked by long-standing
                      cooperation built on trust. approximately 85 % of our employees in germany are members
                      of trade unions.


                      at our sites outside germany too, the workers’ representatives have consultation, infor-
                      mation and advisory rights in financial and organisational matters as well as co-deter-
                      mination rights in relation to social issues. in chile, a large number of small trade unions
                      exist, which negotiate jointly with the company. approximately 50 % of our chilean spl
                      employees are members of trade unions. the employees of morton salt are represented
                      by nine different trade unions based in the united states, canada and in the bahamas.
                      about two thirds of the employees are unionised.

                                            work of the works councils in 2009
                                            in 2009, the work of the works councils in germany was characterised by successful
                                            efforts to retain jobs in the potash and magnesium products business segment, in spite
                                            of slow sales volumes of potash fertilizers. this was achieved mainly through short-time
                                            working. in these difficult times, the trusting cooperation between the works councils,

responsibility in the supply chain




                                     responsibility in the supply chain
                                        the relationships with our service providers are characterised by open and fair dealings.
                                        we expect our suppliers and transport service providers to comply with human rights
                                        and internationally recognised core labour standards professed by the ilo (international
                                        labour organisation). we also make enquiries regarding safety and environmental
                                        standards.


                                        when placing orders, we cannot exclusively restrict ourselves to regional suppliers. how-
                                        ever, due to logistical advantages and a precise knowledge of our requirements and
                                        facilities, regional suppliers with which we have been cooperating as partners for a period
                                        of years are well able to hold their own in competition with supra-national suppliers.
                                        95 % of our contractual partners come from oecd states* (organisation for economic
                                        cooperation and development).


                                        high real net output ratio
                                        potash and rock salt mining is characterised by a very high real net output ratio. we pro-
                                        cess the natural raw materials extracted by us with different separation processes to
                                        create a wide range of products. thus only a small proportion of the purchasing volume
                                        is materials that are used in our production processes and our products. in 2009, k+s
                                        purchased raw materials and supplies, technical goods and services for a total of about
                                        € 1.6 billion.


                                        optimal utilisation of transport carriers
                                        the k+s group shipped 36.6 million tonnes of goods in 2009. as a result of weak sales
                                        volumes in the potash and magnesium products business segment, the transport volume
                                        declined about 10 % in 2009. this particularly impacted on transports by rail and ship,
                                        since fertilizers are frequently transported by water and rail to wholesalers, interim
                                        storage sites or to the hamburg “kalikai”. we exploit all means of transport optimally,
                                        taking advantage of their individual benefits.


                                        it is not only we as a contractor who profit from this, but equally our customers and our
                                        partners in the logistics sector. as far as possible, we transfer shipments from the road to
                                        the more environmentally friendly rail and waterways. the successful logistics concepts
                                        “baltic train” (rail) and “börde container feeder“ (inland waterway ship) from the
                                        container services business sector of our logistics subsidiary ktg serve as examples of this.


                                        we not only train our own employees in loading safety, but also place an emphasis on
                                        well trained drivers for our partner freight forwarders. in 2009, we had to record two
                                        lorry transport accidents. these did not involve any injuries to persons or damage to the
                                        environment.

                                           systematic selection of suppliers
                                           we involve all partners in the supply chain in our systematic selection of suppliers. our
                                           it-based supplier evaluation system is transparent, can be used worldwide, and forms
                                           the basis for decision-making on which we build long-lasting and low-risk partnerships.
                                           on the basis of defined criteria, we evaluate the entire procurement process, from the
                                           enquiry through delivery of the goods or services to billing, parallel to actual processing.
                                           if this ever results in a negative evaluation, those involved in purchasing are also imme-
                                           diately informed. we can therefore implement measures promptly and, if necessary, ter-
                                           minate existing contracts.


                                           about 6 % of our suppliers are classified as strategically important and are audited by
                                           us on a regular basis. a service (goods or services) is regarded by us as strategically im-
                                           portant, if it is essential to the value creation process and can simultaneously only be
                                           provided by few suppliers. in 2009, six suppliers were audited.


                                           transparent electronic invitations to tender
                                           at an early stage, we realised that procurement via the internet will be a key factor in
                                           shaping the purchasing business in the future; already in 2000, we developed the first
                                           electronic processes. transport services for inland waterway vessels and lorries are also
                                           put out to tender online in a transparent process at www.emaks.de. our purchasing

                                           development partnerships
                                                                                                                                                                 s o c i a l r e sp o n s i b i l i t y




                                           we maintain development partnerships with some suppliers, above all in the area of
                                           special purpose machine engineering. for example, we are constantly further develop-
                                           ing the lhd machines for underground operations together with ghh, in order to adapt
                                           them to changed deposit conditions.

                                        securing freight capacity in the long term
                                        the securing of freight capacity in the long term is of strategic importance to us. during
                                        the past year, we revised our concept for the systematic assessment of logistics service
                                        providers, in order to also implement it globally. on the basis of this service provider eval-
                                        uation, we want to generate a ranking in future, which will take into consideration relia-
                                        bility and quality (100 % each), pricing (75 %) as well as social and environmental aspects.


                                        internationalisation forges progress
                                        the further internationalisation of our company also involves challenges for logistics.
                                        in the past year, we critically examined and reorganised our european logistics structure.
                                        in 2010, we will examine the logistics structures in north america. our goal is to iden-
                                        tify and implement synergies in procurement and logistics as well as further improving
                                        the logistics flows between chile, brazil and north america.


                                     social commitment
                                        social commitment is an important part of our corporate culture, anchored in our code
                                        of conduct, and is reflected in our everyday actions. we are aware of our responsibilities
                                        as an important employer in regions that partially suffer from structural weakness.
                                        we live in good neighbourhood with our site communities and want to make a positive
                                        contribution to social development in our environment. we place great value on our
                                        funds being used efficiently and in a targeted way and come to precise agreements with
                                        those responsible for projects. the main focuses of our commitment are sport, society,
                                        art and culture as well as science.


                                        donations and sponsoring
                                        in accordance with our guidelines, we make donations for scientific and charitable pur-

                                        in relation to commercial or official decisions is prohibited at k+s. our employees are
                                        also instructed to keep their private interests strictly separate from those of the company.

                                            examples of our social commitment in 2009:


                                            sponsorship of sport for young people
                                            k+s is a committed promoter of sport for young people. we provide sportswear to the
                                            young members of sporting clubs located in the vicinity of our sites – a visible sign of
                                            the close relationship between k+s and the communities from which our employees
                                            come. in 2009, we supported about 50 youth teams.


                                            “salt worldwide”
                                            in 2009, esco and k+s supported the “salt worldwide” project of the german salt

                                            museum in lüneburg. this globally unique salt table was presented to the public for the
                                            first time in 2010. the world’s salt deposits and salt production sites are presented on
                                            an interactive world map. when the visitor touches selected sites, a projection starts with
                                            images and texts relating to the site, its history and its special features. special presen-
                                            tation modes permit different levels of information and modes of presentation according
                                            to the needs of the respective target group.


                                            children for north hesse
                                            on the initiative of the newspaper “hessisch-niedersächsische allgemeine”, together
                                            with other companies and institutions, we called into being the fund-raising campaign
                                            “children for north hesse” in kassel in november 2007. this initiative is intended to
                                            particularly benefit children who live in difficult social and economic circumstances.
                                            we want to improve the general conditions for disadvantaged children, so that they can
                                            better concentrate on their lessons at school. the more children in north hesse benefit
                                            and are thus enabled to take responsibility for shaping their own futures, the better the
                                            chances of strengthening this region. in 2009, within the framework of the initiative,
                                            we supported the children’s farm of a kassel primary school. the pedagogical work of the
                                            farm includes feeding animals and gardening.


                                            werratalschule researcher class
                                            ever fewer school leavers decide on a course of study in the natural sciences or on a career
                                            as an engineer. with a variety of offers, such as the cta (chemical-technical assistant)
                                            training in cooperation with k+s (see report 2007, p. 109), the werratalschule in heringen
                                            wants to work against this trend and improve the level of teaching of natural sciences.
                                            since the start of the 2008/2009 school year, it has been offering a researcher class for
                                            pupils starting from the fifth form, which is sponsored by k+s. the aim is to develop en-
                                            thusiasm for these subjects in pupils at an age when they can still approach issues in the
                                            natural sciences unselfconsciously, through playful experimentation. ideally, the pupils
                                            will retain their scientific curiosity right into the higher forms and, in the sixth form, will

social commitment




                    mannheim children’s home
                    already in 2008, k+s nitrogen adopted st. joseph home for children and young people
                    in mannheim/käfertal. moreover, in 2009, k+s nitrogen made it possible for children
                    from st. joseph to stay at a nature and adventure farm in the odenwald, a central
                    german uplands.

                    cultures and continents can still be viewed at kassel’s natural history museum for
                    sepulchral culture. k+s sponsored the exhibition, which is interesting both in terms of
                    natural history and the history of art. in europe, the special exhibition will be presented at
                    only four venues, with the exhibits then going to the famous field museum in chicago.


                    bad hersfeld festival
                    in 2009, k+s kali gmbh began a multi-annual cultural partnership with the bad hersfeld
                    festival. the stage attracts about 100,000 visitors to the town each year in the summer
                    and is mentioned in one breath along with salzburg and bayreuth. in july 2009, a guest
                    performance of the bad hersfeld festival took place at the merkers adventure mine for
                    the first time.


                    further projects
                    all sites regularly support schools, associations and charitable institutions in their vicinity.
                    moreover, in 2009, the projects we were involved in included the “kassel museum night”,
                    the “children’s culture programme”, the “louis spohr museum“, the “kassel music
                    days”, the “german language cultural award”, the “kassel-göttingen children’s
                    hospice service” as well as the “saddle festival” of the kassel regional council and the
                    “kassel marathon”.

                               august 2009. more than 4,500 people from the surrounding area used the opportunity
                               to explore the site and were often surprised to learn that a fertilizer factory with an an-

                               was shown in a plant chronicle created especially for the anniversary.


                               open day at the sigmundshall plant
                               in june 2009, the sigmundshall potash plant invited local residents to its open day. more
                               than 5,000 visitors accepted the invitation to spend a day looking behind the scenes of
                               an important employer in the region west of hanover. the tailings pile, which can be seen
                               from far, held a particular fascination for many. on that day, the tailings pile plateau at
                               an altitude of 175 metres could be visited by minibus.


                               private art
                               for the second time, we organised guided tours for those visitors with an interest in art
                               at our kassel site. our small collection of artworks consists of 70 paintings, prints, litho-
                               graphs and woodcuts by 13 artists, predominantly from the region. the event was held
                               as part of the corporate art collection days organised by the state of hesse’s ministries of

gri guidelines




                 appendix
                 gri guidelines
                    the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri) are internationally recognised
                    guid­ing principles for sustainability reporting. they propose reporting principles and
                    specific contents designed to increase the comparability of company reports and im-
                    prove the quality and the accuracy of reports. although these guidelines are applicable
                    to all companies, they cannot take into account the specific requirements of individual
                    industry sectors such as the fertilizer and salt industry. therefore, although we have
                    aligned our reports with the guidelines as far as possible, we have in addition included
                    aspects in our reporting that are of particular relevance for the k+s group.
