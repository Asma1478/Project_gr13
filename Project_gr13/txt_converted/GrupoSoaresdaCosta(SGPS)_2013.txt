      triates). more information about the characterization of the human resources is available in the “social responsibility” chapter.

        the reporting scope of these indicators is grupo soares da costa, s.g.p.s., s.a., including ongoing projects, fixed units (offices, shipyards
      and central support unit in madeira island), fleet and travels (air and rail) in portugal, excluding ace’s. it is not shown the value of energy con-
      sumption for 2010 as only from 2011 it was possible to differentiate the consumption of soares da costa subcontractors hired. the inclusion of
      this value (including subcontractors’s consumption) would lead to an incorrect evolutionary reading. more information about the environmental
      performance is available in the “environmental responsibility” chapter.

to lead to an imbalance between the number of male

costa group are permanent members of staff (from
the range of employees with contract in portugal,
only 3.92% have term contracts and 99.94% are

construction activities oftentimes imply the exis-

employees, due to the type, location and duration of
projects.
