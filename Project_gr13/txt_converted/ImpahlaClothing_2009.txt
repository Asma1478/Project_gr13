“this is the second sustainability report of imphala and we at gri consider this a great achievement.
this shows impahla’s commitment to bring the sustainability agenda in a practical way to the every-
day life of the company. their management systems were improved and several concrete issues were
addressed because of the way they have implemented the sustainability reporting process, already
during the previous reporting cycle in 2007.

the gri was pleased to assist in the development of impahla’s first sustainability report in 2007
through our ‘transparency in the supply chain’ initiative. throughout the process we were frequently
challenged by the fact that impahla is one of the smallest companies ever to produce a sustainability
report, which forced us to consider the appropriateness of our g3 guidelines as well as the relevance
of the process of reporting.

through the example set by impahla, among other small companies, we have become confident that
the g3 guidelines can be effectively applied in a manner that assists smaller companies improve their
sustainability outlook. we are delighted that we can once again see how impahla is pressing forward
to become a benchmark for implementation of reporting processes for smaller companies throughout
the world. we hope they will keep this path.“

introduction by the managing director
spring romance properties 34 (pty) limited, trading as impahla clothing
(hereafter, ‘impahla’), is a privately owned cape town based clothing
manufacturing company.
with more than r5 million, but less than r35million, in annual turnover, we classify
as a ‘qualifying small enterprise’ (qse) as per the department of trade and industry’s
‘codes of good practice for broad-based black economic empowerment’ (hereafter,
‘the bb-bee codes’). as such, we are a very small company, operating without the
luxuries of our larger peers, with large marketing, communications and/or sustainability
departments, and thus must rely on ourselves – as a 3-person management team – to
operate all aspects of our business.

our primary production activity is the manufacturing of apparel items, including the
provision of in-house branding services (embroidery, screen printing and heat transfers).
our garment manufacturing activities are supported by the provision of branding
services for garments produced by other manufacturers.

this is our second annual sustainability report, following the path that impahla
proudly embarked on in 2007 as a south african supplier of puma ag, a world-class
apparel company operating primarily in the sporting arena. with support from puma,
the global reporting initiative (gri) and the german government’s international
development agency (the gtz), impahla underwent a lengthy process of formalising
our understanding of ‘corporate responsibility’ and the sustainability reporting process.
although we always believed that we were an ‘employer of choice’, a ‘supplier of
choice’, and a ‘good corporate citizen’, we hadn’t previously invested in developing
systems to measure our sustainability performance, nor to produce a report that could
identify our strengths and weaknesses as a member of the global environment in which
we operate.

granted, our personal interests have always been reflected in our company, just as our
company has created a mechanism for each of us to have a significant impact on the
quality of lives of others. while we believe that our collective commitment to being
good citizens, on a personal basis, permeates all that we do as a company, we allowed
the lessons learned from our first sustainability reporting process to assist us better
understanding how we can apply the concept of being a ‘good corporate citizen’ to
improve impahla’: economically, socially and in terms of our impacts on our physical/
natural environment.

in producing our first sustainability report, we learned the following:

• that management systems – including basic information management tools such as
  excel – could help us identify and manage issues before they become problems;

• that statistical performance and human resource data can be a powerful tool in
  improving our overall efficiency as a supplier to clients with strict timing and quality
  requirements;

• that engaging with a variety of key stakeholders can often provide us with tips on
  how to further improve our business operations and/or to boost employee morale;

• that our ability to demonstrate commitment to key sustainability principles –
  including the use of environmentally-friendly dyes, and improvements in energy
  efficiency – is important not only to us, but also to our key clients; and,

• that monitoring our performance on an ongoing basis – not just at the end of
  the year during the reporting process – saves us money, makes us more efficient,
  and helps identify employee concerns before they have a negative impact on
  absenteeism and/or turnover.

moreover, the reporting process identified ways in which our management systems
could become more efficient, being mindful of the fact that impahla is a small company
that is actively managed by the ownership team. in doing so, we proved that the
sustainability reporting process – not just the end product – allows us an opportunity
to constantly monitor all of our most material issues, thereby creating mechanisms for
ensuring that our service to clients is managed effectively.

                                   in 2008 our sustainability reporting process has allowed us an opportunity to:

                                   p report a 15.8% increase in the number of garments manufactured, and a 26.3%
                                     increase in the number of non-manufactured garments that were branded in-house

                                   p report a 40% decrease in the amount of electricity we consume per garment
                                     manufactured

                                   p report first time export of products outside south africa (22 237 garments, or 12.7%
                                     of our total production)

                                   p achieve carbon neutrality through our very first carbon footprint assessment

                                   o identify a 13.02% increase in late arrivals from 1.45% in 2007 to 1.63% in 2008
      at impahla, each of our
                                   o identify a 21.8% increase in absenteeism, from 2.17% in 2007 to 2.64% in 2008

     on’ operational role in the   o identify a 21% increase in the purchase of non-south african fabric (polyester)
      running of the business      o identify an untenable increase in the number of non-lost time injuries (from 1 in
                                     2007 to 16 in 2008)

                                   at impahla, each of our directors plays a key ‘hands on’ operational role in the running
                                   of the business, including all aspects of our product design, daily production, ordering
                                   and shipping processes. thus we need to stress that producing a sustainability report
                                   is a relatively expensive venture, both in terms of time and cash costs for printing. as
                                   such, and with the gracious support of our pro bono consultant (michael h. rea), we
                                   have developed a reporting process that is as lean as possible, and while we may not
                                   have included all of the information you, the reader, require, we trust that we have
                                   made the best effort possible in our particular circumstances.

                                   the primary goal of this report is to offer our many stakeholders an opportunity to better
                                   understand who we are as a company, as a team of individuals and as a proudly south
                                   african manufacturer of clothing. the following pages provide a summary of our ‘most
                                   material issues’, including a discussion of how we believe we have been doing thus far
                                   and how we hope to improve in the future.


4                                   gri g3: 2.8, 2.10, 3.2, 4.13, la7

this is impahla’s second report, and while the reporting period under question is limited
to the 2008 calendar year (cy 2008) we have attempted to include data for the last 3
of the 4 years of our operations as impahla. where possible, trend analyses have been
conducted for all available data on a month-by month basis.

our operations exist only in south africa, although our largest clients (puma, adidas
and new balance) are international companies based outside our boundaries. prior
to 2008, 100% of our sales were directed to the south african subsidiaries of our main
clients. however, 2008 heralded our first opportunity to export products to austria,
chile, france, germany, indonesia, japan, singapore, switzerland, turkey, the uk and
the us, as a proud supplier to puma’s involvement in the global ‘peace one day’
project. all of our other clients are based in south africa, as are most of our principle
suppliers of machinery, fabric and all other input materials.

in developing this report we have once again followed the gri’s g3 guidelines , opting
this year to seek application level b+, and have taken into consideration comments and
advice from a variety of stakeholders, most importantly our largest client – puma – and
the association of chartered certified accountants (acca), but also the cape clothing
association, our unions, our suppliers and our employees (each of whom received a
copy of the report). moreover, we have adopted the accountability principles standard
(2008) and have sought moderate level type assurance from trialogue, in accordance
with accountability’s aa1000as (2008).

moreover, we have raised the reporting bar within impahla by seeking a carbon footprint
assessment from the folks at carbon calculated: a cape town based consultancy that
excels in the provision of carbon footprint assessments and off-set strategies.

through our ongoing process of engagement with puma we sought advice on
a number of key sustainability issues, and have done our best to incorporate their
recommendations, not least of which is the shift our branding department has made to
using only environmentally-friendly water-based cht inks.

by participating in the acca awards for sustainability reporting, we were able to learn
a number of key lessons both from the judging panel, as well as from other companies
who produce their own sustainability reports, particularly with respect to ensuring that
we provide a balanced accounting of our social and environmental performance, not
just the good news we want to tell people.

thus far, the feedback from our 2007 sustainability report has been very positive,
albeit limited in quantity. however, the greatest lesson that we learned from our last
report was that the report itself is merely an output of the systems and processes we
have put in place to help manage our business more effectively. the value is therefore
not in the report itself, but in the positive changes that we have been able to achieve
through paying closer attention to what we thought were non-core business activities.

it is important to note that the clothing manufacturing industry in south africa, particularly
in the western cape where impahla is located, has been under constant threat of collapse
over the past few years. as such, we believe that in order for impahla to continue to
survive the ongoing turbulence within our industry, we must be perpetually vigilant in
ensuring that our sustainability is secure. in analysing our company data and developing
this report, as well as ensuring that our service to all of our clients, regardless of size or
international status, continues to exceed their expectations, we believe that impahla will
continue to succeed as a well-respected, growing, and sustainable business.

at this time, it is my hope, as well as that of my co-owners and many team members,
that you will find value in the information we have compiled on your behalf, and we
hope that you will contact us should you have any questions or comments about this
report. as you will see in the coming pages, this report tells the story of one small
company that is driven to excellence fuelled by the collective passion and commitment
of a vibrant and talented team. we are an african company that is owned by africans,
operated by africans: able and ready to compete in a global market.

sincerely,

                                             since we first started in 2004, impahla has been a proud supplier of garments to
                                             puma, levis, adidas and new balance, all of which are among the world’s most
                                             recognised and respected companies. we recognise that as a condition of our ongoing
                                             relationship with such well known companies, we must consistently adhere to strict
                                             controls over quality, timeliness of deliveries, as well as environmental and health and
                                             safety concerns. as such, impahla has undergone a number of contractor compliance
                                             audits from these companies, with puma offering the most comprehensive feedback
                                             on how well we meet their expectations.

                                             it’s important to note that these audits, or site inspections of our production facilities,
                                             have been, and continue to be, extremely helpful sources of process improvement

 results from these audits, including
 puma’s safe audits (right), have been a
 helpful benchmark of our performance in
 social, environmental and safety areas.


                                             on close inspection of our audit results, we have found that while we continue to excel
                                             in the social and health & safety aspects of puma’s audits, we still have significant
                                             room for improvement in our environmental performance. these findings are extremely
                                             helpful when comparing our own internal assumptions and conclusions about our
                                             performance with what we consider to be the ‘reality’ of our progress.

                                             although no safe audits, or contractor compliance audits from other customers, were
                                             conducted in 2008, impahla undertook to further bolster our performance according to
                                             client expectations, and it is our hope that through enhanced environmental and safety
                                             processes, we will continue to rate very highly during compliance audits.

                                             focusing mainly on international customers like puma, impahla has geared its
                                             operations to the highest of international standards, and has been successfully awarded
                                             puma’s contractor compliance “a” status, being one of the first factories in africa to
                                             achieve this honour. in reaching this pinnacle of success, puma further rewarded
                                             impahla’s hard work by nominating the company to become a world cat strategic
                                             supplier, the first company to be given this status in africa.


                                              puma’s world cat strategic partner
                                              a brief explanation from arne etzold of world cat south africa
                                              the strategic partner concept (spc) is a partnership that strives to create a long-
                                              term win-win situation for both the supplier and the puma brand.

                                              from the supplier side, reliability, commitment to puma and compliance of the
                                              strategic partner with puma´s business key elements form the base of our business
                                              relationship and the spc.

                                              in exchange for these things, puma gives a clear commitment to the strategic partner
                                              regarding allocation of production and, if required, technical- or other support.

                                              by mutually recognising the reciprocated commitment, puma and impahla have
                                              entered into an agreement that we hope will sustain long-term support for the puma
                                              brand and that will contribute significantly to satisfy our customers who expect for
                                              customers who choose to produce top quality products made in africa by africans.

decrease in non-puma sales. with puma dominating our orders (over 91%), we
recognise that we are running the risk of falling into an ‘all eggs in one basket’ dilemma.
however, after much internal discussion and debate impahla decided that the increased
risk is manageable based on the assurances puma has offered through the strategic
partner concept. guarantees of production orders, as well as assurances that decreased
demand will be forecast and communicated to us early enough to control impacts, are
deemed sufficient enough to reduce any short and/or long-term negative impacts that
one might associate with becoming a sole source supplier to one brand.

production efficiency, as measured by the time used to complete garments in comparison
to the total time available, continued to be extremely high in 2008 although there was
a slight average decrease from 78% in 2007 to 77% in 2008. it is our best guess that
this decrease was due to a number of factors including a significant increase in staff
turnover and a shift to more complicated garment designs.

                                  more importantly, we have been able to increase our average number of garments produced
                                  per person day, where our total number of ‘person days’ includes our entire staff complement
                                  (down to 88 at the end of december, from a high of 98 at the end of january). although our
                                  efficiency target for garments per person day remains set at 10 units, our team only managed
                                  to increase the monthly average from 7.3 in 2007* to 8.2 in 2008 (up 12.3%).

marketing and procurement
as a small manufacturing company we do not have a marketing department,
but rely completely on our brand-conscious clients to keep us apprised
of their evolving requirements. the likes of puma (our principal client,
accounting for more than 90% of our sales), adidas and new balance all
have highly sophisticated market research and analysis teams to assess where
their products should be heading to meet new consumer trends.

however, our 2008 sales of garments requiring complex fabrics currently unavailable
in south africa led to a sharp increase in our foreign procurement. 48% of the polyester
we used in 2008 was purchased from taiwan, representing 21.5% of all fabric used.
meanwhile 100% of all of the buttons we used for puma garments were purchased
from hong kong.

in line with our commitment to environmental awareness, all of the cotton we procure
is guaranteed to have no less than a 5% organic content, while all heat transfer and
screen printing inks meet puma’s strict environmental standards (water-based, pvc-
free cht inks that are certified as ‘environmentally friendly’). meanwhile, all of the
plastic bags used for packaging garments (203 716 ‘poly bags’) and all of the corrugated
cartons used for shipping (1 981 boxes) are made from recycled materials.

to further improve our efficiencies, impahla implemented a ‘just in time’ (jit) procurement
system that has been well-supported by our suppliers. this system ensures that we do not
need to retain significant warehouse stocks of fabric and accessories, while ensuring that
all materials are readily available from suppliers as and when required.

although we are mindful of our size, and thus the relative smallness of our orders from
big suppliers, we are nonetheless pleased to note that while our influence may not
impact the social and/or environmental responsibility of our main suppliers, we are
able to report that at least one of our suppliers is also taking the issue of sustainability
very seriously. coats, our principal thread supplier, has supplied the impahla team
with evidence of their social and environmental stewardship, through the provision
of documents outlining their ‘worldwide employment standards’ and ‘worldwide
environmental policy’. these documents, printed on recycled paper, encourage us not
only to continue sourcing from coats, but also to ensure that our policies are formalised
in similar documents for future display and distribution.

in 2004, when the cape town t-shirt company was purchased, the company
consisted of approximately 60 employees, of which every employee was
given the opportunity to come across to impahla. although all 60 employees
initially made the decision to join the new company, some decided to move
to new opportunities within the first few months.
in the first year of our operations as impahla, some of the workers taken over from the
previous owners were clearly unsettled by the transition to new owners. in year 1,
we observed a net loss of 11.4% of the total workforce, with 20 of the 26 departures
(29.5%) resulting from workers leaving the company of their own accord (either a
‘resignation’ or an ‘abscond’: where a worker simply fails to return to work). for those
that chose to remain with the company, rewards have come in many forms, of which
secure wages, non-standard benefits and internal promotion opportunities have been
recognised by our current team as reasons to remain within impahla.

we are pleased that as of the end of december 2008, our staff compliment of 88
employees still includes 25 of the pre-impahla employees at the heart of our current
team, including lena who continues to direct our production activities. sadly, 5 more
members of our original 2004 team left us in 2008, of which one was elizabeth de
wet (right) who retired. as our first retiree, the entire impahla team was pleased to
send her off with a farewell party, including a microwave oven as a small token of our
appreciation.

lena is our greatest success story of someone who has worked hard, starting from the
ground level, and who is now a part-owner of the business, and a critical link in the
success of impahla. she is a shining example of how, with opportunity, a competent
and committed individual will succeed, without the presence of forced empowerment
policies and procedures. although impahla complies fully with the employment equity
act of 1995 in our policies and procedures, we sincerely believe that our empowerment
strategy is based solely on aptitude, and that this strategy has been proven successful.

                                    we are equally proud of the fact that our empowerment credentials don’t end with
                                    lena. from the very beginning, our ownership team has been committed to ensuring
                                    that dedication to the company will be rewarded, and that the identification and
                                    placement of supervisors and managers will occur from within the production team,
                                    wherever reasonably possible. as such, we have been able to ensure that lena’s entire
                                    supervisory team (all ladies, 1 black and 4 coloured), and one of carl’s two branding
                                    supervisor-in-training (a coloured female), have been promoted from within and are all
                                    classified as ‘previously disadvantaged individuals’. not one of these individuals was a
                                    supervisor when impahla took over the business. one was a sorter in the cutting room,
                                    one was an embroidery operator, and the others were all machinists.

                                    our most recent promotion to supervisor-in-training level, merle, was identified from
                                    within the team of embroidery operators. we expect that this ongoing demonstration
                                    of commitment to our production staff will help reinforce our assertion that everyone
                                    has a chance to be promoted, and that every employee is valued.

                                    although these individuals – patricia, lydia, francis, christine, joyce, merle and
                                    mogamat – are classified in the south african context as ‘previously disadvantaged’,
                                    each of our promoted staff members has proven that they possess natural leadership
                                    qualities that are helpful to the success of our business.

                                    we believe that this approach is the fundamental key to impahla’s success, and it is
                                    at the heart of our vision and values. by empowering every worker, we ensure that
                                    while the management team receives orders and ensures delivery on time, the actual
                                    running of the shop is left entirely in the hands of people who have been promoted
                                    up from the shop floor, and who have the greatest influence over their colleagues and
                                    team members.

although sick leave continues to present itself as an ongoing management issue, our
team was successful in reducing our sick leave rate from 0.97% in 2007 to 0.70% in
2008. while our target remains 1.0% sick leave days taken, relative to the total number
of person days worked, our hope is to reduce the rate to better than our 2006 sick leave
rate: 0.69%.

while we continue to respect that workers need, and have the right, to take days off                                                                nobody really comes to

                                    machine operators (total absenteeism neither measured nor reported). secondly, we
                                    identified that our information management processes needed updating to record all
                                    incidents where employees are ‘absent without permission’, where ‘all’ refers to our
                                    entire employee pool, not just machine operators.

                                    as such, it should be duly noted that we might experience a significant change in
                                    absenteeism in 2009, due only to the changes in the way in which we monitor and
                                    manage our absenteeism rate.

                                    absenteeism, another indicator we identified as a significant problem during the
                                    development of our 2007 sustainability report, continues to be somewhat of a
                                    concern. while we once assumed that late arrivals did not materially impact our
                                    overall production, when we began to analyse the data we had been collecting, we
                                    found that more than 1% of our production was lost due to late arrivals.

unfortunately, and even though we began to make our employees aware of the fact that
late arrivals would be actively monitored and managed, our total late arrival rate rose
from 1.45% in 2007 to 1.63% in 2008. our worst months were august (2.13%) and
december (2.01%), with only april reaping a rate close to our target of 1.00% (1.03%                  if you want to do
for the month).                                                                                       something go for

goal being to decrease both absenteeism and late arrivals to less than 1.00% each.

it should be noted that as a truly african company, operating in a tremendously dynamic
multi-cultural environment, impahla does not permit any form of discrimination against
employees. we do not tolerate racism, sexual harassment, or the discrimination of
persons with any form of disability. we are very proud of the fact that our team is
made up of 88.6% females, and 95.5% non-whites: both key performance indicators
within the south african economy. however, we still have not had an opportunity to
employ persons with disabilities, although we would not hesitate to ensure that our
work environment accommodates for special needs, wherever reasonably possible.

our remuneration packages, including salary, bonuses and incentives, are above average
for our industry, and we are registered with industrial councils and all other statutory
bodies. wages are established by the national bargaining council, but impahla has
actively pursued bonus systems and other forms of non-financial reward.

for example, the entire management team was proud to participate in the south
african clothing and textiles worker’s union (sactwu) cape region’s ‘spring queen’
competition, hosting our own internal pageant and then supporting our team’s winner –
lydia – through the sactwu pageant process. while we initially participated thinking
that this would be ‘a fun thing to do’, we quickly realised that the development and
upliftment of team spirit that resulted from the pageant process was of significant benefit
to the overall employee satisfaction and productivity rates within the company.

                                                     impahla on a regular basis.

for impahla, ‘zero harm’ refers to the creation and maintenance of a work environment that is free from the potential for illness or
injury for our employees, our clients, and our neighbours within our business complex and the community of maitland. in our most
recent review hazard identification and risk assessment (hira), we identified the following potential risks and hazards:

 1.   minor     9 minor cuts and abrasions occurred in 2008, mostly resulting from the improper use of new/sharp trim scissors.
      cuts
                although we insist on the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (ppe) by all of our cutting room staff, the
                risk of injuries still exists, as wire mesh gloves cannot be effectively used in other areas where knives and scissors are
                used; particularly in our trim section.

 2.   slips &   4 injuries – 1 a lost time injury – resulted from slips and falls in 2008.
      falls
                although impahla prides itself on providing our team a clean and safe work environment, even our best efforts to
                avoid risks has not eliminated certain hazards altogether. meldine slipped coming down the steps from the lunch
                room and hurt her foot in january, resulting in a slight sprain being diagnosed, and resulting in 3 days of lost time.

                4 minor slip & fall injuries were recorded, mostly due to human error, including an incident where dolfie slipped on
                a banana peel in the lunch room and suffered a minor injury to his arm.

                the safety team is currently considering ways to mitigate the risks associated with slips & falls, and will be embarking
                on a hazards awareness campaign early in 2009.

 3.   needle    3 needle prick injuries were recorded in 2008, up from 1 in 2007.
      pricks
                the greatest risk when operating a sewing machine continues to be the potential to penetrate one’s finger with
                the needle.

                in the previous 4 years (2004 through 2007) impahla only suffered one such incident, with the first injury of its kind
                occurring in 2007. we attributed the low number of injuries to our use of needle guards on all of our machines, our
                concerted effort to educate our staff about the danger, and the role our supervisors play in ensuring that guards are not
                removed. however, it is clear that the risk of needle prick injuries continues to exist, and that the team must be mindful
                to remind machine operators of their responsibility to work safely.

4.   lifting      1 lifting-related sprain was recorded in 2008.
     sprains
                  the lifting of heavy bundles of fabric, the repetitive nature of specific tasks, and the need of some employees
                  to move about areas that could become cluttered creates a multi-faceted risk of sprain injuries.

                  supervisors are tasked with ensuring that employees are not operating in an unsafe or unhealthy manner,
                  but we accept that the nature of this risk is more difficult to monitor. as such, we rely on our weekly staff
                  meetings to remind employees of their responsibility to avoid behaviour that could place them in danger of a
                  sprain, as well as to ensure that their work environment remains clean and obstacle-free.


5.   burns        no such injuries occurred in 2008.

                  heated clothes irons, used for pressing garments during our finishing process, have always been an obvious
                  risk area, but no such injuries have been recorded at impahla. nonetheless, we remain committed to ensuring
                  that all of our employees are aware of the dangers and restricting access to the pressing area to ensure that
                  unnecessary personnel are not exposed to the risk.


6.   sunlight     no such injuries or complaints occurred in 2008.

                  when our new building was being designed, we took the decision to reduce our dependency on electrical
                  lighting and heating, and installed translucent roof panels to all natural light to illuminate and warm the
                  shop floor.

                  while this may have appeared to be a fault-free idea at the design stage, we quickly learned that too much
                  light could pose a hazard to our employees.

                  aside from the obvious exposure to sun-related cancers, our more immediate concern was eye strain and
                  potential heat stroke among our machinists.

                  as such, we have made large umbrellas available to any staff member wishing to be shielded from the
                  sunlight, and have created a means of allowing outside air into the building to create a form of natural
                  cooling, without compromising the overall security aspects of the factory.


7.   inhalation impahla uses low harm and environmentally friendly chemicals wherever possible in the various areas of
     of harmful operation in our business.
     dust and
     fumes      although no cases of fume-related illness have thus far been reported at impahla, we are mindful of the
                potential to cause harm where solvents, dyes and glues might be used.

                  as such, our new manufacturing facility was designed with specific attention to the provision of adequate
                  ventilation and air quality management. where task-specific higher risks persist, we ensure that face masks
                  and other ppe are used by all employees operating in the hazard area.


8.   inhalation   resulting from a note submitted via our employee complaints and suggestions box, we have ensured that
     of second-   non-smoking employees are not subject to the effects of second-hand smoke.
     hand
     smoke        smoking in common areas is not permitted, and any employee wishing to smoke must exit the building and
                  remain more than 5 metres from pedestrian access points.


9.   collisions   although we do not own and operate any motorised vehicles within our factory, our positioning within a
     with         busy business park continues to present a possible, if not probable risk of collisions between vehicles and
     moving       personnel.
     vehicles
                  as such, we continue to ensure that our entrance/exit procedures are maintained and enforced to ensure that
                  all of our employees arrive and leave our premises in a manner that will decrease their risk of collisions.

                  when deliveries or collections occur, access to motor vehicle pathways is tightly restricted to ensure that
                  unnecessary personnel do not pose a threat to either the vehicle operator or themselves.

10.   hiv/aids   hiv/aids is a massive problem for all of africa, particularly for those of us living and working in sub-saharan regions.

                 the hiv/aids pandemic will remain a sustainability risk factor to be closely monitored and managed for many
                 years to come, and impahla is committed to ensuring that our workforce is perpetually aware of their role in
                 protecting themselves, and their family members, from the disease.

                 to date, we are not officially aware of any employees who have been infected by hiv/aids, and to the best of our
                 knowledge our team has not suffered any hiv/aids-related deaths or illness-related employment terminations
                 (i.e., ‘medical boardings’). however, the relevant demographics suggest that impahla remains vulnerable to the
                 disease, and therefore must remain committed to addressing the risk.

                 although impahla’s employees come from a region of south africa that has a relatively low hiv-infection rate, we
                 are of the collective belief that each of us is susceptible to hiv/aids related risk factors. as such, and in mitigation
                 of our direct risk, impahla has instituted an hiv/aids programme which comprises of the following elements:

                 • policy guidelines with regard to recruitment, promotion and management of illness in the workplace,
                   including explicit mention of non-discrimination within our code of conduct;

                 • access to education and voluntary testing campaigns through the local union (south african clothing and
                   textile workers union, sactwu) and the national bargaining council;

                 • availability of free condoms in our restrooms.

                 although we have not conducted our own hiv/aids awareness campaigns, this issue has been addressed in one
                 or more of our monthly health & safety meetings, and we are committed to addressing this in the near future.
                 one area of particular focus for 2009 will be the re-instatement of poster campaigns that did not transfer across
                 to our new facilities in 2007. impahla is committed to working with the national bargaining council and our
                 unions to ensure an effective partnership in this regard in 2009.

                    process has somewhat abated, we remain ever-aware of our need to ensure that we act in a responsible manner:
                    shedding our own demand as much as possible.

                    the process of developing our sustainability reports has taught us the value of regularly evaluating our electricity
                    bills to determine if we are managing our electricity consumption in a manner that is both cost-effective and
                    environmentally sound. as such, we now use our monthly municipal rates and taxes bills to evaluate our average
                    electricity consumption per unit of production.

                      in analysing our data, we were pleasantly surprised to note that after experiencing a respectable 16.4%
                      decrease in electricity consumed per garment produced from 2006 to 2007, we were able to witness a
                      remarkable 40.3% decrease from 2007 to 2008. of course, we are cognisant of the fact that this stunning
                      decrease has not necessarily been something we actively planned, but must assume that this is the direct result
                      of improved efficiencies that were reaped through the move to our new premises. our challenge now is to
                      attempt to further reduce our electricity consumption per garment produced, although we predict that further
                      efficiencies will be very hard to identify and/or achieve.

2.      fuel          although extremely insignificant to most companies, impahla decided in 2008 to measure and monitor our
        consumption   total fuel consumption in an effort to get a better handle on the full scope of our greenhouse gas emissions.

                      for the full 12-month period, we consumed 1 695.4 litres of petrol in our delivery van and 1 010.4 litres of
                      diesel in our management vehicles (when used for business purposes).

3.      business      another way in which impahla has emitted greenhouse gases has been through business travel: particularly
        travel        flights. in 2008, 4 international and 2 domestic flights were taken by william as a result of our participation
                      in the gri’s ‘transparency in the supply chain’ project. three flights – two to germany and one to the
                      netherlands – were the direct result of the gri project, while a fourth trip – to germany – was the result of
                      puma’s wish to discuss the project with their stakeholders.

                      two trips to johannesburg were taken as a result of impahla’s involvement in the association of chartered
                      certified accountants’ reporting awards for sustainability reports.

                      no other business travel was recorded for the year.

4.      carbon        although we are a relatively small company, we believe it is within our scope of responsibility to monitor,
        footprint     manage and report on our total carbon footprint: the amount of carbon we emit into the atmosphere as a result
                      of our daily operations. as such we have determined that our total carbon emissions, in terms of carbon dioxide
                      equivalents – or co2e – is 175.89 tons, including:

                             electricity:   159.64 tons, based on our total consumption of 159 641 kwh.

                                   fuel: 6.59 tons, based on our total consumption of 1 010.4 litres of diesel and 1 695.4 litres of petrol.

                      air conditioning: 0 tons, as our air conditioners are cfc-free (noting that electricity consumption for air
                      		 conditioning is calculated in the total electricity consumption figure, above).

                       flights: 9.66 tons, based on 3 international flights to germany and 1 to the netherlands, plus two
                      		 domestic flights to johannesburg (from cape town).

                                  total:    175.89 tons of co2e, or 1.00 kilograms of co2e per garment produced.

                      while we believe that the process we employed to calculate our footprint is simplistic, we believe that is both a
                      fair reflection of our management capabilities at this time, as well as a fair reflection of our total carbon footprint:
                      with the exception of paper consumption in the patterning process (a process improvement for 2009).

                      with many thanks, our total carbon footprint has been calculated by alex hetherington of carboncalculated:
                      a cape town based small consultancy specialising in carbon footprint assessments and off-set strategies (alex@
                      carboncalculated.co.za).

                      working in partnership with food and trees for africa, carboncalculated assisted us with off-setting our carbon
                      emissions, and through the planting of 493 trees, has ensured that for the first time in south africa, impahla has
                      become a “carbon neutral” clothing manufacturer.

                      our goal now is to identify new and more cost-effective off-set solutions, while continuing to improve our
                      processes and monitoring systems to reduce our overall carbon efficiency below our new baseline of 1.00 kg
                      co2e / garment produced.

5.     water          south africa is widely considered to be a ‘water scarce economy’, in that access to reliable supplies of
                      potable water is not a given. as such, our water consumption, although relatively limited, is considered to be
                      an ongoing management concern at impahla.

                      unfortunately, through the process of developing this report, we identified that our water data management
                      processes were not as robust as we had previously assumed. in fact, we identified that the information
                      provided in last year’s report was no where near as accurate as we had asserted, and are without the ability
                      re-trace our data systems to identify the full scope of error.

                      moreover, we have identified that the water consumption figures provided by our landlords in monthly
                      rates and taxes billings appears to be significantly incorrect. over the year, we have paid for as much
                      as 948 kilolitres (kl) of water, yet can reasonably confirm that our actual consumption – based on an
                      extrapolation of eight months of accurate data – is roughly 581.3 kl. our hope is that we will be able to
                      rectify the over-billing problem, and recover the equivalent of a 63% over-payment for water.

                      nonetheless, we have used our monthly municipal rates and taxes bills to calculate our total water
                      consumption, and have evaluated this information relative to our total monthly production figures.

                      of course, our production is not water-dependent, and therefore trends and anomalies cannot necessarily
                      be correlated to fluctuations in our production efficiencies, but we feel that units of production is the most
                      effective tool that we can use to assess our water consumption efficiency. in doing so, we can compare
                      against one of our peer companies, and report that our water efficiency of 3.31 litres of water per garment
                      produced is 12.9% higher than suzi products (2.93 litres per garment).

                   water consumed                        units of                  litres per unit of                   peer
                    (kilolitres – ki)                   production                    production                     benchmark
2008                       581.3                          175 748                          3.31                            2.93


6.     non-           over the past few years we have noticed a significant increase in the amount of garbage that has been
       hazardous      disposed of in landfills. however, we attribute this informally observed increase in waste disposal as a direct
       waste          result of our significant increase in total garment production.

                      to-date, we do not have formal systems or processes in place to monitor and measure the volume (by weight)
                      of solid waste sent to landfills via our waste haulage contractors. however, we are committed to reducing
                      our overall volume of waste being sent for disposal at landfills.

                      as of now, we are already instituting the following mechanisms for reducing our solid waste disposal:

                      • using waste sorting bins to identify waste materials that can be sent for recycling, rather than disposed of
                        as general waste;

                      • recycling our waste paper and plastics through a partnership with oasis, a well-established ngo that
                        employs persons with mental disabilities to sort waste for selling back to paper and plastic recycling
                        companies such as mondi; and,

                      • although we have yet to find a viable partner, we intend to forward reasonably large pieces of scrap
                        material to an economic development project (or projects) that can make use of the fabric to manufacture
                        clothing and other items.

7.     hazardous      although limited in total volumes consumed and/or disposed of, hazardous materials are often used in our
       waste          manufacturing facilities, particularly in the maintenance and operation of our facilities and equipment.

                      because the total volumes are extremely low, we do not have formal systems or processes in place to monitor
                      and measure the volume of hazardous materials consumed throughout our operations,. however, we
                      continue to monitor the way which all solvents, lubricants and other hazardous materials are handled, stored
                      and disposed of.


       we commend impahla for their commitment to measuring their carbon footprint and the environmental
        impact of their small business and then choosing to contribute to greening and sustainable community
       development in south africa. we hope that more clothing, and other, companies will follow their lead so
              that we can move towards a lower carbon economy and a healthier planet in the future.

lessons learned through stakeholder engagement
                                    although impahla learned a lot about sustainability, sustainability
                                    reporting, and our business through the process of developing a gri-based
                                    sustainability report in 2008, the lessons learned did not end at the point
                                    of publishing our report. for us, the most important part of our reporting
                                    process was really about what we learned once we started sharing it with
                                    our key stakeholders, and with others who are more experienced about
                                    corporate governance issues.
                                    through what can only be considered ‘good fortune’, the physical printing of our 2007
                                    report was marked by a significant production error that the printing supplier took full
                                    responsibility for. although the misprinted report was still readable, it was not of a
                                    sufficient quality that impahla could share with external stakeholders. in kindness, the
                                    printer gave impahla the discarded copies (100), and we shared these with each of our
  i’ve been here 7 years and i      98 employees. in doing so, we learned the following from our employees:

     nothing wrong with this
                                    • our employees were very happy with being able to see their photos in print, and

friendly. it’s just that lena can
   be tough sometimes, when         • our ‘employee of month’ section was a source of great joy for the 11 employees
                                      who were included.
 she’s pushing for production.
                                    • our employees were more willing to inform the content of our 2008 report, based
                                      on the fact that they could see how the 2007 report was used.

                                    • our employees told us that they learned a great deal about impahla and its structures
                                      by reading the report.

                                    • the report also seemed to bring the management and staff closer together as
                                      personal experiences were shared and perceptions narrowed.

                                    because of our involvement in the gri’s ‘transparency in the supply chain’ project,
                                    in partnership with the gtz and puma, we had an opportunity to participate in
                                    conferences in the netherlands and germany, and learned the following lessons from
                                    conference participants:

                                    • at a total employee population of 98 people in 2007, impahla was one of the
                                      smallest organisations to ever produce a sustainability report, and respect was
                                      offered based on our decision to overcome our limited resource challenges while
                                      producing a meaningful report.

                                    • as part of ‘team puma south africa’ at the reporting conferences, it was clear that
                                      the example set by all three puma suppliers (vimal, suzi products and impahla) was
                                      one of ‘reasonability’: such that reporting does not need to be overly complicated,
                                      but rather a process that results in a report that is meaningful in the context of
                                      reasonable stakeholder and/or operating environment expectations.

                                    • the conferences illustrated how much effort is going into the sustainability reporting
                                      process, but how this does not filter down to small and medium companies in the
                                      likes of south africa.

                                    • the gri need to make it attractive and cost effective for small and medium sized
                                      companied to become involved.

having submitted our report to the association of chartered certified accountants
(acca) in south africa for consideration of their awards for sustainability reporting,
we not only received an award for ‘best newcomer, small enterprises’, but also learned
the following:

• in most respects, sustainability reporting still appears to be the exclusive domain
  of larger, more financially supported, listed corporations. however, the many
  participants and event attendees seemed to appreciate the reporting lessons that            it’s a pity puma doesn’t give
  could be offered by the likes of impahla and cotlands: a non-governmental hiv/                us stuff. we should have a
  aids charity operating throughout south africa.                                              factory shop where we can
• we realised the massive task that lies ahead for the likes of the gri and the acca,                  get a discount.
  to encourage other small and medium sized companies to report and to see the
  benefits of reporting.

• we appreciated how important it is, not just to produce a report, but to structure your
  business around being sustainable. window dressing to ‘green wash’ stakeholders
  being totally unacceptable.

having shared our report with the cape clothing association and the national bargaining
council for the textiles and clothing industry, we learned that:

• companies in our sector are battling to stay afloat, however, if they took the time to
  get involved in sustainability reporting they would realise that it is a survival tool
  in itself.

having shared our report with our bankers, suppliers and competitors, we learned that:

• they appreciated receiving a report which was so open and transparent.

• as with our employees, our report had the effect of bringing parties closer together.

as stated in last year’s sustainability report, the concept of ‘stakeholder engagement’
was somewhat foreign to us prior to the initiation of our sustainability reporting process.
while we were confident that we were perpetually in close ‘engagement’ with our key
stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers, associations, unions, and bargaining
councils – we did not have formal systems in place to monitor and/or manage our
stakeholder engagement. granted, we have come to understand that much of what we
do to ensure the ongoing productivity and profitability of our company can be construed
as ‘engagement’, but we are fundamentally willing to accept that our engagement
processes will remain ad hoc, with the exception of our customers, suppliers and
employees (including their unions and the nbc). our formal engagement includes:

• our weekly meetings between management and the employees and/or their
  representatives, to raise and discuss issues of importance to our employees. this
  includes their issues/concerns being presented to management, as well as the
  presentation of production results, safety briefings, and process or policy to the
  employees.

• regular meetings with customers to discuss new production trends, fabrics, designs
  and/or orders, as well as any issues or concerns that either party might have with
  the other.

human rights
                                as a small business, impahla has not necessarily been called upon to
                                investigate and/or ascribe to any international conventions regarding
                                human rights. however, as a south african company, we are both obliged
                                and committed to living up to our national constitution, and to respecting
                                all laws, including those pertaining to the fair treatment of employees.
                                impahla falls under the watchful eye of the national bargaining council for the clothing
                                industry, as well as sactwu, the south african clothing and textile workers union,
                                and we actively encourage and support employee participation in both of these rights
                                bodies. all of our non-management employees are members of the union, and are
                                paid according to wage packages as defined by their collective bargaining agreements
                                (above national and regional minimum wages). moreover, we aspire to meet or exceed
                                the bargaining council’s collective agreement rules, recognising that these rules are
                                merely base level guidelines, and that exceeding them, within reasonable limits, has
                                created a work environment that encourages reciprocal trust, respect and commitment
                                between management and our employees.

                                shop stewards are aware of the rules and they attend union meetings on behalf of
                                impahla. if any problems are raised by our workers, the stewards have the right, and
                                responsibility, to address them with the bargaining council or union, without being
                                victimised.

                                impahla does not hire child and/or forced labour, nor do we allow any of our suppliers
                                or sub-contractors to engage in these practices.

                                impahla’s security personnel are contracted through the business park in which we are
                                situated, and we have not been informed of any incidents of excessive use of force by
                                security personnel, nor would we be willing to allow such behaviour to persist in the
                                exercising of their duties on behalf of impahla.

dti codes of good practice
south africa’s department of trade and industry (dti) has launched the
dti codes of good practice: a set of business principles that are expected
to promote and develop corporate behaviour that meets international best
practice standards for corporate responsibility.
the codes came into full effect at the end of february 2008, and impahla sought and
obtained our first status assessment according to these codes. after a relatively quick
evaluation process, facilitated by the department of trade and industry’s online self-
assessment toolkit (http://bee.thedti.gov.za/webapp), we were able to determine that
impahla is a level 2 supplier, based on the following category scores:
 category                                       points
 ownership                                       5.99
 management control                             18.67
 employment equity                              27.00
                                                                                           sometimes it gets hot under the

 enterprise development                          0.00
 socio-economic development spend                0.00

as a level 2 supplier, we are able to offer our customers a significant bonus with
respect to their own preferential procurement scoring, in that they can weight impahla
purchases by a factor of 125%.

although we – as a qualifying small enterprise – do not necessarily need to score
well on all seven elements of the dti scorecard, and thus do not need to contribute
to enterprise development (ed) or socio-economic development (sed), we feel that it
would be unfair to report that we do not make any effort in these regards. on the ed
front, we proudly support and encourage oasis through our recycling programme, and
purchase many goods from very small local enterprises. on the sed front, while we
do not make charitable contributions to charities, per se, our support of oasis, as well
as the contributions we make to our employees, over and above their negotiated wages
and benefits, should constitute a form of sed spend, or corporate social investment.

impahla is committed to ensuring that we continuously strive to meet the requirements
of the dti codes of good practice wherever possible, and to ensuring that we continue
to provide our customers with the relevant certificates and supporting documentation.

the way forward
                                     this is the second time impahla has produced a sustainability report, and if
                                     not for the support and encouragement of our consultant (michael h. rea)
                                     we highly doubt we would have been able to generate such a comprehensive
                                     overview of our company, our most material issues, and our opportunities to
                                     improve our social, safety, environmental and economic performance.
                                     one must understand that as a small owner-operated business, our efforts have always
  i enjoy working here. the          been firmly invested in ensuring that our customers and employees are ‘happy’, and that
people are all nice. the other       our business remains financially strong and healthy. although we recognise that our
workers and the management           data management systems still require further improvement to assist us with maximising
                                     our efficiencies, we have nonetheless been able to improve our ability to find and
         are all nice.               analyse information for the purpose of informing a wide array of key stakeholders.

                                     in short, the process of developing our sustainability report continues to be a lengthy
                                     learning exercise, yet we accept that the process of reporting affords significant benefits
                                     in terms of being able to use statistics to evaluate our performance, including the
                                     conducting of comparisons, particularly with respect to issues that are directly related
                                     to our employees.

                                     this process has once again given us an opportunity to re-think our bonus structures to
                                     encourage full attendance and to motivate the employees to attend work regularly. it
                                     has also assisted us with attempting to identify problems within our business, as well as
                                     to find ways to address them.

                                     in speaking to our staff, michael helped us better understand the issues that they have
                                     apparently felt unable to bring to our attention, and has helped create mechanisms for
                                     addressing each of their concerns.

                                     as a direct result of our reporting procedures, we are committed to:

independent third party assurance statement
to the board and stakeholders of spring romance properties 34 (pty) ltd,
trading as impahla clothing (hereafter, ‘impahla’):
trialogue (pty) ltd was commissioned by impahla to provide independent third
party assurance over this 2008 sustainability report (the ‘report’), covering the
period 1 january to 31 december 2008. over the past twelve years, trialogue has
consulted to companies on their social, environmental and broader sustainability-
related responsibilities to society, has developed considerable experience in social
and environmental performance management and measurement systems, and has
conducted a number of sustainability-related assurance engagements for companies
in south africa.

independence
trialogue is independent from impahla, has an impartial relationship with the
company, and did not undertake any commissions for impahla during the reporting
period concerning reporting or data collection. trialogue was not responsible for the
preparation of any part of this report and our responsibility in performing our assurance
activities is to the management of impahla alone, in accordance with the terms of our
assurance engagement.

assurance objectives
to the best of our ability, this assurance engagement has been managed in accordance
with accountability’s aa1000as (2008) assurance standard, where the format of the
engagement was structured to meet the aa1000as type 1 (moderate) requirements.
one objective of the assurance process was, therefore, to provide impahla management
and stakeholders with an independent type 1 ‘moderate level assurance’ opinion on
whether the report meets the aa1000as (2008) principles of inclusivity, materiality
and responsiveness. a second objective was to assess the degree to which the report
is consistent with the global reporting initiative (gri) g3 guidelines, with the specific
purpose of establishing whether or not the report has met the b+ level of reporting
requirements.

scope of work performed
aa1000as (2008) compliance
the process used in arriving at this assurance statement was based on accountability’s
aa1000as (2008) guidance, as well as other best practices in sustainability reporting
assurance. our approach to assurance included the following:                                  i don’t like the no-smoking

it should be noted that this report was assessed at the point of data aggregation for
reporting. given that this is a type 1 (moderate) assurance engagement, the accuracy
of specific data within the report was not tested back to source. the analysis of data
accuracy was therefore limited to trend appraisal and assessments for reasonableness.

gri compliance
in determining the gri g3 ‘application level’ of the report, we performed the following
exercises:
• a review of the process used to define the content of the report by looking at
  materiality of issues included in the report; stakeholder engagement and responses
  to stakeholder issues identified; determination of sustainability context; and
  coverage of material issues;
• a review of the management approach in addressing topics discussed in the report;
  and,
• a comprehensive desk review of the report to confirm that the requisite number of
  gri performance indicators has been covered in the report.

                                   findings
                                   aa1000as (2008) – inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness
                                   within the parameters of a ‘moderate level type 1 assurance assessment’, the report
                                   appears to account accurately for impahla’s performance, and its sustainability reporting
                                   processes appear to be sound based on the aa1000as (2008) principles of inclusivity,
                                   materiality and responsiveness. it should be noted that:
                                   • impahla’s stakeholder engagement focuses on a number of key stakeholders broadly
                                     defined within the customer, employee and supplier groups. although the evidence
                                     suggests that impahla engages regularly with these most important stakeholder
                                     groups, there might be other groups that warrant more considered engagement.
                                   • knowledge about sustainability-related management and reporting rest with key
                                     individuals within the organisation and its consultancy. however, there is sufficient
                                     evidence to suggest that this knowledge is being transferred more broadly within
                                     the organisation, and that appropriate systems have been put in place to embed this
                                     knowledge.
                                   gri compliance
                                   based on our review of the report, as well as the processes used to collect and collate
                                   information covered in the report, we conclude that this report meets the gri g3’s
                                   requirements for application level b – which requires a number of standard disclosures
                                   relating to corporate profile and management approaches, as well as no fewer than
                                   20 core indicator disclosures, with at least one from each of economic, environment,
                                   human rights, labour, society and product responsibility. reported performance per
                                   gri indicator is identified in impahla’s gri indicator table. note that:
                                   • a number of the required gri disclosures, particularly those relating to management
                                     approach, were covered superficially in the report. these disclosures require either
                                     data quality improvements, or further detail in disclosure.

                                   • impahla must ensure that it does not become overly reliant on key individuals for
                                     its management of issues relating to inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness, but
                                     rather that knowledge and practice are transferred within the organisation.
                                   • there remains scope for impahla to improve its reporting according to the principles
                                     of inclusiveness, materiality, and responsiveness, as guided by aa 1000as (2008).
                                     based on continual improvement, impahla should ultimately aim for type 2 (high)
                                     levels of assurance in future reports.
                                   gri compliance
                                   impahla should build on the sound foundations and methodology it has established in
                                   respect of its sustainability reporting process and the range of issues it covers. to do so,
                                   it should focus, first, on further improvements in the level of detail and the quality of
                                   data provided for conformance with gri g3 application level b, before considering
                                   addressing the requirements of application level a.
                                   conclusions
                                   based on the information reviewed, trialogue is confident that a systematic process has
                                   been used to derive the information and data presented in this report, that it meets the
                                   aa1000as (2008) principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness, and that it
                                   provides a comprehensive and balanced account of the environmental, safety and social
                                   performance of impahla for the period under review. moreover, although the quality
                                   of reported information or data of some of the gri g3 indicators can be improved, this
                                   report appears to meet the gri g3’s requirements for application level b (b+ with this
                                   assurance engagement).

request for feedback
because this is only our second attempt at producing a sustainability
report, we are mindful of the possibility that we continue to fall short of the
reporting expectations of at least some of our key stakeholders. as such, we
are hopeful that you, the reader of this report, will contact us and offer us
your views on the quality and usefulness of this document.
should you have any questions about our company, or comments about anything contained
within this report, please contact william via email at william@impahla.co.za.




gri g3 application level requirements
unlike with our first report, impahla has this year decided to seek a b+
level of gri g3 application. the following tables provide a summary of the
gri’s requirements as well as a quick reference to our self-assessment of
compliance to the b+ level.
