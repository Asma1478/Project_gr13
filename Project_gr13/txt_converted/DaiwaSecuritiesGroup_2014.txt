verification of csr key issues and responses to
changing social requirements
the daiwa securities group recognizes that we are responsible, as a member of society, to various
stakeholders when selecting csr key issues. meanwhile, social requirements for companies may change
over time, and we need to constantly verify whether significant changes are occurring and whether our
key issues accommodate these changes.
  we believe social requirements for corporations from a wide range of stakeholders have become
increasingly diversified and thus more complex to reconcile and that it has become more important than
ever to take a balanced approach considering these diverse demands.
  in light of these circumstances, the daiwa securities group has actively participated in external csr
initiatives in japan and overseas and promoted activities that use various codes in order to identify
properly and respond to corporate csr trends. the following are the ones that we place a special
emphasis on among such codes:

environmental technologies and infrastructure more widely available. at the same time, we are working to establish
