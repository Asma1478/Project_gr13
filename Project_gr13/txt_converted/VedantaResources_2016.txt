working
together
growing
together

individually, one can take rapid strides, but together
we can take giant leaps. individually, one can achieve
unidimensional growth, but together we can pursue
well-rounded and sustainable development.
at vedanta, we believe that the outcome of working
collectively is always greater than the sum of its parts.
that is why, we rigorously practise the philosophy of
'working together, growing together'.
the three imperatives that govern our business approach
are conversation, collaboration and creation of shared value.
over the years, we have been meticulously building
symbiotic relationships with our stakeholders. this year
was no diﬀerent. we formed public-private partnerships
to mount high-impact community interventions,
collaborated with community to achieve greater goals,
worked hand-in-hand with our suppliers to enhance
their sustainability quotient and continued to ensure
fair value for our employees and shareholders.
we synergised strengths and interwove all facets
of the triple bottom line to create a strong fabric of
inclusive growth.

global context



the world, as we see it today, would not have been possible without leveraging the rich resources, nature has
bequeathed to us. the resources we bring to the market serve as building blocks of modern progress. iron ore
forms the bedrock of infrastructure; copper is used to connect people through telecommunications and in
lifesaving medical devices; and aluminium is used across a myriad of products. in addition, we generate
electricity that lights up the lives of millions and our crude oil is an essential component of thousands of
secondary products.


we keenly observe global megatrends with a view to contribute towards addressing global economic, social and environmental challenges and opportunities.
enumerated below are some of such global issues which need immediate attention and vedanta's contribution towards each of these issues.

we run our business with a high degree of transparency and advocate strict adherence to ethical standards in all stakeholder interactions. with operations in
multiple countries, a business that is built around diverse natural resources and a team drawn from several nationalities, we realise that we run a business of
great complexity. that is why, our board of directors emphasises on the importance of a robust governance framework that is both locally responsive and
internationally compliant. we have well-deﬁned reporting structures with clearly allocated responsibilities and responsive feedback mechanisms to ensure
that we operate transparently, eﬃciently and with integrity.
our board complies with the uk listing requirement according to which, at least half of the board, excluding the chairman, should comprise independent
non-executive directors. at the date of this report, the board includes eight members comprising three executive directors and ﬁve independent non-
executive directors. as a result, there are adequate safeguards for the protection of minority shareholder interests. the board comprises directorsfrom
diverse international backgrounds combined with a wide range of professional and sector-speciﬁc experience. this ensures that we have a balanced board
with the right skills and experience to contribute fully to eﬀective decision-making. the board is responsible to shareholders for ensuring that the company
is appropriately managed and achieves its objectives.

natural resources, especially the subsoil ones, play a vital role in a nation's progress and prosperity. but mining of these resources is a complex and intensive
process that may cause environmental and social challenges. hence, maintaining a ﬁne balance between economic growth and sustainability is vital.
at vedanta resources, we adopt global leading practices to reduce and minimise the environmental impacts of our operations. reduction of water and
energy consumption, minimising land disturbance and waste production, containing pollution, and conducting successful mine closure are some of the
measures we have undertaken to minimise our impacts.




approach
we work with our partners and the neighbouring communities at project sites to bring far-reaching socio-economic and environmental beneﬁts to the
region. we adopt a systematic and process-oriented approach, underpinned by a spirit of entrepreneurship. this approach has not only resulted in
mitigating impacts but has also created value for our stakeholders and helped us secure the social licence to operate.
our sustainable development framework includes a toolkit of policies, standards and guidance notes to rigorously manage environmental impacts. for the
environmental priorities arising from the materiality process, we have developed speciﬁc objectives and targets, and review performance against these
issues on a periodic basis. we are working towards implementing our biodiversity action plans and are also ﬁnding new and innovative ways to reduce and
recycle waste from our operations including ﬂy ash, red mud, phosphorous gypsum, copper slag, etc.

our water management plans have been chalked out carefully keeping in
mind the water status of each location. for water-stressed areas such as
rajasthan in india, we implement water conservation projects and follow a
zero discharge philosophy. for operations which are not in water-stressed
areas (such as kcm, cmt and lisheen), we ensure programmes are in place
to protect this precious resource.
but across all our operations, we follow the water conservation hierarchy of
reduce, reuse and recycle. we also focus on rainwater usage and
groundwater recharging through rainwater harvesting. signiﬁcant strides
were made in all four areas during the reporting period.

progress has been made across all businesses to engage experts and
establish biodiversity management plans to meet our deadlines.
our dedicated biodiversity policy and management standard is in line
with international standards and guidelines like ifc and icmm. the bmp
is developed to avoid, minimise or compensate the loss of the
biodiversity attributes which arise due to a new project or a major
expansion. we endeavour to achieve a minimum of no net loss (nnl) of
biodiversity for projects located in the modiﬁed or natural habitat area
and strive to achieve net positive gain (npg) of biodiversity for the
project location in the critical habitat.

 our vision is to establish a 'bio-economy campus' on the lisheen mine site with multiple operations and jobs. lisheen has been
 approved to be 1 of the 6 european model demonstrator regions for the development and implementation of modern cluster
 strategies to foster entrepreneurship in emerging industries. therefore, we are engaging with companies who have an active
 interest in establishing green industries on the site. to realise this vision, a task force comprising members of the local government
 and industrial development agencies has been in place for over two years.




 our commitment to lisheen will extend far beyond its
 closure. we will monitor the site for an eight to 10-year
 period and maintain accountability for up to 30 years.

 our sustainable development framework includes a number of technical and management standards which are aligned to international standards
 like ifc and icmm and require consultation with interested and aﬀected parties, right from the earliest stages of business planning.
 these sustainability standards ensure that sustainability risk assessments and due diligence appraisals are integrated into the wider due diligence
 around project development, new projects and potential acquisitions (including commercial, nancial and legal) and site closure.


 new projects
 every new project poses a unique set of challenges. demographics, local customs, cultural nuances and communication patterns - all vary from location to
 location. therefore, when we initiate a new project we analyse it thoroughly across all stages - from exploration to development, operations and closure.
 along with economic viability of a project, we also conduct a socio-economic and environmental impact assessment through a systematic process.

site closure
closure is not the end of the story for the mines. in fact, it is the ﬁrst chapter in the long tale of recovery of the ecosystem and social renewal for communities.
it is during this phase that the stakeholder gaze is intense and they expect companies to fulﬁl the social and environmental commitments which were made
at the beginning of the project.

conversation builds the foundation for convergence. the symbiotic relationship that we share with our stakeholders stems from our zest to constantly
engage with them in a constructive dialogue. with a view to understand expectations, align interests and update them on intentions and actions, we
interact with our stakeholders, internal as well as external, across the project life cycle. not only does it build winning synergies, we also reap the beneﬁts of
improved risk management and better on-ground outcomes. our key stakeholders can be segmented in the following groups:

 the group's stakeholder engagement standard guides
 relationship building actions of all our businesses. the
 standard is at par with global benchmarks, and is a true
 enabler as it empowers businesses to tailor it so that they
 can accommodate local culture.


in fact, at the beginning of every year our businesses conduct their own
stakeholder identiﬁcation & engagement analysis. it includes details, type
and periodicity of engagement for all identiﬁed stakeholders across the
business functions. this ensures that expectations and concerns speciﬁc
to the operation are identiﬁed and addressed.
we monitor both actual and perceived impacts and then liaise with
respective stakeholders to determine the level of likelihood and severity.   we have a dedicated public email address - sustainability@vedanta.co.in -
based on the analysis, stakeholder engagement plans are developed and        available for sending grievances and queries regarding vedanta group or

adding and sharing value

paying fair share of taxes in the countries where companies
operate is increasingly being seen as a 'social licence' to
operate by various stakeholders. at vedanta, we've been
ahead of the curve by putting out a tax transparency report in
advance of any statutory requirements. we will now take this
reporting to the next level by complying with the uk report
on payments to governments regulation 2014.

transparency is the core principle, as we ﬁrmly believe it is a pre-requisite to
build trust which is the foundation for long-term sustainable value creation.
we practice a tax strategy which conforms to our code of business conduct
& ethics with zero tolerance on corruption and bribery. our tax teams
around the world are required to operate in accordance with clearly
deﬁned principles, including integrity and open communication.
management of tax aﬀairs and tax risks is led by tax professionals who work
in accordance with our established governance framework.
we remain at the forefront of tax reporting by managing the tax aﬀairs in a
succinct and straightforward manner. therefore, in fy 2014-15, to ensure
proactive transparency in tax reporting and greater accountability towards
our stakeholders, we voluntarily produced our ﬁrst tax transparency report

   initiatives


   learning is for life

   age is just a number, for those willing to learn and earn with dignity.
   at kcm zambia, adult education classes ﬁrst began as a 50th
   independence anniversary gift, but the response was so massive
   that the programme was subsequently scaled up. so far, 1,000+
   adults have been taught to read and write by the kcm staﬀ in
   collaboration with the zambian ministry of education. several
   of them have passed certiﬁcate exams organised by the ministry
   and are now equipped to work as teachers or administrative staﬀ.




   when it's about education, every bit counts

   education is the most powerful way to bridge gender diﬀerences.
   sterlite copper's ilam mottukal project in thoothukudi district,
   tamil nadu - india aims at ensuring that every girl child is provided
   with quality school education in an enabling environment so that
   she can realise her full potential. this project beneﬁts 7,800+ girl
   children studying in over 80 government and aided primary
   schools in the district and is aimed at enabling support for their
   holistic development including provision of additional academic
   support and educational kits.
   sterlite copper also recognises bright students every year since
   2000 to fulﬁl their pursuit of higher education. 400+ district level
   toppers in the board exams have been presented the
   scholastic excellence cash award and scores of meritorious &
   economically marginalised students are being awarded an annual
   educational scholarship, till date.



   adding smiles to a nation's happiness index

   when sandhya joined the khushi centre in gusai kheda about 2
   years ago she was severely malnourished and extremely shy. but
   after enrolling at the khushi centre not just did she gain weight,
   her personality too ﬂowered. today, she is a healthy 5-year old child
   who happily recites poems, counts numbers, and interacts with
   everyone. the khushi centres being run by hzl are designed for
   children just such as sandhya. we believe, no child should be bereft
   of the simple joys of life such as having a wholesome meal, playing
   with other kids, as well as learning holistically. with this objective,
   'khushi' child-care centres reach out to the children residing in
   remote hinterlands. the locations have been strategically chosen
   wherein government child-care centres are not easily accessible.

   the khushi centres facilitate nutritious food, hygiene,
   healthcare and preschool education in a play way method.
   hzl directly runs 18 such centres and has also signed an
   mou with the state government to strengthen other 3,000
   state-run child-care centres.

health
poor access to sanitation is a major cause of illness in india. our goal is to create a lasting change in the health quotient of our communities through our two

   success story


   helping manju help herself
   manju singh chauhan lives in mansingh ji ka kheda, one of the core
   intervention villages under hzl's csr ambit. manju got associated
   with a self help group in 2007 and has not looked back ever since. as
   a ﬁrst step towards ﬁnancial independence, she purchased a sewing
   machine with a loan taken from the shg and kept picking up new
   techniques and skills whenever hzl organised sewing trainings.
   soon, people began to recognise her talent and the sewing machine
   became an integral part of her household.
   today she contributes signi cantly to the family income
   and is committed to direct other rural women on the path of
   empowerment. manju's story is just one of the many success stories
   of the women of this village that we take pride in sharing. there are
   many already written, and many more waiting to be written.

       aid in times of distress

       it is every corporate's responsibility to step up in times of
       national calamity. sterlite copper lent a helping hand to the
       victims of the tamil nadu ﬂoods by distributing relief material,
       dewatering ﬂooded areas, cleaning up channels and
       strengthening water bodies.
       as immediate relief, 42,000 food packets were
       distributed across relief camps and free medical camps
       were conducted. to facilitate rehabilitation, bedding and
       cooking utensils worth inr 1,000 were provided to each
        ood-aﬀected family.




       bearing the fruits of arbor day

       skorpion zinc together with agri green grow spearheaded a
       project to develop an orchard in rural schools, as part of the arbor
       day celebrations.
       skorpian zinc oﬀered a sponsorship of n$10,000 to each school
       while agri green grow provided 25 growboxx plant cocoons® with
       fruit tree saplings under the green musketeer project.
       the growboxx plant cocoon® helps the tree to start growing, and
       then degrades and functions as a nutrient.
       the idea of the project was to educate the youth on
       reforestation and green technology as well as to provide an
       additional sustainable income source for the schools from
       the sale of the fruits. skorpion zinc has committed to make this
       an annual sponsorship model to spread the message of going
       green, and promote responsible usage of water in karas region.

               sustainable development is at the core of all the business decisions and processes at vedanta resources. to showcase this commitment as
               a key business imperative, we hosted our rst sustainable development day in london in july 2015.




               our senior management provided insights to socially relevant investors (sris) on how sustainability is embedded across our global

our assurance team and independence
our assurance team, comprising of multidisciplinary professionals, has been drawn from our climate change and sustainability network, and undertakes
similar engagements with various indian and international companies. as an assurance provider, ey is required to comply with the independence
requirements set out in international federation of accountants (ifac) code of ethics for professional accountants. ey's independence policies and
procedures ensure compliance with the code.

what we did to form our conclusions
in order to form our conclusions, we undertook the following key steps:
• interviews with select key personnel and the core team responsible for the preparation of the report to understand the company's sustainability vision,
  mechanism for management of sustainability issues and engagement with key stakeholders;
• interactions with the key personnel at the company's head oﬃce and units/locations in order to understand and review the current processes in place for
  capturing the relevant data disclosed in the report;
• veriﬁcation of the reported data, on a sample basis, at the company's corporate oﬃce and units/locations as mentioned in the 'scope of assurance and
  methodology' above;
• review of relevant documents and systems for gathering, analysing and aggregating sustainability performance data in the reporting period;
• review of selected qualitative statements and sample case studies in various sections of the report.

observations and opportunities for improvement
during the review process, we observed that:
• the company has compiled the report as per the 'in accordance' core criteria of gri g4 sustainability reporting guidelines. the report presents a fair
  description of the company's materiality assessment and includes performance disclosures under the aspects identiﬁed as material;
• the company has demonstrated a structured approach towards data management for sustainability performance reporting in line with gri g4 guidelines.
  however, it may further improve on the accuracy, compilation and completeness of reporting on certain indicators viz. safety and human resource data;
• the company may further strengthen internal review of the sustainability performance data for increasing reliability as well as auditability of the same.

conclusion
on the basis of our procedures for this limited assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the company has reported on
sustainability issues materially signiﬁcant to its business and its stakeholders.

 united nations sustainable development goals (un sdgs)
in september 2015, the un member states agreed on a set of 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs), to end poverty, ﬁght inequality and injustice, and
tackle climate change by 2030. we believe natural resources companies like us have the potential to become leading partners in achieving the sdgs. this
year, we have prioritised the sustainable development goals (sdgs) based on materiality issues and operational competency. we are now in the process of
chalking out targets and action plans to address the relevant goals. the below table states our endeavours which naturally align with the said goals.

                  about this report
   this is our eighth sustainable development report and coincides with the publication of our annual report. combined
   these two documents provide an overview of our approach and our achievements in fy 2015-16, outlining our actions over
   the past year to achieve our mission to be a world-class diversiﬁed natural resource company.



   reporting scope and boundary
   covering the ﬁnancial year 2015-16, the report is structured around our sustainable development model's pillars of
   responsible stewardship, building strong relationships, adding and sharing value, and strategic communications.
   all group subsidiary companies except fujirah gold have been reported in full as though they were 100% wholly owned as
   we recognise the level of control and sphere of inﬂuence the group has over these operations.
   the aspect boundaries and content of this sustainable development report have been deﬁned using reporting principles
   prescribed in the gri g4 guidelines and is prepared 'in accordance' - core criteria of the global reporting initiative (gri)
   g4 guidelines.
   we followed the approach described in gri implementation manual for designing the report content. the material aspects
   that have been covered in the report are clearly brought out in the materiality matrix. in the report, the dma (disclosure on
   management approach) describes the company's approach to the subjects relevant to it and the indicators provide details
   on performance on the speciﬁc subjects.
   there are no speciﬁc restatements of the information provided in the previous reports and no signiﬁcant changes in terms of
   acquisition and physical boundaries from the previous reporting periods in the scope and aspect boundaries.
   the report is also mapped to the united nations global compact (ungc) and united nations sustainable development
   goals (un sdgs) principles. it reports our approach and disclosure towards triple bottom line principles - people, planet and
   proﬁt over the ﬁnancial year 2015-16.
