     case: employeeship in if p&c finland in 2016
     in finland, hr has promoted employeeship through workshops held in several units. these workshops
     aimed at establishing a framework for the employees’ responsibility for their own development and
     motivation. in the workshops, feedback culture was promoted by feedback exercises and self-reflection.

    •   one of the employeeship themes has been an initiative called always the right age. hr has
        promoted that employees should not be seen, or see themselves, differently based on their age and
        that everyone is capable of taking responsibility for their own competence and motivation. all
        employees should be treated equally regardless of their age and supported throughout their careers.
        everyone should be given the opportunity to work with full capacity until the pension age. the
        company needs to recognize the different phases of the working life and support employees where
        needed.
    •   in 2016, always the right age has been supported with a series of intranet articles presenting role
        models of different age and in different phases of their employment life (e.g. starting your career,
        changing position, taking care of children or parents, recovering from sickness, retiring).
    •   hr has conducted a survey regarding age-related myths. the results were presented on the intranet
        in order to start a discussion and to dispel myths around age.
    •   hr has also arranged seminars and workshops on intrinsic motivation for employees and leaders.

       case: health leadership in if p&c in 2016
       in denmark, management teams, union, and hr have cooperated closely around promoting health.
       dialogue and closer follow up around the topic have resulted in clear improvements. in sweden, a well-
       being pilot project was run in business area private in 2016 and hr has also run mandatory training
       sessions to implement the new occupational health laws. in norway, hr has been part of arranging
       “health days”, where lectures on life style change, how to deal with addiction, and mini health checks
       were appreciated. in finland, hr has utilized modern tools and ways of working, e.g. moved from
       physical age group health checks to digital surveys. based on the surveys, hr has been able to allocate
       needed actions more efficiently and coach employees where needed.

 case: refinery to help personnel brainstorm new ideas
 in spring 2016, mandatum life adopted a tool to make it easier and more efficient to come up with
 ideas. the introduction of the tool was business-based: the goal is to increase mandatum life’s ability to
 innovate and to cultivate ideas into business.

 in the refinery, the employees can create their own profile and thereafter share an idea or inspiration or
 present a problem to be solved by the work community. during the brainstorming stage, key words that
 are linked to the company’s long-term targets are used. thus, for every idea, the building of a business
 perspective is encouraged already at the brainstorming stage. in the refinery, ideas are discussed and
 commented on with the goal of developing them into viable solutions. after they are collectively worked
 on, the ideas proceed to the experts that are responsible for the matter or to individuals who are
 interested in promoting the matter.

 between may and the end of 2016, 45 ideas and 9 inspirations were created, 8 challenges were
 presented to be solved, and the number of people using the tool increased by more than 200 during the
 period. the best refinery ideas were awarded with tickets to the nordic business forum.

mandatum life’s environmental responsibility is based on
promoting responsible investment
mandatum life’s business operations do not give rise to significant direct emissions, which is why the
company has identified the promotion of responsible investment as the best opportunity to engage in
environmental responsibility. as a major investor, the company has a responsibility to contribute to
reducing the carbon footprint of investments. read more about our measures in the section
‘responsible investment’.

mandatum life contributes to solving environmental challenges that are of crucial importance to finland
by supporting the ecological restoration of the baltic sea. the baltic sea is one of the most polluted
seas in the world. finland’s annual average temperature is rising close to twice as fast as that of the
whole planet (finnish meteorological institute 2016). the warming of finland’s climate also affects the
state of the baltic sea. one of the most serious problems is eutrophication. climate change increases
precipitation, which increases the quantity of eutrophying nutrients flowing into the sea and accelerates
the growth of algal blooms. the increase of carbon dioxide in the air acidifies the baltic sea, posing a
threat to its species.

mandatum life has made a five-year commitment to the baltic sea action group (bsag) to promote the
protection of the baltic sea. the commitment involves supporting the action group’s work through
annual donations and promoting responsible investment operations among its stakeholders. bsag is a
non-profit foundation that co-operates with state heads, authorities and the private sector. in 2016,
bsag was the beneficiary of mandatum life’s christmas donation, which totaled eur 10,000.

the company strives to reduce the negative environmental impacts of its operations by, among other
measures, developing its digital services and by reducing the use of paper in its customer
communications. mandatum life uses the baltic sea -friendly dropp spring water at its events and in its
offices. the company favors locally produced food at its close to a hundred annual stakeholder events.

the changes in the fair value reserve are disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. other income and expenses comprise
rental income, maintenance expenses and depreciation of investment property. all the income and expenses arising from
investments are included in net income from investments. gains/losses include realised gains/losses on sales, unrealised and
realised changes in fair values and exchange differences. unrealised fair value changes for financial assets available-for-sale are
recorded in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. the effect of discounting annuities in
p&c insurance is disclosed separately. the provision for annuities is calculated in accordance with actuarial principles taking
anticipated inflation and mortality into consideration, and discounted to take the anticipated future return on investments into
account. to cover the costs for upward adjustment of annuity provisions required for the gradual reversal of such discounting, an
anticipated return on investments is added to annuity results.

fair values for the group's investment property are entirely determined by the group based on the market evidence. the
determination and hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value is disclosed in note 17. based on the principles of this
determination, the investment property falls under level 2.


the premises in investment property for different segments are leased on market-based, irrevocable contracts. the lengths of the
contracts vary from those for the time being to those for several years.

testing goodwill for impairment

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets. no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests.


for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units, to
which goodwill has been allocated, on the basis of value in use. sampo has defined these cash-generating units as if group and
mandatum life.


the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model. the model is based on sampo’s
management’s best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumes,interest rates, margins, capital
structure and income and cost development. the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long-term
development of insurance liabilities, affecting e.g. the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount. that is why the
forecast period is longer for mandatum life, 10 years. the derived cash flows were discounted at the pre-tax rates of the weighted
average cost of capital which for if was 7.2% and for mandatum life 7.6%. these are lower than last year due to the decrease in the
interest rates of nordic bonds.


forecasts for if, approved by the management, cover years 2017 – 2019. the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated using
a 2% growth rate. a 2% growth rate for years beyond 2026 has been used for the for mandatum life as well, as it is believed to be
close to the anticipated inflation.


in mandatum life, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 410. with the calculation method used,
e.g. an increase of about 2% in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable amount of the
entity would equal its carrying amount.


as for the if group, the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount.

in the table above are presented fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities. assets held for sale are
included in the figures. the detailed measurement bases of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in group accounting
policies.


the fair value of investment securities is assessed using quoted prices in active markets. if published price quotations are not
available, the fair value is assessed using discounting method. values for the discount rates are taken from the market’s yield
curve.


the fair value of the derivative instruments is assessed using quoted market prices in active markets, discounting method or
option pricing models.


the fair value of loans and other financial instruments which have no quoted price in active markets is based on discounted cash
flows, using quoted market rates. the market’s yield curve is adjusted by other components of the instrument, e.g. by credit risk.


the fair value for short-term non-interest-bearing receivables and payables is their carrying amount.


disclosed fair values are "clean" fair values, i.e. less interest accruals.

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo group's financial assets are valued at fair value. the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs, where available. for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques. the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three
hierarchy levels in the notes, depending on e.g. if the market for the instrument is active, or if the inputs used in the valuation
technique are observable.

on level 1, the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

on level 2, inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques.

sensitivity analysis of fair values

the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilites to changes in exchange rates is assessed on business area level due to different
base currencies. in p&c insurance, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against sek would result in an increase
recognised in profit/loss of eurm 10 (9) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 8 (3). in life insurance, 10
percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against eur would result in an increase recognised in profit/loss of eurm 12
(23) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 94 (79). in holding, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other
currencies against eur would have no impact in profit/loss, but a decrease recognised in equity of eurm 163 (68).


the sensitivity analysis of the group's fair values of financial assets and liabilities in differenct market risk scenarios is presented
below. the effects represent the instantaneous effects of a one-off change in the underlying market variable on the fair values on
31 dec. 2016.


the sensitivity analysis includes the effects of derivative positions. all sensitivities are calculated before taxes.


the debt issued by sampo plc is not included.

the value of financial assets regarding the debt security instruments has been tested by assuming a rise of 1 per cent unit in
interest rate level in all maturities. for other financial assets, the prices were assumed to go down by 20 per cent. sampo group
bears no investment risks related to unit-linked insurance, so a change in assumptions regarding these assets does not affect profit
or loss. on the basis of the these alternative assumptions, a possible change in interest levels would cause a descend of eurm 2
(2) for the debt instruments, and eurm 162 (169) valuation loss for other instruments in the group's other comprehensive income.
the reasonably possible effect, proportionate to the group's equity, would thus be 1.4 per cent (1.5).

since january 1, 2008, the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1, 2006 regardless of age. in may 2015, if
decided that all employees born in 1958 or later that were covered by the norwegian defined-benefit pension plan would be
switched to a defined-contribution plan as of january 2016. as of the same date, it was also decided that existing retirees would
no longer be covered by the plan, and that future retirees would cease being covered by the plan when they are no longer
employed by if. accordingly, the norwegian pension plan now consists solely of active people employed prior to 2006 and born no
later than 1957.


the pension benefits referred to are old-age pension and survivors’ pension in sweden. for norway, old-age pension and
survivors’ pension are included, as well as disability pension up to july, 1, 2016. following an amendment to the plan, all
employees will instead be covered by a defined-contribution plan for disability pension. a common feature of the defined-benefit
plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed by the plans are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the
employees’ service period and pensionable salary at the time of retirement. the dominating benefit is the old-age pension, which
refers in part to temporary pension before the anticipated retirement age and in part to a life-long pension after the anticipated
retirement age.


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway. in sweden,
premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65% of the pensionable salary
and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sector’s collective bargaining
agreement of 2006. in norway, premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70% of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were employed by if in
2013.


the anticipated retirement age in connection with life-long pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway. in sweden,
life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10% of the pensionable salary
between 0 and 7.5 income base amounts, 65% of salary between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and 32.5% between 20 and 30
income base amounts. in norway, life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70% of the pensionable salary up to 12 national insurance base amounts, together with the estimated statutory old-
age pension. paid-up policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an amount
corresponding to the change in the consumer price index. however, there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and future
supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall. pension payments from the norwegian plans
are were earlier indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to 80 -100% of the change in the consumer price index. instead, as
of january 2016, a paid-up policy is issued on retirement, whereby if is no longer responsible for and has no obligation in respect
of future indexation of the insured plans.


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits. if’s
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums. should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits, if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way. in addition to insured pension plans, there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment.


to cover the insured pension benefits, the related capital is managed as part of the insurers’ management portfolios. in such
management, the characteristics of the investment assets are analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations, in a
process known as asset liability management. new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimizing the anticipated risk-adjusted return. any surplus that arises from management of the
assets normally accrues to if and/or the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective.


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans, including investment decisions and contributions. the
pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits, the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements.


when applying ias 19, the pension obligations are calculated, as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period, using
actuarial methods. pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period. the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality, employee
turnover and salary growth. the nominally calculated obligation is discounted to the present value using interest rates based on
the extrapolated yield-curves in sweden and in norway for aaa and aa corporate bonds, including mortgage-backed bonds, as at
30 november, approximately updated to reflect market conditions mid-december. the discount rate chosen takes into account the
duration of the company’s pension obligations. after a deduction for the plan assets, a net asset or net liability is recognized in the
balance sheet.


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions, specifications of pension costs, assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of the
fiscal year. as apparent from the tables, the said amendments to the insured plan in norway have been taken into account when
preparing the annual accounts for 2015 and had a material impact on both recognized costs and assets and obligations.


the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden (24.26%) and a corresponding fee in norway
(19.1%).

36 incentive schemes

long-term incentive schemes 2011 i - 2014 i

the board of directors of sampo plc has decided on the long-term incentive schemes 2011 i - 2014 i for the management and key
employees of sampo group. the board has authorised the ceo to decide who will be included in the scheme, as well as the
number of calculated incentive units granted for each individual used in determining the amount of the incentive reward. in the
schemes, the number of calculated incentive units granted for the members of the group executive committee is decided by the
board of directors. some 120 persons were included in the schemes at the end of year 2016.


the amount of the performance-related bonus is based on the value performance of sampo's a share and on the insurance margin
(im) and on sampo's return on the risk adjusted capital (rorac). the value of one calculated incentive unit is the trade-weighted
average price of sampo's a-share at the time period specified in the terms of the scheme, and reduced by the starting price
adjusted with the dividends per share distributed up to the payment date. the pre-dividend starting prices vary between eur 18.37
- 43.38. the maximum value of one incentive unit varies between eur 33.37 - 62.38, reduced by the dividend-adjusted starting
price. in all the schemes, the incentive reward depends on two benchmarks. if the im is 6 per cent or more, the im-based reward is
paid in full. if the im is between 4 - 5.99 per cent, half of the incentive reward is paid. no im-related reward will be paid out, if the
im stays below these. in addition, the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account. if the return is at least risk free
return + 4 per cent, the rorac-based incentive reward is paid out in full. if the return is risk free return + 2 percent, but less than
risk free return + 4 per cent, the payout is 50 per cent. if the return stays below these benchmarks, no rorac-based reward will
be paid out.


each plan has three performance periods and incentive rewards are settled in cash in three installments. the employee shall
authorise sampo plc to buy sampo's a-shares with 60 per cent of the amount of the reward after taxes and other comparable
charges. the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout. a premature payment of the reward
may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on specifically determined
bases. the fair value of the incentive schemes is estimated by using the black-scholes pricing model.

37 assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale

in october 2016, mandatum life insurance company announced that it will not continue the distribution agreement of insurance
policies with danske bank plc after 31 december 2016 and that it will use its right to sell the insurance portfolio acquired via
danske bank to danske bank a/s. the value evaluation will last approximately until the summer 2017. the porfolio transfer
requires the approval of the authorities, expected to take place at the earliest at the end of year 2017.


the insurance porfolio targeted in the agreement is mainly included in the 'unit-linked contracts' segment. assets and liabilities
are valued at book value. the effect of the with profit insurance portfolio on the investment result in the 'other contracts' segment
is deemed insignificant. the insurance risk result in the 'other contrats' segment also consists mainly of other insurance portfolio
than that targeted in the agreement. the effect of the transfer of the insurance portflio is expected to weaken the result
significantly and this will mainly show in the 'unit-linked contract' segment. the premium income of the insurance porflio in 2016
was eur 304 and claims cost eur 253.
