ceo’s message

it has been 7 years ever since the first publication of the sustainability report of korea east-west
power co., ltd. (ewp) in 2007. i believe it is a very meaningful opportunity for us to present
our economic, social and environmental improvement effort and achievement for strengthening
sustainability in 2012 to all of you.

as a public enterprise, which produces about 11.6% of national electricity supply, ewp has been
making an effort to sincerely follow its fundamental mission - providing inexpensive, stable and
eco-friendly power supply - despite several domestic and overseas management environment
changes since the spinoff from kepco in 2001. with this, we are also very proud of contributing
to the improvement of the quality of life.

in 2012, ewp achieved its largest power sales ever with 54,839gwh, which was 7.3% increase
compared to 2011, due to the increased electricity demand. in fact, one of the causes of this
sales increase is insufficient expansion of power plants. moreover, this year’  s power supply
situation is worse than last year, and to deal with such electric power shortage, ewp started
operating the new gas turbine in ulsan natural gas plant unit #4 in june, 2013, which is planned
to be completed in july, 2014. also, dangjin power plant units #9 and #10, which will be
completed by 2016, are well being built according to their construction plans. ewp also makes
an utmost effort to prevent its currently operating plants from breakdown and to operate with
maximum capacity, and we operate an emergency operation system during the peak period of
power demand

in addition, as a public enterprise owned by the public, ewp has done various activities for
taking care of our surroundings and for fulfilling our social responsibility. for example, we
are currently supporting multi-cultural families, the energy poor, educational works, traditional
markets and cultural events of local communities, and the support range is becoming bigger
every year. we have also actively participated in projects for win-win growth with smes, such as
the expansion of sme product purchasing and domestic & international market development for
sme product sales.

lastly, ewp has performed precautional environment and safety management activities for
minimizing environmental impacts. we have tried to respond to climate changes, reducing ghg
emissions and developing new renewable energy sources, and actively expanded the recycling
range of coal ash and waste water. moreover, we have built the disaster safety management
system to minimize the risk of negligent accidents that can be incurred during plant operation.

                                             , korea east-west power will listen to all stakeholders’
with the attitude of‘limitless responsibility’
opinion with open mind, and make an effort to reflect the opinions into our management to fulfill
our social responsibility to give better happiness to all our customers. we sincerely ask for your
continued interest and support to ewp. thank you.

bod and activating the participation of non-executive directors in the managerial activities.

   composition of the stake-holders and capital
ewp is wholly owned by kepco since it was founded as a spin-off from kepco on april 2, 2001, for power generation on the basis of the law
on the restructuring of the electricity industry.

   composition of the board of directors
the board of directors consists of 4 executive directors and 5 external directors. to guarantee the independence of the bod, the senior external
director presides over the board meetings as its chairperson. to establish a responsible management system by the executive directors, the ceo
has signed a management contracts with the ministry of strategy and finance. the ceo and executive directors have signed internal management
contracts on the evaluation of management performance and compensation. external directors are appointed among those with professional
knowledge and distinguished careers, and are paid according to the bod regulations.

      efforts to strengthen the role of bod
     ewp has improved the operating system of bod to secure the independence and professionalism of non-executive directors for efficient fulfillment
     of their decision-making. ewp has established a separate homepage for the bod to improve non-executive directors’ access to managerial
     information. also, a system of prior deliberation for the agenda was introduced for practical deliberation of the agenda and the active reflection of
     the advices of non-executive directors on mid- and long-term core strategies and managerial policies. especially, the professionalism of non-
     executive directors is sufficiently utilized when making decisions on businesses with high risks so that conflicts of interest in the bod can be
     prevented through active discussions.

to maintain the integration and consistency of information, ewp is running the
rms (risk management system) in connection with the erp (enterprise resource                                                   risk detection and precautionary measures

planning) system which provides real-time information. through this, continuous
monitoring is being conducted for the 20 kris in 5 management areas. in addition,
the monitor has been designed in the same way as the eis (executive information
system) to operate the action plan according to the change of risks.

   integrated disaster management system
to forestall and actively manage disaster risks, such as power plant fire, explosion
or pollutant leakage, ewp has established the disaster safety management system
that is directly linked to ndms (national disaster management system). this system
provides rapid alarming (via sms) and auto notice for behavior procedures in an
actual emergency situation.

   financial risk
to manage financial risks according to the changes in exchange rate, interest rate
and fuel prices, ewp is the first domestic power company which operats an active
risk management system by combining lms (liability management system), a foreign
exchange and debt management system, with pcn (prime coal net), a system for
the demand and supply of coal and the management of distribution lines. in 2009,
the company introduced var-based ear (earnings-at-risk) method to reduce the volatility of fuel prices, establish the optimum portfolio of debts,
and manage risks against the fluctuation of foreign exchange thus laying the groundwork for an advanced risk management.

        programs for ethical practice
     ethical standards
     t he ethical standards, which stipulate the standards for employees’behaviors and value judgment, are composed of charter of ethics, code
      of ethics, code of conduct and the instructions for people concerned with a job. ethical standards are periodically revised according to social
      expectations in order to reflect the requirements of stakeholders, and they are posted in the company’s intranet and the homepage of ethical
      management for easy understanding and practice of all employees.

                                                                                                                                             2013 sustainability report

self-inspection of ethics and education on ethics
for the reinforcement of the ethics and law-abiding mind of all employees, a weekly self-inspection of ethics is done using a real case that may
cause ethical dilemma and make it available in the company’    s intranet to improve ethics and will of autonomous practice. also, various systematic
educational courses are offered to employees so that they can agree with the ethical management and join it. new recruits and the employees
in the promotion list must complete the education on ethics compulsorily, and the online education on ethical management, education by external
trainers, and circuit education at workplaces are being offered for all employees.

preventive report system
both internal employees and external stakeholders may report a case through the homepage of ethical management, and there is an online ethics
counseling office. the‘cyber sinmungo’is being operated for report of unethical behaviors or corruption cases. at the same time, the‘help line
system’is being operated in which a professional external agency, which has no interest with the company, handles the cases of internal reports
to activate the internal report system by guaranteeing the anonymity of internal reporters. we have also improved the implementation of the internal
law-abiding monitoring system, clean mileage system, the system of report of acquaintances by business partners, etc.

ethics program for external stakeholders
ewp is actively conducting ethics programs for external stakeholders such as ombudsman system for business partners and meetings with
business partners to carefully listen to what must be improved in the ethical matter from the standpoint of business partners.

enhancement of the independence of the internal inspection system
for a better systematic, independent internal inspection, the previous inspection division has expanded into the audit team and the inspection team,
along with the establishment of a mid- and long-term road map. in addition, we practice a auditor preferential system to secure excellent inspection
manpower, and carry out manpower training courses to increase professionality of inspection.

present condition of employees
the number of ewp’      s employees was 2,080 as of the end of dec., 2012. the number of employees reduced according to the government’                  s
policy for restructuring public enterprises in 2009 and there was no new recruit until 2010. also, the job opening rate decreased as a result of the
5 times’implementation of‘desired retirement’    . however, ewp is doing its best to fulfill its social responsibility to increase job opportunity and the
employment rate through actively recruiting new employees and young interns in 2011 and 2012.

lead open recruitment by hiring high school graduates
since 2001, ewp has hired a total of 828 new recruits through 13 times of open recruitment. no restrictions are imposed on the application for
employment according to gender, age or educational background. recruitment is decided only by one’      s ability and personality. complaints about
any discrimination in the recruitment procedures can be handled by the internal system including the direct report to the ceo and the‘sinmungo’
system. especially, since 2011, ewp implemented the 30% employment quota system for high school graduates to foster the open recruitment, and
                                                                                                          (
ewp hired 53‘meister’high school graduates for the last two years. in addition, an internship program ‘global      dreamalizer program’ ) at ewp’ s
overseas power plant was implemented to boost the global competitiveness of the students in meister high schools, which received favorable
responses and an award from the minister of education, science & technology in two consecutive years.

     expand the employment opportunity for the socially underprivileged (the handicapped and patriots & veterans)
     the employment of the handicapped has continued to increase with the implementation of employment quota system and additional points granted
     to them at time of recruitment. as a result, the percentage of the employment of the handicapped is now over 3% which is the compulsory legal
     requirement. discrimination is ruled out by equal personnel management for handicapped workers and all the employees receive education to
     improve their recognition of the handicapped.
     individuals of national merit also benefit from positive discrimination through the employment quota system and the grant of additional points.
     approximately 9.3% of ewp’     s employees are filled with patriots & veterans and their children as a result of active implementation of socially fair
     employment.

        long-term consigned educational program for fostering next generation leaders
     ewp develops and implements various industry-academic long-term consigned educational programs for employees’management administration
     and professional job competency development. with various degree courses, such as public enterprise policy making programs that are linked
     to prestigious national or international universities, ceo management programs, mba programs, generating unit design courses and maintenance
     professional courses, ewp makes an effort to secure human resources for future growth.

        in-house college programs for new employees from high school

     center of dangjin thermal power plant. ewp also operates the technical expert system to obtain core technology for continuing power generation,
     and in order to acquire core operation technology, ewp utilizes national and international organizations specialized in designing, constructing and
     maintenance of generating facilities. also, via an apprenticeship, ewp hands down and reinforces the core technology.

     ewp is implementing various welfare programs to increase employees’satisfaction by expanding work-family compatibility culture and realizing family-
     friendly policies. various programs are provided to contribute to the solution of low fertility, which is one of core national challenges, by creating an
     environment friendly to childbirth: a baby shower system which presents gifts of books for prenatal education, support for prenatal medical check-up
     expenses, remodeling the lactation room at the company, childbirth grant, pregnant women’      s day on the 10th of october, and operation of a consigned
     day-care center at the company. in june, 2011, the‘pineville day-care center’was opened in the company housing at dangjin thermal power plant
     headquarters to actively support childcare. the center increased its capacity by 20 children, currently caring 45 children, previously planned 21 children.
     also, ewp is actively participating in the government’   s low-birth rate measures, providing nursery facilities that accommodate 80 children in the long
     term, and carrying out family-friendly policies via agreements with the korean institute for healthy family, the planned population federation of korea, etc.

        expand childcare and maternity protection to overcome low fertility
     to form a family-friendly company culture, ewp continuously designates every wednesday as a day for family love.
     and, since april, 2013, after the ceo sent a message about turning off the lights and pcs in offices, ewp made energy saving
     compulsory in all workplaces of ewp. in addition, ewp strongly encourages employees not to work late and to leave work on time
     every friday. in september, 2012, both of the labor and the management of ewp announced together family-friendly management
     and vision for better family-friendly management in ewp, and in april, 2013, ewp made the family-friendly department for the first
     time among public enterprises to operate welfare, personnel management, member and family friendly social contribution to accelerate
     ewp’  s family-friendly management. ewp continuously encourages employees to spend enough time with their families. in cooperation
     with the korean institute for healthy family located near each workplace, differentiated family education programs are being operated for
     each type of family including children, spouses and parents. there are also, various systems for the family of employees: invitation from
     mom’  s and dad’   s workplace, child vacation programs about english or national security and resort facilities during summer vacation.

        better incentives for work-family compatibility and improvement of female employees’status
     women’   s bod in ewp directly communicates with the ceo and actively suggests suggestions for work-family compatibility.
     as a result, special incentives for multichild(3 children or more), priority over company housing, working hour decrease during
     pregnancy period(from 8 to 6 hours a day) and 2 feeding times for a baby younger than 1 year is now guaranteed. in
     addition, both of the labor and the management have agreed to modify maternity leave requirements from currently 8 or less
     to 3 graders of elementary schools. moreover, the sabbatical leave system is now more enhancing work-family compatibility.

     in january, 2012, a procedure for a single bargaining channel, one part of a multiple labor union system, was conducted in ewp, and the
     enterprise labor union, ewp labor union, which was the single participant of the procedure, acquired the position of the labor union of bargaining
     representative, and made a collective agreement with the management about payment. the right for bargaining representative remains until the 31st
     of december, 2013. on the other hand, the industry union, power plant industry labor union, did not participate in the single bargaining channel
     procedure and was maintaining a separate collective agreement. and, as their agreement was expired in march, 2013, the single bargaining
     channel in ewp has been finally formed. according to the multiple labor union system of ewp, the management respects the status of the single
     bargaining channel, and makes an effort to build the labor-management relationship of communication, cooperation and discussion, preventing
     unreasonable discrimination and maintaining neutrality not taking side with any of the two labor unions.

continuing green projects to reduce ghg emissions
under the negotiated agreement for ghg emissions that came into effect in 2011,
it is impossible for a company which was assigned a goal of reduction to register a new kcer project. also, the uncertainties in the global
carbon market is increasing including the decreases in the prices of carbon credits, and the merits of cdm project have virtually disappeared
as the registration of new cdms in the eu emission trading scheme from 2013 is only applied to the poorest nations. however, apart from such
uncertainties, ewp continues to find out the projects to reduce ghg and making efforts to fulfill its green goal successfully. especially, the old ulsan
heavy oil thermal power plant is being replaced with a new combined heat and power plant to reduce about 600,000 ton of ghg emissions.

expanding the co-firing of biomass
as a major short-term measure to achieve the nation’   s goal in reduction of ghg, ewp is actively implementing co-firing of biomass. a test in
donghae thermal power plant for burning in mixture with wood chip, wood pallet and rdf (refuse derived fuel) successfully completed and the
amount of such fuels will be expanded. for dangjin thermal power plant, the organic solid fuel, which is treated at the sewage treatment facility of
the local government, and bituminous coal are used in co-firing.

     r&ds regarding climate change
     in preparation for the increasing pressure of the international society to reduce ghg according to ipcc, ewp will invest regularly on the r&d related
     to cope with climate change. through such investment, ewp will continue to secure the high technology for the reduction of ghg. especially, in
     cooperation with other power generation companies, ewp will concentrate its capabilities in carbon capture and storage (ccs) and integrated coal
     gasification combined cycle (igcc) that can be applied immediately to power companies. for this, ewp secured available lands in dangjin thermal
     power plant for ccs site and in ulsan thermal power plant for igcc site.

     implementing step-by-step simulated emissions trading scheme
     ewp joined with other power generation companies and the korea power exchange on business cooperation for simulated emissions trading
     scheme to actively and jointly respond to the ipcc. also, according to the ewp action plan, ewp, for the first time as a generating company,
     performed a simulated emissions trading scheme with sk group in october, 2010. in 2012, ewp participated in the test trading supervised by the
     ministry of knowledge economy in preparation for the compulsory emissions trading system which will begin in 2015.

     2012 goal achievement of negotiated agreement
     ewp is an enterprise (ghg heavy emission and heavy energy consumption company) that receives goals under the scheme of negotiated
     agreement. in the negotiated agreement (na), the government assigns each company the goal for ghg emission and energy consumption and
     examines the performance. it is a preparatory stage for the initiation of the emissions trading. ewp has prepared itself to minimize risks caused by
     the execution of the system by participating in the test project of na and establishing a countermeasure prior to the system. the specifications for
     ghg emissions and energy consumption between 2007 and 2012 were prepared, and they were submitted to the greenhouse gas inventory &
     research center of korea in the ministry of environment after obtaining the verification of a certified verification agency. in 2012, ewp emitted ghg
     of 0.804 ton/mwh, which was lower than the goal from the government, 0.834 ton/mwh, achieving the goal.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             2013 sustainability report

power plants are producing electricity using coal, heavy oil and lng. it is inevitable that various environmental pollutants are emitted according to
the consumption of the fuel for power generation. however, ewp is minimizing pollutants by operating state-of-the-art facilities that can reduce
environmental pollutants and by recycling wastes, and therefore, to contribute to sustainable development of our society.

management of air and water pollutants
the pollutants produced in power plants can be largely divided into air pollutants, water pollutants and wastes. air pollutants that are produced in
the process of boiler combustion are sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and dust, and the water pollutants include cod and suspended solids. ewp is
doing its best to reduce the amount of the emission of pollutants by setting stricter criteria than the legal restriction. ewp is operating high-tech air
pollution prevention facilities such as desulfurization, de-nitrification and dust-collecting facilities as well as the general wastewater treatment system.

     raw material recycling
     ewp recycles such wastes as coal ash, gypsum or waste oil that are produced in the process of power generation as a way for profit creation.
     in addition, the company is making efforts to increase recycling continuously and curtail the treatment costs by diversifying the usage of recycling, continuing
     r&d, searching for new usage, etc.

     석탄회 재활용 확대
     ewp is making an effort to make a virtuous circle, recycling fly ash, which is produced in coal-fired power plants, as cement material, and ewp is also
     considering a reduction and recycle plan of bottom ash. for instance, the technology for its complete combustion by putting it back into the boiler will
     be applied to the design of dangjin units #9 and #10 to reduce the quantity of bottom ash. as a result, the lifespan of the ash pond will be extended
     and the consumption of coal for fuel will be reduced. meanwhile, research and development for the recycling of coal ash is also expanding.

      usage of service water and recycling waste water

     the service water used at a power plant is supplied from the river and dam near the workplace. it is used for the water supply for boilers, cooling
     water for machines, desulfurization of facilities and other potable water. a general wastewater treatment system, which treats the wastewater in
     physical and chemical ways, is installed at every power plant. the wastewater is reused for process water or discharged into the sea, at a level
     of the standard water quality for discharged water. ewp is making efforts to solve the problem of water shortage by reducing the amount of
     wastewater or raise the percentage of reuse through the application of new technologies to the process of wastewater treatment. in 2012, we
     recycled 1.22 million tons of wastewater, which was 40% of the total waste water produced by ewp.

     ewp has actively promoted the r&d projects with domestic research institutes to improve the technological power of korea in tidal power
     generation. a 1mw pilot tidal power plant has been constructed in uldolmok waters for the first time in asia, and a large capacity tidal power
     plant (14.5mw) is being promoted on its basis. in addition, a 5mw small hydro power generation facility has been completed by using the outlet
     which leads to the sea through a cooling system. a 3mw small hydro power generation facility is under construction for the 2nd stage, and the
     development of a 254mw tidal power plant is being propelled for the usage of ocean energy.

     waste energy
     ewp is carrying forward 100㎿ samcheok srf power plant, the largest of its kind in korea, which uses the solid recovery fuel (srf) produced by
     recycling of buried and burned waste resources among the combustible wastes occurring in living and workplaces, a 22㎿ srf power plant in
     a filled-in ground in the metropolitan area a 20㎿ srf combined heat and power plant in wonju. as a result, ewp creates a composite synergy
     effect and environmental convenience at the same time.

   enhancement of overseas business
ewp successfully completed the test operation of nueva ventanas coal-fired thermal power plant in chile in 2008, and then it has been expanding
its overseas service projects, such as o&m of a fluidized-bed plant in cebu, the philippines in 2009, us ewp rc biomass and natural gas plant
in 2010, and jamaica jps and haiti e-power investment in 2011. from service businesses with dispatching operators at the beginning to the
management of overseas power plants, ewp diversifies its business fields. this is because of ewp’  s world-class plant constructing and managing
experience acquired from domestic power generating business, specialized fluidized-bed coal power plant and wind power plant experience,
systematic and specialized manpower for overseas development and broad network for overseas projects. also, along with such growth, ewp
introduced the self-supporting system which can analyze individual profitability with overall benefits and costs of each overseas project to
systematically manage and analyze overseas business.

     on top of the previous business analysis system, which simply adds up the benefits and costs of overseas projects, this new system allows ewp
     to calculate overseas subsidiary profits, the overall profit of overseas business, including direct/indirect costs, as well as the overall expenses, and
     thus, to accurately analyze the profitability based on each business’  s real financial statement.

     global partnership that results in win-win growth with domestic partners
     in order to obtain publicness of overseas business, ewp, as a public enterprise, is actively supporting exports of relevant domestic partners. at
     first, the win-win growth performance was merely 0.8 billion won from 1 overseas project in guam in 2010 due to the simple purchase of domestic
     consumable products. however, with an effort to increase diversity, such as purchasing equipments, the export amount reached to 10.3 billion
     won, which was 13 times bigger than the one at the beginning. in addition, when ewp participates in overseas green field business, we go with
     domestic construction companies together, making the construction industry vibrant. moreover, to become a global ipp and to fulfill its corporate
     social responsibility (csr), ewp also supports the infrastructure of the vicinity of overseas business areas.

     base-centered greenfield business development
     since 2012, ewp has been focusing on overseas greenfield business development, for example 1,200mw coal-fired thermal power plant in
     namdinh, vietnam, with human resources for overseas business that are secured for stable and continuous overseas business and joint investment
     with verified partners. in addition, ewp also improves economic feasibility of planned projects via strategic negotiation. in case of the 360mw
     combined thermal power plant project in jamaica, ewp reduced the construction cost via the optimalization of technical specification, and in case
     of the kalsel-1 fluidized-bed development project in indonesia, ewp improved the pf conditions with long-term low interest.

                                                                                                                                   2013 sustainability report

   r&d status
along with the demand survey of technical development
for the whole ewp employees, ewp established ewp
industry-academic r&d cluster for maximizing profit via the
improvement of critical technology and preventing internal
and external business environment changes. also, in order
to strengthen future technology competitiveness, core
technologies to be secured in a long term are selected and
their mid- and long-term r&d plans have been devised. on
such basis, ewp developed plant operations and maintenance
management system (pomms), the world’   s first comprehensive
power plant operation and maintenance working system, and
is actively coping with rps and environmental regulations by
preoccupying the technologies for the usage of low-quality
fuels, such as upgrade technology for low grade coal, and
making r&d activities in the area of new & renewable energy
for low-carbon green growth, such as biomass plant for food
waste, through the performance of an‘r&d with vision’ .
