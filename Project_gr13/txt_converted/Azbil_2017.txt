          to realize safety, comfort, and fulfillment in people’s lives
        and contribute to global environmental preservation through
                        “human-centered automation.”




                                                                                                                                  fo u r c o r e a z b i l va l u e s
                                        to achieve our philosophy,
                       • we create value together with customers at their site.
                       • we pursue our unique value based on the idea of “human-centered.”
                       • we think towards the future and act progressively.




since our establishment in 1906, we have focused on measurement and control technologies, delivering unique solutions
to our customers. our founder, takehiko yamaguchi, established the company with the intention of “using advanced
technology to liberate people from drudgery,” and since then we have advanced with the times. at our centenary in
2006, we introduced “human-centered automation,” which remains our philosophy today, and we formulated the
group symbol “azbil.” in april 2012, we changed the company name from yamatake to azbil, and we have sought to
make the azbil brand familiar to as wide an audience as possible.
  today, the azbil group provides unique levels of customer-oriented value in offices, production sites, and daily life over
the world through its three business segments: building automation, advanced automation, and life automation. the
year ended march 2017 was the final year of our previous medium-term plan. during the year, we upgraded business in-
frastructure, responded to changes in market conditions, and reassessed our business portfolio. as a result, we achieved
year-on-year increases in earnings for the fourth consecutive period.
  in the current fiscal year ending march 2018, we have started a new three-year medium-term plan. to achieve the ob-
jectives of the plan, we are pursuing three fundamental policies: (1) being a long-term partner for the customer and the
community by offering solutions based on our technologies and products; (2) taking global operations to the next level
by expansion into new regions and a qualitative change of focus; and (3) being a corporate organization that never stops
learning, so that it can continuously grow stronger. in particular, we anticipate sustained growth in the life cycle solutions
business, which we will expand globally, as well as in new automation fields where we can apply various technological
innovations, and in environmental and energy fields where we will broaden our business presence.
  going forward, the azbil group will continue forging ahead as a unified corporate group able to help solve var-
ious issues by creating new levels of value in partnership with customers at their sites, through the pursuit of
“human-centered automation” that liberates people from drudgery and provides them with happiness brimming with
joy and fulfillment.

        azbil’s history of value creation
        in its pursuit of automation, azbil will deploy worldwide the sustainable value creation that
        it has achieved over more than a century.



        since our founding in 1906, we have taken on the challenges of solving problems in a variety of situations, including
        buildings, factories and plants, lifelines, and living environments, leveraging both the most advanced automation
        available and the knowledge that we have built up at customers’ sites to provide value.
        as well as pursuing new values in automation, we are aiming not only to meet the needs of society but also to further
        grow and develop in partnership with customers and society amid an increasingly globalized business environment.

the requirements of gas companies, it successfully turned know-how
and technologies of azbil kimmon co., ltd. into a commercial reality,
of which odawara gas is a user. conventionally in gas conduit con-
struction, medium- and low-pressure meters are set up separately. this
requires switching between meters during construction according to the
measurement range, giving extra workload and potential danger. taking
advantage of the newly developed pressure meter, which can undertake
continuous measurement without the need for switching, odawara gas
has reduced its workload, improved safety, and sped up construction. the
new pressure meter is currently acknowledged widely as a groundbreak-
ing product and used by many gas companies.



99.8% of electricity generation, and also foster a transition from heavy oil
to natural energy, seaside hotel yakushima took various measures under a
proposal from azbil corporation. specifically, it installed a highly efficient
heat source and applied various kinds of automatic control technologies
to both improve comfort and optimize energy consumption of indoor
spaces. it also introduced a central monitoring system to allow visualiza-
tion of the building’s status. as a result, it reduced the cost of heavy oil
consumption to one-third and cut carbon dioxide (co2) emissions by 68%.
by monitoring the temperature of the entire hotel, including guest rooms,
it also established a system that always provides comfortable spaces for
customers. this has become a model case for yakushima, known for its
commitment to environment protection and reduction of co2 emissions.




energy efficiency, a focus of growing social pressure. with this mind, the
university selected azbil corporation as an esco*1 operator to resolve
the issue. in addition to renewal of aging heat source equipment, azbil
introduced a bems*2 and control methods to optimize operation of air-
conditioning equipment. as a result, we achieved a challenging energy
usage reduction target—46.2% of reduction from the annual average
for the most recent three-year period—while maintaining high-level tem-
perature and humidity control required by the facility.

*2 building energy management system




the company adopted the azbil group’s approach of making use of the
most of the plants’ existing facilities, such as chillers, cooling towers, and
pumps, optimizing the control of new heat sources, and making use of an
esco plan, a type of plan that guarantees energy-saving effectiveness. as
a result, the woodlands dhc plant achieved a large reduction in electricity
consumption by 2.28 million kw/year, far above its initial target. after these
proven results, similar measures were adopted at the changi and biopolis
dhc plants, which reduced the company’s electricity consumption by over 8
million kw/year at three dhc plants in total, again much above their targets.

      is used by the control devices within that equipment. the azbil group is developing
      products that use this data to improve the preventive maintenance of manufacturing
      equipment. these products have the azbil group’s proprietary health index* function,
      which apply measurement and control technology to track the changing condition of the
      equipment by means of internal process data. with their enhanced communication
      functionality, these devices also help to bring iot to manufacturing sites.
                                                                                                               model c7g multi-loop controllers with

• net sales declined year on year, due to a temporary dip in sales related to new buildings, a reassessment of our
  business overseas, and foreign exchange factors. this was despite growth in the domestic market for services.
• segment profit was down, due mainly to increased expenses associated with enhancing job processing capabilities.

new building automation system launched overseas
during the year, we began overseas sales of “savic-net™g5,” a
new building automation (ba) system incorporating iot and other
technological innovations. the new ba system is equipped with
open communication protocols to allow optimal system construc-
tion, regardless of which company’s products are used, and has an
advanced interface and utility functions that emphasize user conve-
nience. it also features an advanced energy-saving control system
incorporating applications with proven track records in japan. we
have already delivered the system to commercial office buildings and
airport facilities in thailand, singapore, sri lanka, and elsewhere,
and we are expanding sales activities across asia.

    another group companies and all customers of the group across companies. each branch of-
    fice in japan conducts a meeting on a monthly basis in which the sales engineers from group
    companies get together to discuss business solutions for customers and to learn more about
    the products. because we focus on “value creation on-site,” the engineers from group com-
    panies also meet and conduct surveys at customers’ sites from time to time. viewpoints of
    other companies bring out fresh ideas and unexpected discoveries, and sometimes enable us
    to provide completely new solutions for our customers. we believe that, with this approach,
    we can stimulate the creation of special value that is unique to the azbil group.

      infrastructure to support value creation
      the azbil group works hard to create value for customers and society. here, we introduce the
      group’s corporate governance and csr-focused management, which form the basis for sustain-
      able corporate activities, as well as our approach to dialog with various group stakeholders,
      and our responsibilities to them.




      corporate governance
      our most important management priorities are to achieve sustainable corporate growth and to
      improve medium-to-long-term corporate value by practicing highly efficient and transparent
      management while fulfilling our social responsibilities and contributing to society, based not only
      on compliance with laws, regulations, and our articles of incorporation, but also on our sense of
      ethics. this will enable us to earn the trust of all stakeholders.



      efforts to strengthen corporate governance
      azbil corporation has long emphasized the importance of corporate governance in its management, having appointed its first
      outside director in june 2007. in the year under review, our efforts to improve corporate governance gained momentum from
      the enactment of japan’s corporate governance code.

           the model f4h compact digital mass flow controller
           which is 50% the size of conventional models

                                                                                                                                 conventional model
           in june 2016, azbil corporation introduced its model f4h compact dig-
           ital mass flow controller, which is easy to use and easy to incorporate
           into manufacturing equipment for purposes of factory automation.
              the f4h retains the responsiveness and controllability of existing mod-
           els, but its functions have been narrowed down to what is necessary for
           use with electrical and electronic component manufacturing equipment
           and various analyzers and incubators for fields such as physics and chem-
           istry. this enabled us to reduce its size to 50% of previous models.
              accordingly, new equipment that incorporates this controller can be
           made more compact, and the f4h can be installed in existing equip-
           ment where space is limited.                                                            100
              moreover, the controller is easy to use, thanks to improvements in
           noise immunity, which is necessary for incorporation into manufactur-
           ing equipment, as well as multiple-gas compatibility, operation with
           general-purpose 24 v power supplies, and 4–20 ma output, all of
           which helps to reduce the total cost.

    protecting the earth’s environment
    █   reducing the environmental impact of society through our core businesses
    the amount of co2 emission reduction at our customers’ sites in the fiscal year ended march 2017, which totals 3,210,000
    tons, is equivalent to approximately 1/400 of all co2 emissions in japan (approx. 1.3 billion tons). the scope of these cal-
    culations has been expanded to reflect the international expansion of our businesses.
    in order to assess the reduction of environmental impact quantitatively, the effects were classified into the three categories of 1) effects from automation, 2) effects
    from energy management, and 3) effects from maintenance services. in addition, the reduction was calculated by comparison with the assumption that customers
    did not adopt our products or solutions at their sites. the calculation of reduction in global impact was based on the conventional calculation method and partially
    on our own concept.




                                                                                                                                                                                infrastructure to support value creation

      as is customary in japan, the azbil group maintains deposit balances with banks with which it has bank loans. such deposit balances are not
      legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal.
        general agreements with respective banks provide, as is customary in japan, that additional collateral must be provided under certain circum-
      stances if requested by the lending banks and that certain banks have the right to offset cash deposited with them against any bank loan or
      obligation that becomes due and, in case of default and certain other specified events, against all other debt payable to the banks. the azbil
      group has never received any such requests.

      8. retirement and pension plans
      azbil and certain subsidiaries have retirement and pension plans for employees, and certain domestic subsidiaries have retirement benefit plans
      for directors and audit & supervisory board members.
        under most circumstances, employees terminating their employment are entitled to retirement benefits determined based on the rate of pay
      at the time of termination, years of service, and certain other factors. such retirement benefits are made in the form of lump‑sum severance
      payments from the azbil group and annuity payments from a trustee. employees are entitled to larger payments if the termination is invol-
      untary, by retirement at the mandatory retirement age or by death, than in the case of voluntary termination at certain specific ages prior to
      the mandatory retirement age.
        in addition, azbil and a certain subsidiary transferred the defined benefit pension plans for working employees to the defined contribution
      pension plans on june 1, 2015. the accounting for these transfers was recorded according to “guidance on accounting for transfer between
      retirement benefit plans” (asbj guidance no. 1) and “practical solution on accounting for transfer between retirement benefit plans” (asbj
      pitf no. 2).
        the liability for retirement benefits at march 31, 2017 and 2016, for directors and audit & supervisory board members is ¥112 million
      ($1,003 thousand) and ¥133 million, respectively.

      b. method of determining the expected rate of return on plan assets
        	the expected rate of return on plan assets is determined considering the long-term rates of return which are expected currently and in the
          future from the various components of the plan assets.

      (8) assumptions used for the years ended march 31, 2017 and 2016, are set forth as follows:

                                                                                                                  2017                    2016

      9. equity
      japanese companies are subject to the companies act of japan (the “companies act”). the significant provisions in the companies act that
      affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below:

      a. dividends
         under the companies act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year‑end dividend upon
         resolution at the shareholders’ meeting. additionally, for companies that meet certain criteria including (1) having a board of directors,
         (2) having independent auditors, (3) having an audit & supervisory board, and (4) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as
         one year rather than the normal two‑year term by its articles of incorporation, the board of directors may declare dividends (except for
         dividends‑in‑kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. however, azbil does
         not meet all the above criteria.
           the companies act permits companies to distribute dividends‑in‑kind (noncash assets) to shareholders subject to a certain limitation and
         additional requirements.
           semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of incorporation of the
         company so stipulate. the companies act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury
         stock. the limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends
         must be maintained at no less than ¥3 million.

      b. increases/decreases and transfer of common stock, reserve and surplus
         the companies act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained
         earnings) or as additional paid‑in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment
         of such dividends, until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid‑in capital equals 25% of the amount of the common
         stock. under the companies act, the total amount of additional paid‑in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. the
         companies act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid‑in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be
         transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.

      c. treasury stock and treasury stock acquisition rights
         the companies act also provides for companies to purchase treasury stock and dispose of such treasury stock by resolution of the board
         of directors. the amount of treasury stock purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is
         determined by a specific formula. under the companies act, stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity. the
         companies act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury stock. such treasury stock
         acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights.

          ognize lease assets and lease obligations in the balance sheet. however, asbj statement no. 13 permits leases without ownership transfer
          of the leased property to the lessee and whose lease inception was before march 31, 2008, to continue to be accounted for as operating
          lease transactions if certain “as if capitalized” information is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. azbil and its consolidated
          domestic subsidiaries applied asbj statement no. 13 effective april 1, 2008, and accounted for such leases as operating lease transac-

      (2) financing leases as a lessor
          the azbil group leases certain machinery and equipment as a lessor.

      14. financial instruments and related disclosures
      (1) policy for financial instruments
          the azbil group makes risk reduction the first priority in terms of its asset management and limits its investments to financial assets
          that consist mainly of short-term deposits, while the azbil group’s financing needs are met by selecting the most suitable method of
          funding while taking into account such factors as the purpose of the loan, the terms and funding costs. the azbil group limits the use
          of derivatives to forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuating foreign
          currency exchange rates, and interest rate swaps to hedge against the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates, and does not en-
          gage in transactions for speculative purposes.

      (2) nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments and risk management
          notes and accounts receivable—trade are subject to the credit risks of the customers. the azbil group manages its credit risks on the




96   azbil report 2017

        basis of internal guidelines, which include keeping track of due dates and outstanding balances of the receivables for each transaction
        and monitoring the credit standing of major customers on a yearly basis. notes and accounts receivable—trade denominated in foreign
        currencies are subject to risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates; however, their net positions after deducting operating liabilities
        are, in principle, hedged through the use of forward exchange contracts.
          investment securities mainly comprise stocks of companies with which the azbil group has business relationships, and are subject to
        the risks associated with fluctuating stock prices. such stock investments are managed by monitoring their fair values and the financial
        status of the companies on a regular basis, as well as conducting ongoing reviews of their holding status by taking into account the azbil
        group’s relationship with the issuing companies.
          notes and accounts payable—trade are liabilities due within one year. although certain notes and accounts payable—trade denom-
        inated in foreign currencies are subject to the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates, the majority of such instruments are
        constantly kept within the amount of the outstanding balance of accounts receivable denominated in the same foreign currency.
          interest‑bearing debt mainly comprises short‑term borrowings. while a portion of these borrowings, having floating interest rates, is
        subject to the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates, the effects of these risks are negligible as their terms are short and amounts
        are minimal.
          derivative transactions are executed and managed in accordance with internal rules that stipulate the authorization procedures of
        such transactions, are used for the purpose of mitigating credit risks, and are conducted solely with highly rated financial institutions as
        counterparties. please see note 15 for more details about derivatives.
          additionally, notes and accounts payable—trade and short‑term borrowings are subject to liquidity risks such as in the event the azbil
        group cannot execute payment on the payment date. liquidity risks are managed by such methods as having each group company draw
        up monthly cash flow plans.

(3) fair values of financial instruments
    fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted prices in active markets. if a quoted price is not available, other rational valuation
    techniques are used instead. please see note 15 for the details of fair value for derivatives.

      15. derivatives
      the azbil group enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exchange rate risk associated with trade receivables and
      payables denominated in foreign currencies. the azbil group also enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage its interest rate exposures
      on certain liabilities.
        it is the azbil group’s policy to use derivatives only for the purpose of reducing market risks associated with assets and liabilities, not to hold
      or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
        since all of the azbil group’s foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts are related to qualified hedges of under-
      lying business exposures, market gain or loss risk in the derivative instruments is effectively offset by opposite movements in the value of the
      hedged assets or liabilities.
        because the counterparties to these derivatives are limited to major international financial institutions, the azbil group does not anticipate
      any losses arising from credit risk.
        derivative transactions entered into by the azbil group have been made in accordance with internal policies which regulate the authorization
      and credit limit amounts.

        19. segment information
        under asbj statement no. 17, “accounting standard for segment information disclosures,” and asbj guidance no. 20, “guidance on
        accounting standard for segment information disclosures,” an entity is required to report financial and descriptive information about its
        reportable segments. reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria.
        operating segments are components of an entity about which separate financial information is available and such information is evaluated
        regularly by the chief operating decision‑maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. generally, segment in-
        formation is required to be reported on the same basis as is used internally for evaluating operating segment performance and deciding how
        to allocate resources to operating segments.

        (1) description of reportable segments
            the reportable segments of the azbil group—identifiable operating segments of the group’s business structure for which financial infor-
            mation is made separately available—are subject to periodic review by the board of directors in order to make decisions on the distribution
            of management resources and to assess performance.
              the azbil group identifies its operating segments using such criteria as business organization, product lines, service content, and mar-
            kets. this approach results in three separate reportable segments: the building automation business, the advanced automation business,
            and the life automation business.
              the building automation business supplies commercial buildings and production facilities with automatic heating ventilation, and air
            conditioning control and security systems, including products, engineering, and related services. the advanced automation business sup-
            plies automation control systems, switches and sensors, and engineering and maintenance services to industrial plants and factories. the
            life automation business supplies meters for lifelines, residential central air‑conditioning systems, life science research, manufacture and
            sale of manufacturing equipment and environmental equipment for the pharmaceutical and medical fields as well as related services—all
            of which are intimately connected with everyday life.
