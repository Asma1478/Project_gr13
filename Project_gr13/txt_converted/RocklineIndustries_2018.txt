methodology
unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all data, ﬁgures, and charts cover the period of our ﬁscal year ending in
2017, which runs from july 1, 2016 to june 30, 2017. the data in this report has been collected from invoices and
statements of accounts sent to rockline by our utility providers and other vendors.
we have calculated our carbon footprint using the greenhouse gas protocol corporate standard, as well as
guidelines for greenhouse gas inventories from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc). in 2014,
the u.s. epa updated the egrid electricity emissions factors, and our data was adjusted to reﬂect those updates.
this is our ninth annual report. our previous report was published in january 2017, covering our ﬁscal year 2016
(july 1, 2015 to june 30, 2016). prior years’ data may be restated due to more accurate information.

             reusable containers called totes, the majority of the lotion we use is mixed on-site in
             our specialized chemical mix departments. because the amount and type of lotions
             used in our products are largely determined by our customers, we have chosen
             instead to focus on increasing the eﬃciency of our water use, an area over which we
             have more direct operational control.

             our coﬀee ﬁlter and baking cup operations use comparatively limited amounts of
             water. water is primarily used to test the ﬂow rates of coﬀee ﬁlters and to generate
             steam, which is used to give basket-style coﬀee ﬁlters and paper baking cups their
             distinctive shapes.

             outside of ﬁnished goods, we use water for a range of other purposes. our products
             undergo extensive quality testing before we ship them for public consumption, and
             many of these tests require water. rockline also uses water to ﬂush, clean, and
             sanitize piping and other machinery used to deliver lotion to the production lines.
             wastewater continues to be one of the most challenging of all of our sustainability
             goals. although we will not sacriﬁce quality to save water, we can increase our focus
             toward more eﬃcient water use, even in testing and cleaning. we have the
             opportunity to increase the accuracy of the methodology we use to track the amount
             of water in the products that we ship. currently we make estimates based on
             production statistics and product speciﬁcations.




             initiatives
             • our springdale, ar plant implemented improvement within the line vacuum
               system which resulted in a wastewater reduction. further improvements will
               be made in 2018.
             • our montville, nj plant, a relatively small consumer of water, was able to
               identify an issue related to the steam system, resulting in wastewater
               reduction.
             • our booneville, ar plant is working with process engineering to identify issue
               points within the process and identify improvement opportunities.
             • our redditch, uk plant launched a major project to track water usage. they
               realized signiﬁcant reductions in wastewater.
             • our russellville, ar plant is beginning a project to reduce excess solution
               waste in fy18.

               a meter previously identiﬁed as incoming water at our booneville, ar plant was correctly identiﬁed
15             as a wastewater meter. corrections were made back to our baseline year resulting in lower overall
               water consumption in 2015 and 2016.

                waste is the ineﬃcient use of resources. rockline deﬁned solid waste as all waste
                leaving our facilities regardless of how it is generated or handled. our coﬀee ﬁlter
                and baking cup production generates a high amount of waste because the ﬁlters are
                cut from square sheets of paper. even though the paper scrap is recycled, it is still
                considered waste because a truly eﬃcient process would use all the paper.
                rockline focuses on the measuring, reducing and eliminating of waste from our
                manufacturing processes to provide better value to our customers. every step we
                take toward reducing solid waste relieves a portion of the demand placed on
                natural resources.

                we realized higher than normal increases of waste on the wet wipes side in part
                because we included our russellville, ar plant into our metrics. russellville is still
                ramping up as new lines are added. other increases were realized due to a
                signiﬁcant amount of remnant inventory being dispositioned throughout the year.

                 • our montville, nj plant realized waste reductions for fy17 through machine

                 • our sheboygan, wi plant installed real-time waste monitoring equipment to
                   provide visibility and allow for early corrections.
                 • our springdale, ar plant implemented a plant focus on waste reduction
                   resulting in an 8% reduction from the baseline year.
                 • our booneville, ar plant has worked and is working with multiple lines to
                   reduce the amount of waste created at the start of runs.
                 • our sheboygan, wi plant established equipment set-up parameters on

looking ahead
as always, i want to thank you for taking the time to read the 2017 edition of
our environmental sustainability report. this year we faced many challenges.
we overcame many and fell short on a few, but challenges have a tendency
to spark new opportunities. since we are committed to continuous
improvement and open disclosure, i’m excited to see where this journey
takes us and share it with you.



there has been much conversation surrounding sustainability and its eﬀect
on climate change. even though some have taken actions to separate from
global initiatives like the paris agreement, i’m proud to say that rockline has
remained steady in our commitment and steady in our belief in the science
around climate change. 2017 was an exciting year for rockline. we realized
growth in many areas, which resulted in the announcement of the addition
of our 6th manufacturing site in the us, and 7th globally, located in
morristown, tn. the construction of the new facility is underway with our
sustainability goals in mind. finally, i’m proud to say that we at rockline, as
always, operate with our values at the forefront; respect, renew, integrity,
teamwork, and excellence.


thanks to everyone at rockline who contributed to the journey! please feel
free to contact me with any questions or suggestions.


looking forward to the future,
