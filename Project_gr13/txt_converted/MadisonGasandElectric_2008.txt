take the first steps
what can you do? begin with the easy things. take these starting 5 steps.

                       1. take control of your thermostat. for every degree of change
                       for eight hours, you can reduce energy use and save on your heat-
                       ing and cooling costs by 1%. save even more with greater or longer
                       temperature changes.

                            annual savings – all customers
                            35 million pounds of co2. power for 2,400 homes.

                       2. switch to compact fluorescent bulbs. switching five frequently
                       used lights from standard incandescent bulbs to compact fluorescent
                       bulbs saves two-thirds or more of the electricity needed to power
                       these lights. if they are used at least four hours each day, this is a
                       savings of about $40 in the first year.

                            annual savings – all customers
                            130 million pounds of co2. power for 8,800 homes.



                 the power of working together

                     3. wash your laundry in cold water. using cold water for washing
                     eliminates the energy used to heat the 7 to 10 gallons of hot water
                     needed per load and saves you money – between 10 and 20 cents
                     per load. on average, customers launder about 7.5 loads per week.

                          annual savings – all customers
                          123 million pounds of co2. power for 3,300 homes.

                     4. turn off the juice when not in use. one of the easiest ways
                     to reduce energy consumption is to get in the habit of turning
                     things off when you finish using them. if no one is watching that
                     tv, turn it off. if no one is in a room, shut off the lights. unplug
                     that second refrigerator or freezer when not needed and save
                     $5 to $15 per month.

                          annual savings – all customers
                          39 million pounds of co2. power for 2,600 homes.

                     5. look for the energy star® label. when shopping for new appli-
                     ances and equipment, choose those with an energy star label.
                     depending on the type of equipment, energy star models can save
                     10% to 50% of the power used by a standard model. if, over the next
                     few years, you replace all your appliances with energy star appliances,
                     your individual savings could be about $320 in annual energy costs.

                          annual savings – all customers
                          550 million pounds of co2. power for 30,800 homes.
