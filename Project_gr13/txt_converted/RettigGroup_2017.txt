                   alandia is one of the leading marine insurers in the
     nordic region. the åland-based insurance company provides
     marine- and leisure boat insurance in the nordic region as well as
     life and statutory pension insurance on åland. alandia’s investment
     operations manage considerable investment assets (about eur
     600 million in 2016).
          alandia has been a limited liability insurance company since
     the beginning of 2015. rettig group has been an owner of the pre-

          the 2016 consolidated profit of alandia was eur 15.2 million in
     2016 (2015: 19.6). the result was impacted by tough competition in
     international maritime insurance market, a good claims-ratio, high
     operating expenses and volatile financial markets.
          alandia’s solvency remained on a very good level after adoption of
     the solvency ii regulations during 2016. alandia has a bbb+ rating by
     standard&poor’s. as a result of continued efforts to reduce alandia’s
     investment risk, standard&poors added a ”positive outlook” to its
     rating during 2016.
