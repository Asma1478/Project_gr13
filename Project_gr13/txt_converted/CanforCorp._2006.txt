no matter how big the
challenge, the opportunity is
always bigger. it was this attitude
that best reflects canfor in 2005.
without a doubt, 2005 was a year
of challenges. but not only did we
take on these challenges head
on – we made them opportunities.
an opportunity to become more
efficient. an opportunity to become
more resourceful. but most of all,
2005 provided us an opportunity to
reveal the collective strength and
value of our company.

dear fellow shareholders,

with every challenge comes opportunity.
in 2005, those companies who were
able to create opportunities enjoyed
some success in what was otherwise
a disappointing year for the forest
products sector. at canfor, we made
opportunities for ourselves and managed
what can be considered a respectable
year given the circumstances. it is
during these downtimes that one can
truly see the value in a company, where
its strengths and weaknesses are, and
of course, the dedication of its people.

wildlife and habitat management
in 2005, canfor’s coastal operations completed a biodiversity conservation plan. the goal of this plan is to keep common
species common. the plan outlines measures taken to conserve all species and monitoring strategies to ensure the
effectiveness of the plan. the goal for 2006 is to develop a biodiversity conservation plan for at least one bc northern
interior division.
     canfor has been actively involved in planning for caribou habitat management throughout our tenures. as an
example, we began developing a boreal caribou conservation plan, in partnership with bc ministry of environment, for
fort nelson and fort st. john divisions in 2005. the expected completion date is december 2006.


coast forest conservation initiative
canfor has been a member of the coast forest conservation initiative (cfci) since it began in 1999. cfci is a collaboration
among four british columbia-based forest companies dedicated to the sustainable development and conservation of
coastal forests. cfci members have been in dialogue with environmental groups forestethics, greenpeace, rainforest
action network and the sierra club of canada, bc chapter in a forum known as the joint solutions project (jsp).
     the cfci and its environmental group collaborators in the jsp generated a workable package of solutions
regarding conservation and forest management which served as the basis of consensus recommendations reached by
the central coast and north coast land and resource management plan planning tables in 2003 and 2004 respectively.
the recommendations were forwarded to the provincial government, which entered into discussions with first nations
in the region prior to a final land use plan decision by the provincial cabinet.
     in february 2006, the provincial government announced the land use decision, which will establish over 100 new
protected areas, raising the total protected area for the central and north coast to 1.8 million hectares. the decision
also establishes biodiversity areas to maintain ecological diversity and function while allowing for some resource
development. the balance of the plan area (over 65%) will allow the full range of economic uses while applying a new
adaptive approach of ecosystem-based management (ebm). the intent of ebm is to support a sustainable economy
while protecting ecosystems and to promote stability, certainty and long-term resource use in the region.


certification
canfor continues to be a leader in third-party sustainable forest management certification of its forestry operations.
     during 2005, canfor maintained existing certification to the csa sustainable forest management (sfm) standard
on its tree farm licence at prince george, its forest licence in the morice timber supply area (tsa) and its forest
licence and pulpwood agreement in the fort st. john tsa. canfor’s tree farm licences at chetwynd and on vancouver
island and its grande prairie forest management agreement were recertified to the csa sfm standard for another
three-year term. new csa sfm standard certifications were obtained for canfor’s tree farm licence and forest
licence at vavenby, its forest licence and pulpwood agreement at fort nelson, and its forest licences at vanderhoof,
prince george and quesnel.

     currently 85% of the allowable annual cut from canfor’s forest tenures is certified to the csa sfm standard.
sustainable forest management plans are being developed and implemented at the radium and mackenzie divisions
and for the houston division’s lakes tsa forest licence. all will be certified to the csa sfm standard during 2006.
canfor is committed to having sustainable forest management certification in place for all of its tenures.


forest management systems
canfor’s forestry operations have maintained an environmental management system (ems), initially certified to the iso
14001 ems standard in 1999 and re-certified as required for subsequent 3-year terms. the forestry ems, now referred
to as canfor’s forest management system (fms) was reviewed and revised during 2005 to ensure that it remains
current and effective. as part of the revision process the fms, which until now has been certified to the 1996 version of
the iso 14001 standard was recertified to the replacement 2004 version of the iso standard.


compliance with regulations
canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of this
process. the following is an inventory of compliance for canfor’s forestry operations.
     during 2005, a total of 23 non-compliance incidents occurred on company tenures. in all cases, canfor promptly
took necessary actions to mitigate any environmental consequences and correct conditions that may have led to the
incident.
     canfor forestry operations reported 10 spills to government agencies in 2005, 9 in british columbia and 1 in
alberta. eight of the spills were the result of equipment failure, and two were the result of accidents. all spills were
minor in nature, and were properly managed and contained.
     canfor forestry operations were assessed administrative penalties by british columbia government agencies
totalling $7,500 for eleven incidents in 2005. all incidents were related to administrative procedures and did not result
in any environmental consequences.


objectives and targets for 2006
forest management system – we will maintain the forest management system during 2006. surveillance audits to the iso

14001 standard will be carried out at 8 operations and at the corporate office.


sustainable forest management certification – we will maintain existing csa sfm certifications and complete the

certification of the radium, mackenzie and houston operations.


sfm audits – we will provide audit training for forestry staff and conduct internal audits at 11 forestry operations. we

will conduct external csa sfm surveillance audits at 7 operations and recertification audits to the csa sfm standard
at 3 operations.

compliance report


canfor is committed to transparency in our environmental reporting and includes compliance reporting as part of this
process. the following is an inventory of compliance for canfor’s wholly owned manufacturing operations.
     in 2005, canfor had the following non-compliance situations (reported in accordance with government non-
compliance reporting criteria):


air – at sawmills, beehive burners operated below approval temperature as follows: one for thirty-three days, this issue

has been largely resolved with installation of a fuel reclaim system for the burner; one for ten days due to inadequate
fuel to maintain temperature, this issue has been resolved with changes in operating regime of the burner; one for four
days, three of which were due to cold weather; one for two days due to damper controls failure; one for one day. one
burner failed to meet the monthly temperature requirement due to problems with cogeneration startup. the burner has
since been shut down with operation of the cogeneration facility. one complaint was received regarding flyash from a
burner. one burner failed to meet smoke opacity limits due to a power outage. one boiler failed to meet smoke opacity
limits due to an equipment issue. one sawmill failed to submit monthly burner reports and dustfall test results for
several months in 2005. one sawmill failed to submit an annual report for burner operations for 2004.
     at board facilities, one osb plant was issued a ticket for open burning in the plant yard that occurred when a load
of hot board from the press was pulled outside and caught fire.
     at pulpmill operations, particulate emissions from a power boiler exceeded the permit limit by 3%.


effluent – at pulpmills, composite effluent samples were not taken for two days; one monthly qa/qc requirement for

total suspended solids was not performed.
     at a plywood plant, the annual report required by the effluent permit was submitted after the due date.


landfill – at sawmills, one landfill report was submitted after the due date.

     at a plywood plant, the annual report required by the landfill permit was submitted after the due date.


spills – canfor manufacturing operations had 9 reportable spills in 2005. all were contained, cleaned up and preventive

actions taken. the spills were all to ground and included: four spills of process water; two spills of thermal oil; one spill
of hydraulic fluid; one spill of pulp process liquor; and one spill of pulp effluent.


performance versus objectives in 2005


air quality
objective – as a result of the prince george pulpmill 48mw power project, particulate matter and total reduced sulphur

emissions will be reduced with the upgrade of environmental controls at the smelt-dissolving stack and with the
conversion of the recovery boiler to a low odor-emitting boiler. two beehive burners in nearby communities will also be
shut down as a result of the project.




                                  c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n   3   s u s ta i n a b i l i t y r e p o r t 2 0 0 5

performance – the last major stage of the power project was implemented in december 2005 with installation of

a second precipitator on the recovery boiler. preliminary indications are that targets for particulate reduction will
be met. reductions in total reduced sulphur have exceeded expectations. one tier 1 beehive burner has been
permanently shut down and one other burner shut down with provisions to run on an as needed basis to balance wood
residue inventories.


ems for wood products
objectives –

  ■   hold a one day session in may for environmental coordinators that do not have previous ems experience.
  ■   begin development of basic elements of ems at new canfor wood products operations including developing site-
      specific environmental aspects, environmental objectives and targets and programs, and conducting management
      reviews.


performance – the ems session for environmental coordinators was attended by representatives from every new

canfor operation and by all that were newly appointed to the position. the program included an overview of an ems as
defined by iso 14001 as well as an exercise in identifying and ranking site environmental aspects.
      all new canfor wood products operations have developed a site-specific registry of ranked environmental aspects,
set targets for 2006 and held a management review.


ems for tmp mill
objectives –

  ■   develop an aspect registry
  ■   set objectives and targets
  ■   develop environmental programs


performance – the tmp mill has developed an aspect registry with environmental risks ranked according to severity,

probability and countermeasures. targets have been set for the higher ranked aspects for completion in 2006. the
development of environmental programs will continue in 2006 for high priority environmental aspects.


thermal oil systems
objective – we will work with council of forest industries toward the development of an approved training program for

operators of thermal oil systems.


performance – increasing sawmill production and increasing energy costs have resulted in more thermal oil systems in

the province. rather than a custom training program for operators of thermal oil systems, the bc safety authority has
recommended that the minister endorse a reclassification of these systems. the existing requirements do not reflect
the risk level of thermal oil systems.

wood residue management
objective – we will continue to develop economically viable solutions to meet tier 1 burner phase out requirements and

create value from our wood residue.


performance – in mid-2005, one of canfor’s three remaining tier 1 burners was permanently shut down with surplus

wood residue going to the prince george pulpmill power project. a second tier 1 burner will be phased out by the end
of 2007 with a $56 million energy system and joint venture pellet plant project. we are working towards a solution for
the final tier 1 burner involving a bark-fired energy system and whitewood utilization by third parties.


audits
objective – we will conduct corporate environmental audits of three pulp mills, six sawmill operations, one osb plant,

one plywood plant and one remanufacturing plant.


performance – audits were conducted as planned with the exception of two sawmills, which were sold in early 2005.

objectives and targets for 2006


the following are corporate level objectives and targets for 2006.


air quality
we will contribute to airshed research in prince george so that air quality improvement can be accelerated through cost
effective management actions.


ems
we will provide environmental coordinators of our operations with the knowledge and resources required to achieve
continual improvement, reduce the frequency of noncompliance incidents and minimize impact on the environment.
three key areas of focus are:
  ■   training of new environmental coordinators
  ■   support for further development of environmental management systems
  ■   managing the 2006 audit program for maximum benefit to auditors and operations


drinking water
we will support canfor’s drinking water system operators with:
  ■   regulatory updates
  ■   drinking water audit protocol used at all environmental audits
  ■   on site inspections for operations that have not previously been visited by engineers qualified to assess potable
      water systems


wood residue management
we will finalize and implement phase out plans for canfor’s remaining tier 1 burners.


audits
we will conduct corporate environmental audits of seven sawmill operations, and two remanufacturing plants.

commitment to employees




canfor operations are all required to conduct comprehensive annual health & safety audits using a standard audit
process across the entire company.
     each year canfor holds a health & safety conference in prince george, bc. in 2005, 260 delegates representing
all of canfor’s operating divisions attended the 2-day conference.
     for 2005, canfor revised the criteria for its president’s safety award, basing it on medical incident rates (mir).
three categories were established and were won by howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (1.30, lowest
mir for 2005); intercontinental pulp (1.68, lowest mir for three consecutive years, 2003-2005); and tackama division
(4.10/9.68, greatest percentage mir improvement in 2005/2004).
     canfor has set a target mir of 2.00 or lower for all of its operating divisions to be achieved by the end of 2008.
     as a leading integrated forest products company, how we compare within the industry is extremely important to
us. based on the 2005 bc forest industry advisory service (fias) reports, canfor’s interior sawmills ranked first out
of six in the interior lumber sector in the lost time frequency rate and medical incident rates. furthermore, within
its comparative group of five companies in the panels/plywood sector, canfor ranked second in terms of lost time
frequency rate and first in medical incident rate (mir).
     canfor has been an active participant on the forest safety council. the council has been working with worksafe
bc to develop strategies and action plans to eliminate forest industry serious incidents and injuries. major initiatives
of the council include a faller safety certification program for hand fallers and ‘truck safe’, a program to improve log
truck hauling safety performance.

the challenge to foster community
at canfor, we realize that the slogan “our roots are in this community” carries with it a lot of responsibility. in the
communities where we operate, we have a responsibility not only to our employees but also to the community at large.
we have a responsibility to support organizations and initiatives that will improve the communities that we call home
and the lives of the people who live and work there.
     our corporate giving focuses on the areas of youth and education, community enhancement, forestry and
environment, amateur sport and health and wellness – areas our employees told us were most important to them.
     canfor strives to build partnerships with local organizations to enhance the community’s social and economic
development. through our community investment program, donation requests are reviewed locally by employees who
live and work in the area and funding decisions are based on the specific needs of the community.


an opportunity to build hope
in 2005, canfor partnered with habitat for humanity to help build a home in prince george, british columbia and a
multi-family development in edmonton, alberta. habitat for humanity is an independent, non-profit housing program
dedicated to the elimination of poverty housing by building homes in partnership with families in need. in addition to a
significant corporate contribution of building materials, canfor employees donated “sweat equity” over many weekends
to help construct the homes.


an opportunity to make a difference
canfor has a long tradition of supporting the united way. through employee contributions and corporate matching,
canfor donated nearly $460,000 last year to the prince george united way, the thompson nicola cariboo united way,
the grande prairie and district united way, and the united way of the lower mainland. in addition, in september 2005,
canfor head office employees took part in the united way’s annual “day of caring”, painting the boardroom and hallway
at the western institute for the deaf and hard of hearing.
     canfor also renewed its commitment and increased funding for the canfor: building family foundations initiative.
established in 2001, it funds programs and services to help ensure families have access to the resources they need to
construct a healthy, functioning family unit.


an opportunity to promote learning
canfor is committed to making higher education more accessible for students in our operating regions and as part
of this commitment, currently offers 54 awards at post-secondary institutions in bc and alberta and 48 awards to
graduating high school students to continue their education.
     with a goal of developing leaders of the future, canfor created the president’s student program. the president’s
student program takes high performing students and places them in canfor operations for a work term under the
supervision of an employee mentor. the program’s objectives are to provide the opportunity to tackle specific projects in
our operations and sales and marketing area that could improve performance; to build close working relationships with
academic institutions; to transfer knowledge from participating institutions to the company; to provide high potential
students with superior work experiences to supplement their academic studies; and to encourage the best students
to look to canfor for permanent employment upon graduation. in 2005, 18 students worked with canfor though the
president’s student program.

management’s discussion and analysis



the management’s discussion and analysis (md&a) provides a review of the significant developments that have impacted canfor’s performance during
2005 relative to 2004. factors that could impact future operations are also discussed. these factors may be influenced by known and unknown risks and
uncertainties that could cause the actual results to be materially different from those stated in this discussion. in addition to the risks and uncertainties
discussed at the end of this md&a, factors that could have a material impact on any future oriented statements made herein include, but are not limited to:
general economic, market and business conditions; product selling prices; raw material and operating costs; foreign exchange rates; changes in law and
public policy; the outcome of trade disputes; and opportunities available to or pursued by canfor.
       this md&a should be read in conjunction with canfor’s audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. the financial information
contained within this report has been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles. throughout this discussion, reference
is also made to ebitda (calculated as operating income before amortization), which canfor considers to be an important indicator for identifying trends in
the performance of each operating segment and of the company’s ability to generate funds to meet its debt repayment and capital expenditure requirements.
ebitda is not a generally accepted earnings measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flows as determined in accordance
with canadian generally accepted accounting principles. as there is no standardized method of calculating ebitda, canfor’s use of the term may not be
directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
       the information in this report is as at february 15, 2006.

overview of 2005


the strong canadian dollar and poor markets, along with the lingering softwood lumber dispute, combined to negatively impact the 2005
results. canfor’s priority remains the profitability of the company in any market and to positively influence the controllable elements of
the business. in 2005, canfor sold or closed six operations that were either underperforming assets or simply not core to the business.
over $300 million was invested into the mills in 2005 and the company continued to improve its operating and supply chain processes.
the capital projects at polarboard and plateau and the start up of the co-generation facility at the prince george pulp and paper mill
are expected to further lower canfor’s cost structure going forward, and the joint venture osb mill in fort st john has commenced
production. these improvements are expected to positively impact canfor’s financial performance in 2006.
      in 2005, the focus was on positioning the company for success. canfor’s initiatives were driven by the strategy to be a highly
profitable producer of building materials and the preferred supplier to markets around the world. the restructuring of the company’s
assets, along with the announced canfor international distribution centre and the memorandum of understanding with the chinese
academy of forestry in beijing, are all elements of this strategy. the company is looking forward to the pending purchase of new south
companies inc. in the southeastern united states. new south will assist canfor in diversifying its market and product mix, which is
consistent with canfor’s global building products strategy.


highlights

      on february 15, 2006, canfor announced its intention to separate its pulp business from its wood products business by transferring
      its northwood pulp mill, intercontinental pulp mill and prince george pulp and paper mill, together with associated management
      and employees, to an indirectly owned limited partnership (the “pulp income trust”). canfor will distribute a 20% interest in the
      pulp income trust to its shareholders and retain an 80% interest. this transaction furthers canfor’s strategy of focusing on the
      wood products business, while still participating in the improved business fundamentals of the pulp and paper operation. the trust
      is expected to pay out the majority of its distributable cash to unit holders on a regular basis. the completion of the pulp income
      trust is subject to a number of approvals, including approval by canfor’s shareholders at a special meeting expected to occur in
      june 2006.

      on january 18, 2006, canfor announced the acquisition of new south companies inc. headquartered in south carolina, new south
      operates three sawmills with an annual capacity of 425 million board feet of southern yellow pine, two treating plants, a finger joint
      plant and a european lumber import business. new south generated total revenues and ebitda of approximately us $500 million
      and us $35 million respectively in 2005. canfor expects to capture annual supply chain related synergies of approximately us $10
      million from this acquisition. the transaction, valued at us $205 million, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.

      in december 2005, canfor announced the restructuring of its englewood logging operations, in which the assets will be transferred
      to western forest products in exchange for a long-term agreement to supply the howe sound pulp and paper mill with fibre. the
      transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.

       in november 2005, canfor unveiled its market strategy for asia, which included the opening of a new marketing office in shanghai
       and the signing of an historical memorandum of understanding with the chinese academy of forestry and the shanghai school of
       construction engineering to establish a vocational program for wood building practices. the second pillar of the strategy was for
       canfor to increase market share and profitability by working closely with customers and responding to their needs, which has led
       to the development of the jadestar tm lumber brand for the japanese market.

       construction of the peace valley osb plant, canfor’s joint venture project with louisiana pacific corp. in fort st john, was
       substantially completed by the end of 2005, with commercial production beginning in the latter part of december. this plant has
       an annual production capacity of 820 million square feet.

       work on the plateau sawmill modernization project progressed during the year and will be completed in early 2006.

       the co-generation facility at the prince george pulp and paper mill was completed, with energy savings of $7.3 million realized in
       the latter half of 2005. the precipitator upgrade was completed ahead of schedule in december and substantially all of the benefits
       should be realized in 2006. the combined benefits of the co-generation and precipitator projects are projected by management at
       $23 million on an annual basis.

       in the second quarter, canfor announced that a privately owned international distribution centre was being constructed in
       richmond, bc. this facility will be dedicated to servicing the japanese and other developing asia pacific markets for canfor and
       it will be the lower mainland’s largest covered lumber reload facility, with storage capacity to accommodate 20 million board feet
       of lumber. canfor has committed to approximately 300 million board feet of lumber throughput at the international distribution
       centre for its japanese and asia pacific customers.

       in the second quarter, as part of the company’s strategic realignment of its assets, canfor completed the sale of three of its higher
       cost lumber operations and a subsidiary involved in the development and marketing of forest management information systems.
       two additional higher cost sawmills were closed in the third quarter.

       canfor was recognized at the national forest leadership conference in toronto for its visionary work on the coast of british
       columbia. the forest leadership conference brings together companies and certifiers to discuss sustainable forest management
       and certification. working with environmental groups, canfor and its peers designed a sustainable logging strategy for the coast
       aimed at putting an end to the market campaigns targeting customers of coastal products.

       the canadian manufacturers and exporters association gave canfor their top award of “bc’s exporter of the year”, based on
       canfor’s work with home centres in the us, its strategic initiatives to minimize the impact of the port of vancouver strike, and its
       asia strategy. canfor was also awarded “exporter of the year” in the resource sector, in recognition of its excellence in supply
       chain management and market development.

2005 compared to 2004


2004 was a year of exceptionally good market conditions, and canfor achieved record earnings of $415.5 million. 2005 was a more
challenging year, with a stronger canadian dollar, lower average prices (lumber down 10%, plywood 27% and osb 14%), transportation
challenges, mill closures and other production downtime.
           severe cold weather in early january 2005 created operational difficulties, resulting in lower production and increased unit costs in
the sawmills and pulp mills. the plateau sawmill re-build project resulted in reduced production in the third and fourth quarters. osb
production was significantly reduced in the fourth quarter as a result of a major equipment failure and start-up issues at polarboard.
           railcar shortages in the first quarter of 2005 severely limited shipment volumes of all products in that period. in the first half of the
third quarter, a strike by the container truckers at the port of vancouver hampered offshore shipments of lumber and pulp.
           in 2005, pre-tax restructuring costs of $5.3 million ($4.2 million after tax) were incurred, which included $3.8 million of closure
costs for the tackama and hines creek sawmills and severance and other costs of $1.5 million. restructuring costs of $36.5 million
before tax ($28.8 million after tax) were incurred in 2004 as a result of the integration of slocan after its combination with canfor. these
costs included $18.6 million of severance, $10.7 million of mill closure costs and $7.2 million of asset write-downs and lease costs.


significant factors affecting the comparability of 2005 and 2004 are noted below:

as the majority of canfor's sales are to us customers, the strengthening of the canadian dollar since 2003 has significantly reduced
revenues and net income, particularly in 2005, when the dollar averaged 82.5 cents, which was its highest level since 1992.

the main factors affecting the comparability of the results over the last eight quarters were the integration of the former slocan
operations as of april 1, 2004, changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar, which impact us dollar revenues and
the translation of us dollar denominated long-term debt, and changes in lumber, pulp, plywood and osb prices, as highlighted in the
table above.
      one-time items that had a significant impact on quarterly results include restructuring and mill closure provisions of $18.3 million,
$0.3 million and $10.2 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004 respectively, $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2005,
and $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2005 (all figures are after tax). the second quarter 2005 results were reduced by a $4.0 million

after-tax loss on the sale of the fort st james, slocan and valemount sawmills, which was subsequently increased by $0.7 million in
the fourth quarter. the third quarter 2005 results were negatively impacted by an $8.9 million after-tax write-down of timber licenses,
which was subsequently reduced to $6.2 million after tax in the fourth quarter. in the third quarter of 2005, the bc corporate income tax
rate was reduced by 1.5%, which resulted in a $21.0 million favourable adjustment to the current and future income tax liability being
recorded in the period. the fourth quarter 2005 results were reduced by a $5.2 million after-tax expense for the executive long-term
incentive plan and by $1.8 million of bad debt, severance and lease terminations costs related to coastal operations ($0.9 million in the
second quarter). favourable items affecting the fourth quarter 2005 results include $8.9 million of income from the seaboard general
partnership and $2.0 million of scientific research and development tax credits claimed.

cause logging curtailments, which can affect the supply of raw materials to sawmills, plywood and osb plants, and pulp mills. market
demand also varies seasonally to some degree. for example, building activity and repair and renovation work, which affect demand for
lumber and panel products, are generally stronger in the spring and summer months. shipment volumes are affected by these factors
as well as by global supply and demand conditions. shortages in railcar supply had an adverse impact on shipment volumes in the first
quarter of 2005 and also in the first three quarters of 2004. a container truckers’ strike at the port of vancouver impacted offshore
shipments in the third quarter of 2005.


fourth quarter results


an operating loss of $14.7 million and a net loss of $12.3 million were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with operating
income of $20.3 million and net income of $43.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004.
     the main reasons for the decrease in earnings were the strengthening of the canadian dollar, which averaged 4% stronger in the
fourth quarter of 2005 than in the same period in 2004, and lower prices for lumber (3% lower), plywood (14% lower), and pulp (1% lower),
partially offset by a 22% increase in osb prices. although the dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter, the closing value was weaker
than it had been at the end of the third quarter, which resulted in a $4.7 million loss on the translation of long-term debt for the fourth
quarter. in comparison, a $36.1 million gain on the translation of long-term debt was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004.

     the lumber segment reported an operating loss of $13.1 million in the quarter, compared to operating income of $16.6 million
     in the same period in 2004. lower shipments volumes of canfor-produced lumber, in addition to the unfavourable exchange and
     price factors noted above, and lower chip revenues as a result of lower chip prices implemented in the third quarter were the main
     reasons for the weaker financial performance. production of 1,049.9 million board feet was 15% lower than in 2004, mainly as a
     result of the closure of the tackama and hines creek sawmills in 2005, and reduced operations at the plateau sawmill in order to
     complete that facility’s strategic upgrade project.

     the panels segment reported an operating loss of $2.7 million in the quarter, compared to operating income of $19.9 million in the
     fourth quarter of 2004. lower plywood prices and higher energy costs factored into the poor results, and although osb prices were
     25% higher in the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact was more than offset by lower shipment volumes. a major equipment failure
     at the polarboard osb mill occurred in november 2005, and an 11-day emergency shutdown was taken to repair the equipment and
     to complete other maintenance work that had been planned for early 2006. the shutdown resulted in additional costs of $3.5 million
     and 16 million square feet of lost osb production in the quarter. the new osb joint venture in fort st john, which is proportionately
     consolidated in canfor’s results, began production in late december 2005, and incurred a loss of $0.8 million as a result of the low
     production volumes during the mill’s start-up phase.

     the pulp and paper segment earned operating income of $16.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared with an operating
     loss of $10.1 million in the same quarter in 2004. when compared with last year, the impact of lower prices and a stronger canadian
     dollar in the fourth quarter of 2005 was more than offset by the favourable impact of the lower chip prices, lower energy costs
     resulting from the new co-generation facility, a $2.3 million scientific research and development tax credit and $1.4 million of
     forward contract hedging gains.

     corporate costs were $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. the main
     factors contributing to the higher costs in the fourth quarter were a $6.5 million accrual for the executive long-term incentive
     plan related to the last two fiscal years, $1.0 million of severance costs and higher donations, consulting fees and employee
     relocation costs.

     other income of $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 was mainly comprised of $8.9 million of seaboard general partnership
     income, partially offset by $1.3 million of other equity losses. in the fourth quarter of 2004, other expense of $0.7 million included
     a $3.0 million write-off of project costs, partially offset by $2.3 million of equity income. also in the fourth quarter of 2005, a $2.3
     million favourable adjustment was recorded to the timber take-back loss of $11.1 million recorded in the third quarter.



2005 operating results


the following discussion of canfor’s operating results relates to the operating segments and the non-segmented items as per the
segmented information note in the financial statements. canfor’s operations include the following three operating segments: lumber,
panels and pulp and paper. the former coastal operations segment has been reclassified as non-operating, as discussed under the
“discontinued operations” section, below. when comparing the 2005 operating results with 2004, it should be noted that the 2004 results
include the results of the former slocan operations for the nine months following the acquisition on april 1.

     major achievements in 2005

        strategic capital investments in margin-added technologies:

             the strategic upgrade of the plateau sawmill

             installation of grade optimization technologies to enhance market profile at the mackenzie and radium operations

             increased focus on products such as pet (precision-end-trim) studs, msr (machine-stress-rated) and prime
             shorter lengths

        quesnel operation experienced a 22% gain in sawmill productivity following the start-up curve on its capital project

        7% increase in productivity and a 7% increase in prime grade production

        2% decrease in total manufacturing costs




the lumber segment is focused on optimizing profitability from its sawmill assets and fibre resources in order to meet customer needs
for high-quality, eco-certified, branded products.
     the segment consists of logging and forestry operations, which harvested from approximately 10.2 million1 cubic metres of
allowable annual cut in northern british columbia, northern alberta and quebec in 2005, and operates 13 sawmills in british columbia,
one in alberta and one in quebec, which have a combined lumber production capacity of 4.7 billion board feet. other operations include
two lumber remanufacturing facilities, one in british columbia and one in washington state, two whole-log chipping plants, which have
an annual capacity of over 0.3 million oven-dried tonnes of wood chips (total chip capacity is 2.5 million for all wood products operations),
and two finger-joint mills. the segment also includes canfor’s wood products marketing division, located in vancouver.

     marketing strategy

          continue to align with customers that are close to end users and to reduce the wholesale sales component.

          increase committed sales volume with key customers

          increase market share in emerging asian markets.

          focus on developing margin-added product opportunities that provide greater returns to canfor’s fibre resources.
          higher-value lumber grades include square edge, j-grade, machine-stress-rated, fingerjoint studs and primed
          fascia products.

          explore new distribution opportunities, including canfor’s international distribution centre in richmond, bc, which
          will enable consolidation of offshore-bound container shipments.




the wholesale component of lumber sales was reduced by 4% in 2005:

               optimize profitability from facilities and fibre resources, while aligning with the marketing strategy

               top quartile cost structure and margins

               product excellence, including service component




the focus in 2005 was on employing best practices for quality control and value optimization. the lumber operation’s manufacturing
strategy is aligned with canfor’s marketing strategy, which is to be diversified into the major customer segments of home centre, “pro
dealer”, industrial and national builders and to be aligned with the largest and best customers in these segments. canfor’s extensive
reload lumber inventory network in key geographic locations in the us provides a distinct competitive advantage. canfor services its
customers through supply chain management (vendor managed inventories and just-in-time delivery), which provides an advantage over
its competitors in these markets. shortages in skilled labour continue to drive changes in house construction trends, with a shift from
traditional stick built homes to more component built homes leading to increased engineering and product substitution. as a result,
canfor’s manufacturing facilities must have flexibility to produce the full array of products, including pet (precision-end-trimmed)
studs, msr (machine-stress-rated), and shorter length lumber.


summarized results for the lumber segment for 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

ebitda declined by $243.7 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. market factors and exchange negatively impacted earnings by $356.0
million, with the benchmark 2x4 #2 & better lumber price decreasing by 10% in 2005, or 16% when expressed in canadian dollars.
adding to these external factors was the negative impact of lower chip market-based pricing implemented on july 1, 2005. this change
resulted in an unfavourable income variance of $32.0 million in the lumber segment as compared to 2004, but was largely offset by the
reduced chip costs in the pulp and paper segment.

operating performance
positive trends were experienced in a number of key performance indicators relative to 2004, despite continuing input cost pressures,
smaller log size and declining log quality resulting from increased beetle harvest. improvements were seen in production (9% increase
over 2004), prime grade production (improved by 7%), and total manufacturing costs (2% reduction over 2004). the majority of these
improvements were realized once the start-up curves associated with capital upgrades at the houston, prince george, quesnel and
fort st john sawmills were complete. non-capital driven initiatives accounted for the remaining performance improvements, with an
emphasis on quality and optimization programs developed through 2004 and implemented early in 2005. although fuel and energy costs
rose by 9% and labour costs increased by 3% as compared to 2004, total unit manufacturing costs were down 2%. this result was driven
by a 7% reduction in maintenance spending in combination with the above-noted productivity gains. log costs decreased by 2% in 2005
over 2004, mainly because of the increased harvesting of lower grade logs. lumber recovery improved by 1% over 2004, as best practices
for quality and optimization are being continually implemented throughout canfor’s operations and are showing positive results.
     extremely cold temperatures in the first two weeks of january affected production volumes and recoveries at most of the sawmills.
however, by early february productivity had improved significantly, with production records being set at several mills. picketing action
during the log haulers’ dispute in the prince george area resulted in one-day production stoppages at each of the houston, plateau,
isle pierre and polar sawmills in the first quarter. lumber operations performed well in the second quarter, with key performance
indicators improving significantly over the first quarter, largely as a result of milder weather conditions and a strong focus on continuous
improvement. production decreased in the third quarter as a result of maintenance shutdowns at several three-shift operations,
curtailments at specific locations to balance inventories, and a 10-day shutdown for capital installations at the plateau sawmill. work
continued through the fourth quarter on the plateau strategic expansion. primary equipment was in place and testing substantially
complete by the end of the year. capital spending, start-up and project benefits are all anticipated to be at or near expectation. with
the significantly reduced operations at the plateau sawmill and seasonal downtime at other mills, production in the fourth quarter
decreased by 7%.
     railcar supply was a major issue impacting shipment volumes in the first quarter of 2005. however, shipment volumes improved
in the second quarter, as a result of increased demand during the active building season and efficiencies in supply through improved rail
car availability and the scheduling of marine shipments to transport product to canfor’s major us customers.

mill closures / dispositions
     the sale of the fort st james sawmill and related tenures, which was required by the competition bureau as a condition to the
     slocan acquisition in 2004, was completed in the second quarter.

     the high-cost valemount and slocan operations were also sold in the second quarter.

     because of the increasing demand on alberta’s fibre supply, canfor determined that the availability of timber for harvest was not
     sufficient to sustain both of its two operations in that province. as a result, in the third quarter canfor permanently closed its hines
     creek operation in order to focus the amount of fibre available for processing at its grande prairie facility.

     the high-cost tackama sawmill in fort nelson was permanently closed in september.

     mill closure costs of $3.8 million were recorded in the year, mainly related to the tackama sawmill as well as some final costs for
the closure of the hines creek operation. in 2004, mill closure costs of $16.1 million were recorded, related to the closures of the taylor,
upper fraser and hines creek sawmills and the quesnel specialty mill. closure costs associated with the fort st james, valemount and
slocan operations were recorded in discontinued operations.


countervailing (cvd) and anti-dumping (add) duties
in the current year, canfor expensed combined cvd and add duties of $224.8 million (2004 - $276.2 million), and has paid combined duty
deposits of us $733.4 million since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002.
     in december 2005, after completing its administrative review for the period from may 2003 to april 2004 (por2), the us department
of commerce (doc) determined a cvd assessment rate of 8.70% for all canadian companies for por2 and an add assessment rate for
canfor of 1.36% (subsequently corrected by the doc in january 2006 to 1.35%). cash deposits on lumber shipments after december 12,
2005 are being made at these lower rates.
     at december 31, 2005, canfor had accrued additional cvd of $67.4 million in excess of the cash deposits made (included in
“other accruals and provisions” on the balance sheet) and had accrued $113.7 million of cumulative add cash deposits in excess of
the calculated expense (included in “long-term investments and other” on the balance sheet). canfor has not adjusted the previously
expensed duties to reflect the lower revised rates, as noted above, due to the uncertainty over the timing of receipt of refunds.
     a comprehensive discussion of the history and current status of the duties is included in the risks and uncertainties section of
this document.


markets
2005 was another outstanding year for the us housing market. new records for home sales, single-family starts and residential
remodeling were set in 2005. relatively low interest rates, steady income growth, and positive consumer confidence resulted in the
construction of 2.06 million new homes, which is a 6% increase from 2004. this is the highest level since 1972. single-family housing
starts increased to a historical high of 1.7 million units and, as a proportion of total housing starts, increased from 82% in 2004 to 88%
in 2005. as a result, sales volumes in 2005 to canfor’s key professional dealer customers increased by 15% over 2004. while the overall
demand was strong, supply was readily available throughout most of the distribution channels, resulting in western spf 2x4 #2 & better
prices declining by 10% from a year ago to an average price of us$355 per mfbm.

     another aspect of the strong housing market was the record amount spent in the repair and remodeling industry, resulting from
very high levels of existing home sales. in 2005, continuing low interest rates motivated many homeowners to refinance their mortgages
and consequently increase their spending. even though the refinancing activity was lower than in 2004, the combined increase in
spending and the appreciation in housing prices provided strong incentives for homeowners to invest in renovating their existing homes.
as a result, canfor’s sales to the growing home centre segment remained strong, at 16% of total shipments.
     after the two hurricanes in the us gulf coast in the third quarter, the immediate focus was on the construction of temporary
shelters for those residents who lost their homes. this activity fuelled much of the demand for lumber and panel products during this
period. large-scale reconstruction efforts are expected to continue over the next few years.
     lumber sales to japan during the second half of 2005 were stronger than during the first half of the year, which contributed to
a shortage of j-grade lumber in the fourth quarter. the lengthy independent container truckers’ strike in vancouver during the third
quarter prevented container shipments to japan. despite this, canfor’s overall market share in japan increased in 2005. canfor’s
continued sales and marketing efforts in china, malaysia, indonesia and vietnam have increased shipments by 10% over 2004. this was
achieved despite two months of shipment reductions due to the container strike. in 2005, total offshore sales represented 7% of canfor’s
lumber shipments.
     despite the strong demand, the competitive position of canadian producers was reduced due to the canadian dollar appreciating
by 7% against the us dollar in 2005 and the continuing countervailing and anti-dumping duties on exports to the united states.


risks and uncertainties
stumpage rates – as part of its forestry revitalization plan, the provincial government is considering changes to the bc interior

stumpage system, which are expected to come into effect in april 2006. the impact of these changes to canfor, if any, is not quantifiable
at this time.


mountain pine beetle (mpb) – the mountain pine beetle continues to pose a significant threat to the lodgepole pine forests in the interior

regions of british columbia. a significant portion of this infestation is within canfor’s operating areas. lodgepole pine accounts for 25%
of the total timber volume harvested in british columbia and more than 50% of the total timber volume harvested by canfor.
     the mountain pine beetle infestation in british columbia now impacts approximately 411 million cubic metres of lodgepole pine
and has spread at a rate that has averaged approximately 59% per year for the last five years. the quesnel, prince george, morice and
lakes timber supply areas (tsas), all integral to canfor manufacturing facilities, continue to be the most heavily impacted. in addition,
the infestation also impacts at least seven other tsas in which canfor operates, including the kamloops, mackenzie, and dawson creek
tsas. although the levels of attack are still relatively low, the rate of spread in the dawson creek tsa is high and it does present a risk
to the chetwynd operation. there is also a risk of entry of mountain pine beetle into canfor’s alberta forest management agreement
area, which is approximately 40% lodgepole pine. this risk has resulted in an ongoing joint effort by canfor, the ministry of forests &
range, weyerhaeuser and the alberta government to attempt to suppress the beetle in the dawson creek tsa.




                  c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5        31          m a n a g e m e n t ' s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

     canfor is working with the ministry of forests & range and other operators in several areas to implement an aggressive program
to mitigate the spread of infestation by redirecting planned timber development to infected regions over the next five years. this has
resulted in nearly 85% of the current wood supply to canfor’s prince george area mills being comprised of beetle harvest.
     the average diameter of affected lodgepole pine logs tends to be smaller than traditional harvests and requires some realignment
and re-tooling of manufacturing facilities in the prince george region to fit with the changing fibre supply. in the short-term, canfor is
assessing appropriate capital expenditures to realign its prince george area manufacturing capabilities to accommodate the increase
in fibre from beetle-infested logs. if the outbreak continues to spread, the potential implications for canfor include an eventual reduced
fibre supply, a change in lumber product mix, increased costs and a potential decrease in the quality of lumber and chips produced. the
general consensus is that beetle-killed timber will remain merchantable for 5 to 15 years, depending on local site conditions. research
to gain more information about “shelf life” is one of the projects relative to the mountain pine beetle that canfor is supporting.
     the provincial government’s focus in the quesnel, prince george, morice and the lakes tsas among others has shifted to salvage
of beetle-killed timber rather than on suppression activities. in 2004 the provincial chief forester revised the aac in the quesnel,
prince george and the lakes tsas upward by approximately 4 million cubic metres to encourage salvage activities. several new non-
replaceable forest tenures have been and will be advertised for those areas, inviting proposals for the use of this salvage volume.
managing the potential safety issues associated with this increased harvesting activity continues to be a key focus for canfor. eventually
(projected by management to be 10 to 20 years from now), the aac in the affected tsas will have to be reduced to counter-balance the
current increases in aac. the extent of these future reductions is unknown at this time.
     late in 2004 canfor, in conjunction with the city of prince george and local ministry of forests & range representatives, developed
recommendations for a salvage strategy for affected lodgepole pine trees on provincial crown land, city land and private property within
the city limits. the minister of forests acted on these recommendations by offering community forest tenure to the city of prince george.
canfor is assisting the city with their efforts to apply for and manage this tenure.


outlook
markets - in 2006, new home construction and repair and remodeling activity are expected to decline slightly from the record levels

in 2005. higher house prices, rising interest rates and concerns over rising energy costs and inflation may result in a weakening in
housing demand and lower consumer spending. however, with the us economy expected to grow moderately in 2006 and the continuing
reconstruction of homes in the hurricane-affected states, activity in the housing sector is projected to remain relatively strong.


operations – operating activities in 2006 are designed to enhance canfor’s operating performance and increase the alignment between

manufacturing and marketing strategies.
     in 2006 the operating focus will be on the completion and start up of capital projects initiated in 2005 including those at the plateau,
mackenzie, houston and radium mills. these capital projects were implemented to target canfor’s strategy of improving margins,
reducing costs and aligning production activities with the overall marketing strategy. additional capital projects will be initiated and
completed in 2006 with the aim of further capitalizing on this strategy.
     in conjunction with these capital projects the group will continue to focus its attention in the following areas: implementation of
quality control and optimization systems developed in 2005; a focus on supply chain initiatives, including forecasting and order fulfillment;
the execution of continuous improvement programs in all areas; and the development of people and organizational strength.

the panel segment includes two plywood plants, one in prince george and one in fort nelson, british columbia, with a combined annual
production capacity of 450 million square feet (3/8” basis). the segment also includes an oriented strand board (osb) facility, polarboard,
located in fort nelson, with an annual production capacity of 650 million square feet (3/8” basis). at december 2005, construction of the
new osb mill in fort st john, jointly owned with louisiana pacific corporation, was substantially complete, with production commencing
late in the month. the mill will have the capacity to produce 820 million square feet (3/8” basis), of which canfor’s share is 50%. a panel
and fibre operation, located in new westminster, british columbia, produces hardboard, refined fibre and wood fibre composite mat
products for building, automotive and industrial uses.

(4) includes the results of the slocan operations for the nine months following the acquisition on april 1, 2004.




ebitda decreased by $92.2 million over 2004, mainly due to the sharp decline in panel prices in the second half of 2005. for the full
year, canadian dollar plywood prices averaged 27% lower than in 2004, and us denominated osb prices declined by 13%, or 19% when
expressed in canadian dollars. in 2005, 85% of canfor’s plywood production was shipped to canadian markets, 14% to the u.s., and 1%
to japan. the majority of osb was shipped to us western markets (78%) and the rest to canada (22%).

     marketing strategy


     plywood


           target higher-value end users – industrials, vmi (vendor-managed inventory) and home centres

     osb


           target us west

           leverage lumber relationships to increase sales into pro dealers and home centres and to increase committed
           sales volumes.




markets
north american structural panel demand rose to record levels in 2005, reflecting the continued strength in new housing starts in
the second half of the year and the brisk activity before and after the hurricanes in the us gulf coast area. similar to lumber, supply
exceeded demand at various times throughout the year. consequently, panel prices decreased from last year’s high.
     unlike lumber, canfor sells most of its panels through wholesale channels. to generate higher margins, the marketing focus for
the panels segment is to increase sales to pro dealers, home centres and builders. osb sales to these market segments increased by
13% in 2005.

           top quartile cost structure and margins

           product excellence, including service component




operating performance
plywood - after a slow start in january due to the severely cold weather, production milestones were set at the plywood operations in

the first quarter. north central plywood had excellent performance into the second quarter, increasing productivity and establishing
new daily production records. a software upgrade on the scanner was completed in the second quarter and early results indicate that
this will have a very positive impact on plywood recovery.
     the tackama operation had over 80 hours of downtime in the first quarter due to mechanical issues on the carousel and lathe. the
mill also took a 9-day maintenance shutdown in the third quarter in order to improve reliability and uptime measures.
     aggregate plywood performance included a 7% gain in productivity, along with a 4% improvement in plywood recovery, but these
positive results were offset by an 11% increase in log costs, which was primarily as a result of transfer pricing changes due to the
tackama sawmill closure.


osb – with the exception of a 6% gain in product recovery, 2005 was a disappointing year for osb performance. production declined by

8% from 2004, driven almost entirely by a number of downtime occurrences. the polarboard osb mill had some downtime in the first
quarter, which arose due to lack of dry flake, maintenance and reliability issues, and power outages. the mill was also shut down in the
last week of the first quarter for the installation of two new dryer drums and the completion of the planned capital project to increase
capacity. the capital project continued into the second quarter. after starting up, the mill set several daily production records and is
continuing to work through the anticipated start-up curve. as noted above, log recovery has improved by 6% as a result of process
improvements associated with the new equipment.
     in the fourth quarter, a major equipment failure occurred in the heat generation unit at the polarboard mill. an 11-day shutdown
was taken to repair the equipment and to complete other maintenance work that had been planned for early 2006. the shutdown resulted
in additional costs of $3.5 million and a production loss of 16 million square feet (3/8” basis). these extra repairs and maintenance costs,
along with a $2.2 million write-down of equipment replaced in the mill’s capacity upgrade project, cost increases for resins and wax, and
the overall lower production, caused manufacturing costs at this mill to increase by 41% over 2004.

canfor-lp osb limited partnership (operating as peace valley osb)
in 2000, slocan entered into a shareholders’ agreement with louisiana-pacific canada ltd. to jointly undertake construction and
operation of an osb mill with rated annual capacity of 820 million square feet (3/8” basis) in fort st john, british columbia. a limited
partnership was formed in 2004 to own the joint venture and carry on the business. canfor has agreed to supply 330,000 cubic metres of
timber annually to the joint venture out of its existing timber tenure in the area. a key strategic advantage of the peace valley osb mill
is the ability to produce high-value 9’ and 10’ panels for a growing market.
     in 2005, canfor made contributions of $102.3 million to the venture ($140.5 million to date) for construction costs, pre-production
expenses and working capital. canfor has agreed to contribute 50% of the capital to fund the project, which is estimated to have a total
funding requirement to both partners of approximately $288.0 million, of which $258.0 million is capital related, $17.0 million is for
deferred costs and the balance is for working capital. the original budget for the construction was exceeded by approximately $41.0
million as a result of scope and design changes ($11.0 million) and unforeseen cost increases relating to adverse weather conditions and
raw materials and labour costs ($30.0 million). at the end of 2005, construction was substantially complete and the mill had commenced
limited production in december. the mill currently estimates that it will be operating at 55% capacity by the end of the first quarter of
2006 and will ramp up to 90% capacity by the end of the year.
     canfor’s 50% interest in the joint venture/partnership has been proportionately consolidated at december 31, 2005 and an
operating loss of $0.8 million has been recognized in the year.


outlook
markets – demand for both osb and canadian softwood plywood is expected to remain fairly strong in 2006, boosted by the large-scale

rebuilding from the gulf coast hurricanes. however, supply increases in osb are expected to result in lower average osb prices in this
period.


operations –canfor’s plywood and osb facilities are focusing on producing more higher-return and value-added panels, which will have

a positive impact on margins in the future, with many of the capital and maintenance issues completed in 2005. the panel manufacturing
facilities are well-positioned for significantly improved productivity and financial performance in the next year.




pulp and paper


     major achievements in 2005


           earned ebitda of $68.4 million in difficult market conditions

           set records for annual average daily production at the northwood, intercon and taylor mills

           achieved record product quality levels at the northwood and prince george pulp mills

           completed the co-generation and precipitator projects at the prince george pulp mill




the pulp and paper segment is organized into 3 distinct business units: premium pulp, bctmp and specialty paper. canfor’s premium
pulp, which is produced from long northern british columbia wood fibres, offers the strength sought by paper makers worldwide, and
consists of the prince george, intercontinental and northwood pulp mills. premium pulp is also referred to as northern softwood kraft
(nsk). nsk is primarily a bleached product; however, unbleached and semi-bleached grades are also produced at the prince george
pulp mill. all of the mills are located within five kilometres of each other in prince george, british columbia with the exception of taylor,
which is located near fort st john, british columbia. the pulp mills have the annual capacity to produce over one million tonnes of
nsk pulp. over 200 thousand tonnes of bleached chemi-thermo mechanical pulp (bctmp) are produced at the taylor mill. the paper
machine, located at the prince george pulp and paper mill, has the capacity, at optimum product mix levels, to produce 135 thousand

tonnes of kraft paper. canfor’s pulp marketing division is located in vancouver. during 2005, canfor reorganized its paper marketing
division into a jointly-owned sales and marketing partnership with tolko industries ltd. the partnership is headquartered in kelowna,
british columbia.
     2005 was a challenging year for the premium pulp business. pulp markets have remained difficult. benchmark list pricing,
combined with a strengthening canadian dollar, resulted in average canadian dollar mill nets being near the historical bottom of the
market cycle. in spite of these challenges, positive earnings of $22.2 million and ebitda of $68.4 million were generated.

(4) includes the results of the slocan operations for the nine months following the acquisition on april 1, 2004.



2005 ebitda of $68.4 million was $21.2 million lower than in 2004. market factors and exchange negatively impacted earnings by $62.4
million, as canfor’s average us dollar nbsk price delivered to northern europe fell by 2%, or by 9% when expressed in canadian dollars.
productivity remained relatively flat, with annual records for average daily production at the intercon and northwood pulp mills offset
by slowed-back production at the prince george pulp mill while a second precipitator was being installed. positive factors offsetting
the external challenges included the benefit of lower chip prices, lower energy costs as a result of the co-generation facility, and lower
spending on maintenance and other costs. in addition, when comparing the results to the previous year, it should be noted that there
were $2.1 million of realized gains on forward exchange contracts and $2.3 million in scientific research and development (sr&ed) tax
credits included in the 2005 results.

     operating strategy


           to be a low cost producer of superior strength premium pulp




operating performance
total pulp and paper production for 2005 was 1.316 million tonnes, compared to 2004’s production of 1.276 million tonnes.
     combined northern softwood kraft production averaged 3,165 tonnes per day in 2005 compared to 3,160 tonnes in 2004. northwood
and intercon set average daily production records in 2005. northwood struggled early in the year due to cold weather and other
operational issues, averaging 1,508 tonnes per day through april. but, with the completion of a maintenance outage in april and extensive
maintenance and capital upgrades to the recovery boilers, northwood has averaged 1,622 tonnes per day from may though december.
production at prince george pulp was slowed back due to environmental constraints until the completion of the #1 recovery boiler
precipitator upgrade in december. the mill averaged 706 tonnes per day compared to the previous year’s rate of 767 tonnes per day.
     taylor's production for 2005 was 205,906 tonnes, which set a new annual production record, beating the 2004 record of 203,893 tonnes.
     the paper machine averaged 354 tonnes per day compared to 375 tonnes per day in 2004. the reduced production resulted from
mechanical and operational deficiencies, particularly in the second quarter.
     fibre costs averaged $81 per oven dried tonne (odt) in 2005 compared to $98 per odt in 2004. lower chip pricing was implemented
on july 1, 2005 as a result of supply/demand dynamics in the interior of bc, which was driven in part by the impact of incremental pine
beetle chips. 2005 chip costs were $39.8 million less than 2004. $12.3 million of this benefit was unrealized at the end of 2005, as the
savings resided in chip and pulp inventories, for a net benefit of $27.5 million included in the 2005 results.
     significant strides were made in cost reduction in 2005, with cash conversion costs for premium pulp ending the year 2% lower than
in 2004. maintenance costs continue to trend downward due to asset management initiatives and the realization of energy benefits from
the new co-generation facility at the prince george pulp mill and the recovery boiler upgrade work at northwood.
     the co-generation project at the prince george pulp and paper mill was completed mid 2005, with the conversion of the #2 recovery
boiler to a power boiler and the commissioning of the turbo generator. the prince george mill was slowed back in april, running to
liquor availability with the limited firing capacity of the #1 recovery boiler, until the new precipitator came online ahead of schedule on
december 15th. the main benefits of the co-generation facility are reduced electricity purchases, reduced natural gas consumption
and increased productivity. the benefit realized in 2005 from reduced purchased power was approximately $5.7 million. going forward
savings are estimated to be $14.2 million annually at current electricity prices. the 2005 benefit of reduced gas usage was approximately
$1.6 million and is expected to be $5.7 million annually. the precipitator project was completed in december 2005 and substantially
all of the benefits should be realized in 2006 as production ramps up and any operational issues are resolved. on an annual basis the
combined benefits of the co-generation and precipitator projects are estimated at $23.0 million.
     annual maintenance shutdowns have been successfully extended to an 18-month cycle for northwood and intercon, and prince
george pulp will complete its first 18-month cycle in early 2006.
     asset management initiatives continue to have a positive impact on maintenance spending, as reliability-centered maintenance,
risk-based inspections, defect elimination, planning, scheduling and optimization, and business performance management initiatives
provide the tools and resources to positively impact costs. total maintenance spending for 2005 was $91.8 million, compared to $102.5
million in 2003.

markets
premium pulp – at the beginning of 2005, there were 31 days of supply in inventory in the chemical paper grade market pulp industry (6),

after having completed 2004 with a shipments-to-capacity ratio of 107% in december. the strong finish to 2004 was indicative of
restocking by buyers in asian markets. stocks of bleached softwood market pulp, canfor’s key grade, stood at only 30 days of supply at
the beginning of 2005, which is the level at which producers are likely to have enough pricing power to raise prices. through december
2005, inventories increased slightly, to 32 days of supply, which included 30 days of bleached softwood market pulp.
       2005 started with northwest european pricing at us $630 per tonne, and the industry was able to take advantage of a tightening of
supply in the first and second quarters of the year to allow pricing to climb into the us $650 range. this pricing level was not sustainable
into the summer months, which is traditionally a slow demand period in the industry. prices dropped to the us $585 per tonne level
through the summer. a slight resurgence in demand in the fall, coupled with a rapidly strengthening canadian dollar, allowed producers
to push prices back up to us $600 by the end of the year. this pricing development through the year was similar to that of 2004.
       overall demand for chemical paper grade market pulp through november 2005 was only 1% higher than the same period one
year earlier. most of this gain was attributable to definitional changes in the shipments from some canadian pulp mills that changed
ownership at the end of 2004. most of the shipments from these mills were not considered market pulp in the past because they shipped
pulp to paper mills owned by the same parent company. north american shipments were up by 8% through december, mainly as a
result of this definitional change. western european shipments were down by 2.6%, japanese shipments were off by 4.1%, and china
shipments were unchanged.
       during 2005, canfor faced numerous external disruptions that impacted sales of market pulp. a major challenge to operations was
poor and inconsistent delivery of empty railcars to canfor’s pulp mills, particularly during the first and second quarters. this caused
the mills to incur extra costs such as outside warehousing costs, and also caused inventories to rise because sales had to be postponed
when product could not be shipped.
       another disruption to the mill operations was the withdrawal of container truck services during the strike by the vancouver
container truckers association that began june 27th. sales were delayed again and the mills had to carry extra inventory as a result of
this job action. on some sales, extra logistics costs had to be incurred in order to satisfy customer shipping requirements. as a result,
the strike added approximately us $0.9 million to canfor’s logistics costs during the third quarter.
       in 2005, fuel surcharges implemented by rail and shipping carriers amounted to increases of approximately 12%. these fuel
increases resulted in approximately us $1.8 million in incremental shipping costs.




(6) these inventory numbers are as reported by the pulp and paper products council for the world 19 group of producing countries. this group is estimated to represent 85% of world chemical
    market pulp capacity.

paper – during 2005, changes were made in the sales and marketing of the kraft paper produced in prince george. a general

partnership was formed with tolko industries ltd. to market and sell both companies’ kraft paper. by combining the sales efforts of both
companies under the new partnership, premium one papers, customers’ needs are better served with a wider product selection and
security of supply.



risks and uncertainties
the main business risks for the pulp and paper segment center upon pulp pricing, exchange rates and energy prices.
     to counter these risks, canfor will continue to strive for a low-cost position on the global cost curve for both pulp and paper.
successful implementation of the co-generation project has positioned the prince george mill to reduce its conversion costs down
to the level of canfor’s other mills. recovery boiler upgrade work completed in 2005 has enabled northwood to increase black liquor
solids throughput, resulting in increased mill capacity and reduced energy costs. an agreement with shell global solutions to implement
an asset management process saw continued success in 2005, reducing maintenance costs and increased reliability of production. in
addition, the period of time in between maintenance shutdowns has been lengthened to 18 months, and successfully implemented at the
intercon and northwood mills with pg pulp to complete its first full cycle in 2006. to address the risk of major breakdowns associated
with the increase in the shutdown cycle and to meet regulatory requirements, the mills perform “mini-shuts” within the 18-month period
in order to seek to address any issues that may arise.
     for paper, the continued focus to counter these risks will also be on increasing sales of higher-value products and phasing out less
profitable grades, customers and geographic regions.


outlook
markets – looking forward to 2006, markets are expected to be stronger than in 2005. however, a stronger canadian dollar could more

than offset any pricing gains.
     consensus economics estimates real gdp growth of 3% globally in 2006, the same as 2005. the asia pacific region is expected
to expand at virtually the same rate as 2005, or about 3.7%. there may be a slight weakening in gdp growth in north america, but
forecasts indicate europe may accelerate its growth rate. these conditions will provide paper markets with demand growth ranging from
flat in japan, to a high of 3.1% in western europe. chinese paper and board output will likely rise in the 8-9% range. the shipments to
capacity ratio for market pulp is projected at 94.1% for all chemical paper grades, increasing to 95.2% for softwood sulphate market
pulp. historically this level of shipments implies that the industry is operating at full capacity.
     the market is expected to be balanced through the first quarter as canadian pulp supply is becoming constrained due to mill
curtailments resulting from the stronger canadian dollar and rising costs, particularly fibre costs in eastern canada. the usual spring
maintenance programs at market pulp mills are expected to develop a stronger supply/demand balance into the second quarter,
allowing for pricing improvement. by the end of the second quarter, strong pulp production and slowing summer demand will likely
lead to another inventory overhang, which will precipitate falling prices into the second half of the year, with seasonal demand in the fall
leading to a slight pickup in the latter part of the year. industry consultants forecast that it is possible the industry will experience further
temporary or permanent mill closures of softwood market pulp capacity in 2006, as was the case in 2005. should this happen, it could
have an impact on the supply and demand balance in favour of the remaining producers of softwood market pulp, such as canfor.


operations – all mills are forecasting record performance levels for 2006, with key drivers of improvement being the completion

of the precipitator project at prince george pulp and the realization of a full year of benefits from the #5 recovery boiler upgrade
at northwood.
     costs are expected to decrease as a result of the lower chip prices implemented july 1, 2005, the co-generator operating at its full
rate in early 2006 and benefits from the mills’ asset management initiatives.

discontinued operations


coastal operations - in the fourth quarter of 2005, canfor announced its intention to transfer its englewood logging operation and

associated timber licenses to a new limited partnership, coastal fibre limited partnership (cflp), jointly owned with oji paper canada
ltd. in consideration of the transfer, canfor will receive a partnership interest with a fair value of $45 million, which approximates book
value of the assets transferred. cflp has agreed to transfer these assets to western forest products (wfp) in return for, among other
things, a long-term agreement with wfp to supply cflp with fibre, and cflp has agreed to supply this fibre to howe sound limited
partnership. the transfer, which is subject to regulatory clearance under the federal competition act and by the british columbia
minister of forests, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. as a result of this transaction, the former coastal operations
segment has been reclassified as discontinued operations.
       in 2005, canfor’s coastal operations incurred a loss of $4.4 million after tax (2004 - $1.8 million loss), including $2.5 million of
after-tax charges for severance, lease termination costs and an allowance for bad debts. log shipments totaled 862.1 thousand cubic
metres in the year (2004 – 1,148.3 thousand cubic metres). weak market conditions persisted throughout the year. as a result, logging
operations were curtailed for most of the first quarter and throughout the third quarter. canfor’s coastal logging operations were shut
down as of december 15th.


sawmills - during the second quarter, canfor completed the sale of its fort st james, slocan and valemount sawmills in british

columbia for total cash proceeds of $59.0 million. after-tax operating income of $3.3 million was earned by these operations in 2005
prior to the sale dates and a net after-tax loss of $4.7 million was recorded on the dispositions.
       lumber shipments from discontinued operations in 2005 totaled 120.5 million board feet (7) up to the date of disposition of the mills
in the second quarter. in 2004, lumber shipments from these three mills totaled 437.0 million board feet for the year.

by $17.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004. the 2004 expense was unusually high as a result of additional costs incurred from the
integration of the former slocan head office, including severance costs of $9.2 million, asset write downs and lease costs of $7.2 million
and duplicated corporate administration costs of $3.7 million.


interest expense
interest expense was $42.2 million in 2005, net of interest income of $12.7 million, compared to interest expense of $58.8 million, net
of interest income of $8.3 million, in 2004. long-term debt interest of $49.6 million decreased by $12.9 million in 2005 as a result of
principal reductions, the impact of the stronger canadian dollar and the early redemption of the convertible debentures in november
2004. interest income increased by $4.4 million as a result of higher interest rates on temporary investments and interest charged to
howe sound limited partnership, as discussed under related party transactions, below. other interest of $5.3 million was $0.7 million
higher than in 2004 as a result of increased credit facility, standby and letter of credit fees.


other income
other income of $12.8 million in 2005 was comprised of equity income from affiliates of $2.7 million (2004 - $11.3 million), seaboard
general partnership income of $8.9 million (2004 – nil) and miscellaneous income of $1.2 million (2004 - $3.1 million expense).
       canfor’s affiliated companies, which are accounted for on an equity basis, consist of lakeland mills ltd., winton global lumber
ltd., vernon seed orchard co. and kyahwood forest products. lakeland and winton global operate sawmills in the prince george region
and supply wood chips to canfor’s pulp mills. kyahwood, which is owned 49% by canfor, is a value-added lumber facility in moricetown,

british columbia. the combined income of these affiliates decreased by $8.6 million from 2004 as a result of market and exchange
factors, similar to those discussed in the lumber segment.
     income of $8.9 million from the seaboard general partnership was recorded in 2005 as a result of asset sales. canfor has a 19.9%
interest in the partnership.
     miscellaneous income of $1.2 million in 2005 includes $2.1 million in gains on the sale of property, partially offset by losses on the
disposal of investments. miscellaneous expenses of $3.1 million in 2004 were mainly comprised of a write-down of deferred costs for
the discontinued sawmill project in maine.

unusual expense
in march 2003, the government of british columbia (the crown) introduced the forestry revitalization plan (the plan) that provided for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees. the changes prescribed
in the plan included the elimination of minimum cut control regulations, the elimination of existing timber processing regulations, and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses. as well, through legislation, licensees, including
canfor, were required to return 20% of their aac from replaceable tenures to the crown. the plan states that approximately half of
this volume will be redistributed to create opportunities for woodlots, community forests and first nations and the other half will be
available for public auction. the crown acknowledged that licensees would be fairly compensated for the return of tenure and related
infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges.
     the effect of the timber take-back resulted in a reduction of approximately 2.4 million cubic metres to canfor’s existing aac on
its replaceable tenures. canfor worked with the government to identify those licenses and operating areas that were to be returned
to the crown, and negotiations were completed in the fourth quarter of 2005. canfor received compensation of $57.0 million for the
loss of tenures and a $5.0 million advance payment against lost infrastructure and road construction costs. a loss of $8.8 million ($6.2
million after tax) was recorded on the tenures in 2005. canfor is continuing discussions with the province for further compensation for
infrastructure, but the amount and timing of additional compensation, if any, is not yet determinable.
     canfor does not expect that the take-back will adversely affect its ability to obtain adequate timber supplies for its operations or
materially affect the costs of obtaining those supplies.


income taxes
the income tax expense of $12.4 million recorded in 2005 (2004 – $94.1 million) is net of the benefit of utilizing $12.5 million of deferred
tax credits acquired from howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp) (2004 – $68.5 million). in 2004, future income tax
savings of $1.1 million were realized arising from canfor’s share of hslp’s current operating losses (2005 – nil). the history behind
these losses is as follows
     on march 10, 2001, canfor and oji paper co., ltd. (oji) of japan, its 50% co-venturer in the howe sound pulp and paper limited
(howe sound) joint venture, transferred the business of howe sound into a limited partnership, hslp. hslp continues to be jointly
owned by canfor and oji and continues to carry on the operations of howe sound. as a result of the reorganization, howe sound was
amalgamated with canadian forest products ltd. (cfp), canfor’s principal operating subsidiary, and approximately $643 million of tax
losses of howe sound became available to reduce the future taxable income of cfp. cfp has seven years in which to utilize these losses.
as part of the reorganization, cfp made a payment of $60.2 million to hslp in 2001, which was applied to reduce its long-term debt.
during 2002 and 2004, cfp made additional payments to hslp of $5.0 million and $7.0 million respectively as a result of losses utilized.
a final payment of $50.0 million was made to hslp on january 2, 2005.
     the other significant factor when comparing the 2005 and 2004 tax figures is the impact of a 1.5% reduction in the british columbia
corporate tax rate in 2005, which gave rise to a $21.0 million favourable adjustment to the tax expense in the year, as a result of revaluing
the future income tax liability balance.

transactions with related parties


howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership (hslp) – canfor’s pulp and paper marketing division markets the pulp production of hslp,

for which in 2005 it received commissions totaling $2.5 million on sales volume of 372,900 tonnes (2004 – $3.0 million, on volume of
357,900 tonnes). based on a separate prepayment agreement between hslp and canfor and oji, the partners of hslp, at december 31,
2005, canfor had prepaid $48.6 million to hslp in advance of the due date of receivables and pulp inventory for pulp marketed, or to
be marketed, and collected on their behalf (2004 – $44.0 million). this agreement provides for the partners to prepay up to a maximum
amount of $50 million each, which is used as short-term operating funds by hslp. canfor charges hslp a market rate of interest for
the period of prepayment, which amounted to $2.1 million in 2005 (2004 – $2.1 million) and the prepayment is covered by the assignment
of current and future accounts receivable.
     canfor’s coast fibre supply group, previously included in the coastal operations segment and now classified as discontinued
operations, sells and trades the log production of the coastal logging operations to acquire the logs and chips required for hslp’s
pulp and newsprint mills. logs that can be chipped by hslp’s westcoast cellufibre operation are sold to that operation at market
value. logs that cannot be used by westcoast cellufibre are sold to or traded with other coastal operators, with the primary objective
of obtaining the pulp logs and chips required by hslp. in 2005, hslp purchased logs valued at $6.5 million from coast fibre supply
(2004 – $14.2 million). in addition, the coast fibre supply group sources logs and chips for hslp from areas such as southern alaska,
northern washington and the interior of british columbia. coast fibre supply provides this management, fibre supply and other services to
hslp at cost, for which it charged $1.7 million in fees for 2005 (2004 – $1.9 million). canfor has agreed to purchase pulp logs and
chips in the future for resale to hslp at canfor’s cost, to meet hslp’s future requirements. in 2005 canfor purchased and resold
$27.8 million of logs and chips to hslp (2004 – $19.0 million). canfor charges hslp a market rate of interest for this service, which
amounted to $0.6 million in 2005. canfor’s prince george area sawmills also sold chips to hslp in the amount of $17.8 million in 2005
(2004 – $22.2 million).
     at december 31, 2005 there was a balance receivable from hslp in the amount of $21.5 million with respect to the above-noted
transactions (2004 – $10.5 million).
     in 2005, canfor purchased certain land and buildings from hslp through a new company jointly owned with oji paper canada ltd.
the property was purchased at fair market value, of which canfor’s share was $5.7 million, but has been recorded at hslp’s carrying
value, with the difference of $3.5 million being recorded in retained earnings, in accordance with accounting rules for related party
transactions of this nature.
     as a result of continuing losses at hslp, canfor and its partner oji are evaluating strategic alternatives for this operation. canfor
wrote off its interest in the joint venture in 1998 and no longer reflects its share of hslp’s results. canfor’s method of accounting for its
interest in the partnership did not change as a result of the march 10, 2001 reorganization. as discussed under discontinued operations,
the transfer of the englewood logging operation and associated tenures to wfp in exchange for a long-term fibre supply agreement, is
expected to result in lower fibre costs for hslp, which, in conjunction with other marketing and debt restructuring, should assist the
mill’s efforts to return to profitability in the future.


lakeland and winton global – canfor purchases pulp chips and lumber, at market value, from lakeland mills ltd. and winton global

lumber ltd., in which it holds a one-third equity interest through its subsidiary 317231 british columbia ltd. in 2005, canfor purchased
$11.1 million in pulp chips and $9.0 million in lumber from these mills (2004 – $15.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively).


kyahwood forest products – canfor has a joint venture, kyahwood forest products, with the moricetown first nations. the investment

is being accounted for on the equity basis due to its relative size in relation to canfor’s other investments and to the fact that the joint
venture is managed by the band. during 2005, kyahwood forest products provided remanufacturing services, at market value, to canfor
in the amount of $5.3 million (2004 – $5.8 million).


other – other related party transactions include the sale of chips to fibreco export inc., which amounted to $2.0 million in 2005 (2004 –

$6.7 million) before canfor disposed of its investment in that company in july. canfor purchases logs from takla track & timber ltd., in

which it holds a 22% investment. these purchases amounted to $4.9 million in 2005 (2004 $1.0 million). canfor holds a 19.9% interest in
seaboard general partnership, which provided shipping services through seaboard international shipping company amounting to $6.0
million in 2005 (2004 – $5.4 million).

changes in financial position


canfor’s ratio of current assets to current liabilities, at 2.4:1 at the end of 2005, was unchanged from the prior year.
          canfor’s ratio of net debt to equity (defined as the ratio of total debt, net of cash and temporary investments, to shareholders’
equity) was at 14:86, compared to 13:87 in 2004.
            the changes in the components of these ratios during 2005 are detailed in the consolidated cash flow statement of the financial
statements. the more significant changes are discussed below:




                                    c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   45   m a n a g e m e n t ' s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

operating activities – in 2005, canfor generated cash of $193.3 million from operations, compared to $708.5 million in the prior year.

operating earnings before amortization (ebitda) decreased by $340.8 million in the year and changes in non-cash working capital
consumed $55.8 million in cash, as compared to 2004 when changes in these balances generated $100.7 million in cash.
      in 2005, the major changes in non-cash working capital were an $8.3 million decrease in accounts receivable, a $27.0 million
increase in inventories and a $41.7 million decrease in accounts payable. the decrease in accounts receivable at year-end is mainly
attributable to the effect of the stronger canadian dollar on us dollar receivables, while the increase in inventories is mainly as a result
of accelerated logging in order to take advantage of lower stumpage rates. the decrease in accounts payable was mainly as a result
of the january 2005 $50.0 million payment to hslp for tax losses, as discussed above, that was included in payables at december 31,
2004. income tax payments of $2.8 million were made in the year (2004 - $5.8 million plus another $27.7 million for slocan, which had
been accrued by slocan prior to april 1, 2004 and relate to its pre-acquisition earnings). interest payments of $41.9 million were made
in the year (2004 – $56.3 million).


financing activities – in 2005, financing activities consumed $80.0 million in cash, mainly comprising scheduled long-term debt payments

of $68.4 million, $13.8 million for the repurchase of canfor shares for cancellation, and $1.9 million received on the exercise of stock
options. in 2004, financing activities generated $49.2 million of cash, as a result of new financing obtained in the year, which totaled us
$235 million, of which us $160 million was utilized to pay down slocan’s debt. scheduled long-term debt payments of us $43.8 million
were also made in 2004 and a subsidiary made long-term debt repayments of $7.7 million. no dividends were paid in 2005 or 2004.


investing activities – cash used in investing activities amounted to $251.8 million in 2005, which is a $45.0 million increase over 2004.

the main cash outflows in 2005 were $334.5 million of capital expenditures and a $50.0 million payment to hslp for tax losses.
proceeds from investing activities included $62.0 million in compensation from the government of british columbia for timber tenures
and associated infrastructure, as discussed under unusual expense above, $59.0 million from the sale of the fort st james, slocan
and valemount sawmills, as discussed under discontinued operations, $8.3 million of incentive payments related to the electrical co-
generation project at the prince george pulp mill, and $7.5 million from the sale of property, plant and equipment, the majority of which
was from the sale of surplus land.
      of the $334.5 million that canfor invested in capital assets in 2005, over 75% was strategic in nature, to increase shareholder
value by improving the company’s cost position, productivity and production capacity. the other 25% has been to maintain the existing
productive capacity of the operations or to ensure canfor’s safety and environmental performance. the largest investments in the
year included $85.0 million for the construction of peace valley osb, $103.7 million for the plateau mill modernization project, $12.9
million for the prince george pulp mill’s recovery boiler precipitator upgrade project, and $26.7 million for the electrical co-generation
facility.
      in 2004, capital expenditures of $202.5 million were made, mainly comprised of $38.2 million in construction costs for peace valley
osb, $37.3 million for the co-generation project, and $13.6 million to expand production at the polarboard osb plant in fort nelson.
also in 2004, $38.2 million of cash was spent on the slocan acquisition, $26.0 million of incentive payments were received for the co-
generation project, and $9.9 million was received from property disposals, the majority of which was from the sale of a corporate jet.


financial requirements and liquidity


at the end of 2005, canfor had $337.0 million of bank operating lines of credit available, of which $3.4 million was drawn down and an
additional $43.5 million was utilized for several standby letters of credit.
      provisions contained in canfor’s long-term borrowing agreements limit the amount of indebtedness that the company may incur
and the amount of dividends it may pay on its common shares. the amount of dividends the company is permitted to pay under its
long-term borrowing agreements is determined by reference to consolidated net earnings less certain restricted payments. as at
december 31, 2005, the company was permitted under these agreements to incur $1,362.0 million of additional long-term debt (2004
– $1,214.2 million) and to pay up to $523.0 million, or $3.67 per share, in dividends on its common shares (2004 – $458.0 million, or
$3.20 per share).

       in 2006, canfor plans to invest approximately $180.0 million on capital projects, including $6.0 million to complete the plateau
project and $50.0 million for energy projects at the houston and chetwynd sawmills, which will reduce natural gas usage by 900,000
gigajoules. the remaining $124.0 million represents maintenance of business and other improvement projects.
       in 2006, $95.7 million is required for scheduled long-term debt repayments.
       canfor intends to finance its planned capital expenditures, acquisition of new south and scheduled debt repayments from existing
cash reserves and cash generated from its operations.
       no new financing arrangements were obtained in 2005. in 2004, a new private placement financing of us $50 million was drawn
down on february 2nd and was utilized for general operating purposes and capital expenditures. on april 1st, 2004, the us $160 million
of long-term debt assumed upon the acquisition of slocan was refinanced with new private placement debt of us $185 million. the
balance was used to pay a make-whole penalty on slocan’s debt and for general corporate purposes. the new debt was in the form of
unsecured senior notes, which have the following interest rates and maturities: us $60 million at 5.66% (2009), us $50 million at 6.18%
(2011), us $50 million at 6.33% (2012), and us $75 million at 5.42% (2013).
       in october 2004, canfor entered into a new unsecured and committed $325 million credit facility to replace its existing demand
operating lines of credit. this facility, which is comprised of a $125 million 364-day amount and a three-year $200 million amount, is
renewable annually and bears interest based on libor or canadian prime plus a margin based on canfor’s credit rating. the facility was
undrawn at december 31, 2005 except for the standby letters of credit referred to above.
       on november 15, 2004, canfor announced its intention to redeem all of its outstanding convertible subordinated debentures at the
principal amount of $155.0 million plus accrued interest. the holders of the debentures exercised their right of conversion under the
debentures, which resulted in the company issuing 11,742,424 common shares to them. at the same time, canfor commenced a normal
course issuer bid, to purchase for cancellation up to 6,578,868 common shares, or approximately 5% of the company’s then outstanding
shares over a one-year period. in december 2004, canfor purchased 104,800 shares on the open market at an average price of $14.65
per share. during the third quarter of 2005, canfor purchased another 1,000,000 shares for cancellation at an average price of $13.84
per share. the normal course issuer bid expired on october 14, 2005 but a new bid commenced on november 15, 2005. no additional
shares had been purchased as of december 31, 2005.


the following table summarizes canfor’s financial contractual obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter:

contractual obligations at december 31, 2005

operating leases                                                                        55.4        22.5             14.9              8.7              4.8            2.4       2.1

                                                                                 $     695.6   $   118.2      $    102.0       $      26.4      $     165.1      $    40.1   $ 243.8




other contractual obligations not included above are:

       purchase obligations and contractual obligations in the normal course of business. for example, purchase obligations of a more
       substantial dollar amount generally relate to the pulp business and are subject to “force majeure” clauses. in these instances,
       actual volumes purchased may vary significantly from contracted amounts depending on canfor's requirements in any given
       year. in 2003, canfor entered into several long-term agreements with the purchaser of its former bc chemicals operation to
       ensure a continued supply of sodium chlorate and processing of the pulp mills' soap skimmings into crude tall oil. the minimum
       commitment under these agreements is for ten years, at $29.0 million per year for chlorate and $4.5 million for soap skimming.

       deferred reforestation, for which a liability of $111.0 million has been recorded at december 31, 2005 (2004 —$111.2 million).
       the reforestation liability is a fluctuating obligation, based on the volume of timber harvested. the future cash outflows are a
       function of the actual costs of silviculture programs and of harvesting at the time and are based on, among other things, the
       location of the harvesting.

       capital expenditures, as no significant contractual obligations had been entered into at december 31, 2005.

critical accounting estimates


the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recorded in the financial statements. management regularly reviews these
estimates and assumptions based on currently available information. while it is reasonably possible that circumstances may arise which
cause actual results to differ from these estimates, management does not believe it is likely that any such differences will materially
affect canfor’s financial position.


employee future benefits – canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans providing both pension and other

retirement benefits to most of its salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans. canfor
also provides certain health care benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees. the costs and related obligations
of the pension and other retirement benefit plans are accrued in accordance with the recommendations of the canadian institute of
chartered accountants (cica).
     canfor uses independent actuarial firms to perform actuarial valuations of the fair value of pension and other retirement benefit
plan obligations. the application of these recommendations requires judgments regarding certain assumptions that affect the accrued
benefit provisions and related expenses, including the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligation, the expected
rate of return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase and the assumed health care cost trend rates. management and the
company’s pension committee evaluate these assumptions annually based on their own experience and the recommendations of its
actuarial firms. changes in these assumptions result in actuarial gains or losses, which are amortized over the average remaining
service period of the active employee group covered by the plans, only to the extent that the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses
are in excess of 10% of the greater of the accrued benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets.


deferred reforestation – canfor accrues an estimate, in current dollars, of its future liability to perform forestry activities, defined

to mean those silviculture treatments or activities that are carried out to ensure the establishment of a free-growing stand of young
trees, including logging road rehabilitation. an estimate is recorded in the financial statements based on the number of hectares of
timber harvested in the period. the actual costs that will be incurred in the future may vary based on, among other things, the actual
costs at the time.


future income taxes – in accordance with cica recommendations, canfor recognizes future income tax assets when it is more likely than

not that the future income tax assets will be realized. this assumption is based on management’s best estimate of future circumstances
and events. if these estimates and assumptions are changed in the future, the value of the future income tax assets could be reduced or
increased, resulting in an income tax expense or recovery. canfor reevaluates its future income tax assets on a regular basis.


anti-dumping duty expense – as discussed in the lumber segment and below, under risks and uncertainties, canfor has expensed

anti-dumping duties at an estimated rate for certain periods, while cash deposits are made at the deposit rate specified by the us
department of commerce (doc). the actual rate applicable to canfor’s product shipment profile will be assessed by the doc during
their administrative review process. canfor regularly reviews its estimate of the effective rate by applying the doc’s calculation
methodology to updated sales and cost data. the difference between the estimated rate and the cash deposit rate is recorded as a
long-term receivable on the balance sheet. a comprehensive discussion of the softwood lumber duty situation follows in the risks and
uncertainties section.

changes in accounting policies

effective january 1, 2005:

convertible debentures - effective january 1, 2005, canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute

of chartered accountants (cica) concerning the balance sheet presentation of financial instruments as liabilities or equity. canfor had
previously accounted for its convertible subordinated debentures as equity, including the related interest charges, in accordance with
eic-71 financial instruments that may be settled at the issuer’s option in cash or its own equity instruments. prior year figures have
been restated to reflect the debentures as liabilities and the related interest as an expense on the income statement. this had no impact
on previously reported earnings per share or retained earnings. the debentures had a maturity date of november 23, 2006 but were
converted in november 2004 with the issuance of 11,742,424 common shares.


variable interest entities - effective january 1, 2005, canfor adopted the cica’s new accounting guideline for the consolidation

of variable interest entities. the primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved
through means other than voting rights. the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfor’s financial position or
results of operations.


cash and temporary investments - effective january 1, 2005, canfor retroactively amended its presentation of cash and temporary

investments to include unpresented cheques, which were previously included in accounts payable.


vendor rebates – in september 2005, the cica issued a new abstract, eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to

a customer (including a reseller of the vendor’s products), effective january 1, 2006. the eic clarifies the measurement and
presentation of vendor discounts and volume rebates, which canfor had previously presented under “costs and expenses”. canfor has
elected to adopt the standard effective january 1, 2005, which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by $103.3 million for the year
(2004 – $105.0 million).

effective january 1, 2004:

asset retirement obligations – effective january 1, 2004, canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the cica for asset

retirement obligations, which require that such obligations be measured at fair value. as a result of adopting these new recommendations,
canfor’s deferred reforestation liability decreased by $5.6 million, its net future income tax liability increased by $2.0 million and retained
earnings increased by $3.6 million at december 31, 2003. the change in accounting for deferred reforestation liabilities resulted in a
$0.2 million increase to the deferred reforestation expense in 2005 (2004 – $2.2 million). the new recommendations were not applied to
retirement obligations for assets with indeterminate useful lives because sufficient information is not presently available to estimate a
range of potential settlement dates for these obligations.


impairment of long-lived assets – the cica has issued new recommendations, effective january 1, 2004, related to the recognition,

measurement and disclosure of impairment of long-lived assets. an asset is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value is not
recoverable and exceeds its fair value. canfor regularly reviews its long-lived assets for impairment and did not experience a material
impact upon initial adoption of these recommendations.


shipping and handling costs – prior to january 1, 2004, canfor, along with other companies in the forest industry, presented sales net

of shipping and handling costs. effective january 1, 2004, the cica introduced new recommendations for the application of generally
accepted accounting principles (gaap), which, among other things, prohibit the use of “industry practice” and provide guidance on
alternate sources to consult with when an issue is not specifically addressed by canadian gaap. as a result of applying the new standard,
effective january 1, 2004, canfor reclassified shipping and handling costs and countervailing and anti-dumping duties to cost of sales.
also, in accordance with cica handbook section 3400, revenue, shipping and handling costs recovered from customers have been
included in sales. prior periods have been reclassified for comparability.




                       c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   49   m a n a g e m e n t ' s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

risks and uncertainties


most companies in the forest industry in north america, including canfor, face similar business risks and uncertainties. in addition to the
specific issues discussed above under each reporting segment, risks and uncertainties fall into the general business areas of markets,
international commodity prices, competition, currency exchange rates, environmental issues, forest land base, government regulations
and policy reform, and, for canadian companies, trade barriers and aboriginal land claims.
     the future impact of the various uncertainties and potential risks described in the following paragraphs (together with the risks
and uncertainties identified under each of the company’s business segments listed above) cannot be quantified or predicted. however,
canfor does not foresee unmanageable adverse effects on its business operations from, and believes that it is well positioned to deal
with, such matters as may arise.


aboriginal issues
in 1997, the supreme court of canada in the delgamuukw decision confirmed the continued existence of aboriginal title and rights
to lands continuously used or occupied by aboriginal groups. as a result, aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal title and rights
over substantial portions of british columbia, including areas where canfor’s forest tenures are situated. this decision has added to
uncertainty regarding property rights in canada (including forest tenure and other resource rights), particularly in much of british
columbia and other areas where treaties have not been concluded with aboriginal groups. in 2005, the supreme court of canada made
an important decision relevant to the forest industry in the bernard and marshall case. in this decision, the supreme court held that
aboriginal title to forest resources had not been established as claimed by aboriginal groups in new brunswick and nova scotia. the
supreme court held that although proof of aboriginal title must be sensitive to the aboriginal perspective, it must nevertheless meet
common law standards of proof of title. due to the complexity of aboriginal title issues, it is not expected that the issues of aboriginal
title in british columbia will be finally resolved in the near to medium term.
     in november 2004, the supreme court of canada in haida v. british columbia and taku river v. british columbia confirmed that
the duty to consult with aboriginal groups arises when the crown has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential existence of an
aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely impact it. notably, the court found that the duty to consult is a
crown obligation that does not extend to third parties such as forestry companies. while the crown can delegate “procedural aspects”
to third parties, legal responsibility rests with the crown. third parties cannot be held liable for the crown’s failure to consult. while the
crown is required to consult in good faith, aboriginal consent is not required and aboriginal groups do not have a veto over government
decisions. while this decision provides improved clarity regarding the duty to consult, it may take some time for other related issues
regarding consultation and accommodation that were not addressed by the court to be resolved and for governments and aboriginal
groups to respond and adapt to the court’s direction. this may result in some continued uncertainty as further refinements of the duty
to consult and accommodate are clarified. canfor will continue to cooperate, communicate and exchange information and views with
aboriginal groups in order to foster good relationships and minimize risks to its tenures and operational plans.


canada/us softwood lumber dispute
background – the canada/us softwood lumber agreement expired on march 31, 2001 without being renewed or replaced. on april 2,

2001, countervailing duty (cvd) and anti-dumping duty (add) petitions covering certain softwood lumber products from canada were
filed with the us department of commerce (doc) and the us international trade commission (itc) by a us industry group.
     on may 16, 2002, the itc published its final determination on injury, finding that canadian softwood lumber threatened material
injury to the us industry. cvd deposits, estimated at 18.79%, were required of virtually all importers and add cash deposits, estimated
at 5.96%, were required for imports by canfor. however, because the itc ruled that canadian lumber shipments only threatened
material injury and had not already caused material injury, the obligation to make cvd and add deposits was made to be effective only
prospectively from may 22, 2002. as a result, in the second quarter of 2002 canfor reversed all preliminary cvd and add duties accrued
prior to may 22, 2002.




                   c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   50   m a n a g e m e n t ' s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

countervailing duty case – from may 22, 2002 to march 9, 2004 canfor made cash deposits and expensed cvd at the required rate

of 18.79%. canfor filed for an expedited review of its cvd rate on march 31, 2003 to obtain a company-specific rate rather than make
deposits under the national rate of 18.79%. the doc completed this review process in february 2004 and the deposit rate was confirmed
at 12.24% and became effective for shipments to the us after march 9, 2004.
     the doc determination that resulted in 18.79% cvd was appealed to a nafta panel. as a result of a series of nafta panel
rulings and remands to the doc, on november 22, 2005, the doc issued a fifth remand determination with a cvd rate of 0.80%, which
is considered “de minimis”. it is the position of the canadian parties that this finding requires the cvd order to be revoked and all cvd
deposits that have been collected so far, and that have not been liquidated, to be refunded with interest. (in canfor’s case, none of its
cvd deposits have been liquidated.) it is the position of the doc that if the fifth remand determination is upheld, it still will operate
prospectively only, which means that the cvd order would be considered to have been effective for the period may 22, 2002 through at
least november 22, 2005. the fifth remand determination is currently under challenge by various parties before the nafta panel. this
nafta cvd appeal will have no effect on cvd cash deposits or cvd until there is a final result in that appeal.
     while the nafta litigation was proceeding, the doc conducted “annual administrative reviews” of the cvd order. the first annual
administrative review covered the period from may 22, 2002 to march 31, 2003 (por1). on december 20, 2004 the doc published its
final determination for the first review, setting the cvd rate at 17.18%. this rate is to be used to determine the actual duties due for
entries made during por1, and the cvd cash deposit rate for shipments made on or after december 20, 2004 was also changed to this
rate. canfor has reduced the cvd expense accrual for por1 for the difference between the original deposit rate of 18.79% and the rate
of 17.18% published on december 20, 2005, and expensed at the 17.18% rate for shipments subsequent to december 20, 2004. in
february 2005, as a result of ministerial errors in the calculation, the doc announced a further reduction to this rate, to 16.37%,
applicable to assessment of cvd for por1 and to future cvd cash deposits. as a result, in the first quarter of 2005, canfor further
reduced its cvd accrual for por1 by $6.5 million, to record cvd expense at 16.37%. the results in this review are under appeal and are
therefore not final.
     the second annual administrative review covered the period from may 2003 to april 2004 (por2). on december 12, 2005, the doc
published its determination for the second review, setting an assessment rate of 8.70% for por2 entries, which is also applied as the
cash deposit rate on lumber entries occurring on or after december 12, 2005. it is anticipated that the final determination in this review
will be appealed.
     canfor’s subsidiary in quebec, daaquam, had a preliminary company-specific cvd rate of 2.99% as a result of the zero rate review
process. on october 18, 2004 the doc announced that daaquam was not a zero rated company and would have the countrywide rate
applied to all us entries. this doc decision is under appeal as part of the quebec border mill group action. as a result of the doc
october 18, 2004 decision and the december 14, 2004 determination, canfor has increased the cvd accrual to recognize the daaquam
cvd liability at the countrywide rate of 16.37% for the period since canfor’s acquisition of daaquam in may 2003, and to 8.70% on or
after december 12, 2005.
     the doc third administrative review, which is currently under way, will determine the assessment of cvd duties for the period april
1, 2004 to march 31, 2005 as well as the future cash deposit rate. preliminary review results are due may 31, 2006 and final results are
due in the fall of 2006 but can be extended until as late as december 2006.


anti-dumping case – in the case of the add, cash deposits were made from may 22, 2002 to december 21, 2004 at the rate then required,

5.96%. canfor reviews its estimate of the add expense rate by applying the doc’s methodology to updated sales and cost data as they
become available. the final rate will be determined when an official administrative review is complete for the respective periods. the
first annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 22, 2002 to april 30, 2003, and was completed in december
2004. this led to a change in the cash deposit rate on december 21, 2004 from the original rate of 5.96% to 1.83%. the latter rate is a
weighted average of canfor and slocan final rates from por1, based on a “changed circumstances” review conducted by the doc as
a result of the combination of the companies. the canfor por1 rate was 2.59%, and slocan’s por rate was 1.65%. these individual
company assessment rates are to be applied to the entries for the period may 22, 2002 to april 30, 2003. in december 2004, canfor
reduced its expense accrual for por1 to reflect these announced final rates. canfor’s results of the first administrative review are under
appeal and are therefore not final.




                    c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   51   m a n a g e m e n t ' s d i s c u s s i o n a n d a n a ly s i s

     the second annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 1, 2003 to april 30, 2004, with final results
published on december 12, 2005. the doc determined the add assessment rate for canfor at 1.36% for por2, which became the rate for
cash deposits on lumber shipments after december 12, 2005. on january 23, 2006, the doc revised the rate from 1.36% to 1.35% due to
ministerial errors. this is the currently applicable cash deposit rate. it is anticipated that canfor’s results in this review will be appealed.
     in the add initial investigation and in the first and second add administrative reviews, canfor was one of the companies selected
as a mandatory respondent, and for this reason has received its own company-specific add rate. however, in the third administrative
anti-dumping review, which covers the period may 1, 2004 to april 30, 2005 (por3), the doc employed a sampling methodology, and
canfor was not selected as a mandatory respondent in the sampling process. as a result, the company may be assigned the “all others”
rate arising from the averaging of the rates of the mandatory respondents selected for por3 in the manner announced by the doc.
there is no way of estimating what this rate may be. canfor filed a voluntary questionnaire response in the third review, but the doc
refused to accept canfor as a voluntary respondent, which would have given canfor its own add rate for the third review. canfor intends
to challenge the doc’s refusal vigorously, as well as the sampling methodology that was used to select mandatory respondents for the
third review.
     given the uncertainty around the likely final rates to be determined for the add with respect to por3 canfor has made no
adjustments to duties previously expensed for por2 to reflect the lower cvd and add rate as announced in december 2005. since
december 20, 2004 canfor has expensed the duties at the same rate at which deposits are being paid, which was 16.37% for cvd and
1.83% for add until december 12, 2005, and 8.70% and 1.36%, respectively, thereafter. the add rate was subsequently amended by the
doc on january 23, 2006 to 1.35%).


threat of injury determination – the nafta panel hearing the appeal of the itc finding that canadian imports threatened injury to

the us softwood lumber industry repeatedly found that the itc determination violated us law. eventually, the itc issued a remand
determination finding that the us softwood lumber industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of canadian imports.
as expected, the us challenged the nafta panel’s decision by recourse to a special extraordinary challenge committee (ecc) under
the nafta. the ecc ruled against the us on august 10, 2005. the position of the canadian parties is that the us anti-dumping and
countervailing duty orders must be terminated, with effect as from may 22, 2002, due to the itc’s having found no threat of injury in its
nafta remand determination. however, the u.s. position is that an itc determination that there was a threat of injury, which was made
in a “section 129” proceeding following the us’s loss of its defense of the original itc determination before the wto, effectively takes the
place of the itc’s negative remand determination in nafta, and supplies the legal underpinning for maintaining the cvd and add orders
in effect. the matter is now being litigated before the us court of international trade (cit), and is expected to be decided by the cit in mid
2006. it is expected that the cit’s decision will be appealed to the next higher court, the us court of appeals for the federal circuit.
     the “us coalition for fair lumber imports” also has challenged the constitutionality of chapter 19 appeals process for antidumping
and countervailing duty proceedings, in an effort to undermine all of the nafta panel decisions mentioned above. it is unclear when the
court handling this challenge, the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, will decide that case.
     as at december 31, 2005, canfor (including slocan before april 1,2004) had paid combined duty deposits of us $733.4 million (add
of us $173.5 million and cvd of us $559.9 million) since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002. all of these deposits would be eligible
for refund to canfor with interest if the litigation concerning the effect of the itc negative remand determination were successful.
     the doc officially announced in the federal register that it would be assessing duties in accordance with the rates that it
determined in the first and second add and cvd reviews, which legal counsel advise would result in the excess cvd and add deposits
being recoverable, with interest (if the entirety of such deposits were not recoverable, on account of failure of the cit litigation
concerning the itc’s negative remand determination). for a given period of review (por), assessment of duties and refund of excess
deposits will not occur until all subsequent challenges or appeals for that particular por are finalized.
     the company and other canadian forest product companies, the canadian federal government and canadian provincial
governments (canadian interests) categorically deny the us allegations and strongly disagree with the final countervailing and dumping
determinations made by the doc in the investigations and reviews, and with the itc’s determination in the “section 129” proceeding.
canadian interests continue to aggressively defend the canadian industry in this us trade dispute. canadian interests may appeal the
decision of these administrative agencies to the appropriate courts, nafta panels and the wto.

environmental certification
customers of forest products increasingly require assurances that products purchased are derived from well-managed forests. canfor
has responded by implementing a comprehensive third-party sustainable forest management (sfm) certification strategy to verify that
its forest operations are well managed.
     canfor retains an international organization for standardization (“iso”) 14001 certification of its environmental management
system for its forest operations, first obtained in 1999 and re-certified as required for subsequent 3-year terms. in addition, canfor
maintains certification under the canadian standards association (csa) standard for sustainable forest management (can/csa z809)
for its forest management agreement area at grande prairie, alberta, for its tree farm licences at chetwynd, englewood, prince
george and vavenby, british columbia, for its forest licences at fort st john, houston, prince george, fort nelson, vanderhoof, vavenby
and quesnel, british columbia and for its pulpwood agreements at fort st john and fort nelson, british columbia.
     canfor is committed to having sustainable forest management certification in place for all of its tenures.


environmental issues
the species at risk act (sara) was proclaimed by the government of canada in june 2003. the purpose of the act is to prevent the
extinction or extirpation of wildlife species present in canada for at least 50 years, to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are
extirpated, endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and encourage the management of other species to prevent them
from becoming at risk. the economic implications of sara are potential reductions in timber harvests and increases in harvesting costs,
none of which can be predicted at this time
     in december 2002 the government of canada ratified the kyoto agreement. the climate change plan for canada, which sets
out canada’s kyoto implementation strategy, indicates that federal and provincial energy and environment ministers have endorsed
the principle that companies that take early action should not be disadvantaged by an output based emissions regime. canfor was an
early signatory to the climate change voluntary challenge and registry program, a federal program introduced in 1997 to encourage
companies to inventory and track their greenhouse gas emissions (ghgs) and take actions to stabilize and reduce those emissions. canfor
has implemented projects that have improved energy efficiency and displaced purchased fossil fuel energy with renewable biomass
energy, thereby reducing ghg emissions both on absolute and per unit of production bases. canfor has opportunities to further reduce
ghg emissions particularly through increased utilization of sawmill wood residuals. in november 2003, the forest products association
of canada (fpac), on behalf of canfor and other forest products companies, signed a “memorandum of understanding respecting action
on climate change” (mou) with the federal government. the mou establishes a framework for upcoming negotiations of a pulp and
paper sector covenant with the federal government. the mou specifies that, “the government of canada will work with fpac parties
and other industries to design a system that will not disadvantage those firms that have taken early action to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions”. the covenant will establish a ghg emissions reduction requirement equivalent to, on average, a reduction of 12% over 2008
to 2012 (the first kyoto commitment period) relative to business as usual ghg emission projections. canfor believes that its pulp and
paper mills are well-positioned to comply with the likely covenant requirements.
     canada-wide standards have been established by the government of canada for respirable particulate (pm 2.5) and ozone levels in
the ambient air, which will become effective in 2010. the pm 2.5 standard could require future source reductions of particulate emissions
from canfor’s pulp, paper and sawmill facilities, the cost of which cannot yet be determined.
     canfor has two remaining ‘tier 1’ burners in british columbia, and is one of three companies utilizing a third burner located at
another company’s premises, also in british columbia. tier 1 burners are regulated by the ministry of environment for phase out by
december 31, 2007. canfor is diligently seeking economically viable solutions for its wood waste and remaining tier 1 burners including
wood-fuelled sawmill energy systems, manufacture of wood pellets and simultaneous electricity and heat co-generation.

financial market risk
demand for forest products, both pulp and paper and wood products, is closely related to global business conditions and tends to be
cyclical in nature. product prices can be subject to volatile change. canfor, like the majority of the canadian forest products industry,
competes in a global market and the majority of its products are sold in us dollars. consequently, foreign currency relationships pose
a significant uncertainty. shifts in these relationships can have a major impact, positive or negative, on profits from operations. the
strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar in the last three years has had a negative impact on sales and profits
from operations. however, by maintaining a substantial proportion of its debt in us dollars, canfor has partially mitigated the impact of
currency fluctuations.


financial instruments – canfor, from time to time, uses derivative markets to hedge future movements of exchange rates or commodity

prices. during 2005, forward exchange contracts totaling us $97.5 million were exercised and an after-tax gain of $1.7 million was
realized (2004 – after-tax gain of $1.4 million realized on forward contracts totaling us$20 million). forward exchange contracts totaling
us $46.4 million were outstanding at december 31, 2005. these contracts were designated as hedges of specific future pulp sales.
       canfor also uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to risk associated with lumber and pulp prices. there were 186
lumber futures contracts outstanding at december 31, 2005, which had an unrealized loss of $0.2 million. at december 31, 2005, canfor
had entered into swaps to hedge 1,500 tonnes of pulp at an average price of us $675 per tonne. there was an unrealized gain of $0.1
million on these swaps at year end.
       through a combination of process improvements and capital spending, operations are reducing natural gas and electricity
consumption. canfor also uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to rising energy costs and, at december 31, 2005, had
entered into commodity swaps hedging future natural gas purchases of 5.6 million gigajoules, at an average price of $6.53 per gigajoule.
there was an unrealized gain of $18.6 million on these swaps at december 31, 2005.
       since canfor’s long-term debt is primarily fixed in rate, there is no significant impact to net income when interest rates change.


sensitivities – the sensitivity of canfor’s results to currency swings and prices for its principal products, when operating at full capacity,

is estimated to be approximately as follows:

                                                                                                                                                                    impact on annual

the above sensitivities do not reflect the correlation that canfor believes exists between us dollar denominated commodity prices and
the us dollar exchange rate.

labour agreements
the labour agreement with the uswa (united steelworkers of america), formerly the industrial, wood and allied workers of canada,
covering their bc interior certified solid wood operations that expired in june 2003 was ratified by all of canfor’s bc interior sawmill
operations in 2004. negotiations were also successfully concluded with the pulp, paper and woodworkers of canada (ppwc) at north
central plywood and mackenzie. the agreements provide for wage increases totaling 11% over a six-year term, expiring june 30, 2009.
most of the agreements also contain a provision for a bonus plan based on a “return on capital employed” formula. there were very few
benefit plan improvements included in the agreements and most contain benefit plan changes that will either control or minimize some of
the future employer-paid benefit plan premium cost increases. there are also provisions for increased employee (ongoing) and employer
(2 years) pension plan contributions as well as increased employee and employer long-term disability premium contributions.
     the cep (communications, energy and paperworkers union) contract with the grande prairie, alberta operation expired at the
end of february 2004. negotiations for the renewal of this contract were concluded in early 2005. the agreement is similar to canfor’s
bc lumber operations agreements


nafta lawsuit
on july 11, 2002, canfor filed a notice of arbitration and statement of claim against the government of the united states for damages of
not less than us $250 million under chapter 11 of the north american free trade agreement (nafta), as a result of the doc’s actions
in issuing the preliminary and final determinations in the countervailing and anti-dumping proceedings. canfor has asserted that the
actions of the us government have amounted to breaches of certain provisions of nafta, including the failure to provide canfor with fair
and equitable treatment in accordance with international law. canfor and the us government selected a three-member panel to hear the
dispute and a hearing on jurisdiction occurred in november 2004. however, a decision from the panel on jurisdiction was stayed pending
the us government’s request to consolidate canfor’s action with other lumber companies that have sought chapter 11 proceedings.
the us government’s consolidation application was heard by a separate three-member panel in june 2005 (the “new panel”). the new
panel ruled that the chapter 11 actions of canfor, tembec and terminal forest products should be consolidated and heard together. in
january 2006 a hearing on jurisdiction occurred before the new panel and a decision is expected in the next two to three months.

auditor’s report

to the shareholders of canfor corporation
we have audited the consolidated balance sheets of canfor corporation as at december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, and the
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and cash flow for the years then ended. these financial statements are
the responsibility of the company’s management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
     we conducted our audits in accordance with canadian generally accepted auditing standards. those standards require that
we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.
     in our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company
as at december 31, 2005 and december 31, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

notes to the consolidated financial statements



december 31, 2005

1. significant accounting policies


basis of presentation of financial statements
these financial statements include the accounts of canfor corporation (the company) and its subsidiary companies, hereinafter referred
to as “canfor”. investments over which the company exercises significant influence are accounted for using the equity method, in which
the original investment is recorded at cost and is subsequently adjusted for the company’s share of post acquisition earnings. joint
ventures are proportionately consolidated.


use of estimates
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with canadian generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. it is reasonably
possible that circumstances may arise which cause actual results to differ from management estimates, however, management does
not believe it is likely that such differences will materially affect canfor’s financial position.
      significant areas requiring the use of management estimates are deferred reforestation costs, inventory valuations, amortization
rates, accrued anti-dumping and countervailing duties and pension and other benefit plan assumptions.


temporary investments
temporary investments comprise bankers acceptances, commercial paper and other short-term instruments with maturities of three
months or less, and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.


valuation of inventories
inventories of lumber, panels, pulp and kraft paper are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value. logs and chips are
valued at average cost or the greater of net realizable value and replacement cost if lower than average cost. processing materials and
supplies are valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost.


property, plant, equipment and timber
canfor capitalizes the costs of major replacements, extensions and improvements to plant and equipment, together with related interest
incurred during the construction period on major projects.


assets are amortized over the following estimated productive lives:

amortization of logging and manufacturing assets is calculated on a unit of production basis. amortization of plant and equipment not
employed in logging and manufacturing is calculated on a straight-line basis. logging roads are amortized on a basis related to the
volume of timber harvested. for those tree farm licenses and timber licenses which are renewable with the province of british columbia,
amounts capitalized as timber are amortized over the estimated tree growth cycle as volume is harvested. non-renewable licenses are
amortized over the period of the license.

deferred charges
software development costs relating to major systems are deferred and amortized over periods not longer than five years. start-up costs
for the newly constructed oriented strand board mill are being amortized over a period of three years.


deferred reforestation
canfor accrues the undiscounted cost of the reforestation required under its timber harvest agreements at the time that the timber is
harvested. the liability is re-measured at fair value at the end of the fiscal period, as discussed in note 2.


employee benefit plans
canfor has various defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide both pension and other retirement benefits to most of its
salaried employees and certain hourly employees not covered by forest industry union plans. canfor also provides certain health care
benefits and pension bridging benefits to eligible retired employees.
     canfor accrues the costs and related obligations of the defined benefit pension and other retirement benefit plans using the
projected benefit actuarial method prorated on service and management’s best estimates of expected plan investment performance,
salary escalation, and other relevant factors. for the purpose of calculating the expected return on plan assets, those assets are valued
at fair value. actuarial gains (losses) arise from the difference between the actual and expected long-term rates of return on plan
assets for a period or from changes in actuarial assumptions used to determine the accrued benefit obligation. the excess of the net
accumulated actuarial gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is amortized over
the average remaining service period of the active employees, which is 15 years for both pension and other benefit plans. past service
costs arising from plan amendments are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
employees active at the date of the amendment. on january 1, 2000, canfor adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute
of chartered accountants relating to the accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits using the prospective application
method. canfor is amortizing the transitional obligation on a straight-line basis over 15 years, which was the average remaining service
period of employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plan as of january 1, 2000.
     pension expense for the defined contribution plans is based on a percentage of employees’ salaries or on a contribution required
under collective agreements.
     for hourly employees covered by forest industry union defined benefit pension plans, earnings are charged with canfor’s
contributions required under the collective agreements.


revenue recognition
canfor’s revenues are derived from the following major product lines: lumber, pulp, kraft paper, panel products and raw logs. revenue
is recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, goods have been
delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured. sales are reported net of discounts and allowances. amounts charged to customers
for shipping and handling are recognized as revenue, and shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are reported as cost of
sales. lumber duties are recorded as a component of costs of sales.


foreign currency translation
the majority of canfor’s sales and long-term debt are denominated in foreign currencies. foreign currencies are translated into
canadian dollars using the temporal method as follows: monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; non-monetary
assets and liabilities at historical rates; and revenues and expenses at exchange rates prevailing at the time the transaction occurs.
exchange gains and losses are reflected in income immediately. however, prior to january 1, 2003, canfor hedged its us dollar long-
term debt with its us dollar revenue streams. exchange losses deferred prior to canfor’s termination of this hedging relationship are
recognized into income in the same periods as the corresponding debt repayments.
     canfor’s foreign operations are considered to be self-sustaining and the assets and liabilities are translated using the current rate
method. the translation gain or loss is included as a component of shareholders’ equity.

income taxes
canfor accounts for income taxes using the liability method. under this method, future income tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on the temporary differences between the accounting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. these temporary differences
are measured using the current tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences reverse. future tax benefits, such as capital
loss carry-forwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is considered more likely than not. the effect on future
tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the substantive enactment date of
the change occurs.


derivative financial instruments
canfor utilizes derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage its foreign exchange and
commodity price risk. for example, from time to time, canfor purchases foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge anticipated sales
to customers in the united states and the related accounts receivable and also enters into swap transactions to reduce its exposure to
fluctuating natural gas prices. canfor’s policy is not to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
     canfor formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and
liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. canfor also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge
and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of hedged items.
     gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to hedge us dollar denominated sales are recognized as an
adjustment to revenue at the time that the contract is exercised. gains and losses on natural gas swaps are recognized as an adjustment
to manufacturing costs when the contracts are settled.


impairment of long-lived assets
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable, as measured by comparison of their net book value to the estimated future cash flows
generated by their use. impaired assets are recorded at fair value, determined principally using discounted future cash flows expected
from their use and eventual disposition.


stock-based compensation plans
canfor has three stock-based compensation plans, as described in note 14.
     when stock options are granted to employees under the stock option performance plan, compensation expense is recorded
based on a fair value method of accounting. the fair value of the options is determined using an option pricing model that takes into
account, as of the grant date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the current price of the underlying stock and its expected
volatility, expected dividends on the stock, and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. the resulting fair value
of the options is amortized over their vesting periods. cash consideration received from employees when they exercise the options is
credited to share capital.
     compensation expense is recognized for canfor’s contributions to the employee share purchase plan when they are made.
     compensation expense is recognized for canfor’s deferred share unit plan when the deferred share units are granted, and
changes in market value of the underlying shares are reflected in earnings at the end of each period.

2. change in accounting policies


vendor rebates
in september 2005, the cica issued a new abstract, eic 156 accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer (including a
reseller of the vendor’s products), effective january 1, 2006. the eic clarifies the measurement and presentation of vendor discounts
and volume rebates, which canfor had previously presented under “costs and expenses”. canfor elected to adopt the abstract effective
january 1, 2005, which reduced both sales and costs and expenses by $103.3 million for the year (2004 – $105.0 million).


convertible debentures
effective january 1, 2005, canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants
(cica) concerning the balance sheet presentation of financial instruments as liabilities or equity. canfor had previously accounted for its
convertible subordinated debentures as equity, including the related interest charges, in accordance with eic-71 financial instruments
that may be settled at the issuer’s option in cash or its own equity instruments. prior year figures have been restated to reflect the
debentures as liabilities and the related interest as an expense on the income statement. this had no impact on previously reported
earnings per share or retained earnings. the debentures had a maturity date of november 23, 2006 but were converted in november
2004 with the issuance of 11,742,424 common shares.


variable interest entities
effective january 1, 2005, canfor adopted the cica’s new accounting guideline for the consolidation of variable interest entities. the
primary objective of the guideline is to identify and report on entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights. the adoption of this guideline did not have a material impact on canfor’s financial position or results of operations.


cash and temporary investments
effective january 1, 2005, canfor retroactively amended its presentation of cash and temporary investments to include unpresented
cheques, which were previously included in accounts payable.


asset retirement obligations
effective january 1, 2004, canfor retroactively adopted the new recommendations of the canadian institute of chartered accountants
(cica) for asset retirement obligations, which require that such obligations be measured at fair value. the change in accounting for
deferred reforestation resulted in a $0.2 million increase to the deferred reforestation expense in 2005 (2004 - $2.2 million). the new
recommendations were not applied to retirement obligations for assets with indeterminate useful lives because sufficient information
is not presently available to estimate a range of potential settlement dates for the obligations.


shipping and handling costs
prior to january 1, 2004, canfor, along with other companies in the forest industry, presented sales net of shipping and handling costs.
effective january 1, 2004, the cica introduced new recommendations for the application of generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap), which, among other things, prohibit the use of “industry practice” and provide guidance on alternate sources to consult with
when an issue is not specifically addressed by canadian gaap. as a result of applying the new standard, effective january 1, 2004, canfor
has reclassified shipping and handling costs and countervailing and anti-dumping duties to cost of sales. also in accordance with cica
handbook section 3400, revenue, shipping and handling costs recovered from customers have been included in sales. prior periods
have been reclassified for comparability.

3. acquisitions and divestitures


acquisition of slocan forest products ltd.
on april 1, 2004, canfor and slocan forest products ltd. (slocan) completed the combination of their businesses after having obtained
the approval of slocan shareholders on march 25, 2004 and of the supreme court of british columbia on march 30, 2004. under the plan
of arrangement, canfor acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of slocan in exchange for the issuance to slocan shareholders
of 1.3147 canfor shares for each slocan share held by them. 49.3 million canfor shares were issued and were valued at $9.18 per share,
which was the average market price of the shares shortly before and after the date that the terms of the combination were agreed to
and announced.
       slocan was amalgamated with canadian forest products ltd., canfor’s principal operating subsidiary, on april 1, 2004. the
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method, in which the purchase consideration was allocated to the estimated fair
values of the assets and liabilities assumed as of april 1, 2004. the amounts assigned to the net assets and liabilities acquired was based
on their estimated fair values at april 1, 2004, as follows:

discontinued operations
in the fourth quarter of 2005, canfor announced its intention to transfer its englewood logging operation and associated timber licenses
to a new limited partnership, coastal fibre limited partnership (cflp), jointly owned with oji paper canada ltd. in consideration of the
transfer canfor will receive a partnership interest valued at $45 million, which approximates book value of the assets transferred. cflp
has agreed to transfer these assets to western forest products ltd. (wfp) in return for, among other things, a long-term agreement
with wfp to supply cflp with fibre, and cflp has agreed to supply this fibre to howe sound pulp and paper limited partnership. the
transfer, which is subject to regulatory clearance under the federal competition act and by the british columbia minister of forests, is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2006. as a result of this transaction, canfor has reclassified its coastal operations segment as
discontinued operation and all comparative figures have been restated.
       during the second quarter of 2005, canfor completed the sale of its fort st james, slocan and valemount sawmills in british
columbia for total cash proceeds of $59.0 million. a net after-tax loss of $4.7 million was recorded on the dispositions. the sale of the
fort st james mill and associated harvesting rights was directed by the federal commissioner of competition as a condition to canfor’s
acquisition of slocan forest products ltd. on april 1, 2004. the decision to sell the slocan and valemount sawmills was made as part of
a process to focus the company’s manufacturing assets around certain product lines and fibre baskets. canfor retained the right to any
refund of countervailing and anti-dumping duty (note 16) paid prior to the dispositions.

employee share purchase plan
canfor has a share purchase plan, which is available to all employees. purchases of common shares under this plan occur on the open
market. under the plan the employees can purchase up to 10% of their base salary or wage. canfor matches 30% of the first 5% of the
amount contributed by the employee and pays the share purchase plan brokerage fees. in 2005, contributions of $1.8 million were made
towards the purchase of the company’s common shares under the terms of the plan (2004 – $1.6 million).


deferred share unit plan
on january 1, 2002, the company implemented a deferred share unit plan for non-employee directors of the company. a deferred
share unit (dsu) is a right granted to a non-employee director to receive one common share of the company, purchased on the
open market, or the cash equivalent, on a deferred payment basis. the maximum number of dsus outstanding under the plan is
1,000,000, and currently each non-employee director is entitled to 2,500 dsus per year. the value of the dsus, when redeemed, is equal
to the market value of the shares on the redemption date, including the value of dividends paid on the company’s common shares, if any,
as if they had been reinvested in additional dsus on each payment date. the dsus may only be redeemed upon a director’s retirement
from the company, its subsidiaries or any affiliated entity. the value of the outstanding dsus at december 31, 2005 was $1.0 million
(2004 – $1.2 million).


15. employee future benefits


canfor has several funded and unfunded defined benefit plans, as well as defined contribution plans, that provide pension, other
retirement and post-employment benefits to substantially all salaried employees and certain hourly employees. the defined benefit
plans are based on years of service and final average salary. canfor’s other post-employment benefit plans are non-contributory and
include a range of health care and other benefits.
     canfor acquired slocan forest products ltd. in april 2004 (note 3), including its pension and other employee benefit plans.
subsequent restructuring in 2004 included termination of employees, which resulted in the recognition of special termination benefits
of $1.8 million.
     the company is in the process of winding up its taylor sawmill pension plan, following the closure of the mill in 2004 (note 17), and,
as a result, a settlement loss of $1.3 million has been recognized in the current year’s expense (2004 – $5.3 million curtailment loss).
     total cash payments for employee future benefits for 2005 were $49.7 million (2004 – $45.9 million), consisting of cash contributed
by the company to its funded pension plans, cash payments directly to beneficiaries for its unfunded other benefit plans, cash contributed
to its defined contribution plans, and cash contributed to its forest industry union defined benefit plans.

                                                                                                                                  2005                                                  2004

sensitivity analysis
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other benefit plans. a one-percentage-
point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects for 2005:

                                                                                                                                                  1% increase                        1% decrease

defined contribution and other plans
the total cost recognized in 2005 for the company’s defined contribution plans was $2.1 million (2004 – $1.2 million).
           canfor contributes to various forest industry union defined benefit pension plans providing both pension and other retirement
benefits. these plans are accounted for as defined contribution plans. contributions to these plans, not included in the cost recognized
for defined contribution plans above, amounted to $30.4 million in 2005 (2004 – $29.5 million).


16. countervailing and anti-dumping duties


the us department of commerce (doc) determination that resulted in countervailing duty (cvd) of 18.79% was appealed to a nafta
panel. as a result of a series of nafta panel rulings and remands to the doc, on november 22, 2005, the doc issued a fifth remand
determination with a cvd rate of 0.80%, which is considered “de minimis.” it is the position of the canadian parties that this finding
requires the cvd order to be revoked and all cvd deposits that have been collected so far, and that have not been liquidated, to be
refunded with interest. (in canfor’s case, none of its cvd deposits have been liquidated.) it is the position of the doc that if the fifth
remand determination is upheld, it will operate prospectively only, which means that the cvd order would be considered to have been
effective for the period may 22, 2002 through at least november 22, 2005. the fifth remand determination is currently under challenge
by various parties before the nafta panel. this nafta cvd appeal will have no effect on cvd cash deposits or cvd until there is a final
result in that appeal.
           while the nafta litigation was proceeding, the doc conducted “annual administrative reviews” of the cvd order. on december
20, 2004 the doc published its final determination for the first annual administrative review covering the period from may 22, 2002 to
march 31, 2003 (por1), setting the cvd rate at 17.18%. this rate is to be used to determine the actual duties due for entries made during
por1, and the cvd cash deposit rate for shipments made on or after december 20, 2004. at that time, canfor reduced the cvd expense
accrual for por1 for the difference between the original deposit rate of 18.79% and the revised rate of 17.18% and began expensing at
the 17.18% rate for shipments subsequent to december 20, 2004. in february 2005, as a result of ministerial errors in the calculation, the
doc announced a further reduction to this rate, to 16.37%, applicable to assessment of cvd for por1 and to future cvd cash deposits. as
a result, in the first quarter of 2005, canfor further reduced its cvd accrual for por1 by $6.5 million, to record cvd expense at 16.37%.
the results in this review are on appeal and are therefore not final. on december 12, 2005, the doc published its determination for the
second administrative review, covering the period from may 2003 to april 2004 (por2). the doc set an assessment rate of 8.70% for
por2 entries and as the cash deposit rate on lumber entries occurring on or after december 12, 2005. it is anticipated that the final
determination in this review will be appealed. the doc’s third administrative review, which is currently underway, will determine the
assessment of cvd duties for the period from april 1, 2004 to march 31, 2005 as well as the future cash deposit rate. preliminary review
results are due may 31, 2006 and final results are due in the fall of 2006 but can be extended until as late as december 2006.




                                      c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   74   n o t e s t o t h e c o n s o l i d at e d f i n a n c i a l s tat e m e n t s

     in the case of the anti-dumping duty (add), from may 22, 2002 to december 21, 2004 cash deposits were made at 5.96%, which
was the rate required at that time. canfor recorded the add expense for that period at a lower rate, which was estimated by applying
the doc’s methodology to updated sales and cost data as they become available. the final rate will be determined when an official
administrative review is complete for the respective periods. the doc’s first annual administrative review of the add order covering
the period from may 22, 2002 to april 30, 2003 (por1) was completed in december 2004. this led to a change in the cash deposit rate
on december 21, 2004 from the original rate of 5.96% to a weighted average rate for canfor and slocan of 1.83%. in december 2004,
canfor reduced its expense accrual for por1 to reflect these announced final rates. canfor’s results of the first administrative review
are on appeal and are therefore not final. the second annual administrative review of the add order covered the period may 1, 2003 to
april 30, 2004 (por2), and final results were published on december 12, 2005. the doc determined the add assessment rate for canfor
at 1.36% (subsequently amended by the doc on january 23, 2006 to 1.35%) for por2 and for cash deposits on lumber shipments after
december 12, 2005. it is anticipated that canfor’s results in this review will be appealed.
     in the initial add investigation and in the first and second add administrative reviews, canfor was one of the companies selected
as a mandatory respondent, and for this reason has received its own company-specific add rate. however, in the third administrative
anti-dumping review, which covers the period from may 1, 2004 to april 30, 2005 (por3), the doc employed a sampling methodology,
and canfor was not selected as a mandatory respondent in the sampling process. as a result, canfor may be assigned the “all others”
rate arising from the averaging of the rates of the mandatory respondents selected for por3 in the manner announced by the doc.
there is no way of estimating what this rate may be. canfor filed a voluntary questionnaire response in the third review, but the doc
refused to accept canfor as a voluntary respondent, which would have given canfor its own add rate for the third review. canfor intends
to challenge the doc’s refusal vigorously, as well as the sampling methodology that was used to select mandatory respondents for the
third review. given the uncertainty around the likely final rates to be determined for the add with respect to por3 canfor has made no
adjustments to duties previously expensed for por2 to reflect the lower cvd and add rate as announced in december 2005.
     since december 20, 2004 canfor has expensed the duties at the same rate at which deposits are being paid, which was
16.37% for cvd and 1.83% for add until december 12, 2005, and 8.70% and 1.36% (subsequently amended by the doc to 1.35% on
january 21, 2006), respectively, thereafter. the cumulative additional cvd accrued in excess of the cash deposits made at december 31,
2005 is $67.4 million and is included in “other accruals and provisions” (note 11). the cumulative add cash deposits in excess of the
calculated expense accrued at december 31, 2005 is $113.7 million and is being carried as a receivable under “long-term investments
and other” (note 5).
     the nafta panel hearing the appeal of the us international trade commission (itc) finding that canadian imports threatened
injury to the us softwood lumber industry repeatedly found that the itc determination violated us law. eventually, the itc issued a
remand determination finding that the us softwood lumber industry was not threatened with material injury by reason of canadian
imports. as expected, the us challenged the nafta panel’s decision by recourse to a special extraordinary challenge committee (ecc)
under the nafta. the ecc ruled against the us on august 10, 2005. the position of the canadian parties is that the us anti-dumping
and countervailing duty orders must be terminated, with effect as from may 22, 2002, due to the itc’s having found no threat of injury
in its nafta remand determination. however, the us position is that an itc determination that there was a threat of injury, which was
made in a “section 129” proceeding following the us’s loss of its defense of the original itc determination before the wto, effectively
takes the place of the itc’s negative remand determination in nafta, and supplies the legal underpinning for maintaining the cvd and
add orders in effect. the matter is now being litigated before the u.s. court of international trade (cit), and is expected to be decided
by the cit in mid-2006.
     the “us coalition for fair lumber imports” also has challenged chapter 19 appeals process for antidumping and countervailing
duty proceedings, in an effort to undermine all of the nafta panel decisions mentioned above. it is unclear when the court handling this
challenge, the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit, will decide that case.
     as at december 31, 2005, canfor (including slocan before april 1,2004) had paid combined duty deposits of us $733.4 million (add
of $173.5 million and cvd of $559.9 million) since the inception of cvd and add in may 2002. all of these deposits, would be eligible for
refund to canfor with interest if the litigation concerning the effect of the itc negative remand determination were successful.
     the company and other canadian forest product companies, the canadian federal government and canadian provincial
governments (canadian interests) categorically deny the us allegations and strongly disagree with the final countervailing and dumping




                  c a n f o r c o r p o r at i o n a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 0 5   75   n o t e s t o t h e c o n s o l i d at e d f i n a n c i a l s tat e m e n t s

determinations made by the doc in the investigations and reviews, and with the itc’s determination in the “section 129” proceeding.
canadian interests continue to aggressively defend the canadian industry in this us trade dispute. canadian interests may appeal the
decision of these administrative agencies to the appropriate courts, nafta panels and the wto.


17. restructuring, mill closure and other severance costs


restructuring costs of $5.3 million were recorded in 2005. the expense includes mill closure costs of $3.8 million, which are mainly
related to the permanent closure of the tackama sawmill in the third quarter, severance costs of $1.1 million, and restructuring costs
of $0.4 million associated with the formation of a jointly owned paper sales and marketing partnership with an external party.
      restructuring costs of $36.5 million were recorded in 2004. the expense was comprised of $20.4 million of severance and other
costs associated with the integration of canfor and slocan operations and $16.1 million of mill closure costs related to the closures of
the taylor, upper fraser and hines creek sawmills and the quesnel specialty mill.

20. unusual expense


the forestry revitalization plan
in march 2003, the government of british columbia (the crown) introduced the forestry revitalization plan (the plan) that provides for
significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees. the changes prescribed
in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations, the elimination of existing timber processing regulations, and
the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses. through legislation, licensees are required to
return 20% of their replaceable tenure to the crown. the plan states that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open
up opportunities for woodlots, community forests and first nations and the other half will be available for public auction. licensees will
be compensated by the crown for the return of tenure and related infrastructure costs such as roads and bridges.
       the effect of the timber take-back resulted in a reduction of approximately 2.4 million cubic metres to canfor’s existing allowable
annual cut on its replaceable tenures.
       on october 28, 2005, canfor signed an agreement with the province of british columbia, in which canfor received $57.0 million in
compensation for the loss of tenures noted above, and a $5.0 million advance payment against lost infrastructure and road construction
costs. a loss of $8.8 million was recorded on the tenures taken back. canfor is continuing discussions with the province for further
compensation for infrastructure, but the amount and timing of additional compensation, if any, is not yet determinable.

24. financial instruments


commodity price risk
canfor uses financial instruments to reduce its exposure to risks associated with lumber and pulp prices and energy costs. at december
31, 2005, there were 186 lumber futures contracts outstanding, (2004 – 195) which had an unrealized loss of $0.2 million. canfor also
entered into swaps to hedge 1,500 tonnes of pulp at an average price of us $675 per tonne. there was an unrealized gain of $0.1 million
on these contracts at december 31, 2005. commodity swaps hedging future natural gas purchases of 5.6 million gigajoules were
outstanding at the end of the year (2004 – 2.6 million) at an average price of $6.53 per gigajoule. there was an unrealized gain of $18.6
million on these swaps at december 31, 2005 (2004 – $0.1 million).


credit risk
canfor does not have a significant concentration of credit risk as no one individual customer accounts for 10% or more of total company
sales. canfor reviews the credit history of all new customers before extending credit and also performs regular reviews of the credit
performance of existing customers. canfor may require payment guarantees, such as letters of credit, or obtains credit insurance
coverage. the allowance for doubtful accounts as at december 31, 2005 was $0.2 million (2004 – $0.6 million).


currency risk
a significant portion of canfor’s income from operations is generated from sales denominated in us dollars. in order to manage some
of the risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates, canfor enters into forward exchange contracts from time to time. at december
31, 2005, canfor had us $46.4 million of forward contracts outstanding. these contracts were fixed at an average rate of 1.1702 and
have option periods extending through to april 2006. there was an unrecognized gain of $0.1 million on these contracts at december
31, 2005. in 2005, contracts totaling $97.5 million were exercised and a gain of $2.1 million was realized (2004 – contracts totaling $20.0
million at a gain of $1.8 million).


interest rate risk
canfor is exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments. the company has considered, but does not use, derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk.

joint venture, transferred the business of howe sound into a limited partnership, hslp. the partnership continues to be jointly owned
by canfor and oji and continues to carry on the existing operations of howe sound.
     as part of the reorganization, howe sound was amalgamated with canadian forest products ltd. (cfp), canfor’s principal
operating subsidiary, and approximately $643 million of tax losses of howe sound became available to reduce the future taxable income
of cfp. in 2001, as part of the reorganization, cfp made a payment of $60.2 million to the partnership, which was applied to reduce
the long-term debt of howe sound assumed by the partnership. further payments were made to the partnership in 2002 and 2004 of
$5.0 million and $7.0 million respectively as a result of losses utilized, and a further, final payment of $50.0 million was made to the
partnership on january 2, 2005.
     as a result of this reorganization, cfp recorded a future income tax asset and a deferred credit, which were $18.0 million and
$14.1 million, respectively, at december 31, 2005 ($48.9 million and $27.2 million at december 31, 2004). the deferred credit is being
recognized in income on a systematic basis.
     canfor wrote off its investment in the joint venture in 1998 and no longer reflects its share of the joint venture’s results in its
earnings. canfor’s method of accounting for its interest in the partnership did not change as a result of the reorganization.
     while canfor does not reflect the partnership’s results in its earnings, it is required to include its share of the limited partner’s
income or loss, within the limits imposed by the income tax act (canada), in the calculation of taxable income. there was no impact
on canfor’s future income tax recovery in 2005 but in 2004 this had the effect of increasing canfor’s future income tax recovery by $1.1
million. any income tax expense incurred by canfor will be reimbursed by the partnership.

27. canfor-lp osb limited partnership


canfor has entered into a limited partnership agreement with louisiana-pacific canada ltd. to jointly undertake construction
and operation of an oriented strand board mill with rated annual capacity of 820 million square feet (3/8” basis) in fort st. john, british
columbia. canfor has agreed to supply 330,000 cubic metres of timber annually to the joint venture out of its existing timber tenure
in the area.
       during 2005, canfor made capital contributions of $102.3 million to the venture (2004 – $38.2 million). in order to retain its 50%
interest, canfor has agreed to contribute 50% of the capital to fund the project, which is estimated to have a total funding requirement of
approximately $288.0 million, of which $258.0 million is capital, $17.0 million is for deferred costs, and the balance is for working capital.
at the end of 2005, construction was near completion and the mill had commenced limited production in december.


these consolidated financial statements include the following amounts, which represent canfor’s 50% ownership interest in the

electrical co-generation incentive payments
in 2003, canfor entered into an agreement with bc hydro to build an electrical co-generation facility at canfor’s prince george pulp
and paper mill. under the agreement, bc hydro was to contribute up to $45.8 million of the project costs, with canfor contributing the
balance. incentive payments of $8.3 million were received from bc hydro in the first quarter of 2005 and a final payment of $11.5 million
was recorded as a receivable in the fourth quarter. total incentive payments of $26.0 million were received in 2004. these incentive
payments were accounted for as a credit to property, plant and equipment. the project was completed in the second quarter of 2005 at
a net cost to canfor of $69.6 million. canfor has entered into a 15-year commitment with bc hydro for power displacement at the co-
generation facility, whereby a proportionate repayment is required should the facility not generate a minimum of 390 gigawatt hours of
electricity per year. as required in the agreement, canfor has posted a letter of credit in the amount of $21.8 million as security.


30. subsequent events


on january 18th, canfor announced that it had signed an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of new south companies
inc. (“new south”) in a transaction valued at us $205 million, including working capital of approximately us $55 million. new south
is headquartered in myrtle beach, south carolina and operates three sawmills, two treating plants, a fingerjoint plant and a european
lumber import business. the acquisition will be effected by a plan of merger requiring the approval of the holders of two-thirds of new
south’s outstanding shares. the acquisition agreement provides for the payment of certain amounts to canfor in the event that the
transaction is not completed by new south for certain reasons. shareholders of new south representing approximately 80% of the
outstanding voting shares of new south have agreed to support the transaction. other customary closing conditions will apply. the
transfer is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006 and will be funded from canfor’s existing resources.
     on february 15, 2006 canfor announced that it intends to separate its pulp business from its wood products business. canfor
proposes to transfer to an indirectly owned limited partnership, its northern softwood kraft pulp and paper business, including its
northwood pulp mill, intercontinental pulp mill and prince george pulp and paper mill, together with associated management (the “pulp
income trust”). the pulp income trust is proposed to be completed through a plan of arrangement under which canfor will distribute a
20% interest in the pulp income trust to its shareholders and retain an 80% interest. completion of the pulp income trust is subject to
a number of approvals, including approval by canfor’s shareholders and lenders and the supreme court of british columbia, as well as
receipt of a tax ruling confirming the expected treatment of the distribution of trust units as a return of capital to canfor’s shareholders.
a special meeting of shareholders to approve the pulp income trust is expected to occur in june 2006.
