   massimo tinazzi runs one of emmeti’s installers,
   termoidraulica mv di tinazzi massimo, based in
   fontanelle in the province of treviso in italy. as
   a very dedicated installer, he proudly presents
   his own highly energy-efficient home, which has
   an a+ efficiency rating.
       thanks to excellent insulation and efficient
   heat-storage solutions, the energy generated by
   the electric pv panels is greater than that required
   within the home, so the excess energy can be
   sold back to the energy distributor. as a result,
   running costs are zero – an excellent return on
   investment.
       the products installed in this highly efficient
   home include the mirai smi inverter heat pump,
   which can supply heating and cooling systems
   for summer and winter comfort. this is one of
   the most efficient a++ rated air/water heat
   pumps on the market. the house also benefits
   from the emmeti underfloor system, with pipes
   and manifolds produced in emmeti’s factories
   and supported by insulation panels that have
   been designed in-house. the solar pv panels are
   emmeti sun polycrystalline modules, exclusively
   assembled in italy.
       one of the key features of the house is the
   febos hp system. this software, designed ex-
   clusively by emmeti, increases the energy output
   during periods of high availability and stores it in
   concrete flooring for use at a later date. “with no
   emissions, no gas consumption, and no mainte-
   nance costs, this truly is a highly energy-efficient
   home, made possible by emmeti’s energy-effi-
   cient solutions,” says massimo tinazzi, owner of
   both termoidraulica and the house.

nordkalk has extensive experience of flue-gas
desulphurisation (fgd) at power plants. the
newest solution consists of granules made of
hydrated lime that are used in packed bed filters
designed for land-based combustion units. this
technology is used worldwide and it has recent-
ly been modified to enable flue-gas desulphuri-
sation onboard ships, which as of january 2015
need to comply with the strict sulphur limits for
fuel used in seca (sulphur emission control
areas). the sulphur emissions are absorbed by
the granules provided by nordkalk. nordkalk’s
turnkey solution also includes collection of the
used granules, which can be reused in applica-
tions such as agriculture or in the construction
industry. the solution is based on a closed-loop
process, which causes no emissions to water or
waste to be disposed of.
    two dnv-certified dry scrubbers using nord-
kalk’s granules have been installed onboard the
german shipping company rörd braren’s vessels,
which ship the pulp of one of the world’s largest
pulp suppliers, the swedish company södra cell.
the hydrated lime granules will also be introduced
to water treatment applications.
