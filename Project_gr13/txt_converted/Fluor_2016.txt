2015 sustainability report

fluor builds. a sustainable world.
fluor is more than a business. we have a relationship with the world. we work with stakeholders who want what we want: a healthy
place to live and work and an opportunity to thrive. we are solving problems not only for today’s generations but also for generations
to come. together, we and our stakeholders will build solutions that are sustainable over time. we are vested in the future, and our
responsibilities are clear.

about the cover
a fluor-led joint venture, pegasus link constructors llc, is providing design-build services for the texas department of transportation
horseshoe project in dallas,texas. the project is dedicated to improving mobility near the downtown dallas central business district
in a safe, efficient, reliable and environmentally sensitive manner. the $798 million project will improve traffic flow through the
heart of downtown dallas. construction improvements include the expansion, replacement and addition of several new bridges
and roadways along interstates 30 and 35e in the dallas mixmaster and the construction of a new signature bridge, the margaret
mcdermott bridge, over i-30. safety will be enhanced for drivers with the improved traffic flow, and pedestrians and cyclists can use
paths and facilities designed for them along the i-30 eastbound and westbound frontage roads. the design-build project delivery
will result in a shorter construction schedule and lower overall cost for the client. construction on the horseshoe project began
in summer 2013, with a projected completion date of 2017. in 2015, the construction project achieved 1 million hours without a
recordable incident.

project profiles     to become more sustainable and contribute to
                     sustainable development. gri provides companies
                     and organizations with a comprehensive sustainability
                     reporting framework that is widely used globally. g4
                     is the latest version of gri’s sustainability reporting
                     guidelines.

                     gri offers core and comprehensive options for an
                     organization to prepare its sustainability report
                     according to the guidelines. the core option contains
                     the essential elements of a sustainability report and
                     provides the background against which an organization
                     communicates the impacts of its economic,

                     the comprehensive option builds on the core option,
                     requiring additional standard disclosures of an

                     fluor believes that a collaborative work environment benefits all parties, including employees, clients and
                     shareholders. the company acknowledges employees’ legal rights to choose whether or not to join third-party
                     organizations without fear of retaliation, coercion or harassment. these rights are in accordance with applicable
                     laws related to third-party involvement, which may include labor unions and/or trade unions in countries in which
                     fluor employees work. the company periodically meets and collaborates with such organizations formally and
                     informally. fluor managers and employees receive instruction and periodic training about these rights.

                     approximately 7 percent of fluor’s u.s. workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements; however, this
                     percentage fluctuates as the project-based workforce changes. fluor does not collect and aggregate global data
                     on specific operations or suppliers that violate or place at significant risk collective bargaining or the right to
                     freedom of association.

                     disruptive behavior, establishing programs that promote the highest standards of employee safety and security.

                     this position includes a zero-tolerance policy that prohibits actual or threatened violence by employees against

                     risk management
                     fluor’s risk mitigation begins with its ethical culture, which supports good decision-making and the company’s stance
                     against corruption.

                     fluor’s business risk management framework (brmfsm) is a formalized system to assess, manage and monitor
                     project business risks. before pursuing new project opportunities, fluor employs this framework to assess a project’s
                     potential risks. “bid/no bid” decisions are based on analyzing a project’s profile. all fluor projects are assessed for
                     corruption-related risks, such as:

                       • the location of the project
                       • the business culture

                     fluor’s code of business conduct and ethics is the centerpiece of the company’s commitment to conduct

governance
                     additionally, given our risk profile, fluor’s anti-corruption program is extensive. fluor prohibits any form of
health, safety &     commercial bribery, and employees are asked to be especially vigilant when dealing with public sector officials.

                     fluor’s anti-bribery and corruption policy provides clear standards for employees.

appendix b
project profiles
                     fluor’s anti-corruption expectations also apply to joint venture partners and agents. fluor conducts due diligence
                     when selecting them and routinely monitors business relationships. fluor limits the number of third-party agents by
                     relying primarily on internal sales staff. agents are required to periodically certify their adherence to fluor
                     anti-corruption requirements.

                     additionally, in 2015, fluor increased project-specific expectations by requiring its projects to develop and
                     implement project compliance and ethics plans. these evolving plans address current and subsequent risks to
                     comply with applicable laws and regulations, fluor policies and practices and contractually imposed compliance and
                     ethics requirements.

                     anti-corruption communication and training
                     training is key to fluor’s risk management. all of fluor’s salaried employees receive training on the code, including
                     anti-corruption policies and practices and other key risks. in 2015, 28,408 employees took advantage of various
                     web-based ethics and compliance training modules, including 22,103 who completed anti-corruption training.
                     another 2,544 employees participated in face-to-face ethics and compliance training, including project-specific,
                     anti-corruption training.

                     fluor’s goal is for every employee to feel confident seeking advice and reporting any ethical concerns without
                     fear of retaliation. investigations are timely and thorough in order to maintain fluor’s high standards for ethics and
                     compliance. results from the 2015 employee engagement survey show the company’s efforts for strong reporting
                     and investigations processes are working. employee response to the survey statement, “management at fluor takes
                     appropriate action to address any violation of fluor’s ethical standards” was very positive, exceeding the response of
                     similar companies and past fluor survey results.

                     governance
                     fluor believes effective corporate governance principles promote fairness, transparency, responsiveness and
                     accountability. conducting business according to these principles strengthens the company’s stakeholder
                     relationships, enhances its reputation and supports fluor’s long-term business success. this is especially important
                     given increased shareholder focus on corporate governance and growing regulatory requirements.

about the company    corporate governance issues. the changes made to fluor’s governance principles in the last five years indicate the
                     effectiveness of these reviews and the board’s commitment to shareholder accountability. enhancements include:

                     the board’s depth and breadth for the benefit of shareholders. accordingly, directors have experience in industries in
                     which the company operates or have particular skills that are beneficial to the company’s business.

                     standards. energy star–certified buildings typically use 35
                     percent less energy and have 35 percent lower carbon emissions
                     than average buildings.

                     sustainability is a company-wide philosophy as reflected in fluor’s breeam-, leed- and energy star-certified
                     buildings. fluor is committed to adopting the best environmental methods wherever possible and reducing
                     energy, carbon and operational expenses.

                     december 2014. during fluor’s tenure, this was extended
                     until december 2015, when power generation ceased
                     on schedule. operating a nuclear reactor for an extra five years, with no new fuel being fabricated, was an innovative
                     approach that was well executed for the client.

                     now, fluor’s focus at wylfa has shifted from operation to decommissioning. removing the remaining spent fuel,
                     which is more than 87,000 fuel elements, will take approximately 3 years, after which crews will begin clearing much
                     of the site. that process will end around 2026, when only the reactor buildings and dry fuel stores will remain.

                     at the portsmouth decontamination & decommissioning project, fluor is leading the largest environmental cleanup
                     ever performed in ohio. in late 2015, the company started work on a 5 million cubic yard, highly engineered and
                     robust onsite waste disposal facility. once complete, this 10-cell disposal facility, with a leachate collection system,
                     8-foot thick lining system and 10-foot thick cap, will be the permanent home to demolition debris from three
                     main processing buildings, along with dozens of support structures totaling 145 acres under roof and associated
                     contaminated soils.
