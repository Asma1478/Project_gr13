1 csr management system
  development
           1.1 identifying material aspects of csr activities
as part of preparing of the corporate social responsibility (csr) report for 2014 we implemented the material aspects
identification procedure recommended by new version g4 of the international gri guidelines. this process aimed at identifying
the areas of our csr activities which are recognised as important by the bank management and represent an area of concern
for our stakeholders.

firstly, implementation of this analysis allowed us to form the basis for further csr work: we understood which of the csr
areas and management processes must be built and improved. secondly, we used the analysis results to determine the content
of the report to make it more relevant and aimed at meeting the stakeholders’ information needs.

 step 1.                              to consider a wide range of topics      analysis of gri standards,                a list of 45 material topics

                                      and to highlight those potentially      analysis of the best similar

 step 2.                              to carry out analysis of the            online opinion poll of 260 people,        graphical diagram showing

 step 3.                              to carry out an expert assessment       assessment of the identified              a list of 18 material gri aspects

                                      so that the report reflects both
                                      positive and negative impacts



the topics that received an assessment score above 4.5 points for stakeholders and above 5.0 points for business development
(figure 1) were recognised as material and included in the report: each is described in terms of management approaches and
explained in terms of corresponding gri guidelines aspects and indicators. the topics located outside the orange zone on the
map were not recognised as material and, according to gri guidelines, are not required to be disclosed in the report. neverthe-
less, we made the decision to include some of these topics in the report, which might also be of interest to our stakeholders.

in the future we plan to analyse sberbank’s and sberbank group’s efficiency on the basis of csr material aspects and report on
selected indicators on a regular basis. in the long term we are also considering the possibility of elaborating and implementing
key performance indicators for the material aspects to build csr management system at the group level.


         1.2 stakeholder engagement
throughout its history, sberbank has functioned as both economic and social financial institution. the success of our development
is closely related to building strong relationships with stakeholders.

stakeholders’ concerns guideline our development activities in all csr areas. we use various communication channels to identify
their expectations and, based on the received feedback, make management decisions, and introduce changes to existing processes.

application of crowdsourcing technology
the search for managerial decisions through crowdsourcing has become a part of the bank’s daily activities, and is used for
product improvement and development of internal processes. in 2014, 123 professional communities of networking employees,
clients, and experts from across russia used the www.sberbank21.ru website to discuss the bank’s current projects. in the
reporting period, crowdsourcing participants suggested the following ideas, including:

        ▶▶ creation of a sberbank online service to submit claims regarding self-service machines malfunctions with a claim
           status monitoring capability;
        ▶▶ early credit repayment through self-service machines and sberbank online;
        ▶▶ creation of a separate information resource “from heart to heart” on sberbank’s website for project work with
           orphanages, and others.

took part in the development of such projects as “building an office for small business”, “new solutions for the development
of sberbank’s corporate client remote service”, and “let’s improve small business products together!”. in particular, small
business representatives proposed introduction of such services as self-collection, sms informing and automated payments
(autopayment service) improving sberbank business online service and others.

ideas exchange
the bank has established the “ideas exchange” platform to encourage its employees get involved in management processes.
the platforms are attended by about 10% of sberbank employees, including the employees of subsidiary banks in kazakhstan,
belarus and ukraine. in 2014 34,500 employees suggested 91,200 ideas, more than a half (51%) of which were implemented.
the total economic effect of their implementation amounted to rub 4.1 bn. the main areas addressed by ideas developers
included:

      ▶▶   increase in the share of non-cash payments;
      ▶▶   attraction of retail funds;
      ▶▶   reduction of the number of errors in business units and an increase in the customer satisfaction level;
      ▶▶   enhancement of collection service performance and a reduction in investment costs (including bu reformatting),
           etc.


        examination of internal regulations

        since 2013 the bank has been committed to a mandatory crowdsourcing examination of internal regulations before their
        approval. altogether, in 2014 crowdsourcing made it possible to submit 60 drafts of internal regulations for discussion.
        we collected about 30,000 proposals from 6,800 employees. more than 20% of these proposals were efficient and
        helped the bank to take into account regional specifics in preparation of documents before their approval.

2 economic impact

          2.1 contributing to the development of regions
          of operation
our main contribution to regional development is that we provide funding for the development of projects aimed not only
at commercial, but also at social benefits. these projects are designed to solve problems of specific regions or the country
as a whole, and thus to accelerate economic development and improve the social situation in the region. we provide loans
to companies operating in industries of importance (oil, agricultural, and light industries) and participate in public-private
partnership (ppp) projects in such sectors as infrastructure development, industrial park construction, and housing and social
facilities construction (kindergartens, schools, and hospitals).

         agricultural “producer card” issued by denizbank

         denizbank has been issuing a bankcard “producer card” designed specifically for customers in the agricultural sector
         for 10 years. the card enables producers to get a loan for a period of up to one year, with loan maturity tied to the
         harvest period when producers earn their main income. this reduces their financial burden during the year and, in
         particular, during the sowing period. the card can also be used for interest-free fuel purchases from partner companies
         for up to five consecutive months. there is also a grace period during which producers can buy seeds, fertilisers, feed
         and other agricultural commodities and pay with the card without the need to pay interest. in 2014 about 500,000
         customers used the agricultural “producer card”.

handling customer complaints
in order to analyse the dynamics of customer complaints, we consider the number of complaints against the total scope of
banking transactions. in 2014 we were able to reduce the number of complaints for the first time despite a continuing increase
in the number of banking transactions by our clients.

to reduce the number of client complaints we took the following measures in 2014:

         ▶▶ developed a new version of service standards – the guidelines for our employees on how to deal with clients and
            their complaints;
         ▶▶ introduced standards for transactional procedures for the most common issues (such as searching for and refunding
            payments and handling any transactions’ issues that involve self-service machines) to facilitate instantaneous
            assistance and prevent grievances.

analysis of complaints in the group revealed that most often complaints are connected to issues that arise while a customer is
making payments, depositing and withdrawing cash through atm and internet booking. also, our clients are not fully satisfied
with the quality of service and the terms of the products offered.

customer complaints indicate areas of concern and we adjust our work accordingly in order to reduce complaints. changes
made by the group’s banks in 2014 include:

         ▶▶ introduction of an operational schedule for servicing self-service machines (repair, replacement and preventive
            maintenance) in local banks that had three or more client complaints per week (sberbank);
         ▶▶ reviewing the processing of registers on payments (cetelem bank);
         ▶▶ upgrading the service quality training programme for employees in the branches and contact centre (sberbank
            ukraine);
         ▶▶ linking the number of complaints with employees’ appraisal (cetelem bank);
         ▶▶ introducing requirements to publish changes in terms of products or service provision 60 days prior to their
            implementation (sberbank europe);
         ▶▶ growth in the number of connection channels with technical support (bps-sberbank);
         ▶▶ reduction of the number of transactions that require mandatory use of paper documents (sberbank europe) and
            others.

reducing queues at sberbank
in 2014 we continued to monitor customer flows using an automated queue management system (qms). based on the year’s
results, we achieved our targeted performance indicators: the waiting-in-line time was less than 10 minutes for 93% of our
customers4.

           2.4 ensuring security
to ensure the privacy and security of personal data and clients’ funds we take organisational and technical measures covering
all service channels (face-to-face as well as remote). in 2014, we achieved the following results in fighting fraud at sberbank:

          ▶▶ 71 attempts of theft of corporate funds and 87,000 attempts of theft of individuals’ funds were prevented and the
             amount of prevented damage equals to rub 2.9 bn;
          ▶▶ in cooperation with law enforcement authorities sberbank suppressed the activity of some cybercriminal groups
             that made mass attacks on sberbank clients’ funds; the criminals were arrested and prosecuted;
          ▶▶ attempts of fraud for a total of rub 0.8 bn were detected and prevented in trade outlets that accept credit cards for
             payment through payment terminals of sberbank.


            antiskimming measures

            due to an increasing number of self-service machines we focus on antiskimming measures. during the year we were
            implementing our preplanned technical security for self-service machines against skimming. we installed more than
            13,000 sets of active antiskimming equipment and developed a system of interaction among sberbank branches to be
            used while checking reports of suspected skimming. as a result, 702 cases of possible skimming were prevented, 142
            sets of skimming equipment were confiscated and about rub 4.7 bn of financial damage was avoided.


we also continued to work on raising the level of security of our information systems to protect the personal data of our clients.
in particular, data leak/loss prevention (dlp) system was introduced in 2014 and a certification audit of the main processing
centre of sberbank was conducted to comply with the international safety standards of the payment card industry pci dss.

subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group implemented the following measures in order to secure clients’ personal
data in 2014:

         ▶▶ cetelem bank implemented access control systems on the bank premises, limiting employee access to the
            premises where customer information is processed and stored, and obtained a licence to work with cryptography;
         ▶▶ bps-sberbank replaced magnetic strip cards with cards with emv standard chip cards and activated a secured
            payments service via verified by visa and mastercard secure code;
         ▶▶ sberbank kazakhstan modernised its surveillance system in the cashier’s offices (in particular, the archiving period
            was increased and the quality of recording was improved) and opened a centre for monitoring technical security
            systems (fire and emergency alarm);
         ▶▶ yandex.money was audited according to pci dss, improved the procedure for fighting fishing and introduced a 24-
            hour surveillance system in its offices;
         ▶▶ denizbank was certified in accordance with iso 27001, isae 3402, and cobit standards, and others.


         2.5 procurement activities
increasing procurement efficiency

in order to raise purchasing efficiency, we implement the process of centralisation of the purchasing function in the central
office, which entered the final stage in 2014. we introduced a new organisational structure – centre for logistics – and launched
the supply transformation programme aimed at increasing the quality of purchasing and reducing the purchasing time. we also
made some improvements in our regulatory framework with the following results:

         ▶▶ a new draft of the regulations on purchasing was developed;
         ▶▶ a new contract negotiation concept was introduced, which significantly reduces signing time;
         ▶▶ the share of standard contracts signed in the central office reached 73.5% (69% in 2013).

purchasing will be further expanded through the entire branch network of sberbank. thus in 2014 the pilot projects to centralise
purchasing in north-west bank and central chernozyomny bank were already completed. as a result, a single purchasing unit
will be set up in each region what will make it possible to expand the purchasing volume and reduce the number of personnel
involved in purchasing activities.

procurement from local suppliers and small businesses

we attracted about 6,300 suppliers in the whole sberbank group in 2014. due to the specifics of our activity, our main suppliers
are it companies (on average 20-30% of total sum spent on purchasing), leaseholders, advertising, marketing and design
agencies, providers of office equipment and stationary. we try to buy from local businesses5 to support economic activity of
other companies in our regions of operation. the share of purchases from local businesses in 2014 totalled 95%.

  local suppliers include legal entities and individual entrepreneurs that supply products or services to a group member and are registered in
the same country as this group member.

we also aim at buying from medium-sized businesses and small businesses to encourage and support entrepreneurship. thus
the share of this supplier category in the purchasing budget of sberbank was 33% in 2014, which considerably exceeds the 18%
requirement set by the ministry of economic development under the road map improving the access of small- and medium-
sized businesses to procurements of infrastructure monopolies and state-owned companies.


         2.6 compliance risk management
we are currently developing a uniform system for compliance risks management across the entire sberbank group. the purpose
of this system is to ensure that our activity is in line with legal regulations and best business practices relative to:

         ▶▶ fighting money laundering and financing of terrorism;
         ▶▶ controlling the economic sanctions imposed by the russian federation, international organisations and individual
            states;
         ▶▶ supporting market behaviour and fair competition when making transactions on financial markets;
         ▶▶ preventing use of insider information and price manipulation on financial markets;
         ▶▶ managing conflict of interest and fighting corruption;
         ▶▶ complying with any other ethical norms of employee conduct.

to create the uniform system in 2013, we developed an organisational structure of compliance business units in sberbank,
and in 2014 set up a compliance function in our subsidiary banks and the group’s companies, adopted unified methodological
approaches to managing compliance risks and implemented them among group members.

furthermore, one of our goals in 2014 was to develop initiatives aimed at promoting a compliance-oriented model of the group’s
employee conduct and maintaining a strong connection between employees’ behaviour and financial compensation. with the
purpose of developing compliance culture and increasing the level of employee awareness, we created training programmes
in different areas of compliance, and provide regular employee trainings. all employees are informed of the compliance
requirements upon employment and have face-to-face or distance trainings.

  local suppliers include legal entities and individual entrepreneurs that supply products or services to a group member and are registered in
the same country as this group member.

fighting corruption

in order to improve our performance in fighting corruption, we assessed risks related to corruption in all group members.

                                                                            informing purchasing employees of the bank principles in the area of
                                                                            fighting corruption and including liabilities for observing these principles

based on the evaluation results an anti-corruption policy was developed, which defines a number of interconnected principles
and procedures for fighting corruption in the bank and the group. it covers all employee regardless of their position. this policy
is the basis of the anti-corruption programme of sberbank group and manifests the principle of the bank and the group not to
accept corruption in any form (“zero tolerance” principle). in 2014, the group members adopted and consistently implemented
their own internal documents and procedures to prevent corruption as required by the policy.

the group’s activities had a positive impact: we observed a reduction in corruption records in the bank’s subsidiaries and zero
records among affiliated companies. the number of corruption cases in sberbank decreased from 68 in 2013 to 11 in 2014.

3 social impact

           3.1 ensuring availability of financial services
developing our branch network we aim to place our offices in convenient locations in order to gain as many customers as
possible. using geomarketing technologies we identify areas with high concentration of customers and open customer service
outlets near the places where these people live, work and study, or open outlets close to major pedestrian traffic routes. we
opened 302 service outlets in new places in 2014 while 545 service outlets were moved to other places and 1,138 service
outlets were closed because of their inefficient location.

when designing our network we are trying to provide equal access to our services to customers throughout russia, including
underdeveloped and low-populated areas7, where doing business could be economically challenging. while overall reduction of
number of service outlets in 2014, the share of branches in those regions increased by percentage point and constituted 27%.
we also continue to develop a network of self-service machines. during the reporting year the number of self-service machines
increased by 15% in underdeveloped and low-populated areas.

we also try to make our services available to the customers living in rural areas. for this purpose we develop various banking
services: we open mobile banking service points, install self-service machines and improve remote channels (mobile banking
and sberbank online). thus, in 2014 the number of mobile banking service points increased by 33% compared with the previous
year and the number of active users of internet banking more than doubled.

          improving bank’s services availability under the “online village” project

          we initiated a pilot project called “online village” to make our services available in small villages in remote areas. the
          project included the following activities:

          ▶▶ installation of free internet kiosks at the administrations and public institutions with access to banking services
             through sberbank online and sberbank business online, to the personal account of network operators and to
             public services portal;
          ▶▶ meetings and trainings of local customers on how to operate the remote banking services;
          ▶▶ support of activists in promoting online services to the public.

          in 2014, six regional banks participated in the project and 104 service outlets in 11 regions of russia were opened:
          altai and stavropol territories, tambov, novgorod, pskov, tomsk, kemerovo, novosibirsk, kirov, nizhny novgorod,
          and orenburg regions.

          this project helped people in remote areas to repay loans, pay for traffic fines and communication services, pay for
          utilities and taxes without going to regional centres. residents of villages will also be able to get access to a public
          services portal to schedule an appointment with a doctor, to apply for a passport and to ask questions to the municipal
          authorities.

in 2014, the number of customer service outlets increased in turkey, kazakhstan, and europe. in belarus, there was a decrease
in the number of branches due to the implementation of the offices reformatting programme (24 ineffective sales points were
closed and four new ones were opened). the total branch network of sberbank group outside russia counts 1,455 customer
service outlets.

reformatting of customer service outlets
in 2014 we continued to implement branch network reformatting programme in russia, which includes office upgrade to make
them more ergonomic and comfortable. the result of the programme implementation was reformatting 68% of the branch
network in the cities.

improving accessibility for disabled people
during reformatting we continued to adapt our offices to the needs of people with disabilities. offices were equipped with ramps
or lifts, and reception desks were installed at a lower level to implement a “sitting-sitting” format of service. a call-button was
mounted near the office entrance so that disabled client can call for assistance and access the premises with help of a bank
employee.

         3.2 enhancing financial literacy
as a part of our efforts to improve the population’s financial literacy, we provide information about basic banking products, form
a responsible attitude to personal finances and explain how to use new online services.

working with the population, we apply a targeted approach to its various categories. one of our innovations was the launch of
a training programme targeted at specifically senior people – the so-called “new opportunities club”. at the pensioners’ club
seminars we talk about banking products and teach senior people how to use online banking by means of easy and interactive
examples from real life.

for young people we initiated a course of lectures about foundations of the financial system in our times entitled “investing in the
future”. the course was specifically designed by lecturers from the plekhanov russian academy of economics and implemented
together with “universarium” e-learning system. we also launched our entertainment application “financial games” on three
social networks in 2014. the game idea is based on the popular tv show “brain ring”, where participants must quickly answer
financial questions. the application allows teams to compete in the same or between different social networks (vkontakte,
odnoklassniki, and facebook) and was installed by more than 239,000 users.

for children, sberbank opened its office in the “masterslavl” (moscow) and “kidburg” (st. petersburg) children’s centres.
furthermore, a day celebrating financial literacy for children in grades 1-5 was held on september 1st, the day of knowledge.
within this project children learn about banking careers in a simple game form, pretending to be cashiers or collectors. thus,
the bank aims at generating a positive image of the profession and installing a habit of seeking help in banking institutions for
financial matters.

at the beginning of the school year the bank launched the “financy prosto” specialised portal (www.finprosto.ru), which is the
basis of sberbank’s communication programme to improve financial literacy. on the portal users can receive detailed theoretical
information on existing financial products and services. moreover, it has features that motivate users to continue ongoing
training and to improve their knowledge in the financial area. about 1 million unique visitors have visited the portal since it was
launched.

pensioner support
sberbank not only makes pension payments, but also offers products on special conditions to customers of retirement age:
bankcard for pension, loans at lower interest rates, and deposits at special rates. in 2014, the number of pensioners using
“social” cards increased to 26.4 million (18.5 million in 2013). the number of deposit agreements concluded with retirees on
special conditions exceeded 30 million in the reporting period.

in 2014 we introduced a new service for pensioners and some vulnerable categories of citizens to get free federal retirement
benefit statements and other types of social benefits from the pension fund of the russian federation, credited to one’s sberbank
account. clients can get helped at any sberbank customer outlet or through sberbank online service.

in order to evaluate the results of our work with special population groups, we are monitoring the satisfaction rate of our
customers in different segments on an annual basis. nps and satisfaction of retirees demonstrate stable and good results –
64% and 88 points respectively. it is noteworthy that results of these studies in the pensioners’ segment exceed the average
values ​​for all sberbank clients (60% and 86 points respectively).

bps-sberbank has developed a special bank deposit for retirees “pensionny”, which offers an increased interest rate, and the
banking package “pensionny-legkiy”, which includes issuance of a bankcard and other services. denizbank together with the
turkish association of retired persons issued a bankcard that provided retirees with various bonuses. the number of cardholders
increased from 89.7 thousand to 208.4 thousand people during 2014.


student support
sberbank launched a new product entitled “government-supported student loan” in august 2014, which aims to stimulate the
development of secondary technical and higher education in the russian federation, and is implemented jointly with the ministry
of education and science of the russian federation. as a part of the programme, the government partly reimburses to students
the cost of study at ¾ of the refinancing rate. thus, the student loan rate will be ¼ of the refinancing rate plus five percentage
points, which at the moment is only 7.06%. the lending programme aims at long-term training of students and 10 years after
graduation students can extend the loan periods in some cases. this is a pilot project and it will be extended in 2015.

we issue the “molodezhnaya” debit and credit card specially for young people with a low annual fee, discounts, accrued bonuses
and special offers from payment systems. in 2014, the transactional activity with “molodezhnaya” cards grew by 6%.

nps and satisfaction level of young people with our services is consistently higher than that of our competitors. in 2014, nps
increased significantly. the number of young people who are ready to recommend us to their friends and relatives increased by
8 percentage points as compared to the previous year.

denizbank, a sberbank group member, also provides students with education loans at reduced rates. in addition, in collaboration
with four major universities of turkey, denizbank produces credit cards which are used as student access cards at the same
time. the bank developed special “youth” accounts for students with bonuses and special offers without a service fee. education
loans are also provided by bps-sberbank and sberbank kazakhstan.

housing loans
an important social task for sberbank is to increase affordability of housing for the population. for this purpose we adopted
a new customer service model for mortgage lending by expanding the network for acceptance of mortgage applications in
2014. now to file an application our customers do not need to go to the mortgage centre – they can apply at any bank office
with the sales manager or mortgage lending manager’s assistance. in 2013 our clients were consulted by 2,000 sberbank
professionals and in 2014 the number of qualified mortgage sales consultants increased to 20,000, which significantly simplified
the population’s access to mortgages.

3.4.2 training system development

training for employees
when training employees we focus on the improvement of their professional expertise and competencies. in addition, we
develop their managerial and social skills. in 2014 we developed 94 new full-time training programmes, 18 of which are cross-
functional, namely, applicable to several functional blocks. the programmes are primarily focused on the training of basic
concepts and operations required for work and communication with the customers to ensure compliance with the bank’s quality
standards.

we provided training for 251.3 thousand employees in 2014, and thereby fulfilled 95% of the training plan. the average hours of
training per employee was more than 46 hours15.

in order to improve the training programmes, we regularly ask our employees to provide feedback on the training courses and
whether they turned out to be useful. according to the results of the feedback questionnaires, the average training satisfaction
score of sberbank employees reached 9.44 points out of 10 in 2014.

training for management
when providing training for managers, we pay maximum attention to the development of their leadership, managerial and
professional competencies.

distance learning
we continue to develop the practice of online training for our employees. distance learning is efficient for studying computer
programmes, legislative standards and requirements, and for acquiring basic knowledge in the fields of personal growth and
management. the major resource for distance learning is our sberbank corporate university virtual school. the portal offers
many opportunities for studying and self-development, including more than 400 units of learning content (multimedia courses,
video lectures, ipad applications, articles, etc.), e-books, webinars, and online conferences. today 36,000 users are registered
on the portal, more than half of which completed at least two courses in 2014. on average, each user accrues five training
courses a year.

3.4.3 attracting young professionals

we are interested in attracting students and young professionals, and actively cooperate with various educational institutions.
every year more than 13,000 students take part in practical training at sberbank. we created 14 basic academic departments
(functionally similar to sberbank units) in russian higher education institutions, which provide over 100 training courses for
students and employees of the regional banks of sberbank. in addition, we sponsor “banks battle”, an international student
competition in commercial bank management.

in subsidiary banks and affiliated companies there are special “graduate” programmes aimed at attracting and developing
students and graduates. in particular, in 2014 sberbank kazakhstan signed 20 agreements with higher education institutions,
where the bank held 23 events and attracted about 220 trainees. in total, in 2014 the share of personnel under the age of 30
employed by subsidiary banks and affiliated companies constituted 71.4% of all new employees hires during the year.

3.4.4 career ending management and continued employability programmes

through outplacement programme sberbank provides assistance to its former employees with further employment or career
ending due to retirement or termination of employment. in 2014, 3,608 people participated in the personnel monitoring and
support programme during headcount optimisation at sberbank, which accounted for 6% of dismissed employees.

bps-sberbank applies some of the outplacement instruments: provides employees facing layoffs under labour legislation with
recommendation letters and one day off per week to seek employment with other employers. in switzerland, the bank works
together with a local organisation that provides three-month support to employees who quitted their jobs at the bank. after the
closure of one of the branches of sberbank europe in bosnia and herzegovina in 2014, several employees of the branch were
transferred to another european subsidiary bank.

3.4.5 motivation and compensation of employees

in 2014, we increased the salaries of ordinary employees, especially of those who work directly with sberbank clients in
customer service outlets. also, as part of the annual comparison of the salaries with the market level, in the second half of 2014

we raised salaries of employees in some sberbank units where a salary lag was found. due to the increase in salaries and total
number of employees, labour costs raised by approximately 13% in 2014.

due to changes in the customer service business model, we continued to improve the system of incentives for the employees
of the retail business and corporate business units in 2014.

3.4.6 employee performance assessment

all sberbank employees undergo annual performance assessment as a part of performance management system that
consists of two assessment tools: performance assessment (fulfilment of annual goals) and compliance assessment of
personal competences with the corporate competency model (“5+” assessment). the system ensures interconnection between
performance results, career development and financial reward of employees. in 2014 due to the development of performance
management system and introduction of a new corporate competency model we updated the regulation base for the employee
performance assessments.

subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group use their own performance monitoring systems, with the help of which
84% of employees were assessed in 2014.

3.4.7 improving employee engagement and satisfaction

we conducted the fifth annual survey of employee engagement and satisfaction in 2014, which covered over 148,000 sberbank
employees. in 2014 the employee engagement index grew considerably (68.9 points), demonstrating the best result for all
years of the survey leaving behind the average level of russian companies (63 points) and reaching the average level of global
financial companies. we can see a strong positive trend of the index at all directly controlled regional banks and branches. all
the involvement factors demonstrated considerable growth, including, to the greatest extent, satisfaction with the sberbank top
management, the system of incentives, remuneration and benefits for employees. the result was influenced, above all, by the
8% salary increase for certain categories of employees and by the transition to 100% coverage by sberbank of the voluntary
medical insurance (vmi) for employees working over one year.

subsidiary banks and affiliated companies conduct their own employee engagement and satisfaction surveys both in respect to
particular employment aspects and work in the company as a whole.

voluntary medical insurance
at the request of our employees, starting from 2014 sberbank began to cover 100% of the vmi cost for employees working in
the company for more than one year. as a result, the number of employees who joined the vmi programme in 2014 increased
by more than four times and the financing by sberbank increased by more than 2.5 times compared to the previous reporting
period.

the majority of subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group also provide vmi to their employees. in particular, from
2014 sberbank kazakhstan and the corporate university also cover 100% of the vmi cost for the employees who worked more
than one year. in cetelem bank a free vmi policy is available for employees working with the bank over six months. employees
of sberbank ukraine and their relatives are offered insurance policies at reduced rates.

3.4.9 occupational health and safety

approach to occupational health and safety
sberbank launched a special assessment process of workplace conditions in 2014, and developed and approved the following
regulatory documents in the field of occupational health and safety:

         ▶▶ the regulations governing the occupational health and safety in ojsc sberbank russia establish a uniform
            procedure for labour protection in the bank, basic elements, goals, and objectives for the occupational health and
            safety control system;
         ▶▶ the process scheme for the organisation and carrying out of preliminary and periodic medical examinations of
            ojsc sberbank russia employees determines the procedures for conducting medical examinations of the bank’s
            employees engaged in work with harmful and (or) dangerous working conditions.

occupational health and safety experts conduct special corporate seminars on a regular basis; on-site occupational health and
safety audit is performed in regional banks.

thanks to these measures, in 2014 the injury severity rate in sberbank decreased from 39.05 to 34.37 and the injury frequency
index decreased from 0.94 to 0.86.

although the financial industry has a low level of accident frequency rate, in the banking sector there are some categories of
employees who may be exposed to increased risk, in particular, drivers, security guards, cash collectors and drivers-collectors.
in 2014, four sberbank employees died during the performance of official duties. in order to avoid fatal casualties in the future,
we conducted discussions with the employees of regional banks, brought to their attention the circumstances and causes of the
accidents and provided extra training.

subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group also develop their own occupational health and safety systems and
improve the working conditions of their employees. in particular, in 2014 cetelem bank, sberbank technologies and a branch
of sberbank europe in austria held a special assessment of the working conditions of their employees. the branch of sberbank
europe in czech republic conducts a regular assessment of workplace ergonomics.

healthcare and healthy lifestyle

we actively promote healthy lifestyle among our employees and help them to develop good habits. in large offices of sberbank,
in-house doctors not only advise employees in private but also participate in mass preventive actions including long-term
campaigns to control blood pressure and cholesterol, and analyse the results. on average, about 100 employees a month use
medical services in the offices of sberbank.

in 2014 under the sberbank health programme we held four major events. the “donor’s day” was attended by approximately
230 employees of the central office, and the “walk to health” programme, aimed at motivating employees to get physically active
and fight against hypodynamia, was attended by over a thousand sberbank employees.

in 2014 we integrated the health programme into our traditional campaign “green marathon”. medical professionals assessed
physiometric indices of 400 “green marathon” participants, and were provided individual recommendations based on the
express measurements.

in 2014 lectures were held on “stress, stress management, techniques and exercises” for the employees of the central office,
involving experts from the green team company, which is engaged in the development and implementation of programmes for
the prevention of professional burnout. at the lectures 600 sberbank employees learned about the causes and consequences of
stress, as well as about the ways of its correction and prevention.

in 2014 we launched a new healthy lifestyle section in the “my sberbank” newspaper, where each month we tell employees
about the necessity of healthy lifestyle and share tips on health improvement.


         sberbankiad 2014 in antalya

         at the end of october 2014, the xi annual summer sberbankiad took place in the turkish city of antalya. this event
         brought together employees of the group from 12 countries of operation, 16 regional banks and the sberbank central
         office. competitions were held in nine types of sports: football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, table tennis, tug of war,
         beach volleyball, swimming and athletics. during the five competition days, 29 programmes hosted more than 1,400
         sports contests. in addition to the competitions, the event included meetings, training seminars and a festival of arts.


subsidiary banks also promote a healthy lifestyle among their employees and implement local initiatives and activities.

         world-class education for all citizens of the russian federation and russian-speaking population of the world. within
         the project over 2,300 video lectures were translated into russian in 2014.


children and childcare institutions support
sberbank traditionally provides charity assistance to children from poor and problem families, and orphanages and boarding
schools. in 2014 for this purpose the bank allocated 12% of the total volume of charitable funds. financial support was
provided for the construction and renovation of schools, kindergartens and improvement of their material and technical base,
rehabilitation of orphans and replenishment of special-purpose capital of educational institutions.


         “good deeds day” in sberbank

         in 2014, as a part of our large-scale “from heart to heart” charity programme, for the first time we organised a
         unified charity day for our employees, customers and partners, which received the name “good deeds day”. on this
         day, thousands of participants across russia visited more than 250 orphanages under the patronage of sberbank,
         gave gifts to children, organised gala concerts and excursions, participated together with children in the activities of
         volunteer centres, and in environmental events. in various russian cities the bank organised excursions for children to
         an equestrian club, oil refinery, as well as a visit to a sand show, and other educational and recreational activities. in
         the first five years of existence of the “from heart to heart” programme sberbank employees adopted over 200 children
         from orphanages.


in kazakhstan financial assistance was provided to students of orphanages under the patronage and to a tuberculosis sanatorium
for children; and in ukraine support was received by 20 orphanages and two sports school for children. bps-sberbank took a
part in the “our children” charity event to collect gifts for orphan homes. sberbank europe also provided financial assistance to
local orphanages and reconstructed children playgrounds and kindergartens.

healthcare and children suffering from serious diseases support
in 2014 sberbank continued cooperation with the “gift of life” (podari zhizn’) foundation. the bank traditionally participated as
an official partner of the foundation in the organisation of the world-wide children’s “games of winners” - the world’s largest
competitions for children who survived cancer. over 400 children from eight countries attended the event.

the bank continued issuing international “gift of life” visa cards. according to the results of this initiative, during 2014 alone
donations in the amount over rub 113 mn were transferred to the “gift of life” charitable foundation, which is almost four times
as much as during the previous year. more than rub 280 mn have been donated to medical institutions since the beginning of
cooperation with the foundation.

sberbank kazakhstan assisted in the rehabilitation of eight children with serious diseases and sberbank ukraine provided
sanatorium therapy to more than 150 children. in addition to the support for medical institutions, sberbank europe conducted
blood donation campaigns among its employees.

4 environmental impact

         4.1 raising resource and energy efficiency
sberbank is a financial institution with the largest network of customer service outlets in russia. for maintaining our operations
we need significant amounts of electricity and heat. we are taking steps to save energy in order to minimise our impact on the
environment and to raise the efficiency of our operations. to compare our energy consumption over time, we use a specific ratio,
namely, energy consumption per employee. the ratio has remained approximately at the same level with a tendency to decline.

since 2013, sberbank has been using systems of electronic office document circulation in its administrative arrangements
to save paper. according to the bank’s assessment, we managed to save at least 30 tonnes of paper within two years, which
equals to 5.6 hectares of forest.

subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group also implement steps for resource conservation.

these measures enabled subsidiary banks and companies to achieve the following results in 2014:

         ▶▶ sberbank europe (croatia) saved approximately 138.6 kwh per employee by installing new air conditioning systems
            (a total of 75,000 kwh);
         ▶▶ sberbank-technologies saved 33.1 kwh of electricity per employee by installing 1,920 led lamps (a total of 46,080
            kwh);
         ▶▶ sberbank kazakhstan reduced its water costs by 10% as it installed sensor water mixers;
         ▶▶ sberbank insurance gave 7.8 kg paper per employee for recycling (a total of 500 kg);
         ▶▶ bps-sberbank saved approximately 0.7 kg of paper per employee by optimising the payroll procedure (a total
            of more than 3 tonnes) and approximately 9.2 kg paper per employee within 2012-2014 years by reducing paper
            consumption by cash machines as atms were installed (a total of 43.2 tonnes);
         ▶▶ sberbank switzerland gave approximately 80% of the paper for recycling.


         4.2 responsible waste handling
as we represent a financial institution, most of sberbank’s waste is paper and office equipment. we did our best in the reporting
period to give as much paper as possible for recycling.

when using infrastructure facilities, we generate some hazardous waste, most of which is old office equipment, cartridges,
fluorescent lamps, batteries, and sediments caused by mechanical and biological sewage water treatment. hazardous waste is
also generated in maintenance of the corporate car fleet (used lubricants, tires, oiled rags, oiled sand, etc.). we’ve been working
on the improvement of our hazardous waste management system over the last three years. as a result 98% of the hazardous
waste we generated in 2014 was recycled or neutralised.

          4.3 promoting environmental protection
in 2014, the third green marathon of sberbank took place. the initiative was inspired by the 2014 sochi olympics and aimed at
promoting sports and healthy lifestyle and protecting the environment. our project has been expanding with a growing number
of participants and cities involved so that this year the marathon was also held in kazakhstan and turkey.

in 2014, over 52,000 people in russia joined the run, and the total number of participants and guests amounted to nearly 90,000.
at the end of the event, the participants contributed to the landscaping of russian cities by planting green alleys in parks and
gardens of participating cities. over 5,000 of new trees have been planted around the country over the three years of the green
marathon.

5 about the report
sberbank has been publishing non-financial reports since 2010, and this is the second corporate social responsibility report
of sberbank group (hereinafter referred to as the report). our main objective in the development of the reporting system in
2014 was to unify the approach to data collection at subsidiary banks and affiliated companies all over the group for their
consolidation. we are just at the beginning of this process, but already in this reporting period we have managed to disclose
more csr indicators of the group in comparison to the previous year. from now forward we will continue to improve the
methods and forms of data collection for the report within the group.

another innovation for the year 2014 was the transition to the new g4 version of the gri guidelines (basic version). the new
version focuses on identifying material aspects of the company’s csr activities and stakeholder engagement during this
process. for compliance with the requirements, we undertook a poll of our stakeholders and top management of sberbank.
read more about the procedure for identifying the material aspects and its results in section “1.1 identifying material aspects
of csr activities”.

in the reporting period we specified the criteria for including subsidiaries in the report boundaries. for the 2014 report, we
used the following criteria:

         ▶▶ control of sberbank over the subsidiaries (ownership of over 50% of shares);
         ▶▶ materiality of the influence of the subsidiaries on the stakeholders in the regions of operation (over 60 employees);
         ▶▶ financial operations in the field of the main business of the group or supplementary functions for implementation
            of the main business of sberbank.

in comparison to the previous reporting period, sberbank switzerland was included in the report boundaries and korus
consulting cis was excluded. the definition of sberbank group was modified in accordance with the updated report boundaries.
therefore, the information and data in the report relate to the following:

         ▶▶ sberbank (ojsc sberbank of russia) with its head office and 16 regional banks of the russian federation;
         ▶▶ subsidiary banks that are listed in table 27;
         ▶▶ affiliated companies that are listed in table 27.

the key methodical changes as compared to the 2013 report are as follows:

           ▶▶ unification of the method for defining underdeveloped and low-populated areas for the group; they represent top
              level political units where the population density is below the national average and which belong to the 25% of
              regions with the lowest average income per capita;
           ▶▶ in table 16 “main socially oriented products of sberbank’s housing loans” credit disbursements for the product
              military mortgage are indicated for 2013 and 2014 years respectively while in the 2013 report this indicator
              contained disbursements since the launch of product in 2011 (cumulatively).

changes mentioned above could have resulted in divergences in comparison to the data published in the previous report.

as we are just starting to develop consolidated csr data collection at sberbank group, some of the subsidiary banks and
affiliated companies have no systems for non-financial data collection or do not do such collection yet. the area of coverage of
subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group by gri indicators is shown in table 28.

      the complete list of the countries of operation of the subsidiary banks can be found in the financial report of sberbank group.
