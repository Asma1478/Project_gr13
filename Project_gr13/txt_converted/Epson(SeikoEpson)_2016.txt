message from management

aiming to make epson an indispensable company for our customers and society

in march 2016, epson announced its epson 25 corporate vision. this
document draws a vision of where we want epson to be in ten years and
maps out our path to get there. we will make further rapid advances by
leveraging the business infrastructure we have built to date to transform
epson into a company that creates a new connected age of people, things

in the future, advances in information and communications technology will
allow all kinds of information to be connected over the internet, causing
cyberspace to expand dramatically. in this world, hardware products that
interface with cyberspace will be essential for businesses and consumers

lab will save water, a valuable resource that is used in tremendous volumes in traditional wet recycling processes. epson is thus
changing work processes and providing original products that produce new value.


epson declared its support for the united nations global compact in 2004, and we continue to drive initiatives aligned with the
ten principles of the gc relating to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. we have been working to build and
maintain a strong, fair and transparent governance system by, for example, establishing a corporate governance policy in 2015
and transitioning to a company with an audit & supervisory committee in 2016. as a member of society, epson believes that it is

epson’s csr

what is epson’s csr?

epson’s management philosophy is the bedrock on which our businesses are run. our mission is to build stakeholder trust as
we grow and prosper with communities and to help create a better world. to this end, we strive to practice the values preached
in the management philosophy, maintain legal and regulatory compliance, adhere to the highest standards for business ethics,
and create value that exceeds the expectations of our customers. we consider any action designed to realize the management
philosophy to be a csr activity.


   management philosophy (please refer to page 114 of “appendices”)


principles of corporate behavior and the epson code of conduct

established in 2005 and applying to the entire epson group, principles of corporate behavior spells out principles of conduct for
realizing the aim of epson’s management philosophy. the epson code of conduct, which was revised in 2006 and applies to all
group companies in japan, articulates proper employee conduct based on these principles. we frequently update the epson
code of conduct (most recently in april 2016) in response to social, legal, regulatory, and other changes.


the graphic below illustrates the nine core principles that form the foundations of business activities for achieving the goals of
the management philosophy.

the tm-c7500 revolutionizes the printing environment

                                     in creating labels for displaying products to their best advantage, there is a need to be able to design
                                     color labels with photographs and text for each product, and print them attractively at high speed, on
                                     demand. on learning of this customer requirement, epson developed the tm-c7500 color label printer.

first they would ask an external printing contractor to make several varieties of preprinted labels showing the company logo and
the red diamond for the picture symbol, in the places designated in the ghs standard. then, using their own barcode label
software, they would print barcodes, product information, and picture symbols for each chemical on the preprinted labels using
a monochrome thermal label printer. as a result, we discovered that customers faced the following issues.

in order to solve these problems faced by customers, the product plan for the tm-c7500 was developed with a focus on achiev-
ing color, high speed and high resolution, and the ability to move to an environment enabling smooth, on-demand color label
printing leveraging customers’ existing label printing environments.


1. to achieve color, high speed and high resolution, the printer is equipped with precisioncore lineheads with print speeds of up
  to 300 mm per second.


2. the internal memory of the printer comes with a stock of images. equipping the printer with a function for combining this

  data sent from the barcode label software. this substantially cuts down the waiting time while data is being sent and read.


3. in order to leverage customers’ existing label printing environments, the printer is equipped with zplii commands which are
  standard in the monochrome thermal label printing environments, and esc/ label commands including epson’s proprietary
  frppdqgvirudfklhylqjfrorusulqwlqjzlwkdqlqnmhw


4. by working with companies that produce three types of barcode label printing software popular with customers, we incorpo-
  rated the three types of software in the tm-c7500 native driver to achieve an environment that enables on-demand color label
  printing without customers having to change their systems.

supplier quality assurance

epson internally manufactures key components such as printheads for
lqnmhwsulqwhuv$wwkhvdphwlphrxuvxssolhuvdovrsurylghxvzlwkpdq\
of the parts needed for manufacturing. therefore, our quality assurance
programs go beyond the epson group. we share our approach to quality
with our suppliers and work with them to improve quality.


for example, we stipulate our basic quality assurance policies and re-
quirements in quality assurance standards, verify the quality of parts by
visiting suppliers, and give them advice about ways to improve. in addi-
tion, we hold meetings with suppliers and our own people who are in
charge of supplier quality control at our operations divisions to improve       a meeting of people in charge of supplier qc
quality assurance programs.


global sharing of service & support information

we hold an annual epson group services and support conference that
is attended by people in charge of these functions at our overseas re-

the meeting is to improve the quality of our service and support. at the
meeting, we share technical information about service and support, as
well as about the use of our products and services by customers. we
also review actions and discuss issues to formulate long-term strategies.
the results of the meeting are used in our group companies around the           epson group services and support meeting

receive the same level of training as our employees in japan.


epson aims to develop people who are able to identify and address the root causes of problems so that we can produce and
sell products and services that exceed customer expectations.

every year, the results of team-based improvement activities are presented and evalu-
ated in blocs. there are four blocs, consisting of japan, china, southeast asia, and
europe/ america. the teams with the best presentations in each bloc are invited to the
worldwide team presentations in japan, where the teams with the best presentations
are recognized with awards. in addition to presenting activity results at the various bloc
events, we make qc circle presentations available for viewing on the company intranet.                                                   the fy2015 worldwide team presentations, in japan

by promoting similar activities across the epson group, we look to learn from one
another and to raise awareness of the need for continuous improvement.


the worldwide team presentations conference was held in october 2015, with 12 elite
teams from the various blocs giving their presentations. lulutong, a team from epson
engineering (shenzhen) ltd., (esl, china) came away with the president’s award in
recognition of outstanding actions taken to establish a multi-model production system.

system to other production sites. the goal is not to win the president’s award but to further increase productivity. still, we will try
to win the president’s award again next year by further developing our skills and teamwork.”



activities to raise awareness

november is cs & quality month across epson. in fy2015, we raised cs and quality awareness with an online course about key
initiatives for relaying customer expectations to people in every phase of the product commercialization process, from planning
through sales support. in addition, we held an event to listen to customer opinions, ideas, and wishes that was attended by
approximately 1,000 employees in japan. we use events like this to help shape our products and services to the needs of our
customers.

glossary


carrying capacity

the amount of human activity and environmentally harmful materials (substances that degrade or pollute the environment) that
can be supported without impairing the environment.


in “environmental vision 2050” carbon dioxide is cited as a representative environmentally harmful material, and the environmen-
tal carrying capacity is assumed to be the capacity of the earth’s natural environment to support it.


biodiversity

biological diversity, i.e. the existence of diverse forms of life in a given ecosystem.

diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.”



resource recycling loop

a system in which the input of new resources is gradually reduced by repeatedly reusing and recycling resources used in earlier
products.



backcasting

a planning technique in which a desired outcome or goal is envisioned and planned before the scenario for achieving the out-
come or goal is devised.

                                                                                                                 epson group sustainability report 2016   25

tional analog printing processes with epson’s digital printing processes can be expected to sharply reduce environmental im-
pacts. epson aims to achieve in 2050 a 90% reduction in co2 emissions versus the environmental impacts of current operations
and those of business markets that we are looking to enter. we aim to achieve this by reducing the environmental impacts of our
products themselves as well as by reducing their impacts during use.

design for environment

the environmental impacts of a product across its life cycle, from cradle to grave, are largely determined at
the planning and design-engineering stages.

equipped with a newly developed gps module and miniature ring antenna

epson developed a new gps module for small, accurate, low-power solar watches and combined it with a small yet acutely
sensitive ring-shaped antenna that captures even weak gps satellite signals so that it can automatically correct the time any-
where in the world.

                                                                  -newly developed gps module

the new gps chip enabled us to reduce the size of the re-
chargeable battery used in the 8x series and incorporate it
inside the movement.


in addition, the 8x series has one circuit board instead of two
because the board components were mounted on both sides
of the board. this enabled us to reduce the thickness of the
watch head by 3.5 mm.



                                                                                                                              epson group sustainability report 2016       46

realization of a stable power supply

since about 10,000 times more current is consumed when receiving gps signals than when
simply keeping time, we developed a new radio wave reception algorithm, lithium-ion battery,
and a low-power charge control circuit that controls the charging and discharging of the battery
to dramatically reduce power consumption.

management of chemical substances in products

increasing international restrictions on substances used in products, notably the rohs directive and reach regulation in eu-
rope, have made it essential to closely control the type and quantity of materials used. epson systematically controls product
substance content at the purchasing, production, and shipping stages to ensure compliance with these restrictions.

    the standard also defines requirements relating to the elimination or exclusion of legally restricted substances and requirements for providing information on substances present in
    parts and materials.

legal and regulatory compliance

more and more nations are regulating chemicals. we investigate regulations and chemical hazards as early as possible, analyze
the information we obtain, and then supply products accordingly.


-measures for meeting the rohs directive

epson has made compatibility with the european rohs directive2 a standard feature of its entire lineup of products throughout
the world, regardless of whether a particular product is bound for the european market or not.


phthalate esters (dehp, bbp, dbp, and dibp) will be added to the list of restricted substances in july 2019. epson began look-
ing into alternatives to these substances in 2009 and by march 2014 had eliminated them from all but a few industrial products
and products in inventory.

2
    the european rohs directive restricts the use of the following six hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment: lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, poly-
    brominated biphenyl (pbb), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (pbde)




                                                                                                                                            epson group sustainability report 2016         51

-actions for reach compliance

epson has stayed compliant with the requirements of reach (registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemi-
cals) legislation in europe.


under reach, companies that manufacture or import chemical substances must register them in a central database. if a prod-
uct contains harmful substances (such as substances of very high concern), the company must disclose the substances, notify
government authorities, and search for alternatives. moving forward, we will continue to use our substance content framework to

water recycling

epson is mitigating environmental impacts and maintaining legal and regulatory compliance by focusing on water and resources
from a risk management point of view. basic to this is making sure we soil and consume no more water than necessary, and
recycling and reusing what we do use.


we work actively to increase the recycling rate of factory wastewater and comply with stricter water quality regulations. moreo-

epson has manufacturing sites and sales centers in all parts of the world making environmentally-conscious transportation an
important consideration. here we present examples of such environmentally-conscious transportation initiatives in which we
introduced high cube containers1 and changed our shipping method.

    with a height of 9 ft 6 in (about 2.6 m), they are 1 ft (about 30 cm) taller than standard containers, whose height is 8 feet 6 inches (about 2.3 m).



topic 1: improving transport efficiency with high cube containers

currently, high cube containers account for about 70% of shipping containers in the marketplace. hitherto, epson has used the
standard type of container for shipping products from its factories, but with the widespread adoption of high cube containers,
we are gradually making the switch.


since the inner dimensions of the containers are higher, palletizing products for standard containers resulted in wasted space
amounting to about 10%. optimizing the pallets for high cube containers reduces the number of containers required, contribut-

results of switching containers for shipping to the u.s.




* we have calculated the reductions in co2 emissions emitted when transporting containers by cargo ship, train and truck from our manufacturing affiliates in southeast asia, as a result
  of reducing the number of containers shipped to the u.s. by about 200. the unit indicator by the japan ship technology research association is used for calculating emissions during
  sea transport.



topic 2: reduced environmental impact by changing printhead shipping

previously, printheads for shipping to our printer manufacturing sites in indone-
sia were gathered from our plants around japan at tohoku epson in yamagata
prefecture and transported by truck to narita airport for air transportation. by
establishing a sea transportation pipeline from sakata port, which is located

talked about its actions to reduce environmental impacts in line with a strategic policy
entitled “environmental vision 2050.” epson also described the process used to estab-

the presentations, the students and epson employees gathered to discuss environmen-

epson and the environment

environmental management

as stated in its management philosophy, epson’s business is anchored in a commitment to environmental conservation. epson
carries out environmental programs under uniform standards and goals in every country and region of the world. our basic
environmental stance is set forth in epson principles of corporate behavior and in the environmental policy. in recent years our
customers, along with society in general, have become interested in reducing their environmental impacts. the desire to deliver
reduced environmental impact products and services that surprise and delight our customers is embodied in the “exceed your
vision” tagline.

developing young technicians through technical skills olympics

as a manufacturing company, epson in japan uses training for technical skills olympics competitions to develop “groundbreak-
er,” technicians who quickly acquired essential manufacturing knowledge and skills and have the ability to break from precedent
to create innovative technologies and systems. as a rule, individuals are allowed to take part in technical skills olympics train-

every year epson sends 10-15 individuals to the national technical skills olympics to compete in seven selected categories that
are applicable to our business: instrument making, press tool making, mechatronics, industrial electronics, web design, it
network system administration, and watch repair.


new employees sent to monozukuri juku as technical skills olympics trainees experience monozukuri (the art and science of
manufacturing) in such forms as rasping and cutting by blade. they also learn basic knowledge about machinery, electricity, and

their children in elementary and middle school.


monitoring and controlling working hours

epson remains fully compliant with labor laws. one of the ways we ensure compliance is by following an operations manual that
epson created to prevent excess overtime work. we have also deployed time management initiatives and monitoring systems
across the organization. epson has programs to build awareness among employees of the importance of regulating working
hours appropriately and we are fully committed to maintaining a well-balanced working environment.


work-life balance initiatives

recognizing the importance of the well-being and development of our children, epson encourages employees to balance their
careers with their personal lives. we enforce an eight-hour no overtime workday at least once per week at our sites in japan,
and an increasing number of sites have a day each year when parents can bring their children to work. to create an environment
suitable for both male and female employees who want to pursue a career, we are working to support childcare. from october

professional development through safety and health training

epson considers safety and health training vital for protecting employees. the training
curriculum is tailored to the position, roles, and responsibilities of employees. training for
non-management employees focuses on practical techniques such as risk assessment
and hazard prediction. training for managers and supervisors focuses on leadership. all
group companies use the same training curriculum. since we have a variety of business-
es, each with its unique needs, we also provide employees with training tailored to their
business unit and company.

   stress diagnoses

   since 2004, all employees in japan have received an occupational stress diagnosis when they get their periodic medical checkup.
   the main purpose is to help employees practice self-care when they feel stress. occupational physicians, nurses, and industrial
   counselors follow up with employees diagnosed as highly stressed. this has facilitated early detection and response to mental health
   troubles.

   nationally, a stress diagnosis system came into force in december 2015 based on the industrial safety and health act. we have
   updated our own diagnoses by adding considerations required by the law. we have established group stress diagnosis standards

   our stress diagnoses follow these standards. we use this process not only to help employees practice self-care against stress but
   also to improve the workplace environment.

   on their situation, employees may meet with medical professionals and industrial counselors, working with them as a team to plot
   their approach. moreover, the employee’s primary care physician, workplace manager, and human resources department work to-
   gether closely to provide better support.

managing sanitation in employee cafeterias

a food poisoning incident occurred in one of our employee cafeterias in 2011. this prompted periodic inspections of kitchen

work together during these inspections. in this manner we are improving the state of sanitation management and addressing any
facility problems. the risk is not only in japan. if a food poisoning incident were to happen at an employee cafeteria at a large-
scale production site overseas (especially in china or southeast asia), it could seriously impact employees’ health and impede
business continuity. therefore, since fy2012 we have been taking steps at production sites in china, indonesia, malaysia, singa-
pore, and the philippines to manage sanitation and risk.

ups. the result of this initiative is that companies in japan and abroad learn to identify sanitation management issues for them-
selves and systematically improve on therefore, raising the level of cafeteria sanitation management.

procurement of wood products.


epson has a stated procurement policy that says, “in every region where we do business, we promote procurement initiatives
compliant with each nation’s law, international rules and the spirit of the same, cleaving to a high sense of ethics and acting for
the good of society.” in keeping with this policy, epson encourages procurement of paper products with due consideration for
the social, economic and environmental sustainability of forests.


thus epson manages its entire supply chain from the immediate supplier all the way back to the forest to ensure the legality,
sustainability and environmental safety of the paper products we procure. we ask that suppliers fully understand the intent and
nature of these initiatives and then give us their support.

sustainable procurement

raising awareness

practicing csr throughout the supply chain

epson selects suppliers using fair criteria and procedures based on its basic procurement policy. we have established internal
rules that set forth criteria for selecting excellent supplier candidates that can provide us with a stable supply of quality parts and
raw materials at fair prices.


in accordance with this rule, we now undertake a new supplier evaluation that focuses on appropriate environmental manage-
ment, fair employment practices, and legalistic approaches to human rights and so on. we decide our suppliers based on this
evaluation.


we also conduct a comprehensive annual evaluation of every supplier with which we do regular business. this periodic evalua-

ment, cost management, and delivery deadline management. by reviewing the evaluation result, we can gain a clearer picture of
a supplier and its practices, therefore contributing to stable supply. if a supplier receives a poor evaluation, we ask the company
concerned to submit a corrective action plan. we then re-evaluate the supplier and provide feedback about the results. this
process aims to achieve better and stronger relationship with our suppliers. on the other hand, we have set a procedure to
terminate transactions with suppliers that have consistently failed periodical evaluations. a supplier that demonstrates poor
results for two successive years is put on a watch list, with transactions suspended if this continues for two more years.

epson’s procurement guidelines and communicated our approach to csr, which aims to foster trust with all stakeholders, to
develop goodwill with the local and international communities, and to contribute to improving society as a whole. we aim to use
these activities as a start point to promote initiatives for socially responsible procurement in cooperation with our suppliers.


compliance management

aiming to work to high ethical standards and a social conscience, epson conducts procurement in strict compliance with both
the letter and the spirit of local and international laws and regulations in every country and region around the world. we consider
employee training and education are the most important factors in achieving this.


epson group companies in japan train employees on the laws, regulations, and social norms of various countries and regions
around the world to ensure every employee acquires the necessary expertise and awareness.

epson information science vocational school (japan)

our society is increasingly built around information. to meet the needs of
changing times, we established the epson information science vocational
school in 1989. its purpose is to develop technical personnel who are
trusted by the community and can make wide-ranging contributions to
society. as of march 2016, more than 2,500 persons have graduated from
the college.


most of the instructors are businesspeople or technical experts who have
                                                                                  epson information science vocational school

communication

approach

communication serves as a vital bridge that connects epson to its various stakeholders, including customers, shareholders,
investors, governments, communities, ngos and npos, media outlets, suppliers, students, and employees. epson provides
accurate, unbiased information to all stakeholders in accordance with the epson group communications regulation. in addition
to upholding public order, decency, and morality and maintaining neutrality, epson refrains from discrimination in any form,
including but not limited to discrimination based on gender, age, national origin, ethnicity, race, religion, or social standing. our
communications respect the individual and cultural diversity and aim to earn the trust of people throughout the world.


epson practices both marketing communication (conveying the value of our brand, products, and services) and corporate com-
munication (conveying the value of epson itself). in both cases, as an open, progressive company, epson communicates through
the mass media and directly to stakeholders to ensure the timely delivery of information on our activities and initiatives, even if it
is of a negative nature.
