2.7 financial information
in 2011, gigabyte issued a dividend of nt$2 per ordinary share for 2010.
2011 was one of the most economically unsettling periods in history with
worsening european debt crisis affecting the whole world. in q1, political
unrest in the middle-east and north africa unsettled the international
financial market and led to high international oil prices. the global
information, communications and automobile supply chains were then
disrupted by the tohoku earthquake in japan. when the us lost its aaa
credit rating for the first time in q3, global panic ensued. the pc industry's
hardware supply chain was then disconnected again by the thai floods in
q4.
gigabyte was severely affected by the events of 2011. sales of gigabyte
branded mainboards and graphics cards for the year amounted to
16,699,000 pieces and 3,089,000 pieces respectively, a decrease of 13.44%
in annual revenues. total net earnings after tax for the year was nt$1.569

5.8 gigabyte's labor law breach explained
gigabyte values the opinions and voice of our employees. we are
committed to establishing an open and transparent communication
channel for promoting harmonious labor relations. in 2011, the labor
affairs department of new taipei city expanded its labor inspection of the
high-tech electronics industry. gigabyte was found to have violated labor
laws regarding excessive work hours and unpaid overtime. to balance
employee well-being with the company's competitiveness, gigabyte
convened a meeting to review the existing shift system. managers were
educated about the relevant legislation, and employees were informed
about the overtime work application process. in order to improve
managers and employees' communication and review the workflow, the
automated reminder system was introduced to send automatic alert
messages to managers and employees when employees' clocking in and
out times are abnormal. at the end of 2011, the labor authorities conducted
another inspection on overtime and overtime payments. gigabyte passed
the repeat inspection with no further breaches of the labor standards act.
the improvement showed gigabyte's determination to comply with labor
laws and fulfill its csr.

7.5 development of smart phone product
     category rules
the environmental protection administration determined that a common
standard was necessary to ensure the fairness and transparency of carbon
footprint calculations for similar products and services. the private-sector
was therefore invited to work together to define the “product category
rules, pcr”. gigabyte, compalcomm, the environment and development
foundation and the taiwan electrical and electronic manufacturers'
association joined forces to draft and define the “product category rules”
(pcr) for the “smart phone” category. on december 6, 2011, a
stakeholder conference was hosted with the industry invited to review the
draft rules. the pcr has now been verified by expert review and has been
officially proclaimed in the epd/pcr area of teema. the new pcr helps
manufacturers or service providers define the scope of the system
boundaries and the data used for calculations.
