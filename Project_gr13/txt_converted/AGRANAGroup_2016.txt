              stronger together.
    sugar, starch and fruit: it is thanks to the very
  diversity of our products’ applications in industry
that the combination of these three pillars has proved
  a solid and stable base for our company. together,
    the three business segments not only generate
   synergies in production and marketing, but also
   create long-term growth potential independent
           of segmental market fluctuations.




    sugar


    €   672.6                          million

    revenue of the sugar segment declined by
    8.0% from the year before, to € 672.6 million.
    sugar sales prices, especially for product
    sold to the sugar-using industry and to food
    retailers, were significantly lower than in
    the prior year, but growth was achieved in
    sales volumes of quota sugar, particularly
    to the food industry. while exports to
    countries outside the eu decreased, sales
    of non-quota sugar to the chemical industry
    were held almost at the year-earlier level.

                                  fruit

€   1,083.4                                million

the fruit segment successfully defied the tough
market conditions prevailing in its fruit juice
concentrates business in the 2015|16 financial
year. sales revenue of the segment grew by
2.0% to € 1,083.4 million. sales quantities of
fruit preparations were up slightly from the
previous year and, coupled with an increase
in sales prices, led to revenue growth of about
8% in this division of the fruit segment. the
fruit juice concentrates division, on the other
hand, saw a revenue reduction of 18% as
a result of a sharp decline in selling prices for
apple juice concentrate from the 2014 crop.




                               starch

€   721.6                        million

the starch segment delivered a robust top-
line performance. at € 721.6 million, revenue
even slightly exceeded that of the prior
financial year. the areas of revenue growth
included the bioethanol business, which
benefited from higher selling prices, and
the sector of wet starch derivatives, where
sales volumes rose. by-products generated
slightly less revenue than in the prior year
as a result of lower raw material prices, and
sales reductions in saccharification products
reflected the lasting low prices in a difficult
european sugar market.

supplying what makes
industries run.
our versatile starch segment impresses with its outstanding
product diversity, its high degree of value added and its
wide range of applications. we supply a large number of
very different industries, and the product portfolio of the
starch segment could not be more varied: food ingredients,
infant formula, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products,
feedstuffs and fertilisers, technical applications in the paper,
textile and construction materials industries, and climate-
friendly bioethanol for blending into petrol. added to this is
our leading position in organic and gmo-free starches.

                                 diversity and unity.
                           we are proud of the vast number of uses
                         our products find in everyday life: the range
                            extends from sugar for foods, to starch
                         for textiles and other non-food applications,
                              to fruit preparations for yoghurts and
                            fruit juice concentrates. taken together,
                          agrana’s products are indispensable both
                             in commercial and in private daily life.

in the field together.
our established global network of agricultural
advisors ensures that we remain in personal touch
with our contract growers. discussion forums
with top management as well stimulate an active
exchange of ideas with suppliers, especially beet
and potato growers. this dialogue encourages
trust and understanding, ultimately letting
us develop solutions together to meet the chal-
lenges that may exist.


 united in thinking of tomorrow.
   economic success is what drives us, but our respon-
    sibility to society as a whole is a constant guiding
    principle in our work. through respect for people
and the environment at all our sites worldwide, we thus
  create a shared culture of care that also honours the
                 needs of future generations.




                taking sustain-
                able action.
                at agrana we strive not only to com-
                pletely utilise all our agricultural raw
                materials and to ensure all our pro-
                duction processes are as eco-friendly
                and energy-saving as we can make
                them, but also to advance sustainable
                production conditions in the upstream
                supply chain. for instance, in the
                farm sustainability self-assessment
                using the criteria of the sustainable
                agriculture initiative (sai), one-half
                of our contract-based european
                beet growers and austrian potato
                growers achieved gold status and the
                other half attained silver standing.


                leading energy
                efficiency.
                in autumn 2015 at our sugar factory
                in kaposvár, hungary, a plant was
                installed which upgrades biogas (pro-
                duced from spent beet pulp and other
                residues) into biomethane and feeds
                it into the local natural gas network.
                as a result, the hungarian facility will
                in the next few years become the first
                sugar factory in europe to achieve
                energy self-sufficiency (on a net basis,
                taken over the whole financial year).

in this report on the 2015|16 financial year, the sustainability issues relevant to agrana’s business activities under
the g4 reporting standard of the global reporting initiative are covered directly in the group’s corporate governance
report and management report. to make the non-financial information easier to find, a content index of all
gri g4 indicators included in the report is provided from page 175. in addition, relevant passages are marked with
a green fingerprint on the respective pages.

letter from the ceo



        “acting together” – the motto of our annual report reflects the winning combination of our
         three business segments that again proved itself in the completed 2015|16 financial year, enabling
         agrana, despite the challenges in the sugar segment, to achieve a moderately improved operat-
         ing profit (ebit).


        sugar segment performed its absolute best in current demanding circumstances
        2015|16 was another year of difficult conditions in the sugar market. sales prices that were low
        all year (but did not fall further after the 2015 campaign) weighed on revenue and especially earn-
        ings in our sugar segment. the fact that we are not having to report a loss in this segment is
        an accomplishment in itself. our rationalisation measures, such as cost reductions in overheads,
        gained traction as quickly as our investment in yield enhancement (through chromatography), in
        by-product extraction (of betaine) and in energy efficiency.

        the swings in the world market price for sugar and the fierce battle for eu market positions
        in the run-up to the sugar regime’s expiration at the end of september 2017 will remain dominant
        drivers for our sugar business. but: we have prepared well for the market liberalisation, already
        command a strong presence in the deficit markets, and have deep expertise in sugar and glucose
        production based on decades of experience. our continuing goal is to expand our market share
        in central and eastern europe. the negative impacts of the sugar market reform, such as the
        testing of the economic lower price limits, are already a reality, while the advantages – such as
        the elimination of production caps and export restrictions – will only make themselves felt from
        the end of 2017.


        acting together: stronger profits in starch and fruit
        we are currently benefiting more than ever from our diversification into three pillars, which
        led to a respectable consolidated earnings result for the group. starch and fruit profits made up
        for the sugar segment in 2015|16. in fact, the starch segment delivered an all-time record
        operating profit, buoyed not just by its product diversity in food and non-food starches but also
        by ethanol prices. the fruit segment held its operating profit steady at the prior year’s level, with
        the fruit preparations division also attaining its best result yet, while the fruit juice concentrates
        business came in well below expectations due in part to the low apple juice concentrate prices
        from the 2014 crop.


        specialties strategy and higher refining intensity
        a lasting low oil price, the slowdown of the global economy with weaker growth in transition
        countries like china and brazil, significant falls in commodity prices: even, and especially, in this
        environment, agrana is strategically well positioned – with competition driven purely by raw
        material purchasing prices and product sale prices, our specialties strategy stands us in good stead.
        we will continue to focus on this approach in the future. in the starch segment in particular,
        we have enormous manufacturing flexibility and can offer a very broad product portfolio thanks
        to a mix of available grades (organic, gmo-free, clean label), different input species and varieties
        (yellow corn, waxy corn, wheat, potatoes), a range of technologies (extrusion, drum drying, spray
        drying, slurry processes) and chemical and physical modifications. our products’ gmo-free nature
        and our organics capabilities are a competitive advantage that we increasingly leverage world-
        wide, including in the usa, where gmo-free starch specialties are in growing demand. we are also
        using a specialties strategy to counter the commoditisation trend in the fruit juice concentrate
        business. in the sugar segment too, we will expand our unique selling propositions in our region
        in terms of the brands and breadth of the sugar product range and of managing regional brand-
        name products.

supervisory board’s report

        in the 2015|16 financial year as in the prior years, the supervisory board actively oversaw and
        supported agrana’s performance and exercised its responsibilities and powers under the law
        and the articles of association while observing the provisions of the austrian code of corporate
        governance. in a total of four meetings, of which all its members attended at least half, the
        supervisory board, through the reports of the management board and detailed written material,
        informed itself about the company’s business situation and financial position and about all
        relevant matters concerning the business performance and exceptional business transactions.
        the management board briefed the supervisory board in a timely and comprehensive manner
        on measures requiring the approval of the supervisory board.


        top agenda items of discussions
        regular key agenda items of the supervisory board’s deliberations were the strategic orientation
        and further development of the group, the business trend in all segments and the optimisation
        of corporate financing. outside the regular meetings as well, the chairman of the supervisory
        board had numerous conversations with the management board, especially with the chief
        executive officer, to discuss ongoing developments in the group’s environment, their impact on
        current business results, and the risk situation.

        in its meeting on 12 may 2015 the supervisory board dealt with the audit of the parent company
        and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 28 february 2015, the nomination of the
        independent auditor for election for the 2015|16 financial year, and the medium-term investment
        planning. the independent auditor attended this meeting and reported on the audit priorities
        and results, which also included the accounting-related elements of the internal control system.
        the supervisory board adopted the parent company financial statements and approved the
        consolidated financial statements. in its meeting on 3 july 2015, the supervisory board discussed
        and approved the medium-term planning. the meeting on 30 november 2015 discussed the
        forecast financial results for 2015|16 and the subjects of corporate governance, strategic equity
        investment and capital expenditure projects. in its meeting on 25 february 2016, the supervisory
        board deliberated on the financial planning and the capital investment projects for the 2016|17
        financial year. the supervisory board also attended to the self-evaluation under the austrian code
        of corporate governance.


        audit committee
        the audit committee convened for two meetings in the 2015|16 financial year. with the indepen-
        dent auditor in attendance, the audit committee dealt exhaustively with the 2014|15 parent
        company and consolidated financial statements of agrana beteiligungs-ag and discussed the
        management board’s proposal for the appropriation of profit. the committee’s deliberations also
        covered the audit of the corporate governance report and dealt with the report from internal
        audit and with the risk management system. the audit committee likewise worked on the plan-
        ning and priorities for the audit of the 2015|16 financial statements and discussed the subjects
        of anti-corruption and compliance.

        the committee chairman reported to the supervisory board in detail on the work of the
        committee.

corporate governance report

        agrana beteiligungs-ag is a public limited company (a stock corporation) under austrian law
        and is listed on the vienna stock exchange. corporate governance at agrana is based on austrian
        stock corporation law and capital market law, the regulations on employee co-determination,
        the articles of association and the terms of reference (the charters) of the supervisory board
        and management board of agrana beteiligungs-ag. in addition, the austrian code of corporate
        governance (the code), which can be found on the website of the austrian working group for
        corporate governance at www.corporate-governance.at, provides the framework for the direction
        and oversight of the company with the aim of high transparency for all stakeholders.

        the code consists of binding so-called l rules (these are based on legal requirements); of c rules
        (comply-or-explain rules), which are expected to be adhered to, with deviations to be explained in
        order to achieve compliance with the code; and of r rules (recommendations), non-compliance
        with which requires neither disclosure nor explanation.


        commitment to the austrian code of corporate governance
        agrana is committed to the provisions of the austrian code of corporate governance. in the
        2015|16 financial year, agrana applied the code in the version of january 2015. at its meetings
        on 30 november 2015 and 25 february 2016, the supervisory board of agrana beteiligungs-ag
        discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of com-
        pliance with the code.

        in the 2015|16 financial year, agrana adhered to all c rules of the code except as explained below:

        █   rule 27 (management board compensation criteria)
            the existing employment contracts of the management board members do not tie variable
            compensation to non-financial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts. setting ceilings
            on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unfore­
            seeable developments and to honour special achievements. a retroactive change to existing
            contracts does not appear justified.

        █   rule 27a (severance pay)
            in the event that a management board appointment is withdrawn, severance pay has been
            agreed in accordance with the provisions of the employees act. the management board con-
            tracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay.

        the approach in respect of rules 27 and 27a was adopted by the supervisory board and imple-
        mented by the nomination and remuneration committee in the contracts of the management
        board members.

        █   rule 49 (contracts requiring approval)
            under section 95 (5) (12) of the austrian stock corporation act, the approval of the supervisory
            board is required for contracts with members of the supervisory board by which members
            undertake, outside their role on the supervisory board, to provide a service to the company
            or a subsidiary for a material consideration. this also applies to contracts with companies
            in which a supervisory board member has a significant economic interest. for business policy
            and competition reasons, the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the
            annual report as stipulated in rule 49. this divergence was adopted by the supervisory board
            at the time of the initial commitment to the code of corporate governance in 2005.

                                                                          corporate governance report   19

supervisory board independence
the supervisory board of agrana beteiligungs-ag applies the guidelines for the definition of
supervisory board independence as set out in annex 1 to the austrian code of corporate
governance:

█   a supervisory board member shall not, in the past five years, have been a member of the
    management board or other management staff of the company or a subsidiary of the company.
█   a supervisory board member shall not have a business relationship, of a size significant
    to him or her, with the company or a subsidiary of the company, and shall not have had such
    a business relationship in the past year. this also applies to business relationships with
    companies in which the supervisory board member holds a significant economic interest,
    but does not apply to board positions held within the group.
█   the approval of individual transactions by the supervisory board under l rule 48 does not
    automatically imply a member’s designation as non-independent.
█   a supervisory board member shall not, in the past three years, have been an external auditor
    of the company or a partner or employee of the external auditing firm.
█   a supervisory board member shall not be a management board member of another company
    in which a member of the company’s management board is a supervisory board member.
█   a supervisory board member shall not serve on the supervisory board for more than 15 years.
    this does not apply to supervisory board members who are shareholders with a strategic
    shareholding in the company or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.
█   a supervisory board member shall not be a close relative (direct descendant, spouse,
    common-law spouse, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, nephew or niece) of a management board
    member or of persons holding any of the positions referred to in the foregoing points.


committees and their members
where the importance or specialist nature of a particular subject matter makes it appropriate,
the supervisory board also exercises its advisory and supervisory functions through the following
three committees:

the nomination and remuneration committee deals with the legal relationships between the
company and the members of the management board. the committee is responsible for
succession planning in respect of the management board and approves the compensation schemes
for the management board members. the nomination and remuneration committee held no
meetings in the 2015|16 financial year.

the strategy committee prepares strategic decisions of the supervisory board by providing
decision support, and makes decisions in urgent matters. the strategy committee held no meet-
ings in the 2015|16 financial year.

                                                                        corporate governance report    23




the audit committee prepares for transaction by the supervisory board all matters related to                •
the company’s separate financial statements and to the auditing of the accounting records and of             •
the consolidated financial statements and group management report, including the corporate                   •
governance report. it monitors the effectiveness of the internal control system, audit system and            •
risk management system and verifies the independence and qualifications of the external auditors.            •
in the 2015|16 financial year the audit committee met twice. its meetings focused particularly               •
                                                                                                            23
on the audit of the 2014|15 financial statements, the preparation of the audit of the 2015|16 finan-         •
cial statements, and the supervision of the risk management system. the audit committee also                 •
dealt with the compliance report and with the report of the group’s internal audit function.                 •

the supervisory board terms of reference include the procedures for the committees; an excerpt
of the terms of reference is available on the agrana website at www.agrana.com/en.                          •

the fixed compensation of the management board members remained unchanged compared
to the prior year.

post-employment benefits granted to the management board under the company’s plan are
pension, disability insurance and survivor benefits. for the management board members johann
marihart, fritz gattermayer and former member walter grausam, the following applies: the
pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the austrian public pension
scheme (asvg5) are met. in the event of retirement before the age determined under the asvg,
the amount of the pension is reduced. the pension amount is calculated as a percentage
of a contractually agreed assessment base. for the pension of stephan büttner, there is a defined
contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient has reached 55 years of age
provided that the employment relationship has ended. for the 2015|16 financial year, pension
fund contributions of € 720 thousand were paid (prior year: € 2,955 thousand).

the retirement benefit obligations in respect of the management board are administered by an
external pension fund. in the event that a management board appointment is withdrawn, there
are severance pay obligations in accordance with the provisions of the employees act (see note on
rule 27a) or the occupational pension plan act (bmsvg6). in the balance sheet at 29 february 2016,
within the item “retirement and termination benefit obligations”, an amount of € 6,646 thou-
sand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year: € 8,058 thousand) and an amount of
€ 1,986 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year: € 1,906 thousand).

no compensation agreements in the event of a public tender offer exist between the company
and its management board, supervisory board or other staff.

agrana maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage for management staff. this
d&o insurance covers certain personal liability risks of the individuals acting as legal representa-
tives of the agrana group. the cost is borne by agrana.

agrana’s compliance management system comprises the following core elements and policies:

the agrana code of conduct forms the foundation of all business actions and decisions. the
code of conduct is designed to give a clear and systematic understanding of the conduct which
agrana expects from all employees, managers and directors in all activities and locations
of the group. together with the mission statement, it guides the entire agrana group, setting
unambiguous standards of integrity, correct business conduct and ethical principles. the code
of conduct has been translated into all languages relevant to the group.

anticorruption laws apply worldwide and must be obeyed everywhere and at all times. in view
of austria’s specific anti-corruption legislation, agrana has issued a separate austria anti-corrup-
tion policy, complementing the code of conduct. this policy sets out binding regulations and a
reporting system. the policy aims to ensure legally compliant conduct and to facilitate the proper
handling of invitations and gifts. additionally, to accommodate austrian laws, a separate tax policy
was created that governs the handling of tax processes.

the purpose of the globally applicable antitrust compliance policy is to ensure that all employees
and board members know and abide by the essential provisions of competition and antitrust
law and have the awareness to recognise situations with antitrust relevance. the overarching aim
of this policy is to preserve employees from violating antitrust legislation and to provide practical,
real-world support in applying the relevant rules. the policy has been translated into all languages
relevant for the group.

for agrana beteiligungs-ag as a publicly traded company, it is highly important to adhere to
stock exchange and capital market laws and regulations, particularly the stock exchange act and
the issuer compliance regulation of the financial market authority. based on these pieces
of legislation, agrana has issued its capital market compliance policy. it sets out the principles
governing the disclosure of information and prescribes organisational measures for safeguarding
confidentiality and preventing improper use or transmission of insider information.

the purpose of the agrana compliance management system is to ensure the fulfilment of the
corporate leadership’s organisational and supervisory obligations under the law and to minimise
the liability risks for the agrana group, its employees and board members.

in 2015|16, frequent trainings in austria continued to be delivered for a defined group of employ-
ees on austria-specific anticorruption and tax policy, on competition and antitrust law and capital
market compliance. all identified employees in austria were or have been trained. new staff
members are continually being trained soon after hiring. in the international subsidiaries, the
training of all relevant compliance policies for the defined group of employees was begun in 2015
and is to be completed in the course of 2016.

in addition to the physical classroom trainings, agrana now also plans to provide electronic
distance training on the code of conduct, anticorruption, and competition and antitrust law.
the trainings are being produced and delivered together with an external provider and are to be
rolled out during the 2016|17 financial year in austria and then worldwide.

agrana’s strategy

                            as an austrian industrial group with an international focus, agrana’s sugar and starch segments
                            operate mainly in europe and the operations of its fruit segment are global. in these markets,
                            agrana seeks or already commands a leading position in the industrial processing of agricul-
                            tural raw materials. the group pursues a growth strategy oriented to the respective local market
                            opportunities. long-lasting, stable customer and supplier relationships, respectful treatment
                            of all stakeholders and continual growth in the company’s value are major cornerstones of the
                            corporate strategy, which is guided by the principles of sustainable management. agrana’s aim
                            is to provide both its globally operating and its regional customers worldwide with high product
                            quality, optimum service and innovative product development ideas and expertise.

                            agrana controls and manages the product value chain from the purchase of agricultural raw
                            materials to the production of the resulting intermediate goods for industrial customers (and end
                            products for consumers in the case of the sugar segment). agrana utilises the group’s strategic
                            know-how across segment boundaries. this is especially true for agricultural grower contract
                            management and raw material procurement, the knowledge of customer requirements and mar-
                            kets, the opportunities for the development of inter-segment products, and synergies in logistics,
                            purchasing, sales and finance. the cross-segment application of these competencies forms the
                            basis for a robust market position in relation to competitors in all product groups, and underpins
                            agrana’s innovative strength and lean cost position.

                            in its business operations, agrana seeks to make the part of the value chain that it has influence
                            over as sustainable as possible. by sustainability, in this context, agrana primarily means the
                            following three aspects, which apply to all business segments:

                            █ utilisation of almost 100% of the agricultural raw materials employed,
                              and use of low-emission technologies to minimise impacts on the environment
                            █ respect for all stakeholders and communities where the group operates

                            █ working together in long-term partnerships

operating profit (ebit), at € 129.0 million, grew moderately (by 6.0%) from the prior-year level.
while ebit in the starch segment, at € 65.9 million, rose substantially by 21.8%, the lower
revenue in the sugar business led to markedly weaker (but positive) ebit in the sugar segment
of € 4.3 million, a decrease of 52.2%. in the fruit segment, ebit was steady (at € 58.8 million,
up 0.3%) despite a significant reduction in fruit juice concentrate earnings. details on the share of
results of equity-accounted joint ventures and on exceptional items can be found in the segment
reports and the consolidated financial statements.

net financial items in the 2015|16 financial year amounted to a net expense of € 24.5 million
(prior year: net expense of € 5.2 million); the significant negative year-on-year change was attrib-
utable to net currency translation losses that represented a negative change of € 21.3 million from
the prior year’s translation gains. the translation losses were caused primarily by depreciation
in the currencies of argentina, brazil, china, mexico and russia. net interest expense, meanwhile,
improved by € 1.8 million thanks to a further decline in interest rates and the optimised use of
existing liquid assets.

operating cash flow before changes in working capital rose moderately from the prior year,
to € 225.9 million in 2015|16. after a significant increase of € 73.7 million in working capital (prior
year: decrease of € 52.0 million) and a higher income tax expense, net cash from operating activi-
ties amounted to € 101.9 million (prior year: € 227.1 million). net cash used in investing activities
was € 19.9 million (prior year: net cash use of € 84.2 million) as higher payments for purchases
of property, plant and equipment and intangibles were offset by proceeds from non-current
financial assets. net cash used in financing activities of € 163.6 million (prior year: net cash use
of € 81.1 million) reflected both the payment of the dividend for the 2014|15 financial year and the
repayment of borrowings to südzucker ag. free cash flow declined by about 43% year-on-year.

as a result of the group’s realignment of its financing structure in 2014|15, no capital market trans-
actions were required in the financial year under review. the funds freed up by the disposal of
the participation capital were used to repay a loan from südzucker ag, with the effect of reducing

in the 2015|16 financial year, revenue in the sugar segment decreased by 8.0% year-on-year to
€ 672.6 million. while sugar sales prices especially with the sugar-using industry and with resellers
(food wholesalers and retailers) were down significantly from the prior year, growth was achieved
in the sales quantities of quota sugar, particularly with the food industry. sales volumes of
non-quota sugar with the chemical industry were nearly at the year-earlier level, while exports
to non-eu countries were down significantly. revenue from by-products receded slightly for price
reasons. the sugar segment accounted for 27.2% of group revenue (prior year: 29.3%).

as expected, ebit (earnings before interest and taxes), at € 4.3 million, also fell year-on-year (from
€ 9.0 million). the key negative driver was the significant decline in sugar selling prices compared
with the prior year. in the first six months of the prior year, higher prices were still being
received from the 2013|14 campaign. the ebit improvement in the last six months of the 2015|16
financial year was attributable primarily to the year-on-year drop in the cost of raw sugar and
to the additional contribution margin from the higher sales volume.

revenue in the starch segment in 2015|16 was € 721.6 million, up slightly by 3.1% from the
previous year. among other areas, the revenue growth was achieved in the bioethanol business,
which benefited from higher selling prices, and in wet starch derivatives, thanks to higher sales
volumes. decreased revenue from saccharification products reflected the persistent low prices
in the european sugar market. by-products brought in slightly less revenue than in the prior
year, as a result of lower raw material prices. the starch segment generated 29.1% of the group’s
revenue (prior year: 28.1%).

ebit of € 65.9 million significantly surpassed the year-earlier result, by 21.8%. besides price-driven              •
margin growth (notably in ethanol) and higher sales volumes, this increase was explained by                         •
lower raw material and energy prices. profitability in terms of ebit margin rose from 7.7% to 9.1%.                 •
the earnings decrease at hungrana, the equity-accounted subsidiary, was a result of the lower                       •
sales prices for saccharification products.                                                                         •

slightly from one year earlier, and higher sales prices that were amplified by favourable currency                  •
effects (mostly from the us dollar, chinese yuan, korean won and egyptian pound). in the fruit                      •
juice concentrates division, on the other hand, revenue declined by about 18% as a result mainly                    •
of sharply lower selling prices for apple juice concentrate from the 2014 crop. the fruit segment                   •
was responsible for 43.7% of group revenue (prior year: 42.6%).                                                     •

ebit in the fruit segment was € 58.8 million and thus steady at the year-earlier level. while                       •
the fruit preparations division showed a significant improvement in ebit, the lower apple prices                    •
of the 2014 campaign and the associated considerable decline in concentrate prices negatively
affected margins in the fruit juice concentrate activities. in fruit preparations, a significantly
positive business trend was felt particularly in europe, north and latin america, asia/australia
and middle east/north africa, while currencies that strengthened against the euro (most notably                     •
the us dollar, korean won and chinese yuan) also contributed to the gain in ebit. the net                           •

      sustainability/       economic footprint of the agrana group
         value-chain
                            in the sustainability realm, for agrana as an energy-intensive industrial company, the ecological
                            aspect of its business operations has been a focus for many years. besides this, the group also
                            considered working conditions (both internally and in the supply chain) and compliance aspects.
                            additionally, in the 2015|16 financial year the group’s contributions to the economy in terms of
                            value added and employment were studied more closely for the first time.


                            methodology
                            based on the business data for 2014|15, when agrana’s sugar, starch and fruit segments gener­
                            ated revenue of about € 2.5 billion in 25 countries with approximately 8,700 employees worldwide,
                            the economica institute of economic research calculated the gross value-added impacts and
                            employment effects emanating from agrana’s activities.

                            the study methodology is based on an input-output analysis. using a worldwide input-output
                            table in which agrana was individually modelled in the form of a satellite account, the
                            input-output model describes the delivery and procurement relationships which link agrana to
                            all production sectors of an economy, portrays the company’s contribution of value added to the
                            economy and shows the flows of individual goods (inputs) into and through agrana’s produc-
                            tion into its outputs and their uses. this makes it possible to quantify not only the direct impact
                            of the group’s business activities on the macroeconomy but also their multiplier effect.

research and development

       operating in a highly competitive market environment, it is vital for agrana to set market trends
       and differentiate itself from the competition through product innovations. in close partnership
       with customers, agrana’s research and development (r&d) teams are always working on new
       recipes, specialty products and innovative applications for existing products, true to the group’s
       strategic focus on lasting, sustainable success.

       the agrana research & innovation center (aric) in tulln, austria, is the group’s central research
       and development institute for the starch, bioethanol, sugar and fruit businesses. aric, as a sepa-
       rate company in the agrana group, is a wholly owned subsidiary of agrana beteiligungs-ag.
       the aim of the institute is to develop new applications for innovative products made from potato,
       corn, waxy corn, wheat and sugar beet. the company is active nationally and internationally
       as an in-house r&d service provider for sugar technology, food technology, starch and bioethanol
       technology, microbiology, biotechnology, as well as fruit preparations product development. more-
       over, the agrana research center also offers its specialist r&d know-how to third parties and
       acts as a state-accredited laboratory for bioethanol analytics and sugar beet quality control.

       this “clustering” and collaboration of r&d specialists from different segments (sugar, starch and
       fruit) under one roof not only drives administrative synergies but also promotes creative exchange
       between different groups of researchers. the complementarity between the groups’ experience is
       particularly valuable in cross-segment areas of research, such as nutrition physiology, thickeners
       and aromas, microbiology, product quality and safety, and organic products. in this way, the
       growing number of projects involving more than one agrana business segment can be carried
       out much more simply and efficiently.

       sugar segment
       a project aimed at the potential reduction of primary energy costs was launched in connection
       with the expanded molasses desugaring plant at the sugar factory in tulln, austria. the plant oper-
       ates by chromatographically (without the use of chemicals) separating molasses into a sugar-rich
       fraction, a betaine-rich one and a fraction high in ash and colour compounds. while there are
       excellent utilisation opportunities for the first two fractions, the existing uses of the latter residue,
       which still contains a significant proportion of sugar, can be diversified beyond the current options
       of feedstuff or fertiliser use.

       a cooperative project with the austrian centre of industrial biotechnology (acib gmbh), supported
       by the comet programme of austria’s research promotion agency (österreichische forschungs­
       förderungsgesellschaft mbh), is studying the fermentative utilisation of the remaining sugar in
       this molasses residue. the researchers are using a two-stage process in which the residual sugar is
       digested by microorganisms to produce hydrogen and methane. the goal is to build a two-stage
       pilot plant in the molasses desugaring facility in tulln for studying the process over a longer time
       period. if the concept proves viable and an industrial-scale version is installed, approximately
       30% of the primary energy requirement of the molasses desugaring plant could be met from the
       methane produced on-site.

4 non-permanent (i. e., fixed-term or temporary) and permanent employees within the gri reporting boundaries
  (see from page 41).
5 in agrana’s workplace safety data, injuries are counted as accidents. days are counted as lost from the first scheduled
  work day missed after the accident (excluding accidents on the way to or from work).
6 total paid hours worked are defined by agrana as contractual work hours plus paid overtime.
7 explanation of the multiplier 200,000: the multiplier is intended to make the group’s internal workplace safety data
  comparable with other companies. it is based on the assumption of 40 work hours per week and 50 work weeks
  per year, for 100 employees (40 × 50 × 100). the effect of the multiplier is thus to convert from a company’s average
  number of accidents, lost days or absentee hours (hours missed as a result of accident or illness) per hour of work
  done in the company, to an annual number per 100 employees.
8 a work day is assumed to have eight hours.

          agrana currently expects both group revenue and operating profit (ebit) to increase moderately
          for the 2016|17 financial year.

          total investment in the three business segments in 2016|17, at about € 114 million, will signifi-
          cantly exceed depreciation of just under € 90 million.

          in the sugar segment, agrana expects revenue at least in line with the previous year, in antici-
          pation of stable sales volumes and prices. improved margins and the cost reduction programme
          initiated in summer 2015 augur a significant increase in ebit in 2016|17 compared to the year
          before.

          the capital expenditures planned for the sugar segment in 2015|16 are approximately € 22 million.
          alongside asset replacement and maintenance investment, the spending will go especially to
          measures to improve energy efficiency and product quality.

          in the starch segment, agrana’s projection for the 2016|17 financial year calls for slightly rising
          sales volumes and steady revenue. the probable downward price pressure in saccharification
          products and bioethanol leads to a moderately to significantly reduced ebit forecast compared
          to 2015|16, despite lower commodity derivative prices for raw materials.

          the investment of approximately € 58 million planned in the starch segment represents about
          50% of the group total. the capital expenditure will primarily target capacity expansions in austria
          (in aschach) and product segments that have a high refining intensity, in order to seize growth
          opportunities in high-margin areas.

          agrana expects that in the 2016|17 financial year the fruit segment will achieve significant
          growth in revenue and ebit.

financial statements
agrana beteiligungs-ag (“the company”) is the parent company of the agrana group and has its registered office
at friedrich-wilhelm-raiffeisen-platz 1, 1020 vienna, austria. the company together with its subsidiaries constitutes
an international group engaged mainly in the worldwide industrial processing of agricultural raw materials.

the consolidated financial statements of the agrana group for 2015|16 were prepared in accordance with inter-
national financial reporting standards (ifrs) in effect at the balance sheet date and with international financial
reporting interpretations committee (ifric) interpretations, as adopted by the european union.



1. segment information
the segment reporting, which conforms with ifrs 8, distinguishes between three business segments – sugar, starch
and fruit – and thus follows the agrana group’s internal reporting structure.

the agrana group has the three reportable segments sugar, starch and fruit, which correspond to its strategic
businesses. each of the segments offers a different product portfolio and is managed separately in view of the
different production technologies, raw material procurement and sales strategies. agrana beteiligungs-aktiengesell­
schaft (“agrana beteiligungs-ag”), the group’s holding company, is considered part of the sugar segment.

for each segment, internal monthly reporting is provided to the group’s chief operating decision maker (codm).
the members of the management board of agrana beteiligungs-ag constitute the codm. information on the results
of the reportable segments is given below. segment profitability is evaluated primarily on the basis of operating profit
before exceptional items, which is a key performance indicator in every internal management report.

the iasb has issued the final version of ifrs 9, bringing together the results of the classification and measurement, impairment and                    •
hedge accounting phases of the project to replace ias 39 (financial instruments: recognition and measurement). this new version of the                  •
standard adds a new model of expected losses for measuring impairment, and limited changes to the classification and measurement                        •
requirements for financial assets. the impairment model is based on the concept of providing for expected losses at the inception of                    •
a contract, with the exception of purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, where expected credit losses are incorporated               •
into the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition. the classification and measurement model for financial assets and                   •
for certain debt instruments is expanded by adding a new category, “fair value through other comprehensive income” (fvtoci). as well,                   •
additional guidance is provided on how to apply the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics test. the standard super-                  •
sedes all previous versions of ifrs 9. for the securities holdings the new classification will also result in changes in measurement method.            •

ifrs 15 establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer. specifically, it also establishes criteria for determining whether different                    •
performance obligations under a contract are distinct. agrana does not expect the application of the standard to have an impact on                      •
the timing of revenue recognition, but expects it to require expanded disclosures.

ifrs 16 establishes new rules for the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases. the standard provides only a single
accounting model for the lessee, requiring the right of use to be recognised as the asset, and the obligation to be recognised as a liability,         •
in the balance sheet. capitalisation is optional only for underlying assets with a low value and for short-term leases with a term of less              •
than twelve months. agrana is evaluating the extent to which ifrs 16 applies to existing rental agreements and how the right-of-use                     •
asset and the corresponding liability are to be measured for individual contracts and categories of contracts. once this process is completed,          •
the impacts on the financial position can be estimated. agrana only acts as a lessor to a very limited extent. as the dual accounting                   •
model of operating leases and finance leases remains in place for lessors, no accounting changes are expected for agrana as a lessor.                   •

restatements in accordance with ias 8
from the beginning of the 2015|16 financial year, the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income was
expanded by adding the line item “effects from equity-accounted joint ventures” within other comprehensive income.
the new item represents the effects – recognised directly in equity – from equity-accounted joint ventures in the
form of ias 39 fair value movements, currency translation differences, and changes in actuarial gains and losses
on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities. previously, these effects were included in the separate
line items for ias 39 fair value movements and currency translation differences and for changes in actuarial gains
and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities. the consolidated statement of changes
in equity was adjusted by the addition of a separate column containing the corresponding amounts, to be recognised
directly in equity, of the ias 39 fair value movements, translation differences and changes in actuarial gains and
losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities of equity-accounted joint ventures.


changes in comparative information
in the 2015|16 financial year, currency translation gains or losses were for the first time presented on a gross basis
in operating profit (ebit) and in net financial items. for the 2014|15 comparative period this adjustment led to
an increase in other operating income and other operating expenses of € 5,055 thousand and an increase in finance
income and expense of € 41,204 thousand, compared to the published amounts.

as a result of an expansion of the treasury management system and an associated adaptation of recording processes,
gains and losses on derivatives are since 2015|16 presented on a gross basis. for the 2014|15 comparative period,
relative to the published amounts, this led to an increase of € 11,935 thousand in gains on derivatives and an increase
of € 32,583 thousand in losses on derivatives, as well as a reduction of € 5,130 thousand in currency translation gains
within net financial items and a reduction of € 25,778 thousand in translation losses in net financial items.

the presentation of employee numbers was changed from a headcount basis (average for the year) to full-time
equivalents (average for the year).

in the cash flow statement, the interest, taxes and dividends representing cash flows are now presented separately
and the foreign currency effects are allocated to the items to which they relate; the prior-year data have therefore
been adjusted.




3. scope of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include, by full consolidation, all domestic and foreign companies controlled
by agrana beteiligungs-ag (i. e., all subsidiaries), except where the subsidiary’s effect on the group’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows is immaterial. control exists when agrana beteiligungs-ag has the
power to participate in positive and negative variable returns of a company (an investee) and has the ability to affect
these returns and direct the investee’s relevant activities through its power over the investee. this is usually given
when agrana beteiligungs-ag owns more than one-half of the voting rights of the investee.

companies managed jointly with another entity, where control is exercised jointly and the investors have joint
rights to the net assets of the investee, are joint ventures and are included in the consolidated financial statements
using the equity method of accounting.

at the balance sheet date, 58 companies (prior year: 63) besides the parent were fully consolidated in the group
financial statements and 12 companies (prior year: 11) were included using the equity method.

an overview of the fully consolidated entities, equity-accounted joint ventures and other business interests is given
beginning from page 159.

3.1. balance sheet date
the balance sheet date (reporting date) of the consolidated financial statements is the last day of february. group
companies with other reporting dates prepare interim financial statements at the group reporting date.




4. consolidation methods
█ acquisitions of companies that are fully consolidated are accounted for using the acquisition method in accor-

dance with ifrs 3. where a business combination entails the possible recognition of intangible assets not previously
recognised in the separate financial statements of the acquired company, such as customer relationships, these
are recognised only when the requirements under ias 38 for capitalisation are met. for acquisitions of a majority
interest rather than a 100% stake in a company, ifrs 3 provides an accounting policy choice as to how to measure
the resulting non-controlling interests. the non-controlling interests may be measured either at their proportionate
share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree (partial goodwill method) or at their proportionate share
of goodwill (full goodwill method). this choice is available individually for each business combination. the full good-
will method has not been applied in the agrana group to date.

█ the investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in the consoli-

dated financial statements from the time of acquisition, provided that the requirements for the application of
ifrs 11 (joint arrangements) are met. profits or losses resulting from transactions of the agrana group with a joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint venture.

█ intragroup revenues, expenses and income and all receivables and payables or provisions between the consoli-

dated companies are eliminated. in assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included
in non-current assets or in inventories, intragroup balances are eliminated.




5. currency translation
█ financial statements of foreign group companies are translated into euros in accordance with ias 21. the

functional currency of every group company is its respective national currency. assets and liabilities are translated
at the ecb reference rates of exchange or other published reference rates at the balance sheet date (i. e., at period-end
rates). foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at
the transaction date. expenses and income are translated at annual average rates of exchange (the mean of the
daily rates of the ecb or national banks), with the exception of the currency translation gains and losses from the
measurement of receivables and liabilities related to group financing.

█ differences compared to prior-year amounts arising from the translation of balance sheet items at current

balance sheet date exchange rates or arising from the use of average rates in translating expenses and income com-
pared to the use of current balance sheet date rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. specifically,
they are presented in the statement of other comprehensive income as currency translation differences related to
consolidation.

█ product development costs are capitalised at cost if they can be accurately allocated to a product and if both

the technical feasibility and the marketing of the new product are assured. in addition, the development work must
be sufficiently likely to generate future cash inflows. items of property, plant and equipment are valued at cost
of purchase and/or conversion, less straight-line or campaign-based depreciation and impairment losses. besides
materials and labour costs, prorated overheads are capitalised in the conversion costs of internally generated assets.
borrowing costs directly attributable to the production of an asset that are incurred during the production period
are capitalised in accordance with ias 23. all other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period
during which they are incurred. maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, unless they result in an expansion or
significant improvement of the asset concerned, in which case they are capitalised.

                                                                                notes to the consolidated financial statements   112




█ where rental agreements or leases transfer all material risks and rewards of ownership to the agrana group

(finance leases), the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset. the asset is initially measured at the lower of
(i) its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and (ii) the present value of the future minimum
rental or lease payments. this amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings.

█   depreciation of property, plant and equipment is generally based on the following useful lives:

buildings                                                                                                    15 to 50 years

6.2. government assistance
█ government assistance to reimburse the group for costs is recognised as other operating income in the period

in which the related costs are incurred, unless the assistance is contingent on conditions that are not yet sufficiently
likely to be met.

█ government assistance to support capital expenditure is recognised as deferred income from the time of the

binding award and deducted from the cost of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on a straight-
line basis over the useful life of the allocated asset through profit and loss. details are provided from page 128.


6.3. financial instruments
█ the agrana group distinguishes the following classes of financial instruments:



    financial assets
    – securities, and investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies
    – trade receivables
    – other financial assets
    – cash and cash equivalents
    financial liabilities
    – bank loans and overdrafts, and other loans from non-group entities
    – borrowings from affiliated companies in the südzucker group
    – finance lease obligations
    – trade payables
    – financial other payables
    derivative financial instruments
    – interest-rate derivatives
    – currency derivatives
    – commodity derivatives

█ investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, as well as securities, are classified to the

available-for-sale category and are initially measured at fair value in the case of securities, and at cost in the case
of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and outside companies, including any transaction costs. subsequent
measurement is at fair value. changes in value are recognised outside profit or loss (after income tax) in a separate
reserve item in equity. only after the cumulative changes in fair value are realised by selling the asset are they
recognised in the income statement. available-for-sale non-material investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries
and outside companies are measured at cost.

█   financial assets are recognised at the settlement date.

█ cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and bank deposits having a remaining term to maturity of up to

three months at the time of investment. cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are measured at the exchange
rates at the balance sheet date.

                                                                                                         accounting policies   113

fair value. changes in their fair value are recognised through profit or loss in other operating income/expenses                      •
(for commodity derivatives and currency derivatives related to purchase and sales transactions) or in net financial                   •
items (for interest rate derivatives and currency derivatives related to financings), unless the derivatives are used to              •
hedge an underlying transaction (cash flow hedges). where the conditions for cash flow hedge accounting under                         •
ias 39 are met, the unrealised effective changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity. they are reclassified               •
from equity to profit or loss in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects profit or loss. ineffective            •
portions of the valuation gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recognised in the income statement immediately.
derivatives are classified as held for trading, except for derivatives in a hedging relationship with a hedged item
that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. more information on derivative financial instruments is provided on                     •

6.5. emission allowances
█ emission rights are accounted for in accordance with ias 38 (intangible assets), ias 20 (accounting for govern-

ment grants and disclosure of government assistance) and ias 37 (provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent
assets). emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes
of ias 38 that, except as noted below, are to be classified as current assets. they are assigned a cost of zero. from
the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances (one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide), a
provision for co2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income state-
ment. the provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or
any excess of their market value at the measurement date over their cost. co2 emission allowances that have already
been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in non-current assets.


6.6. impairment
█ assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) are tested at every balance sheet date for evidence of

impairment. goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed for impairment annually
at 31 august regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment.

█ the impairment test involves determining the asset’s recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher

of an asset’s value in use and its net selling price. if the asset’s recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount,
the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement.

█ an asset’s value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the asset’s continuing use

and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. the discount rate used in determining present value is a pre-tax
market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned. where no largely independent cash inflows
can be determined, value in use is determined for the next-larger unit (the cash generating unit) to which the asset
belongs and for which largely independent cash inflows can be determined.

█ where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated, the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss

(except in the case of goodwill and equity-like securities classified as “available-for-sale”) is recognised as income
in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use. impairment losses on goodwill
are not reversed.


6.7. employee benefit obligations
█ the agrana group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination

benefits. under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements, agrana has no further
obligation after paying the agreed premium. contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense
when they fall due, and are reported in staff costs. contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same
manner as those paid to defined contribution plans. as the group has no payment obligations beyond making the
contributions, no provision is maintained.

█ the provisions for defined benefit pension, termination and long-service obligations are calculated using the

projected unit credit method in accordance with ias 19 (employee benefits), based on actuarial valuations. this
involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan
assets at the balance sheet date. in the case of a deficit, a provision is recorded; in the case of a surplus, an asset
(other receivable) is recorded. the defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method.
under this method, the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over
the period during which the respective beneficiaries acquire the entitlement to these benefits.

                                                                                                         accounting policies   115




█ service cost is recognised in staff costs. besides the current service cost for the benefits newly earned by staff                 •
every year, it may also include past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes, which is recognised                      •
immediately in profit or loss for the period. the net interest cost for the financial year is calculated by applying the              •
discount rate determined at the beginning of the year to the net pension obligation determined at that time, taking                   •
into account the expected payment outflows. net interest is recognised in finance expense.                                            •

█ actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous                       •
actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur,                      •
along with their effect on deferred taxes (with the exception of obligations for long-service awards). correspondingly,               •
the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet. the changes in actuarial gains and losses
recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income.
actuarial gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity cannot be reclassified to profit or loss in subse-               •
quent periods. the recognition in other comprehensive income also includes the differences between (i) the interest                   •
income on plan assets based on the discount rate and included in net interest and (ii) the actual return on plan                      •

█ the calculation is based on extrapolated future trends in salaries, retirement benefits and employee turnover,                      •
as well as a discount rate of predominantly 1.8% for the year under review (prior year: 1.4%).                                        •
                                                                                                                                      •
█ a portion of pension obligations was transferred to pension funds. the retirement benefit contributions to                          •
be paid are calculated so as to fully fund the retirement benefit obligation at the time of retirement. if a plan deficit             •
occurs, there is an obligation to fund the shortfall. the group also holds benefit insurance policies to secure its                   •
ability to meet obligations under pension and termination benefit plans. the individual assets allocated to the pension               •
plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the net obligation. the individual
assets allocated to the pension plan are netted against the present value of the pension obligation to arrive at the

█ “provisions for staff costs including long-service awards” also include provisions for phased retirement, provisions                •
for redundancy benefit plans under restructuring projects, provisions for bonuses and awards, and other personnel-                    •
related provisions. under ias 19, long-service awards are classified as long-term employee benefits. these are                        •
determined by the projected unit credit method. actuarial gains and losses are reported in the current period in staff                •

are stipulated under local company agreements or of collective agreements. obligations for the payment of such
service anniversary bonuses exist especially in austria and germany. in austria, provisions for phased retirement must

                                                                                  notes to the consolidated financial statements   116




be created as a result of labour laws regarding obligations to employees. the legislation concerning phased retire-
ment makes it easier for companies to employ older staff members working reduced hours with substantial financial
security until full retirement. provisions for redundancy benefit plans under restructurings are created only if a
formal, detailed restructuring plan has been prepared and communicated.

█ provisions for uncertain liabilities include, among other items, provisions for litigation risks, onerous contracts,

costs of beet receiving, loading and storage, and other uncertain liabilities. a provision for onerous (loss-making)
contracts is recognised if the expected economic benefit from a contract is less than the unavoidable cost of fulfilling
the contract.


6.9. deferred taxes
█ deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the ifrs carrying amounts of assets and liabili-

ties and the tax base; on consolidation entries; and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised. significant
differences exist between the ifrs carrying amounts and the tax base for property, plant and equipment, inventories
and provisions. deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected
to be utilised within five years.

█ deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method (under ias 12), based on the pertinent national income tax

rates. consequently, with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation, deferred taxes are recognised for
all temporary differences between the ifrs balance sheet and the tax base, to the extent that deferred tax assets are
likely to be realised.

█ when income and expenses are recognised directly in equity, the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities

are also taken directly to equity. the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary
differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account company-specific forecasts of, for instance, the future
earnings situation in the respective group company. deferred tax assets are recognised only if the associated tax
benefits are expected to be realisable over a five-year planning horizon. this is the case if sufficient profits can
be earned or if there is sufficient taxable income from the reversal of temporary differences previously recognised
as liabilities.

█ deferred tax assets are classified as non-current assets; deferred tax liabilities are recorded as non-current liabilities.

deferred tax assets are off set against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority.

█ the income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income, and the

movement in deferred taxes.


6.10. recognition of revenue and costs
█ revenue from goods sold is recognised when substantially all risks and rewards incident to ownership have

passed to the purchaser. revenue from services provided is recognised to the extent that the services have been
rendered by the balance sheet date.

█   operating expenses are recognised in the income statement upon use of the product or service or as incurred.

█ finance expenses comprise the interest expense, similar expenses and transaction costs on borrowings including

finance leases; financing-related currency translation gains and losses; and financing-related hedging gains and
losses.

█ income from financial investments represents interest, dividend and similar income realised from cash-equivalent

investments and investments in other financial assets; gains and losses on the disposal of financial assets; and
impairment losses and impairment loss reversals.

█ interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. dividend income is recog-

nised at the time of the decision to pay the dividend.

                                                                                                     accounting policies   117

           – the off-balance sheet obligations from financial guarantees and from other contingent liabilities, and any reduc-
             tions in these obligations, are regularly reviewed as to whether they require recognition in the balance sheet.

             management exercises judgement as to whether agrana is likely to incur an outflow of resources from the
             obligation concerned and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

           █ the hungrana group and the studen group were classified as joint ventures in accordance with ifrs 11 and

           the agreements existing at the time. the agrana group holds 50% of the share capital of the joint ventures.

the tax reform act of 2005 introduced a new concept for the taxation of company groups. in accordance with the
provisions of this act, the agrana group established a group consisting of agrana beteiligungs-ag as the
group parent and the following group members: agrana zucker gmbh, agrana stärke gmbh, agrana marketing-
und vertriebsservice gesellschaft m.b.h., agrana internationale verwaltungs- und asset-management gmbh,
agrana group-services gmbh, instantina nahrungsmittel entwicklungs- und produktionsgesellschaft m.b.h.
and austria juice gmbh.

deferred taxes are recognised on differences between carrying amounts in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
and the tax bases of the individual companies in their home countries. deferred taxes take into account carryforwards
of unused tax losses.

in the interest of conservative planning, deferred taxes reﬂect carryforwards of tax losses only to the extent that
sufficient taxable proﬁt is likely to be earned over the next ﬁve years to utilise the deferred tax assets. € 16,075 thou-
sand (prior year: € 14,305 thousand) of potential tax assets were not recognised. these related to cumulative unused
tax loss carryforwards of € 72,412 thousand (prior year: € 66,306 thousand). of the unused tax loss carryforwards,
€ 25,568 thousand (prior year: € 18,606 thousand) can be carried forward indefinitely, € 20,851 thousand (prior year:
€ 0) expire in two to four years, € 17,020 thousand (prior year: € 38,734 thousand) expire in five to seven years and
€ 8,973 thousand (prior year: € 8,966 thousand) expire in the 2017 calendar year.

at the balance sheet date the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised directly in equity amounted to a net asset
of € 7,198 thousand (prior year: € 6,396 thousand).

for temporary differences on investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax liabilities of € 191,574 thousand (prior year:
€ 193,502 thousand) were not recognised, as these gains are intended to be reinvested for an indeﬁnite period and

█ intangible assets consist largely of goodwill, capitalised in accordance with ifrs 3, that resulted from the acquisi-                •
tion of companies. intangibles also include acquired customer relationships, software, patents and similar rights,                     •

█ of the total carrying amount of goodwill, the sugar segment accounted for € 20,111 thousand (prior year:                             •
€ 20,111 thousand), the starch segment for € 1,606 thousand (prior year: € 1,606 thousand) and the fruit segment for
€ 204,485 thousand (prior year: € 204,459 thousand).

█  to satisfy the provisions of ifrs 3 in conjunction with ias 36 and to allow the calculation of any impairment of                    •
goodwill, agrana has deﬁned its cash-generating units to match its internal reporting structure. the cash-generating                   •
units in the agrana group are the sugar segment, starch segment and fruit segment, consistent with the internal                        •
management accounting and reporting processes. all goodwill was allocated to cash-generating units.                                    •
                                                                                                                                       •
█ to test for impairment, the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit is measured by allocating to it the corre-                  •
sponding assets and liabilities, inclusive of attributable goodwill and other intangible assets. impairment is recognised              •
in profit or loss when the recoverable amount (value in use) of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount                •
inclusive of goodwill.                                                                                                                 •

█ in testing for impairment, agrana uses a discounted cash flow method to determine the value in use of the                            •
cash-generating units. the determination of expected cash ﬂows from each cash-generating unit is based on business
plans that are validated and approved by supervisory board committees and have a planning horizon of ﬁve years.
projections beyond a ﬁve-year horizon are based on the assumption of a constant, inﬂation-induced growth rate                         •
of 1.5% per year (assumption in the prior year: 1.5%). the cost of capital (wacc) is calculated as the weighted average                •
cost of equity and debt capital for each cgu.                                                                                          •

█ the cost of equity is based on a risk-free rate, a return premium for the business risk, and a premium for country                   •
risk and inflation differential. the spot rate of a 30-year zero coupon bond, based on deutsche bundesbank data,                       •
was used as the risk-free rate of return. business risk is represented by the product of a general market risk premium                 •
                                                                                                                                      127
of 6.5% (prior year: 5.75%) and a beta factor derived from a peer group of nine companies. the country risk and the                    •
inflation differential are assigned a volatility factor of 1.5 (prior year: 1.0).                                                      •

█ the cost of debt capital is calculated as the risk-free rate plus the country risk premium, the inflation differential,              •
and the credit spread determined by reference to the capital market.                                                                   •

█ the quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis.

the insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan. projections of value
in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends. value
in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for
the regional markets.

█ the amounts by which the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying amounts were subjected to a sensitivity

analysis. the results are presented on page 117. the goodwill is not tax-deductible.

             capital management at agrana means the management of equity and of net debt. by optimising these two measures,
             the company seeks to achieve the best possible shareholder returns. in addition to the equity ratio, the most import-
             ant control variable is the gearing ratio (net debt divided by total equity). the total cost of equity and debt capital
             employed and the risks associated with the different types of capital are continuously monitored.

             the sound equity base gives agrana strategic ﬂexibility and also demonstrates the group’s ﬁnancial stability
             and independence. in addition to its self-ﬁnancing ability, agrana also has access to high, committed credit lines
             for its overall ﬁnancing needs.

             the approach to capital management was unchanged from the prior year.

a discount rate of 1.8% (prior year: 1.4%) was used in almost all cases in the determination of the provisions for                    •
pensions and termination beneﬁts. the discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds with a                       •

deﬁned beneﬁt plans
pension plans in the agrana group are based largely on direct deﬁned beneﬁt commitments. the amounts of                               •
the pension beneﬁts are usually determined by length of service and pensionable pay. termination beneﬁt plans exist                    •
mainly as a result of legal requirements or of obligations under collective agreements and the beneﬁts represent                       •
one-time, lump sum payments. the amount of the termination beneﬁts typically depends on ﬁnal pay and length                            •
of service.                                                                                                                            •

the expense for the unwinding of discount on beneﬁts accrued in prior years, less the return on plan assets, is
included within net ﬁnancial items. the current service cost is included in staff costs. the change in actuarial gains
of the pension and termination benefit provisions, which is recognised directly in equity, was an increase of
€ 3,225 thousand (prior year: losses with a decrease of € 17,261 thousand). the change resulted primarily from the
higher discount rate and from experience adjustments concerning factors such as expected retirement age, wage and
salary growth rates and assumed employee turnover rates. as of 29 february 2016, net cumulative actuarial losses
of € 35,037 thousand (prior year: net losses of € 38,261 thousand) had been offset against retained earnings, not
taking into account deferred taxes.

the experience adjustments reﬂect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement
in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year. such differences
arise, especially, from actual rates of wage and salary increases, changes in pension beneﬁts, employee turnover and
biometric variables such as disability and mortality.


composition of plan assets
the plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension beneﬁt insurance
policies. the fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide, at all times, full coverage of the payment obliga-
tions arising from the respective beneﬁt plans. the plan assets include neither ﬁnancial instruments issued by the
group nor owner-occupied property.

at the balance sheet date the plan assets were invested in the following asset categories:

             deﬁned benefit plans are associated with various risks for the agrana group. besides general actuarial risks such                         •
             as discount rate risk and longevity risk, these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial                          •

             (early departures). risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks, credit risks and investment risks.                 •
             other risks lie in exchange rate ﬂuctuation and changes in inﬂation rates.                                                                •

             the rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate. if the actual rate of return on plan assets is                   •
             less than the discount rate used, the respective net liability increases. the net liability is particularly strongly inﬂuenced            •
             by the discount rate, with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability. a further
             decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities that can only be off set
             to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets.                                            •

             potential inﬂation risks that may lead to an increase in the deﬁned benefit obligations lie, indirectly, in inﬂation-driven               •

            the provisions for uncertain liabilities included, among other items, provisions for litigation risks of € 11,744 thou-
            sand (prior year: € 8,481 thousand), for costs of beet receiving, loading and storage of € 2,165 thousand (prior year:
            € 2,771 thousand) and for onerous contracts of € 4,189 thousand (prior year: € 11,687 thousand).

            most of the non-current other provisions of € 19,999 thousand (prior year: € 14,879 thousand) represented provisions
            of € 10,150 thousand for long-service awards (prior year: € 10,048 thousand). these are payable under local company
            agreements or collective agreements and are based on length of service. phased-retirement provisions of € 736 thou-
            sand (prior year: € 965 thousand) are expected to be used in outflows of funds in the next one to three years.
            for the majority of the non-current provisions of € 7,173 thousand (prior year: € 2,754 thousand) for recultivation,
            an outflow of funds is likely to occur in more than five years.

bank loans and overdrafts (excluding finance leases) and amounts due to affiliated companies of the südzucker
group amounted to € 531,024 thousand (prior year: € 628,965 thousand). the reduction compared with the prior year
resulted primarily from the repayment of a loan tranche of € 85,000 thousand to südzucker ag, mannheim,
germany.

the weighted average interest rate paid on these credits was 1.95% (prior year: 1.98%), with a remaining maturity
of 1.6 years (prior year: 1.9 years).

these borrowings are covered by credit line limits of € 952,627 thousand (prior year: € 1,007,724 thousand). the
weighted average remaining maturity of the credit lines at the balance sheet date was 2.6 years (prior year: 3.0 years).

the credit funding of the agrana group consists primarily of two syndicated credit lines totalling € 450,000 thou-
sand at the balance sheet date (prior year: € 450,000 thousand), a schuldscheindarlehen (bonded loan) of
€ 126,000 thousand (prior year: € 126,000 thousand) and a financing from südzucker ag, mannheim, germany, in
the amount of € 165,000 thousand (prior year: € 250,000 thousand). the other credit lines are bilateral ones.

the fixed interest portion of bank loans and overdrafts and amounts due to affiliated companies was € 200,149 thou-
sand (prior year: € 251,067 thousand). the fair values (i. e., market values) of the variable rate bank loans and over-
drafts are equivalent to their carrying amounts. at the balance sheet date, € 0 (prior year: € 809 thousand) of
bank loans and overdrafts were secured by mortgage liens and € 7,800 thousand (prior year: € 7,900 thousand) were
secured by other liens.

cash and cash equivalents decreased by € 84,443 thousand from the prior year to a new total of € 109,375 thousand.
in addition, securities in the amount of € 45 thousand (prior year: € 46 thousand) were held as current assets; these
were categorised as held-for-trading.

the currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year;
the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to four years.

the notional amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges, translated into euros as the group
currency.

the fair value of a derivative is the amount which the agrana group would have to pay or would receive at the
balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position. as the hedging transactions
involve only standardised, fungible financial instruments, fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market
prices.

fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows (cash flow hedges) are initially recognised
directly in equity. only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss. at
29 february 2016 there were cash flow hedges with positive fair values of € 1,748 thousand (prior year: € 588 thousand)
and cash flow hedges with negative fair values of 5,688 thousand (prior year: € 69 thousand).

in the financial year, € 588 thousand (prior year: € 185 thousand) was reclassified to the income statement and
the ineffective portion (amounting to € 284 thousand) of cash flow hedges was recognised in profit for the period
(prior year: € 0).

the value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised
in profit or loss. the hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for
the juice activities, and to hedge sales contracts in the sugar segment.

10.3. additional disclosures on financial instruments

carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments
set out in the table below are the carrying amounts and fair values of the group’s financial assets and liabilities,
both by individual item type and by measurement category. the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for
which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length
transaction.

the table below also shows how the fair values were determined, broken down by category of financial instrument.
the fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based
on quoted market data:

the three levels were defined as follows:

█   level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices
    quoted for the exact instrument on an active market (i. e., these prices are used without adjustment or change in
    composition).
█   in level 2, the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market
    for similar assets or liabilities, or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on
    observable market data.
█   level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation
    techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data.


the fair value of level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and
the underlying currencies’ interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity. the mark-to-market price is
determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction. the input factors for this are the reference
rates of the ecb (daily fixing) or selected national central banks, and the daily euribor and libor/ibor rates.

for level 2 interest rate derivatives, the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with
the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity. the fair value is obtained
from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions.

are based on the reference rates published by the ecb or the national central banks. in some cases, as a result                       •
of differences in interest rates, the fair values determined by the group may differ to an insignificant extent from the              •
fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations.

for trade payables and current financial other payables, it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the                      •
fair values equal the carrying amounts. the fair value of fixed interest liabilities is calculated as the present value               •
of expected future cash flows. for variable rate liabilities, the fair value equals the carrying amount.                              •

10.4. risk management in the agrana group
the agrana group is exposed to market price risks through changes in exchange rates, interest rates and security
prices. in the group’s operating activities, price risks arise largely from the costs of raw materials (mainly sugar
beet, sugar purchased in the world market, grains, potatoes, and fruit) and energy, and from selling prices of sugar,
starch, ethanol and fruit products. in addition, the group is exposed to credit risks, associated especially with trade
receivables.

agrana uses an integrated system for the early identification and monitoring of risks relevant to the group. the
group’s proven approach to risk management is guided by the aim of balancing risks and returns. the group’s
risk culture is characterised by risk-aware behaviour, clearly defined responsibilities, independent risk control, and
the implementation of internal control systems.

agrana regards the responsible management of business risks and opportunities as an important part of sustain-
able, value-driven corporate governance. risk management thus forms an integral part of the entire planning,
management and reporting process and is directed by the management board. the parent company and all
subsidiaries employ risk management systems that are tailored to their respective operating activity. the systems’
purpose is the methodical identification, assessment, control and documenting of risks.

in a three-pronged approach, risk management at the agrana group is based on risk control at the operational
level, on strategic control of group companies by the group, and on an internal monitoring system delivered by
the group’s internal audit department. in addition, emerging trends that could develop into threats to the viability
of the agrana group as a going concern are identified and analysed at an early stage and continually re-evaluated
as part of the risk management process.


credit risk
credit risk is the risk of an economic loss as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its payment obligations.
credit risk includes both the risk of a deterioration in customers’ or other counterparties’ credit quality, and the risk
of their immediate default.

the trade receivables of the agrana group are largely with the food, chemical and retail industries. credit risk in
respect of trade receivables is managed on the basis of internal standards and guidelines. thus, a credit analysis
is generally conducted for new customers. the group also uses credit insurance and security such as bank guarantees.

for the residual risk from trade receivables, the group establishes provisions for impairment.

the net carrying amount of trade receivables after provisions for impairment is determined as follows:

liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that a company will not be able to meet its financial obligations when due or in sufficient
measure.

the agrana group generates liquidity with its business operations and from external financing. the funds are used
to fund working capital, investment and business acquisitions.

in order to ensure the group’s solvency at all times and safeguard its financial flexibility, a liquidity reserve
is maintained in the form of credit lines and, to the extent necessary, of cash.

to manage the seasonally fluctuating cash flows, both short-term and long-term finance is raised in the course
of day-to-day financial management.

the following maturity profile shows the effects of the cash outflows from liabilities as at 29 february 2016 on the
group’s liquidity situation. all cash outflows are undiscounted.

the group’s international business operations expose agrana to foreign exchange risks from financing and financial
investment as well as from trade receivables and trade payables. to measure and control these risks, the agrana
group uses value-at-risk based on the variance-covariance approach at a 95% confidence level. this involves the
measurement of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the correlations between                        •
them. the result is stated as the diversified var from currencies and is analysed by borrowings and operating business:                    •

most of the group’s foreign exchange risk arises in the operating business, when revenues or costs are denomi-
nated in a currency other than that of the related costs or revenues, respectively. the foreign currency positions of
€ 63,445 thousand (prior year: € 91,000 thousand) in the operating activities were mainly in mexico, the czech
republic, romania, russia, ukraine and hungary, as well as a us dollar position in the euro area, and represented
a value-at-risk of € 5,459 thousand (prior year: € 6,804 thousand).

the agrana group’s currency risk from financing arises from borrowings and financial investments not denomi-
nated in the local currency of the respective company. the foreign currency positions from financing amounted to
€ 143,715 thousand (prior year: € 217,750 thousand), with a value-at-risk of € 9,959 thousand (prior year: € 13,418 thou-
sand) and pertained largely to brazil, china, mexico, romania, russia, ukraine and hungary for financings in euros
and us dollars.

in the sugar segment, group companies based in the european union whose local currency is not the euro are
exposed to sugar-regime-induced foreign exchange risk between the euro and their respective local currency, as the
beet prices for a given campaign are set in euros eu-wide. the subsidiaries in romania and hungary are subject
to additional currency risk from raw sugar purchases in us dollars, and some companies are exposed to currency risk
from sales of non-quota sugar in us dollars.

agrana’s business activities expose it to market price risk from purchases of commodities and the sale of finished                   •
products (ethanol). this is particularly true in the production of bioethanol, where the most important cost factors by
far are the prices of the main inputs, corn and wheat. to a lesser but still significant extent, the sugar segment has
exposure to the purchase prices of raw sugar.
                                                                                                                                    •

legal risks
agrana continually monitors changes in the legal setting relevant to its businesses that may lead to a risk situa-
tion, and takes risk management actions as necessary. this applies particularly to compliance matters and food and
environmental legislation; the group maintains dedicated staff positions for these areas.

there are currently no pending or threatened civil actions against companies of the agrana group that could have
a material impact on the group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

as noted in previous annual reports, the austrian federal competition authority in 2010 sought a fine under an
antitrust case for alleged competition-restricting arrangements with respect to austria filed against agrana zucker
gmbh, vienna, and südzucker ag, mannheim, germany. to date the cartel court has not ruled on the case. agrana
continues to regard the allegation as unfounded and the fine sought as unwarranted.

a further contingent liability of € 6,425 thousand (prior year: € 6,600 thousand) related to a claim for recovery

unlike the prior-year annual report, transactions with the other owners of the joint ventures are not reported.

in addition, at the balance sheet date, borrowings from related parties amounted to € 220,470 thousand (prior year:
€ 353,403 thousand); these borrowings were on normal commercial terms. of this total, € 130,000 thousand repre-
sented non-current borrowings (prior year: € 130,000 thousand).

for fully consolidated subsidiaries, the group issued guarantees in favour of companies with significant influence
of € 5,000 thousand (prior year: € 17,958 thousand), of which an amount of € 1,022 thousand (prior year: € 9,345 thou-
sand) was utilised.

the remuneration of the members of the management board of agrana beteiligungs-ag totalled € 3,183 thousand
(prior year: € 3,365 thousand), consisting of total fixed base salaries of € 1,445 thousand (prior year: € 1,693 thousand)
and a total performance-based, variable component of € 1,738 thousand (prior year: € 1,672 thousand). the perfor-
mance-based elements of the compensation are linked to the amount of the dividend payable for the last three
financial years. the management board member of agrana beteiligungs-ag appointed on the basis of the syndicate
agreement between südzucker ag, mannheim, germany, and zucker-beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.h, vienna, does
not receive compensation for serving on the management board.

on 3 july 2015 the annual general meeting approved an annual aggregate remuneration for the supervisory board
of € 250 thousand (prior year: € 250 thousand) and delegated to the supervisory board chairman the responsibility
for allocating this sum. the amount paid to the individual supervisory board members is tied to their function on the
board. no meeting fees were paid in the year under review.

post-employment benefits granted to the management board members johann marihart and fritz gattermayer and
the former management board member walter grausam under the company’s plan are pension, disability insurance
and survivor benefits. the pension becomes available when the pension eligibility criteria of the austrian public
pension scheme (asvg) are met. the amount of the pension is calculated as a percentage of a contractually agreed
assessment base. in the event of early retirement within asvg rules, the amount of the pension is reduced. for
the pension of stephan büttner, there is a defined contribution obligation, which can be claimed after the recipient
has reached 55 years of age if the employment contract is terminated by the employer. for the 2015|16 financial year,
pension fund contributions of € 720 thousand were paid (prior year: € 2,955 thousand).

the retirement benefit obligations in respect of the management board are administered by an external pension
fund. in the balance sheet at 29 february 2016, within the item “retirement and termination benefit obligations”, an
amount of € 6,646 thousand was recognised for pension obligations (prior year: € 8,058 thousand) and an amount
of € 1,986 thousand was recognised for termination benefit obligations (prior year: € 1,906 thousand).

in the event that a management board appointment is withdrawn, there are severance pay obligations in accordance
with the provisions of the employees act or the occupational pension plan act.

information on the management board and supervisory board is provided on page 158.

                report on the consolidated financial statements
                we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of agrana beteiligungs-
                aktiengesellschaft, vienna, that comprise the consolidated statement of financial position
                as of 29 february 2016, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of cash
                flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the fiscal year then ended, and
                the notes.


                management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
                the company’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these
                consolidated financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards
                (ifrss) as adopted by the eu, and the additional requirements pursuant to section 245a ugb
                (austrian commercial code) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary
                to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
                whether due to fraud or error.


                auditor’s responsibility
                our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
                our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with austrian standards on auditing. those
                standards require that we comply with international standards on auditing – isa. in accordance
                with international standards on auditing, we are required to comply with ethical requirements
                and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
                financial statements are free from material misstatement

                an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclo-
                sures in the consolidated financial statements. the procedures selected depend on our judgment,
                including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
                statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, we consider internal
                control relevant to the group’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
                statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
                not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control.
                an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
                reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
                presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

                we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
                basis for our audit opinion.

                                                                                           independent auditor’s report      163

isoglucose: isoglucose, a liquid, is a sweetener based
on starch that has been converted to sugar. at a fructose
content of 42%, it has the same sweetness as sugar
and is therefore used as a sugar substitute. the fructose
content can be raised to as much as 55% through further
process stages. isoglucose is manufactured from grains,
especially corn.

        forward-looking statements
        this annual report contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions and estimates made by the
        management board of agrana beteiligungs-ag. although these assumptions, plans and projections represent the manage-
        ment board’s current intentions and best knowledge, a large number of internal and external factors may cause actual future
        developments and results to differ materially from these assumptions and estimates. some examples of such factors are,
        without limitation: negotiations concerning world trade agreements; changes in the overall economic environment, especially
        in macroeconomic variables such as exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; eu sugar policy; consumer behaviour;
        and public policy related to food and energy. agrana beteiligungs-ag does not guarantee in any way that the actual future
        developments and actual future results achieved will match the assumptions and estimates expressed or made in this
        annual report, and does not accept any liability in the event that assumptions and estimates prove to be incorrect.

        in the interest of readability, this document may occasionally use language that is not gender-neutral. any gender-specific
        references should be understood to include masculine, feminine and neuter as the context permits.

        as a result of the standard round-half-up convention used in rounding individual amounts and percentages, this report
        may contain minor, immaterial rounding errors.

        no liability is assumed for misprints, typographical or similar errors.

        the english translation of the agrana annual report is solely for readers’ convenience and is not definitive. in the event
        of discrepancy or dispute, only the german-language version shall govern.
