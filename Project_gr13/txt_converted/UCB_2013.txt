in 2012, a new reporting tool has been selected, developed                                                (million megajoules)
and rolled-out by our teams of corporate health, safety
& environment and corporate societal responsibility. this
new tool will allow for a more precise and proactive data                1600
management as most of the data will be reported and                      1400
validated on a monthly basis while they previously were                  1200
reported on a semester basis. in 2012, we tested the tool
                                                                         1000

although energy consumption is very much linked to our
production volumes, most of our manufacturing sites are
developing energy savings plans. these plans resulted in an
energy saving of almost 35.5 million mega joules.
the most important individual energy saving was
realized at the manufacturing plant in shannon (ireland)                                            water consumption
where the elimination of the thermal oxidation unit’s                                                            (million m3)
plume suppression resulted in an energy saving of
13.5 million mega joules. in the past, steam was added to
the process in order to suppress a visible plume.

ucb in 2012 has reduced with 8 %. this reduction is partly
linked to the reduced level of activities at the site in monheim
(germany) where the consumption of water was almost                        0

3.4.3 | waste


waste management (tons)
our waste is mostly generated by our production sites.
compared to 2011, we see a decrease of 4% in total waste.
more important is the fact that the ratio of recovered waste                                        waste management
also keeps improving. in 2012, 91% of the waste generated                                                             (tons)
by ucb was recovered. in 2010 and 2011, this ratio was
respectively 86% and 89%. this recovery is mainly organized
by incineration of the waste with energy recuperation, by                 14000
re-using the waste as a secondary liquid fuel or by having third          12000
