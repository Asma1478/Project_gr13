we are happy to publish our first sustainability report which presents our sustainability performance from
1st april, 2016 up to 31st march, 2017. this report delineates data and information along with our plans for
the future, across the economic, environmental and social pillars of sustainability in resonance with our
philosophy ‘aapki jeet. hamari jeet’. we have been practising sustainability for 70 years and have now
embarked on the journey of reporting our sustainability performance. going forward we intend to disclose
our sustainability performance on an annual basis.

this report is prepared ‘in - accordance’ - core option of the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 guidelines. in
doing so we have applied the four principles of stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality
and completeness for defining the report content and methodologies in its development. it details our
performance on the triple bottom line (economic, environment and social) and includes the issues found
to be material based on the interactions with various stakeholder groups of ashok leyland limited. the
report is also mapped to the nine principles of the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental
and economic (nvg-see) responsibilities of business in india issued by the ministry of corporate affairs and
complies to the securities and exchange board of india (listing obligations and disclosure requirements)
regulations, 2015 on “business responsibility reporting” (brr), regulation 34. the data reported on
economic performance is based on audited financial statements by the company’s auditors.

the report boundary extends to our operations in india to include the sites of hosur (units 1 and 2), ennore,
bhandara, alwar, pantnagar and vellivoyal chavadi (vvc), north chennai and our corporate office. we
have 24 subsidiaries, 7 associate companies and 2 joint venture companies as on march 31, 2017. however
sustainability performance of our subsidiaries, joint ventures and supply chain partners will be evaluated
for inclusion in future reports as we are in the process of developing the systems for making qualitative
and quantitative disclosures for the identified material aspects as applicable to our subsidiaries and joint
ventures.

we have identified and prioritised our key stakeholders and have established a positive dialogue with them
to identify our material issues which have significant impact on our business and stakeholders. this report
contains a disclosure on management approach (dma) for every material aspect identified during our
stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment process. these dma’s are disclosed in appropriate
sections of the report. key facts and figures regarding sustainability related data for sites within the reporting
scope have been disclosed as per the issues identified in the relevant sections.

the report includes forward-looking statements based on certain assumptions and management plans. in
the report, these statements have been identified by words such as ‘intend’, ‘anticipate’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’,
‘project’, ‘plan’, etc., as far as possible. should they materialise, the achievement of the projections is subject
to risks and uncertainties.

to ensure consistency and completeness in our disclosures, the contents of this report and performance
data has been verified by a third party. in financial year (fy) 2016-17, authenticity of data, information and
conformance of ‘in accordance’ – core option of reporting has been verified by dnv gl business assurance
india private limited. the assurance has been conducted as per isae 3000 (revised) and the statement
provided by dnv gl business assurance india private limited, is included in the report. they have verified
the report for a selected set of economic, environment and social performance related key indicators.

message from the chairman
                                         i am happy to present to you this sustainability report for
                                         the fy 2016-17.

                                         over the years, ashok leyland has played a key role in
                                         the transportation needs of the country. we have been
                                         benchmarking our products and solutions against global
                                         standards of technology and quality. sustainability has
                                         been at the core of our corporate strategy. it is our strong
                                         belief that economic growth and resource conservation are
                                         complementary goals to support sustainable development.

                                         the automotive industry has footprints across all three
                                         pillars of sustainability, namely economic, environmental
                                         and social. for long term sustainability, a company needs
to function in a manner that meets the evolving needs of all its stakeholders in a fair and equitable
manner. we recognise that sound environmental and safety management, managing aspirations of
our workforce, building mutual trust and understanding with our customers and channel partners,
and maintaining cordial harmonious relationship with the community, are imperatives for our
business sustainability. in fy 2016-17, we have made progressive advancements across all the three
pillars.

on the economic front, through appropriate product and market actions we have been consistently
improving our market presence, growing our revenues and profitability and expect to maintain the
momentum in the years to follow. on the social aspect, our corporate social responsibility (csr)
initiatives address education, environment, health and road safety. on the environment front, we are
focused on implementing energy, waste and emission reducing initiatives constantly endeavoring to
reduce our environmental impact. we address the impact of climate change across the value chain
and remain committed to reducing the environmental footprint across our operations and products
throughout their life cycle.

last year, our bhandara unit won the ‘front runner award in sustainability 4.0 awards - 2017’
competition organised by frost & sullivan and the energy and resources institute. our manufacturing
facility in pantnagar was awarded the coveted deming prize for implementation of total quality
management.

i believe ashok leyland is making steady progress in the path of sustainable growth in a wholesome
manner while being fully committed to bettering our environment and the quality of life of all our
stakeholders.

i hope you find the report interesting. thank you.
yours sincerely,




dheeraj g hinduja

message from the managing director
                                    it is with great pleasure that i present to you ashok leyland’s sustainability report for the year
                                    fy 2016-17. this report details our overall triple bottom-line performance in the context of
                                    economic, social, and environmental sustainability. sustainability has always been an integral
                                    part of ashok leyland’s corporate ethos and business strategy. the future of ashok leyland, can
                                    only be secured by our ability to deliver value to our stakeholders and the society in which we
                                    operate.

                                    ashok leyland is fully committed to performance excellence across all spheres of its business
                                    activities addressing concerns such as consumption of resources, pollution, and more importantly
                                    giving back to the societies in which we operate. the focus areas for reporting the current year’s
                                    performance include our business performance, environmental performance, customer and
                                    employee satisfaction, and community service.

under business performance we had initiatives like prism which were designed to address concerns of customers in a speedy and
responsive manner and spark which enabled customers get right spare-parts within a reasonable time and cost.

environmental concerns would mould the way businesses are run in the coming years. the global risks report by world economic
forum for the year 2016 lists the issues of ‘failure of climate change mitigation and adaption’, ‘extreme weather events’, ‘water
crisis’, ‘energy price shock’ as the top ten risks in terms of impact on societies. to play our part in mitigating these risks, we
at ashok leyland are focused on a `green approach’. we have initiated several measures in adding green cover across our
manufacturing plants, water harvesting, recycling, and introducing alternative sources of energy such as solar power.

we also had the unveiling of ‘circuit series’ of transport buses which are india’s first indigenous electric bus, and the launch of
‘iegr’ (intelligent exhaust gas recirculation), a cost effective solution to address bs-iv requirements.

in community service, we take pride in our csr programme called ‘road to school’, which saw ashok leyland adopt nearly 108
schools in tamil nadu in supporting their infrastructural needs and ashok leyland employees volunteering in teaching at these
schools. our blessing scheme (ashirwaad yojana) started in collaboration with the government of uttarakhand and training
partner nttf, with the objective to enhance skills and employability of local communities has become a benchmark for the industry.

the above initiatives not only contribute to the well-being of societies in which we operate, but also make sound business sense.
it is in this context that we have started reporting our overall sustainability, by proactively disclosing the details and results of our
efforts across the three pillars of sustainability.

our reporting journey started last year with an internally circulated sustainability report. this is our first published sustainability
report and conforms to ‘in accordance’ - core option developed by the global reporting initiative (gri). going forward we aim to
move towards reporting as per gri standards.

ashok leyland is committed to sustainability in all facets of its business which is aligned with our brand and corporate philosophy
of “aapki jeet. hamari jeet” (in your success, lies our success) i would like to take this opportunity to thank all our stakeholders
for their ongoing support, and look forward to ideas and suggestions for further enhancing value.

     head on and tackling the issues by optimising our energy
     demand. our cutting edge technology has not only helped us
     to reduce our energy needs and greenhouse gas emissions but
     has also helped our customers to reduce the same.

     we continuously work towards managing our energy needs
     sustainably and improve energy efficiency. our energy needs
     are met by a mix of renewable and non-renewable sources
     of energy. renewable sources include wind energy and non-
     renewables are high speed diesel (hsd), compressed natural
     gas (cng), liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) and grid electricity.

     in fy 2016-17, we consumed 3,42,708 gj of total direct energy
     (hsd, cng and lpg) and 4,01,291 gj of indirect energy from
     grid electricity. our overall energy intensity for fy 2016-17 was
     reported as 5.25 gj/ hecu4 which is 7% less than fy 2015-16.

     we have introduced various initiatives to conserve our energy
     through conventional sources and improve energy efficiency.
     through our various initiatives, we have conserved 16,633 gj
     of energy in the reporting year.

     climate change due to human energy intensive activities have
     created a real challenge and thus work needs to be done to
     address such risks on global scale. we must create solutions
     that help in reducing the adverse effects and helped to achieve
     our environmental goals without undermining the growth of

     we believe that elimination of waste is an effective way to
     enhance profitability. we take all required efforts to eliminate
     waste generation at source and ensure that the waste generated
     from our operations is disposed off in an environmentally
     sound manner following regulatory norms.


     spill management

     operations and it is our endeavor to ensure zero spills.
     in this regard, we undertake several measures to avoid
     spills and during the reporting period there were no
     incidences of significant spills across our operations.

our organisation to be as efficient as possible, effective staffing,
forecasting the hiring requirements, retaining workforce and
ensuring their work-life balance is indispensable. hence, as a

for ashok leyland. our efforts are directed towards hiring and
retaining the best talent in the industry by providing them with
an environment that supports their personal and professional
prosperity. our hr vision is “to build and sustain an agile,

our strategies in alignment with our vision and undertake several
initiatives for talent acquisition and management. we periodically
review our existing systems and look forward to modification for
improvement.

one of our key initiatives involves collaboration with institutes
for building long-term relations through identification of campus
ambassadors. in order to motivate our management staff to
perform at their full potential, we initiated the emerging leaders
program in 2008 which was revamped last year and our first
batch graduated in march 2016. we have implemented sap sf

enhancing the onboarding experience of new joiners:
this year we undertook a survey to improve the onboarding           in the near future we wish to publicly recognise and applaud
experience of new joiners. we realised that the incoming high       employees receiving maximum appreciation-celebrating positive
potential talent has a tendency to get disengaged due to a lack
of a defined process for onboarding. when a new employee
enters a company with little or no experience, it greatly impacts
both the business and the employee themselves. since we
invest greatly in hiring, we acknowledge the need to support
new joiners with a formal onboarding process. post the survey,
actions were defined and implemented to enhance the process
and we observed a significant improvement in the responses of
new joiners. the respondents of this survey were employees
who have completed a tenure of less than 6 months.

     road to school
     one of our most widespread programmes is the road to school
     programme. currently we have a total of 15,155 students enrolled
     under the programme. the objective of this programme is to
     improve the access to quality education while simultaneously
     providing necessary support for skill development, training and
     health of students. we have implemented this programme across
     six blocks surrounding our plants in chennai, hosur; puzhal,
     minjur, anchetty, shoolagiri, natrampalayam and thaggatty. we
     continue to maintain our successful partnership with learning
     links foundation (llf) to conduct various academic, co-curricular
     and extra-curricular activities.

     through our initiatives we have focused on improving the
     learning in the following subject areas viz. tamil, english, math,
     social studies and science. in order to ensure our impacts are
     measureable, we conducted baseline tests for all the students
     enrolled in the programme.

     we focus on providing holistic education to students by engaging
     in fun ways of learning. we believe that holistic education
     provides well-balanced paths for children to be prepared to
     face challenges along with continuous academic progress. we
     organise sport activities and competitions, science fairs, arts and
     crafts, rhymes recitation, storytelling, spelling bee, poster making,
     math competitions and motivational talks for the children in an
     effort to imbibe the culture of all-round learning. we also conduct
     remedial support classes for differently abled students to ensure
     their learning levels are continuously improving. we also give them
     practical training to visit banks, post offices, govt hospitals etc.

     we also ensure that the impacts of our programme are
     constantly improving by scheduling management review visits
     by senior officials to the schools. the officials interact with the
     children on various topics and cross check their learning levels,
     in addition to end-line assessments at the end of academic year.

     following are the highlights of the key outcomes of the initiative:
     •• in the phase-2 of the first year of the project
        implementation learning improvement increases of 29%
        in natrampalayam, 34% in thaggatty, 40% in minjur and
        35% in puzhal, 17% anchetty and 14.5% shoolagiri cluster
        were observed in comparison to the baseline assessments
        conducted in july, 2016.

     •• a reading skill improvement of 67% in minjur and 59% in
        puzhal was observed.

     •• sixty-seven children in hosur and thirty-five children in
        chennai, who had previously dropped out from school, were
        brought back to attend routine classes.

    the sustainability report
                    2016 –17    69

assurance
statement

                                                 independent assurance statement


scope and approach
dnv gl business assurance india private limited (‘dnv gl’) has been commissioned by ashok leyland limited (‘ashok leyland’ or
‘the company’) to undertake an independent limited level of assurance of the company’s sustainability report 2016-17 in its printed
format (the ‘report’) for the financial year ended 31st march’ 2017 based on international standard on assurance engagements
3000 (isae 3000) revised*. the management of company is responsible for all information provided in the report as well as the
processes for collecting, analyzing and reporting the information presented in the printed report. the intended users of this assurance
statement are the management of the company. our assurance engagement was planned and carried out from may to july’ 2017.


we performed our work using dnv gl’s assurance methodology verisustaintm1, which is based on our professional experience,
international assurance best practice including international standard on assurance engagements 3000 (isae 3000) revised and the
global reporting initiative (gri) sustainability reporting guidelines.


the sustainability performance disclosure in scope was the verification of the qualitative and quantitative information on sustainability
performance disclosed in the report covering economic, environmental and social performance of the activities undertaken by the
company over the reporting period 1st april’ 2016 to 31st march’ 2017 and based on the global reporting initiative g4 sustainability
reporting guidelines (gri g4) for ‘in accordance’ – core option of reporting. we evaluated the sustainability performance disclosures
including reported data using gri g4 principles on defining report content and the reliability principle together with the company’s
data protocols on how the data are measured, recorded and reported to arrive at the conclusion.


we understand that the reported financial data and information including csr expenditure are based on company’s annual report
and accounts dated 31st march’ 2017, which are subject to a separate independent audit process. the review of accuracy financial
data taken from the annual report and accounts is not within the scope of our work.


we planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence that we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance
opinion. we are providing a ‘limited level’ of assurance and no external stakeholders were interviewed as part of this assurance
engagement. a ‘high level’ of assurance would have required additional work at group and site level to gain further evidence to
support the basis of our assurance opinion.


responsibilities of the directors of company and of the assurance providers
the directors of ashok leyland limited have sole responsibility for the preparation of the report. in performing our assurance
work, our responsibility is to the management of the company; however, our statement represents our independent opinion and is
intended to inform stakeholders of the company. dnv gl was not involved in the preparation of any statements or data included in
the report except for this assurance statement. this is the first year that we have provided assurance of the report.

 the verisustain protocol is available on www.dnvgl.com
* assurance engagements other than audits and reviews of historical financial information

dnv gl’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the client to us as part of
our review have been provided in good faith. dnv gl expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person
or an entity may make based on this assurance statement.


basis of our opinion
a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability and assurance specialists performed work at corporate office at chennai and sample
sites. we undertook the following activities:
•• review of the current sustainability issues that could affect the company and are of interest to identified stakeholders;
•• review of management approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs although we have no direct engagement
   with stakeholders;
•• review of information provided to us by management team on its reporting and management processes relating to the gri
   g4 content principles;
•• interviews with selected directors and senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues and review of
   selected evidence to support issues discussed. we were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall
   responsibility for the programmes to deliver the group sustainability objectives for medium and long term vision.
•• site visits were conducted at manufacturing locations at hosur -2 (including visit to social project), ennore and research
   and development centre at vellivoyalchavadi at chennai, tamil nadu to review process and systems for preparing site level
   sustainability data and implementation of sustainability strategy. we were free to choose the sites we visited and they were
   selected on the basis of their materiality to the group for sustainability impacts;
•• offsite review of supporting evidence for key claims and data in the report. our verification processes were prioritised
   according to materiality and we based our prioritisation on the materiality of issues at a consolidated corporate level;
•• review of the processes for gathering and consolidating the specified performance data and, for a sample, checking the data
   consolidation; and
•• an independent assessment of reporting against the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 guidelines, ‘in accordance’ – core
   option of reporting.


during the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement except that
the verification was limited to data and information disclosed for the reporting year 2016-17.


opinion
on the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the report together with referenced information
does not properly describe adherence to gri g4 reporting requirements i.e. content principles, general standard disclosure and
specific standard disclosures as below:


a. general standard disclosures: the report together with references to annual report describes company’s responses to general
standard disclosures.
b. specific standard disclosures: the report describes the generic disclosures on management approach (dma) and performance
indicators for identified material aspects as below:

economic
•• economic performance – g4-ec1;
•• procurement practices - g4-ec9;

•• product and service labelling – g4-pr5;
•• customer privacy – g4-pr8;
•• compliance – g4-pr9.

observations
without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations. we have evaluated the report’s adherence to
the following principles on a scale of ‘good’, ‘acceptable’ and ‘needs improvement’:

stakeholder inclusiveness:
the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability.


the stakeholder engagement process is well established to identify sustainability challenges and concerns of diverse stakeholder
groups and the report brings out key concerns of diverse stakeholders. the stakeholder concerns are well identified documented
and reported. in our opinion, the level at which the report adheres to this principle is ‘good’.


materiality
the process of determining the issues that are most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders


the materiality determination process was based on inputs from key stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers,
governments, regulatory bodies, media and senior management of the company. the output of process clearly brings out material
issues in internal and external context. in our opinion, the level at which the report adheres to this principle is ‘good’.


responsiveness
the extent to which an organization responds to stakeholder issues.


the report has fairly brought out key responses to the identified materiality aspects i.e. the report focusses its disclosures on key
material aspects at macro level and has not missed out responses to identified material aspects, however the report needs to further
strengthen the disclosure of management approach especially the disclosure on evaluation of management approach (dma-c) and
identified material aspects in supply chain. the company is in the process of developing systems for reporting on supply chain. in our
opinion, the level at which the report adheres to this principle is ‘acceptable’.


reliability
the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems.


the company has established manual spreadsheet-based system for capturing the sustainability performance data from primary
sources for monitoring environmental, labour and social performance at the three sites visited by us. during our verification, we
observed some of the data inaccuracies at the sites visited by us; these were found to be attributable to transcription and aggregation
errors. these errors have been communicated for correction and corrected for sample sites visited. in our opinion, the level at which
the report adheres to this principle is ‘acceptable’.


completeness
how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organisation and its stakeholders is reported.


the report has fairly attempted to disclose the general and specific standard disclosures including the disclosure on management
approach and performance indicators for identified material aspects for gri g4 – ‘in accordance’ – core option of reporting for the
chosen reporting boundary and the reporting of performance and data for some of the sustainability performance indicators is limited
to the reporting year. in our opinion, the level at which the report adheres to this principle is ‘acceptable’.

neutrality
the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of an organization’s performance, delivered in a neutral tone.


the disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are generally reported in a neutral tone, in terms of content and
presentation, however the report could further bring out responses related to the challenges faced during the reporting period at
various locations of operations in terms of location specific material aspects, sustainability goals and targets in objective manner. in
our opinion, the level at which the report adheres to this principle is ‘acceptable’.


opportunities for improvement
the following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of the company
and are not considered for drawing our conclusions on the report; however, they are generally consistent with the management’s
objectives:
•• the report needs to explicitly bring out strategic priorities under strategy and analysis, and report short, medium and long term
    sustainability goals and targets for identified material aspects and disclose the same in its future reports;
•• reporting boundary needs to include all entities included in the organization’s consolidated financial statement;
•• a systematic process of internal audit of data management systems may be established to further strengthen the reliability of
    reported sustainability performance;
•• a comprehensive supply chain risk assessment covering the value chain partners will help in evolving appropriate sustainability
    strategies to manage risks.
