                   to our stakeholders


                    the ricoh group has consistently helped raise office productivity with its innovative
                    technology, and continues to be an industry leader. during this year — our 77th since
                    ricoh’s founding in 1936 — we achieved group consolidated net sales of approximately
                    2,000 billion yen (usd 20 billion), and evolved into a global organization with more than
                   100,000 employees around the world.

                    the foundation of our business activities is “the ricoh way,”* which is comprised of our
                    founding principles and management philosophy. we seek to earn trust and continue to
                    thrive by helping customers manage their information, develop their enterprises and solve
                    their business problems. at the same time, we as a group have made it our mission to
                    contribute to social and environmental sustainability alongside the growth of our organization.

                    as globalization advances, the problems surrounding society and our planet’s resources
                    are becoming more complex and interrelated. in parallel, our business environment is
                    transforming at an ever faster pace. it is therefore imperative, now and in the future, that
                    we raise our corporate value not only by delivering greater profitability, but also by being
                    an effective force in efforts to solve global issues.

                    in response to these challenges, the ricoh group’s 17th mid-term management plan,
                    initiated in april 2011, defined “business creation and integration” and the “establishment
                    of highly efficient management” as its key strategies. we have also strengthened and
                    expanded our imaging business — the main generator of our revenue — while actively
                    developing new businesses.

                    in fiscal 2013, structural reforms implemented throughout the group increased profits
                    in our core business and enabled us to bring new value to our customers. in the area
                    of industrial products, for example, we entered new markets that allowed us to use our
                    optical technology to advantage. yet we continue to take on the challenge of helping
                    our customers build their future success, and every member of the ricoh group remains
                    focused on creating customer value.

                    we believe that, through the sum of our initiatives, we can meet the diverse expectations
                    of all our stakeholders while simultaneously growing our business. that is what it means
                    to act in accordance with the ricoh way.

                    as we innovate with a view to the future, look for a new era in the evolution of the
                    ricoh group.

     i have been with ricoh for some 40 years, and
 during that time i have worked in several regions and
 countries and in many organizations. everywhere i
 went, i found teams of people with a high degree of
 professionalism as well as wide-ranging curiosity that
 extended beyond their specialties. their individual
 efforts became an exponentially greater force when
 they worked together. i seek to build a corporate
 culture in which the collective strength of each
 person working autonomously with a strong sense of
 mission and integrity is firmly entrenched.

 represent the potential for a new business model
 that can provide great benefits to our customers and
 society. i believe they will enable us to head into a
 bright new future.

   csr global governance and monitoring across the group

   our social responsibility efforts evolve in three stages: from assessing legal, regulatory and other external
   requirements; to mission- and responsibility-driven voluntary activities that proactively meet expectations from
   society; to the third stage, where we work to create shared value by solving social issues while concurrently
   accelerating our growth.
       to govern and monitor group-wide activity in each of the three stages, we deploy our csr management cycle.
       under this system, the head office collects information and feedback from operating organizations on the
   ground to identify and provide necessary support. the head office and operating units also hold periodic opinion
   exchanges and discussion forums to improve the quality of their respective csr activities.

  carbon offsetting in europe: the generali example

  the swiss branch of the insurance company generali was the first business in europe to receive the ricoh
  group’s certificate of carbon offset, and the second in europe to achieve complete carbon offsetting.
      generali introduced ricoh’s managed document service (mds) four years ago, and decided to implement carbon
  offsetting in its office printing environment in order to further promote its environmental conservation activities.
      generali’s co 2 reduction initially began by switching to new models, but ricoh europe plc (re) took
  it further and proposed solutions that restrict resource consumption. these included the use of ricoh eco

                                 3. t op priorities: safety, environment and compliance
                                     to create a corporate culture valuing these priorities, they must become part of the
                                     agenda of daily operations. for example, monthly and weekly meetings might start with
                                     reports on safety, environmental and compliance issues before moving on to business
                                     performance.
                                 i hope to continue with constructive participation in board meetings as an outside director
                                 to enhance ricoh’s corporate value.

   a message from our partner, the center for human rights education and training


   an awareness of human rights is key to being a global citizen
   it was a great pleasure for us to work with ricoh in developing e-learning materials that reveal international
   developments in human rights and their relevance to corporate activities.
       in recent years, interest in corporate social responsibility has grown in pace with economic globalization.
   reflecting this trend, the united nations global compact, iso26000 and other international frameworks are
   becoming de facto guidelines for corporate activities.
       as human rights are mainstreamed into business practices,
   integrating human rights considerations into every employee’s
   everyday work is vital for a company to achieve growth and
   contribute to society.
       we hope the e-learning materials we jointly developed will help csr
   and human rights initiatives spread throughout the entire ricoh group.

    tpm is a tamper-proof hardware security module that performs cryptographic functions and securely stores
    cryptographic data. ricoh uses the tpm to store the root encryption key that protects the hard disk data
    encryption key and the digital certificate of the mfp, and to perform a trusted boot operation that validates mfp
    firmware authenticity before permitting the mfp to operate. the root key and cryptographic functions are always
    contained within the tpm and cannot be altered from outside. this provides high-level assurance of the validity of
    the mfp’s firmware, device identity and hard disk security.                                                                                                   information leaks due

     with a network of 24 hospitals, 38 consultation centers and 10,000 medical professionals treating over four million
     patients annually, usp & quiron hospital group is one of the largest private operators of hospitals in spain.
          previously, the group generated over 20 million paper-based medical records every year. this legacy system,
     however, compromised patient care and required significant administrative resource to maintain. patient records
     were fragmented, there was little standardization of forms, and it took time to retrieve critical information and
     share it with relevant departments.
          referencing its document management expertise and knowledge of the healthcare sector, ricoh españa s.l.u.
     migrated the group to an electronic health record (ehr) system with automated workflows and electronic forms.
          the ehr system provides end-to-end management of patient records. now, medical records are scanned at
     the point of admission and uploaded to the ehr when a patient attends a group hospital for the first time. new
     information, such as pathology notes generated while the patient is in the hospital’s care, is appended using
     electronic forms (eforms).
          this has transformed administration at usp hospitales. key workers can now access complete electronic
     records on demand. information is shared instantly, enabling clinicians to make better informed decisions in less
     time. billing cycles are shorter as well, with administrative staff able to quickly access insurance records.
          to safeguard patient confidentiality, the electronic records are encrypted. floor space that had been used to
     store paper-based records has been liberated and the hospital group is enjoying a 20% reduction in document
     related costs.
          the ehr system has dramatically improved
     productivity and is allowing clinicians to focus more
     time on patient care. ➤ web

   communication with employees

   employee engagement survey
   the ricoh group seeks to create a workplace environment where individual employees are encouraged to demonstrate their abilities to the fullest
   and enjoy a sense of ownership in their work. this is in keeping with the ricoh way, our fundamental philosophy, values and action guidelines.
        as part of our efforts, we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys. in fiscal 2013, we conducted these surveys at 21 group com-
   panies in japan (with about 36,000 employees), and garnered a response rate of over 90%. the survey results, which were announced on our
   intranet and in-house publication, are used to plan measures for improvement.
        these surveys will be extended to include overseas group companies in fiscal 2014, with the aim of making the ricoh group a truly
   global company built upon a common foundation, the ricoh way.
   employee council
   ricoh employee council meetings are manifestations of our belief
   that employees are collaborators in the growth of our business. the council’s
   central meetings serve as a forum for communication between senior executives
   and other employees, with top management sharing information concerning the
   current state of the company and their management policies with representatives
   from 14 offices.
        the information is subsequently conveyed to all employees through workplace
   meetings as well as through the council’s newsletters. additional sectional
   meetings are held to deliberate company-wide issues such as pay raises, bonuses
   and event schedules, and the results of these deliberations are presented to ricoh’s
   senior executives.

                                      every business not only impacts our planet’s natural resources and ecosystems — it also
                                      depends on them. problems such as global warming, depletion of renewable and non-

                                      the ricoh group deploys sustainable environmental management practices that help to
                                      preserve the earth’s ecology while simultaneously improving our profitability. our approach
                                      focuses on developing energy-efficient products, reducing costs and minimizing our own
                                      environmental footprint though economical use of resources, and supporting workstyles
                                      that enhance operational and energy efficiency. in short, we are committed to benefiting

                                              one of our goals is to reduce total lifecycle co2 emissions by 30% by the year 2020 as compared
                                              to the level of the year 2000. to reach this goal, the ricoh group is working to lessen the
                                              environmental impact throughout the life cycles of our products, focusing specifically on the phase
                                              that has the greatest impact — the daily usage of our products. current ricoh products require less

                                          environmental conservation requires us to not only reduce our environmental impact but also to

                                          formulated the ricoh group biodiversity policy in march 2009. this directive aims to preserve our

                                          business activities on biodiversity.

                                        ”the capability of the community to sustain itself is key”
                                              drishtee envisions a world where all communities are empowered to achieve shared prosperity. the focus is on helping
                                              rural communities become sustainable and empowered. we measure our impact on broadly two parameters — new
                                              income and increased savings for the rural community. activities resulting out of our partnership with ricoh measure
                                              high on both these parameters. the model of women’s shops not only brings in new income to the village but also
                                              increases savings for the villagers. to top it all, the new income comes to the woman
                                              of the family. she is spending this money for educating kids and for the well-being of
                                              her family members.
                                              moving forward, we would like to continue our innovative journey with ricoh.
                                              providing solutions for the community would remain the theme while the focus
                                              would be on sustainable income for all stakeholders: community, ricoh as well

forest ecosystem conservation projects
forests, lakes and ponds, coral reefs and oceans all provide unique ecosystems for countless varieties of plants,
animals and other organisms. when these habitats are disrupted, it ultimately affects the human environment
as well.
    ricoh started a forest ecosystem conservation project in 1994 in cooperation with environmental ngos
and local partners, and now operates related projects in six regions in five countries. unlike tree-planting
projects, these sustainable forest management initiatives focus on conserving the lifestyles of the local people
in addition to the habitats of endemic species. ➤ web
