case / our search for new reuse applications for foundry sand

    componenta’s finnish units generate a total of 25,000 tonnes of excess foundry sand annually. according to the law,
    foundry sand can be reused at a landﬁll site, if this is mentioned in the environmental permit for the site, or at an earth
    construction site, if a separate environmental permit is applied for. otherwise, foundry sand has to be dumped at a
    landﬁll site.

    in 2013, only a few per cent of excess foundry sand was reused outside of landﬁll sites. however, reuse applications
    could be increased due to the excellent composition of foundry sand: most foundry sand types contain around 10 per
    cent of bentonite, which is added to mixtures used in earth construction, among other things. in addition, the
    concentrations of harmful ingredients in foundry sand are either below or very close to the limits of inert waste.
    expanding reuse applications would also bring signiﬁcant environmental beneﬁts.

    at the moment, the environmental permit process required for foundry sand is in eﬀect preventing its ﬂexible reuse.
      erefore, we have initiated a project in finland that produces information for the authorities on the environmental
    impact and reuse opportunities of foundry sand. e project aims to change the current legislation (government
    decree concerning the recovery of certain wastes in earth construction) so that foundry sand could be reused in
    diﬀerent projects with a less burdensome notiﬁcation procedure than in the environmental permit process. in the
    context of the project, we are participating in a finnish programme called uuma2, which examines the reuse of waste,
    and an eu life funded project at the hitura nickel mine in finland.

engineering service development continues in orhangazi

    componenta’s target is to provide world-class engineering services to fulﬁl customer needs, while also ensuring the
    best possible solutions from the perspectives of delivery certainty, quality and cost.

       e orhangazi engineering center in turkey plays an active role in sales and production through several product
    development processes, such as requests for quotation, new product introduction and requests for modiﬁcation. in
    addition, the know-how of engineers is needed in internal product transfers carried out between componenta’s units
    for optimised production.

    in 2011, development actions began at the orhangazi engineering center in order to increase engineering resources
    and capabilities, clarify engineering roles and develop project management skills.

    in 2013, the main focus of the project was to deﬁne the needs for engineering related to sales and production in order to
    safeguard the ownership and coordination of cross-functional processes. in addition, several necessary human
    resource management processes and tools were implemented, paying special attention to future engineering needs. in
    addition to recruiting new engineers, the existing organization was renewed in order to meet engineering targets.
