    in 2011 asc began offering all full-time year-round employees 16 hours of paid volunteer time. we’ve built homes with habitat
    for humanity, rehabilitated trails throughout the roaring fork valley, and volunteered with numerous charities. if all eligible
    employees took advantage of this benefit we’d add 15,500 hours to the non-profit community, worth about $330,000.

    in 2011, asc donated more than $2.4 million to 266 local nonprofit organizations.

                                                           solving climate change is going to hurt. it’s going to fracture old alliances;
                                                           create new friendships; and require a completely new take on the world.
                                                           fixing climate change is art itself; and it will be inspired by art.
