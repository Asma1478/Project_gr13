strategic role of corporate responsibility




letter from jay hooley, chairman and ceo
joseph l. hooley is chairman and
chief executive officer of state street corporation

at state street, corporate responsibility (cr) is firmly ingrained in our culture and business strategy. we know that
making a positive impact on the world is not only the right thing to do, it’s smart business. being a responsible
corporate citizen makes sense for all of our stakeholders — our employees, our clients, our shareholders and
society at large.

environmental sustainability
protecting the environment while supporting sustainable development is a major priority for us. in 2015, we
continued to make substantial progress toward our goal to reduce our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and water
use by 20 percent per person by 2020, compared to a 2012 baseline. at the end of the year, we had achieved a 17
percent reduction in both categories, while also closing in on our goal of drastically reducing waste sent to
landfills.

we continue to manage the environmental impact of our operations, with 56 percent of our global square footage
of office space now certified to iso 14001 standards. our investment in a wind power project near our new office in
gdansk, poland, helped offset 26,000 metric tons of carbon impact, an amount equivalent to our 2014 business
travel emissions. we also acquired 202 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy certificates (recs),
representing 110 percent of the electricity we purchased in the us in 2015.

we are proud to be a leader in helping investors incorporate environmental, social and governance (esg) factors
into their investment decisions. we first started managing esg portfolios in 1986 and as of the end of 2015 had
more than $168.4 billion in esg assets under management. in december 2015, we launched an exchange traded
fund designed to help investors eliminate fossil fuel reserves from their portfolios while maintaining exposure to
the core of the s&p 500 index.

investing in our communities
the strength of our business is directly linked to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. our state
street foundation provided $22.7 million to nonprofit organizations around the world in 2015, including matching
employee contributions of $4.15 million to 2,222 charitable organizations. we encourage our employees to be
active in our communities, and more than a fifth of them participated in company-sponsored volunteer activities
during the year, devoting 116,000 hours of their time to charitable causes.




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        4

in june, we launched the boston workforce investment network, or boston wins, a four-year pilot program to
boost education and job readiness for urban youth in our headquarters city. in an innovative approach to corporate
philanthropy, our foundation pledged to donate $20 million to five nonprofit organizations over four years and hire
1,000 young people who work with them to advance their education and job readiness. all five of these partner
organizations have committed to working closely with each other and with state street to pursue our shared
objectives of providing education, training and meaningful career opportunities for boston youth — and to regularly
measure, assess and report our joint progress.


diversity and inclusion

building a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are essential elements of our culture. for us, diversity
represents the variety of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences within our organization, while inclusion is
about soliciting and respecting different perspectives to promote a culture of engagement, innovation and
constructive debate and challenge.

our workforce should mirror the clients and communities we serve, and we want our employees to be able to see
themselves reflected in their leaders. to this end, we set a series of goals to increase the diversity of our middle
management and leadership ranks by the end of 2017, and we will measure progress on diversity and inclusion as
part of our annual performance reviews for all managers.


risk management

our stakeholders expect us to serve them fairly and act appropriately in all we do, and doing so is an essential
element of our values. in 2015, we launched a company-wide initiative to elevate risk excellence as a top priority.
we strengthened our risk assessment and monitoring capabilities by investing in skilled people, technology and
processes. we also rolled out a newly revised standard of conduct and ethical decision-making framework to all
employees and stressed the importance of holding ourselves to the highest possible standards and challenging
ourselves and each other to make sound decisions.


committed to cr

as a signatory to the united nations global compact, we’re committed to advancing its 10 universal principles for
responsible business, as well as the sustainable development goals (sdgs) the un issued in september 2015.
these sdgs are aimed at addressing important esg challenges, and several of them are closely aligned with our
goals. we’re pleased with the progress we’ve made advancing our cr agenda, but we recognize there’s more to
do. we will continue our work to be a responsible corporate citizen and make a more positive impact on the world.




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        5

letter from pat centanni, chairman of the executive corporate responsibility committee

pat centanni is an executive vice president and manager of state street global realty, procurement & continuity
services. he will retire in june 2016 after more than 25 years at state street.

every year, i’m excited to see how we can continue to weave corporate responsibility (cr) further into our strategy.
from the 2020 environmental goals we set in 2012 to the investments we made this year in our boston wins job-
readiness program, we’re preserving our promise of building a sustainable future.


where we are

as a solutions-focused company, we use the insights we gain from talking to our clients to develop solutions for
their business. this includes helping them incorporate cr into their own business.

but our commitment to cr is more than just the solutions we offer to clients. it’s also how we engage our
employees to help them grow in their careers and stay connected to our goals. our focus on cr helps employees
know they work at a company whose values align to theirs. suppliers are another way we can make a difference.
over the past few years, we’ve taken a close look at our supply chain and have started implementing procurement
policies on social and environmental responsibility. wherever we can, we look to work with partners that
demonstrate socially responsible sourcing.


where we’re going

as we look forward, we want to zero in on the most relevant cr topics and make sure top management is
informed and can lead the charge. we need to clearly articulate what matters to our business and all
stakeholders.

in 2016, we’ll continue to promote esg product and service opportunities through state street global advisors
(ssga) initiatives and by working with our global strategy team to develop a corporate-wide approach. when it
comes to the environment, we’ll look for additional opportunities to lower our carbon footprint, water usage and
waste amount so that we can reach our 2020 goals.

an important part of our way ahead is also setting new goals. as signatories to the un global compact, we want
to make sure our cr and community initiatives align with the un’s sustainable development goals. we’ll identify
those most material to state street to establish metrics and report on our progress. and while our human rights
statement has served us well since we first issued it in 2008, we’ll be updating it this year for greater clarity.
finally, we’re also considering ways we can include cr in our employees’ annual goals. i think this will truly help
strengthen the belief that everyone can contribute to our goals of building a sustainable future.




                                                                                     corporate responsibility         6

material corporate responsibility topics
creating focused value

our corporate responsibility (cr) initiatives and this report focus on the most relevant topics for our company and
stakeholders. we update our list of material cr topics every two years based on guidelines from the global
reporting initiative (gri). in 2015, our assessment, which is supported by the cr consultancy sustainserv, began
with a list of 32 cr topics. these were compiled from gri, the iso 26000 guidance on social responsibility, the
sustainability accounting standards board (sasb) and cr reports of other financial services companies.

a number of test questions helped us narrow this down to 15 topics that create the greatest value for our business
and stakeholders. these questions addressed whether a topic presents significant risks or opportunities to our
company, whether it is related to our values, or whether it has been raised by external partners or employees as
impacting their interests.


inviting feedback

to determine the topics most important to our company, we engaged colleagues across business units and from
our north america, europe, middle east and africa (emea) and asia-pacific (apac) operations. they completed an
online survey based on our test questions and refined the results at an in-person workshop in boston and online
workshops in emea and apac. to assess the topics in a holistic manner, the survey also looked at relevant
impacts that could occur in our value chain.

to identify the topics most relevant to our stakeholders, we invited a select group of clients, investors, suppliers,
nongovernmental organizations (ngos) and academics to complete an online survey, supplemented with a few
follow-up interviews. in addition, we asked a small group of employees which topics they believed were most
important and included their feedback in our final assessments.


ongoing observation

the chart below shows how relevant our 15 focus topics are for our business and stakeholders. it also lists the
topics that fell outside of the materiality scope. while we’re not specifically discussing these topics in this report,
we’ll continue to manage them appropriately and reassess their relevance for future reports.

we decided that some topics were not material on their own, but still contribute to our performance on other
topics that are material. examples include the impact of energy efficiency as well as business travel and
commuting on our greenhouse gas emissions, and the impact of human rights policies and training on our
responsible sourcing.

our approach and performance on these material topics are discussed in this report and in our online gri report,
published on our website under corporate responsibility.

europe, middle east and africa (emea) and asia pacific (apac) perspectives

to ensure our cr reporting includes perspectives from all our global regions, we asked regional representatives
to help select our most relevant cr topics (see pages 8-9). to avoid a north american bias, we also asked senior
management from our regional teams for feedback on how we discuss the relevant topics in the report. while the
different chapters throughout this report include regional considerations and examples, we summarize
overarching comments from colleagues in emea and apac here.


increasing demand for esg capabilities

esg demand from clients in emea was significant in 2015, expressed for example in requests for proposals (rfps)
to conduct business. this aligns with findings from our global survey of 400 pension funds, which revealed that 83
percent anticipate a moderate or high level of interest in esg investing over the next three years. eighty percent of
those in emea reported they were more likely to consider hiring a manager that has esg capabilities compared
with one that doesn’t. nordic pension funds are particularly active on esg issues, with norway’s government
pension fund global being one of the leaders in the field.


strong expectations for governance

since the financial crisis, many apac regulators have focused on corporate governance. one expectation is for the
head of a local legal entity to be fully accountable for local business dealings and decision making. this can have
significant impact for multinational banks, such as state street, that are vertically organized and have globally led
systems, infrastructure and functional support. for example, we offshore a number of activities to centers of
excellence to increase efficiency and effectiveness. we need to demonstrate to regulators that our local offices
have sufficient oversight and decision rights in these arrangements.

also, there is increased expectation from the european central bank as well as from the uk’s financial conduct
authority (fca) and prudential regulatory authority (pra) among others. they want state street management in
emea to have local decision-making authority, oversee local implementation of global strategy and have clear
accountability. in the uk, the senior managers’ regime (smr), expected to begin in early 2016, will result in far
higher levels of personal accountability for senior executives of the london branches. all other uk-regulated firms
are expected to be subject to similar requirements by 2018.


data protection required by regulators and clients

data governance and data confidentiality are important issues in emea. for example, swiss banking laws limit our
ability to share client data across our corporation or systems. also, regulators across apac are increasingly
focused on customer data protection, privacy and cybersecurity issues, although rules and regulations vary from
market to market. for example, in applying our global marketing automation and client relationship tools, we
found that in one jurisdiction data has to be stored locally, while in another data encryption is required for data
transfer. customizing our solutions allows us to ensure local compliance.




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      10

increasing requirements on esg reporting

in the european union, a directive is unfolding to make reporting on nonfinancial matters including human rights,
employee-related issues, diversity and the environment mandatory for thousands of companies by 2018. there are
also local disclosure requirements on specific esg topics. for example, uk anti-slavery law requires employment-
related disclosures, and the uk government is currently proposing mandatory gender pay disclosure for firms with
more than 250 employees.

recently, there have been a number of new requirements and consultation processes on esg reporting in apac.
for example, the hong kong stock exchange conducted a consultation in 2015, which resulted in a requirement
that each issuer must disclose esg information annually. the singapore stock exchange also held a consultation
on esg reporting in 2015 and published esg disclosure rules for consultation in early 2016 as a result. australia,
south korea, malaysia, taiwan and india have established or are developing requirements for disclosures
regarding esg issues.




                                                                                   corporate responsibility     11

corporate strategy and corporate responsibility
aligning corporate strategy and responsibility

inspired by the guiding principles of the integrated reporting framework published by the international integrated
reporting council (iirc), our 2014 cr report took the first step to show how cr issues are part of our business
strategy. by exploring how material cr topics align with different parts of our strategy, we understood better how
cr supports our strategic goals.


focusing on the future

the way ahead is our strategy and road map for the future. designed to move our business forward, it’s focused
on four strategic priorities that rest on a foundation of trust, culture, innovation and risk excellence:

    •   build on our strong core by aligning solutions with client needs and continuing to innovate so that we’re in a
        stronger position to capture value and improve efficiency.

    •   achieve a digital enterprise by automating processes and digitizing much of how we do business to benefit
        our employees, clients and shareholders.

    •   maintain our capital strength by prioritizing our strong capital position so that we can grow and deliver
        returns to our shareholders.

    •   pursue new opportunities by focusing on prospects for growth that are informed by future trends.

determining areas of impact

as part of our cr materiality assessment (see pages 8-9) and in cr working group meetings with global teams, we
discussed how cr topics impact our strategy. to fully capture the complex connections between responsibility and
business, this year we recorded both the primary impacts of cr topics to our strategy as well as secondary, but
still meaningful, impacts.

the results are clear: all parts of our corporate strategy can be supported by our attention to relevant cr topics.
two of our priorities — build on our strong core and pursue new opportunities — as well as the foundation of
talent, culture, innovation and risk excellence are particularly impacted by this focus.

we have initiatives and incentives in place for many strategically important cr issues, such as ethics, risk
excellence, and diversity and inclusion. in addition, we’ll continue to explore how our cr programs support how we
execute our strategy. clearly, there are ample opportunities for valuable connections that will drive long-term
financial growth and help us continue to build trusted relationships with all stakeholders.

compliance and business ethics
building trust

the financial crisis dramatically changed how clients, shareholders, employees and communities view corporate
organizations. as a financial services provider, it’s more important than ever that our stakeholders see us as a
trusted partner. to earn, and keep, this trust, we must hold ourselves to the highest possible standards. all of our
business units are responsible for complying with rules and regulations and adhering to our ethical requirements
as a first line of defense. our compliance teams and audit function are the second and third lines.

as part of an agreement reached in 2015 with us and massachusetts banking regulators, we were required to
implement enhancements to our anti-money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance programs.

because our reputation rests on the behavior of every employee, we revised our global standard of conduct to
focus even more on conduct and culture in 2015. we also introduced a new ethical decision making framework
and reinforced our managers’ roles as the first line of defense.


adding staff and training

in 2015, we expanded our ethics office from 11 to 33 members. by establishing new regional ethics leaders in
emea and apac, and adding to the overall strength of our team, we’ve enhanced our advice, counsel and
monitoring activities company-wide.

the ethics team created and provided in-person ethical decision making training to 364 executive vice presidents
and senior vice presidents globally in 2015. these evps and svps then delivered in-person, leader-led training in
ethical decision making to more than 7,000 of our senior executives. and more than 1,400 assistant vice
presidents and above completed equivalent integrity at work trainings in emea.


strengthening personal accountability

globally, all staff received online training in anti-bribery, conflict of interest and other standard of conduct
matters. we increased the attention to on-time completion of training and in 2015 achieved 100 percent on-time
completion of the standard of conduct training — a strong statement of acceptance of personal responsibility.




                                                                                    corporate responsibility       15

in 2015, we launched a program on risk excellence, including an
emphasis on the importance of speaking up and dealing transparently
with issues. risk excellence is separately evaluated as part of our
performance review process, and we’ve created incentives for self-
reporting failures to follow our compliance policies. through the end of
2015, 34 percent of all instances of noncompliance with ethics policies
per month have been self-reported. this is just one way we’ve              david suetens

across can vary quite a bit depending on their position, so these
goals have been tailored to make sure they’re applicable and
achievable within the broader risk excellence framework.


learning from our mistakes

in any service-based business, mistakes are made and incidents
occur. we want to make sure we respond to these situations in a
transparent, timely and effective way — every time. we expect
personal accountability and reward employees who quickly identify,
escalate and respond to incidents.

to gain insight and avoid repeating mistakes, we share lessons
learned from handling incidence cases through our risk excellence
governance. this can be challenging, as we often have to break
silos across business and geographic lines. but the benefit is great:
we improve our collective awareness of potential risks and solidify
our risk awareness. this is essential for a business built on trust.




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      16

creating value for clients and shareholders
lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with both our clients and shareholders are at the foundation of our
success. to meet our clients’ emerging challenges, we continually look at how we support them and the solutions
we offer. this includes financial products and services that embed environmental, social and governance (esg)
features in their design. when it comes to our shareholders, we maintain close relationships to make sure they
understand our goals, how we plan to get there and our progress along the way.

client experience and feedback
staying in touch

our clients expect excellent service — every day. to deliver on that promise, we’ve worked for many years with
national quality review (nqr) tools to see what our clients think about the quality of our work and where we can
make improvements.

these surveys differ by region in terms of approach, areas measured and client feedback. for example, in emea
the results showed that we continue to maintain our strong level of overall satisfaction. clients highlighted
regulatory change and tax reporting as areas where they would like to see even more insights from us.

building lasting relationships

in 2014, we piloted a program with 10 of our largest global asset management clients who we support through our
global relationship management (grm) team. in contrast to the nqr surveys, which are focused on general
satisfaction levels, we opted to use the net promoter system (nps) with these select clients. the nps survey
addresses three areas: commercial conditions, state street as an organization and our service quality. most
importantly it asks if the client — based on their experience of working with us — would be willing to act as an
advocate for our company. the bar is high: on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most positive, only a rating of 9
or 10 is counted as a positive result.

for clients who we surveyed for the second year using nps, we saw clear improvements in overall scores, in the
number of individual promoters (more than doubling) and the attributes we measured. also, more people
participated in the survey this year at each client. nps can support our relationships with a wider group within a
client’s organization, often even engaging a client’s entire c-suite. this helps us build lasting relationships and
also fits well with our increasing focus on relationship governance. together with the client, we’re in a stronger
position to pinpoint what they value most and create a continuous focus for dialogue and improvement. in 2015, we
also included in the nps pilot a number of strategic clients headquartered in europe and asia.

valuing thought leadership

we’ve learned that once service quality is addressed, one of the next areas clients value is thought leadership. in
surveys, clients have told us that they can’t find the critical insights we offer anywhere else.

for example, they can tap into our experience with disruptive technologies from state street global exchange
(ssgx). access to white papers on current industry challenges as well as future trends also gives our clients a
stronger understanding of the markets they operate in. and with marketing automation and client relationship
tools, we can see what information clients most actively use so that we can respond to their individual needs.




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      17

where thought leadership is of interest to a client, we can invite them to talk with the authors of our white papers
or to speak to other experts on our team. we also share insights into what has worked for us and for other clients
regarding geographic expansion, product development and topics such as technology, regulation, risk and
distribution. also, our strong engagement in community and environmental protection is compelling to many
clients who are developing their own responsibility programs. we’ve even seen an increase on these topics in
rfps.

ethical marketing and fair competition
building a foundation of trust

as a partner to some of the world’s leading institutions, we must constantly earn their trust. our commitment to
honest and transparent operations is not only in the work we do for our clients and shareholders, it’s part of how
we market our services and communicate our mission to the public.

our recently revised global standard of conduct clearly prohibits misrepresenting any material facts, and requires
that employees understand and uphold the laws regarding cross-selling and bundling of products and services.

marketing ethically

in 2015, we launched a new multi-level compliance program. we made marketing compliance a key area for
strengthening our risk excellence, and provided additional resources for achieving this compliance. the new
resources included a stronger compliance oversight program (cop) for ethical marketing and creating the new
role of a marketing risk and compliance program manager.

as part of the training on our new global ethical decision-making framework, we developed ethical dilemma
scenarios and added them to the ethics training library for all businesses. also, our new global marketing and
advertising committee helps us uphold our transparent disclosures on the products and services we offer.

avoiding improper gifts

while modest gifts and entertainment can help personalize business relationships, we strictly prohibit our
employees from giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for or the perception of a specific business
advantage.

we have a strict annual limit of us$250 for gifts given to an individual, and any gift or entertainment offered to a
public employee or us union official requires prior approval. we train employees across the company to make
sure they clearly understand their responsibility when entertaining clients or prospects.

upholding fair competition

we want our clients to select their financial services providers in a transparent and efficient market environment.
our standard of conduct clearly prohibits all employees from engaging in any unfair competitive actions or
misusing a client’s confidential information.

employees must get advance approval from our chief legal officer or general counsel before discussing pricing
strategies with any competitors, or entering into agreements concerning market opportunities. employees are
only allowed to acquire competitive information and market data from public sources, and through lawful means.




                                                                                     corporate responsibility          18

data protection and privacy
using smart data analytics to our advantage

our clients navigate large volumes of data to make informed investment decisions. by capturing and analyzing
data in a meaningful way, we help them assess risk and forecast performance. to make sure we’re staying ahead
of the curve when it comes to gathering and protecting data, we continue to evaluate and implement protection
technologies across the company.


carefully managing data

with a business based on trust, our clients must feel confident in our ability to keep data confidential and uphold
their privacy. we have several programs in place to maintain strict protocols for how we handle data and manage
our it systems.

to handle data appropriately, our information security controls require data to be classified as highly confidential,
personal sensitive, confidential, limited access, company internal or general data. in late 2015, we introduced a
pilot program with a new tool to automate this classification process, reducing the potential for misclassification
and inadvertent data disclosure. over the next two years, we plan to roll out other data protection tools that will
deliver additional access management, encryption and revocation features corresponding to the associated
classification levels.


safeguarding data from external threats

our data loss protection program includes technical tools and business processes that monitor and mitigate the
risk of data leakage. for example, end-point protection software provides threat detection and analysis of activity.
and our shadow it program detects communication to external sites and controls undesirable activity and data
exfiltration.




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      19

esg financial solutions

several parts of our business incorporate esg strategies in their
work. we spoke with four executives from across the organization
about the opportunities esg financial solutions provide for our clients
and our company.
                                                                          chris mcknett

provide insights to the marketplace. for example, we led the
industry collaborative project delphi that together with academic
partners uncovers esg impacts on investment portfolios. the first
phase of the delphi project wrapped up in december 2015 and the
findings will be available in 2016.

we have 17 esg products on the market right now. we first started
managing esg portfolios in 1986 and introduced our first fund in
1996. we launched the latest — a fossil fuel-free exchange traded
fund (etf) based on the s&p 500 fossil fuel free index — at the           jake rosenfeld

q: why did you introduce the fossil-free fund?
                                                                          tax-advantaged investments. these

some investors, such as a number of university endowments,                renewable energy projects.

foundations and individuals that aim to divest from firms with fossil
fuel reserves, want to go beyond low carbon.

different investment styles work for different clients. in esg
financial services, negative screening to avoid unwanted exposure
has been around for a long time. positive selection to gain exposure
to sustainability themes such as low carbon or green bonds was
added later. there is also an increasing move toward using esg
factors to capture intangible, off-balance-sheet values in broader
investment strategies.




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      20

q: are there other pieces to the esg puzzle?
batler: in municipal finance, our clients seek to fund infrastructure
projects including capital improvement plans (cip) directly with us
or via the public markets. an increasing number of public issuers’
cips include infrastructure projects that address environmental or
social issues. for example, the san francisco public utility               mark mcdivitt

causes such as renewable energy. energy is increasingly generated
by privately financed providers that sell to public utilities. we can
provide project financing to these generators in addition to our
support for municipal utility clients. this lets us bridge both sides of
the renewable energy equation.

mcdivitt: renewable energy certificates (recs) can also help. we
provide trading solutions for recs that help clients monetize
environmental attributes of renewable electricity generation
separately from the electricity itself. recs can be embedded into
                                                                           tim batler

this goes beyond credit ratings and includes, for example,
dependency on coal. there are also upcoming mandates to source
certain amounts of the energy offered by some utilities from
renewables. this will likely change which new energy facilities get
built and the market demand for recs or alternative energy.




                                                                                    corporate responsibility      21

rosenfeld: in december 2015, the us congress extended tax credits for wind and solar projects for several years.
we believe this extension, coupled with state renewables mandates and international initiatives such as the paris
climate change accord, will help spur a significant growth in the renewable sector. that will lead to a
corresponding need for financing in the coming years.

mcdivitt: across the company, we’re starting to hear clients ask for better coordinated esg financial solutions. i
would expect there to be more and more opportunities for our different groups to work together to meet their
needs.

q: if you could choose one thing you’d like to do, what would that be?
mcdivitt: it would be very powerful to bring all our disciplines that can support esg solutions together. let’s link
our capabilities on environmental asset administration, portfolio risk analysis, low-risk trading and “green”
investment management to figure out how to help our clients solve esg issues.

we have a big chance here and a huge potential commercial opportunity. that being said, we also have the risk of
missing the boat. we could lose out to competitors who are aggressively focusing on esg capabilities if we’re
playing this too defensively.

mcknett: there are some questions on how esg can be best monetized because it’s a heterogeneous category.
one area where we see clear emerging interest from clients is in viewing esg factors and sustainability themes as
long-term drivers of investment performance and a component of rigorous investment philosophy and process.
provided we have strong support from senior management and our board, we’re in an excellent position to offer
uniquely integrated esg solutions.

asset stewardship
more than $400 billion flowed into us-based passive funds in 2015.
unlike active managers who can sell companies when they
disagree with management, passive managers represent near
permanent capital that cannot vote with its feet — as long as a
company is included in the index it remains in the portfolio. that’s
                                                                       rakhi kumar

shareholder value.

in 2014, we introduced new esg portfolio screening tools to help
actively identify companies for engagement and enhance oversight
of esg risk at portfolio companies. in 2015, we engaged a total of
636 global companies representing more than 45 percent of our
assets on esg issues.

increasing transparency on esg efforts to clients

annually, ssga develops a series of strategic priorities that drive
our engagement with portfolio companies based on developing
macroeconomic conditions, emerging esg trends and client
feedback. a significant challenge for all passive index managers
invested in thousands of listed companies globally is to provide
active oversight of the company. a sector approach lets us take a
deep dive into two to three sectors a year and proactively monitor
and engage companies on matters such as long-term strategy,
performance and esg issues.




                                                                               corporate responsibility      25

reviewing global holdings within a sector lets us identify business and esg trends impacting our holdings, and
puts us in a stronger position to advise boards and management teams when they seek feedback or direction from
large institutional investors. we also share our insights with clients through presentations and report our findings
in our annual stewardship report.


for 2015, ssga’s stewardship priorities included a sector focus on pharmaceutical companies, which have to
navigate structural change in their sector due to an increase in mergers and acquisitions, and the consumer
discretionary sector where macroeconomic and exchange-rate challenges impact business strategy. we worked
with companies on board refreshment and diversity, cybersecurity threats and climate change as priority topics. in
addition, we focused on us proxy access issues and worked on developing a stewardship program for our fixed
income assets.


contributing to esg best practices

we’ve taken a leadership position in the market and share our lessons learned with the wider investment
community through white papers available on our ssga website. our evolving approach to esg has contributed to
the development and broader acceptance of best practices.


one example is board refreshment — a key aspect of effective governance. in 2014, we were the first major
investor to adopt a policy to address these practices at us portfolio companies. through this policy, we’ve raised
awareness about the need for the orderly succession of directors and fresh skills and expertise.

economic performance

to create value for our shareholders, we’re focused on generating consistent revenue growth and maintaining
disciplined expenses. the economic success of our business also determines our ability to serve all stakeholders.
with this in mind, we manage the risks inherent in our business with systems, procedures and oversight to
maintain transparency and long-term sustainability.


revenue increase despite lower global interest rates

our total revenue in 2015 increased by one percent over 2014. this was mainly due to increases in our fee revenue,
partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue.


servicing and management fees were approximately 76 percent of our total fee revenue. the remainder was due to
trading services, securities finance, and processing and other fees. in 2015, total fee revenue increased by three
percent compared to 2014. in contrast, net interest revenue decreased by eight percent on a fully taxable-
equivalent basis in 2015 compared to 2014. contributing factors were our efforts to optimize our capital position to
comply with evolving regulatory requirements on liquidity, lower yields on interest-earning assets and the effect of
the stronger us dollar.


increasing expenses and new cost efficiency program

total expenses in 2015 increased by three percent compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in expenses
due to more than $400 million in legal accruals, as well as higher information systems and communications costs
to support new business and other expenses from professional services. this was partially offset by a $108 million
decrease in acquisition and restructuring costs and $251 million from the effect of the stronger us dollar.


in october 2015, we announced the next phase of our multi-year transformation program, which we refer to as
state street beacon. we expect to deliver cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and
further digitize our processes and interfaces with clients. we expect state street beacon, which includes the
targeted staff reductions that we announced with our third-quarter 2015 results, to generate approximately $550
million in estimated annualized pretax expense savings over the next five years, including approximately $75
million in 2016.


dividend increase and stable return on equity

during 2015, we declared common stock dividends of $1.32 per share (2014: $1.16), totaling approximately $536
million. return on average common shareholders’ equity remained flat at 9.8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014.
we purchased approximately 20.5 million shares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $74.07 and
an aggregate cost of approximately $1.52 billion.


additional information with respect to our financial results, our common stock purchase program, stock dividends
and the method used for computing earnings per share is provided in our 2015 annual report on form 10-k.

engaging employees and suppliers
to keep our clients at the heart of everything we do, engaged employees, as well as experienced, knowledgeable
suppliers, are essential to our continued success.

our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential
infuses our company values. it’s also part of our commitment to inclusion, development and engagement, and
corporate social responsibility. hiring the right talent and supporting them in their professional development is key
to our success. this includes cultivating employees from diverse backgrounds and nurturing the range of
perspectives that keep us innovative and competitive.

we also make sure we work with high-quality suppliers that share our values and help us serve our clients well.
because we have a significant supplier base, our selection of suppliers that employ responsible business practices
has an impact on local economies, environmental protection, the workforce in our supply chain and broader social
issues.

talent recruitment and retention

as the business world grows, companies are competing for the same skilled workers. to attract and keep the best
candidates, we’re developing a new recruitment branding campaign to refine our image and the message we’re
delivering to potential employees. with this new campaign, we explain how our more than 200-year-old custodian
bank can offer opportunities that are interesting and rewarding.

diversifying our talent

a diverse workforce inspires innovation and creates better business results. in 2015 we hired 12 full-time
employees — eight in north america, two in emea and two in apac — to form a global diversity sourcing team to
bring diverse talent into higher-level roles. all of the team members completed specialized recruitment training
and received their diversity recruiting certification. (for more on our initiatives to foster diversity, see pages 34-
36.)

the role of recruitment programs

our employees help our company grow and stay innovative. our hiring increased significantly in 2015 across
strategic business areas including regulatory compliance, technology and analytics, showing our commitment to
deliver on our corporate strategy (see pages 4-5).

our future focus program in the us, which began in 2014, increased the rigor of our entry-level recruitment. in its
first year, it brought 26 high-caliber candidates into the company and in 2015 more than 120 were hired through
the program.

we also expanded our internship programs in 2015 to more than 1,100 participants. in emea, we offered a number
of internship opportunities to help undergraduates prepare for a career in financial services and to strengthen our
pipeline for future entry-level roles. in apac, we offered university students from nanyang polytechnic in
singapore six-month internships. polytechnic grants them academic credit for the experience, which speaks to the
quality of our program.

the gap between open jobs and the talent we need to fill them will continue to be a challenge for us. programs like
future focus and our boston workforce investment network (wins) initiative, which supports inner-city youth in
education and job readiness (see pages 44-46), will help us close that gap. continuing to craft our image as an
exciting and fulfilling place to work and sharing our story will give us an edge in the race.


training and professional development

by offering numerous avenues for professional development, our employees are able to deepen their skills, our
clients receive even better service and our company continues to evolve.


managers as students

in 2015, we analyzed where our managers needed more support. as a result, we piloted our first line leader
program for new managers in december 2015, and laid the groundwork to launch the program globally in 2016.
we also updated our most popular management classes in 2015. data showed that employees who took these
classes had higher performance scores, higher rates of promotions and were more internally mobile.




                                                                                  corporate responsibility      31

lastly, we launched an internal professional development program
(pdp) in july 2015 that allows assistant vice presidents to enter a
two-year job rotation. this program shows how diversity and
mobility are important parts of state street’s future. through an
application process that included a series of interviews and a hay
assessment, we selected 36 high-performing avps for this

encouraging collaboration                                               most!”

to encourage collaboration across the company, we created a
cross-enterprise learning council this year. this council bridges
all the groups in the company that support employee learning, so
they can coordinate efforts and improve our educational
opportunities. we also redesigned an internal site — “managing my
team”— to help managers tap into the information they need, when
they need it. use of the site skyrocketed by 90 percent after the
redesign.




                                                                                corporate responsibility       32

wage equity and flexible work options
upholding wage equity and equal opportunity

the ratio of wages of our female employees compared to our male employees in the company is material to our
business and of interest to our stakeholders. however, we do not report a female’s basic salary as a percentage to
a male’s. a simple across-the-board analysis of an organization of state street’s size and multiple business-line
complexity would not accurately compare similar positions or capture all elements of a total compensation
program.

successful companies actively ensure that the visible and invisible barriers to advancement are identified and
removed — including closing the gender wage gap. to that end, in 2013, we signed the boston women’s compact,
which strives to make greater boston the premier place for working women in america. state street is executing the
objectives of the compact in several ways: by setting organizational goals for diversity, by mentoring women in
leadership roles, engaging them in our employee networks and through our flexible work initiative.


increasing engagement and productivity

highly skilled, productive employees are vital to our success. we believe that offering flexibility in how, when and
where work gets done increases the engagement and productivity of our workforce. flex work may include a
consolidated schedule, as well as working remotely or at a satellite office. and job share opportunities allow more
than one employee to share a position on an ongoing basis.


providing support and guidance

benefits from flexible work can include enhanced work-life balance and time and cost savings from commuting.
the flex work program is integrated with our business strategy and has developed into a proactive, manager-
initiated program supported by tools, technologies and resources.

our flexible work employee network is an inclusive collection of employees who voluntarily work together to
support our global workforce around state street’s formal flex work program. for example, the network provides
career development guidance and support to flex community followers to help them in career advancement,
internal mobility and becoming the voice of flex in their area. in 2015, our flexible work employee network was
ranked no. 7 on the top 25 employee resource groups by the association of employee resource groups and
diversity councils. this affirms the network’s commitment to best practices and organizational impact.

diversity and inclusion
we spoke with julie haskell about the role diversity and inclusion play
in staying competitive, and the strides we’re making to enhance this
aspect of our culture.

q: how do you define diversity in the workplace?
diversity refers to the visible and invisible traits that make us all     julianne haskell
                                                                          managing director, global

experiences and worldviews within our organization. it’s equally
important, however, to promote an understanding of inclusion.             julie leads our initiatives on inclusion,
                                                                          diversity and work-life balance. as part

to creating a risk excellence culture.

diversity and inclusion are most valuable when present together.
by itself, a diverse workforce doesn’t change culture. providing
opportunities that let employees use their unique perspectives and
backgrounds is how we create real business value. we want
employees to recognize and embrace all dimensions of diversity,
and then work to create an inclusive environment where everyone
can perform at their best.

q: where do you see change?
in the short time since we embraced this definition of diversity,
we’ve already seen positive outcomes. here’s just one example: we
know that in some asian cultures, certain forms of diversity are not
usually expressed in public. in the past, very few of our asian
colleagues were willing to identify with the lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender (lgbt) community during the annual hong kong
pride parade. last year, however, we were pleased to see more
than 20 employees participate in the parade. the kickoff event of
hong kong pride and friends network attracted more than 70
attendees including senior management. our message is being
heard!




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      34

q: what steps are being taken at state street to support an inclusive and diverse workplace?
we want to create an environment where people of all backgrounds and experiences can succeed. three key
components of our effort are to:

    •   establish our leaders as champions of diversity and inclusion and give them the tools and resources to
        help convey the importance and business value of a diverse workforce
    •   ensure that we’re building a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent for leadership positions
    •   implement a clear standard to hold leaders accountable for creating a diverse workforce and behaving
        inclusively

one way we celebrate and support our differences is through employee networks. open to all employees, these
networks create volunteer, career development and cultural opportunities. state street supports 23 employee-
established networks and affinity groups with more than 100 chapters globally.

q: what are your plans for maintaining diversity and inclusion over the long term?
building a truly diverse and inclusive workforce is a journey for any company. last year, we took a big step by
introducing a three-year strategy to educate employees, shift behavior and embed these elements throughout the
company.

we’ve already made progress in 2015 by setting new goals, establishing an approach to report progress, sourcing
diverse talent from within and improving leadership opportunities for internal talent. we’ll continue to analyze the
success of our diversity and inclusion efforts through our biennial employee opinion survey and by participating in
external surveys that allow us to benchmark ourselves against our peers.

supplier assessment
identifying the best partners

our global procurement services (gps) team works tirelessly to identify high-quality, cost-effective, flexible
suppliers that help us operate and serve our clients efficiently. in 2015, we spent about $3.9 billion globally on
products and services including financial, it, business and professional services, and market data, travel
management and office support.

the team also sets procurement standards, identifies suitable suppliers, and negotiates favorable price and
contract terms. it pinpoints the “best-in-class” processes, technology and tools that will help us reach our
spending and risk management objectives. in addition, it selects suppliers that support our drive for social
responsibility.


striving for responsibility

wherever possible we choose to work with suppliers who offer products and services that will reduce our overall
environmental footprint as part of our environmentally preferable purchasing program (eppp). in cases where
the eco-friendly solution is more costly, however, we have to manage trade-offs between environmental and
economic goals.

in 2015, we expanded our eppp goals related to our it purchases and disposals. these goals include the
prioritization of purchasing energy star®-certified devices and working with vendors that have a product
recycling or take-back program. the eppp is currently focused on direct suppliers in north america and emea,
and we hope to expand its scope in 2016. going forward, we also want to explore including second-tier suppliers
used by our major vendors. in addition, we screen new suppliers in north america for environmental and ethical
aspects in our rfp process.


exploring local sourcing

when scale and cost permit, we use local suppliers whenever we can. if our global business needs limit our
options for local sourcing, we encourage our larger global suppliers to use local second-tier vendors if they can.

starting in 2016, we plan to explore including local sourcing questions in our global procurement’s rfp process.
in addition, we plan to monitor which second-tier vendors our larger suppliers use. we’ll also explore how local
sourcing and our supplier diversity program — which measures and encourages sourcing from businesses owned
by minorities, veterans and women — can support each other.




                                                                                     corporate responsibility        37

supporting communities and the environment
actively engaging our global communities is one of our fundamental values, and is one reason why our
commitment to social and environmental responsibility is a cornerstone of our long-term success. since 2014,
we’ve been a signatory to the united nations global compact — a global initiative uniting organizations to help
build prosperous societies. these organizations believe responsible business practices create a stable, equitable
and inclusive global market. with the same rigor we apply to our business, we use our resources — both human
and financial — to support our communities. not only are we committed to using these resources responsibly to
protect the environment, we know we can use them to attract and retain clients and employees and reduce costs.


prosperity and financial security
at the center of the global economy

as of december 31, 2015, we had $28 trillion of assets under custody and administration and $2 trillion of assets
under management.** our position at the center of the world’s financial markets comes with responsibility —
something we never take lightly.

we help clients make the right connections, bringing opportunities into focus and paving the way ahead, whether
they are based in the most established markets or in those just emerging. the e7, a group of seven emerging
economies, will have close to 50 percent of global banking assets by 2050. it held less than 20 percent in 2013. to
meet the demand fueled by this globalization, we’re committed to global expansion and further integration of our
products and services.


enabling graceful retirement

our strong pension fund services help many people around the world retire gracefully. pension funds have often
been expected to play a conservative role in the financial system as long-term investors. as the current investment
climate leads them to consider new strategies to deliver value to their members, we help them navigate the
challenges in the financial landscape and provide comprehensive investment management solutions, such as
target-date funds.


creating local jobs

with more than 32,000 employees globally, we help to create job opportunities in the communities where we live
and work. the new staff we hire comes mostly from the local community. for example, at the level of senior vice
president and above, 31 of the 35 new hires in 2015 were local. a significant number of local jobs will also become
available through our boston wins project (see pages 44-46) over the upcoming years.




** assets under management include approximately $22 billion as of december 31, 2015, for which state street global markets, llc,
an affiliate of ssga, serves as the distribution agent.




                                                                                             corporate responsibility         38

strengthening communities
fostering employee engagement

through our employee engagement surveys, employees have told us they want to pursue projects that are
meaningful to them. two years ago, we transformed our global employee giving program from an annual “giving
campaign” to an ongoing awareness and open-choice platform.

by encouraging our employees to work directly in their local communities on projects they’re passionate about,
we’ve transformed employee engagement. together with the state street foundation, the charitable arm of our
business, employee volunteering and giving are also supported by our giving, investing, volunteering by employees
(g.i.v.e) initiative.

g.i.v.e.-ing back

our g.i.v.e. program lets employees choose the volunteering and fundraising opportunities most meaningful to
them. it also provides matching gift programs, such as our domore grant, which monetizes volunteer hours to
increase their impact.

to further inspire employees, we started the story-telling initiative “this is why i give” that lets employees share
stories from causes they support. in 2015, stories came from more than 150 events organized by our corporate
citizenship team, our community support program committees and our business teams. these inspirational
events included collections for syrian refugees in ireland, italy and germany; “chasing ice” events to raise climate
change awareness in hong kong, singapore and taipei; and volunteer recruitment events for our boston wins
program in massachusetts (see pages 44-46).

in 2015, the g.i.v.e. program logged a record 116,000 hours of volunteer service and generated $4.1 million in
employee donations. the passion and engagement of our company and staff is also shown in the size of our
corporate citizenship social media community, which increased by more than 60 percent in 2015 to more than
3,000 members.

leading from the top

a culture of community engagement starts from the top. that’s why we encourage all of our senior executives to
serve on nonprofit boards, and offer grants and matching gifts to enrich their board service. our newly launched
senior vice president community leadership program also supports leaders who have committed time and
resources to serving on charitable boards. these programs not only uphold our commitment to charitable
initiatives, they also help cultivate our staff’s professional talents and growth.

targeting support for education and workforce development

we make grants to nonprofits and ngos in 20 of the countries where we operate through our charitable arm, the
state street foundation. in 2015, the foundation distributed $22.7 million in funding to nonprofit organizations. of
this, $10 million was in strategic grants for programs aligned with the foundation’s strategic focus of education
and workforce development (see table below for regional breakdown). the remainder included $4.15 million in
matching gifts for employee contributions (a 27 percent increase over 2014) and a significant investment in our
boston wins initiative.

our chairman and ceo, jay hooley, challenged us to think           charitable arm.
differently about our approach to corporate philanthropy and to
reconsider how we could deliver the greatest impact for each
dollar invested. so i went back to our foundation team and we
got to work. we decided to focus our efforts on education and
preparing disadvantaged young people for employment.

in a given year, we used to contribute hundreds of grants.
boston wins helped us narrow our focus. it’s an opportunity to
be involved with our nonprofit partners over a longer term and
accelerate our impact on education and workforce development.
the ultimate goal is to increase the number of career-ready
youth in boston.

q: how is boston wins structured?
five nonprofit organizations targeting inner-city boston youth
are involved. we selected these organizations — year up,
bottom line, boston pic, uaspire and college advising corps —
after thorough due diligence. we wanted to engage
organizations with strong leadership that shared our vision, who
were willing to collaborate and could use our contributions in a
meaningful way.




                                                                           corporate responsibility      44

with the right group of organizations, we knew we could offer more substantial contributions and provide a
platform for improved collaboration that would offer greater value to the community. the program involves three
main contributions from us: we provide $20 million over the next four years to our group of partner organizations;
we pledge to hire 1,000 individuals served by these organizations over the same time; and we commit to staying
involved. this includes having state street leaders hold board of director positions, encouraging our employees to
volunteer and offering a 2-to-1 match of employee donations to these organizations.


q: what would make boston wins a success story?
we want to make a significant impact on education and career success for boston youth with this game-changing
corporate philanthropy initiative. to help us succeed, we’re outlining our expectations and have engaged a network
partner to help facilitate meetings so we can all remain in alignment and track outcomes.

as this program gets in full swing, we’ll learn from the experience for engagements beyond the boston area. our
hope is to take those lessons learned and use the blueprint of boston wins to potentially introduce a similar
program in other parts of the world where we operate.

reducing for the long term

as part of our responsibility to protect social well-being and our planet, in 2013 we committed to reducing our
greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by 20 percent per person by 2020, compared to a 2012 baseline. in 2015, we
continued to make substantial progress toward our goal. at the end of the year, we had achieved a 17 percent
reduction in ghg emissions. this reduction was primarily due to our increased occupancy of more efficient office
space, a favorable change in emissions factors used in calculations and an increase in the overall number of
employees against which emissions are factored.

our environmental data shows the main source of our ghg emissions is the energy we use in our operations,
followed by emissions from employee commuting and business travel. by focusing on our operations, while
supporting sustainable commuting options and flexible work solutions that reduce commuting, we’re creating
significant change that brings us ever closer to our goals. to further mitigate the impact of our global business
travel, our investment in a wind power project near our new office in gdansk, poland, offset 26,000 metric tons of
carbon impact from our 2014 business travel.


making progress, creating challenges

we’ve made great progress in the last few years in our energy efficiency. however, this has brought its challenges.
to make further progress, we’ll keep tabs on technology and infrastructure innovations to find new opportunities
to reduce emissions.

our new global energy policy will support us as well as new certifications to the global iso 50001 energy
management standard. in 2015, our offices in dublin, edinburgh and london were certified to this standard. as
part of our global expansion, we opened a new office in gdansk, poland, in february 2016. we realize that using
larger premises will also increase emissions. to mitigate the emissions from this additional office space, we
chose an energy-efficient, leed platinum precertified building. we also continued work on data center
virtualization to avoid emissions increases as it requirements grow. in response to a regulatory requirement
defined in the european energy efficiency directive, we also completed energy audits in seven eu office locations.
operations in the uk were covered by our iso 50001 energy management certification.

receiving recognition for our efforts

in 2015, the us environmental protection agency (epa) recognized us as one of the nation’s top 100 purchasers of
green power for our purchase of 211 million kilowatt-hours (kwh) of green-e certified recs covering state
street’s 2014 purchased electricity in the us. to continue the program we purchased another 202 million kwh,
representing 110 percent of purchased electricity in 2015.

we were also recognized in 2015 by cdp, a not-for-profit organization supporting environmental impact
disclosures by major corporations, for achieving its a-level of ghg emissions performance. we were also included
in cdp’s leadership index for achieving a score of 99 out of 100 for our environmental disclosures.




                                                                                   corporate responsibility      48

impacts of climate change
strengthening risk excellence

we focus on managing risk in everything we do. as a signatory to the united nations global compact, we’re
specifically committed to a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. also, our iso 14001 certification
at 17 of our largest operations globally requires us to evaluate environmental risks over the long term.

in 2015, our office of environmental sustainability developed an environmental risk excellence matrix that
evaluated strategic and market risks, regulatory risks, reputational risks and physical risks. while climate change
isn’t a major risk to our operations right now, we identified certain risks and mitigation strategies primarily
involving strategic and reputational risk. we’ll continue to diligently monitor and evaluate these and the other risks
we identified.

turning strategic and market risks into opportunities

many market players see carbon-related assets as an increasing risk factor for their investments. for example,
fossil fuel assets could become “stranded” if new regulations prohibit their extraction. or, if the cost of low-carbon
substitutes declines, it could impact share values of companies that own them. clients may seek new ways to
protect themselves from such risks.

our strong focus on environmental financial solutions turns these risks into opportunities. products like our low-
carbon exchange traded fund (etf) and our new fossil fuel-free etf, together with esg screening strategies, give
us a leading position in the market. for more information on our esg financial solutions, see pages 20-24.


mitigating regulatory and reputational risks

increasing global and regional climate regulations might require us to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions
even beyond our voluntary commitments. and clients, analysts and industry rankings may put more pressure on
us to demonstrate climate leadership.

but we’re prepared. we’re committed to our 20 percent carbon reduction goal (see page 47) and continuously
monitor our progress. our iso 14001 risk reviews and the work of our regulatory, industry and government affairs
team keep us well informed on new regulations relevant to our business. our public disclosures on corporate
responsibility, including this report, make sure we tell a clear story on our sustainability initiatives.


maintaining business continuity

a business continuity event — big or small — can impact any business with physical operations. climate change
can contribute to such physical risks, for example through more frequent severe weather events or sea level rise.
as financial services centers around the world are often by or near the coastline, our peers and our own company
may be impacted by these risks.

we assess and observe such risks in our iso 14001 risk reviews and risk register. our global continuity services
team leads our efforts to ensure continuity of our operations in the event of a business interruption. we’re
committed to protecting our clients from any service interruptions, including those related to climate change, in
addition to taking responsibility for mitigating our own climate impacts.

in relation to state street’s 2015 corporate responsibility reporting as set out below.

 responsibilities
                           erm cvs’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the
                           assurance activities performed and exercising our professional judgment.

our assurance activities
our objective was to assess whether the selected information is reported in accordance with the principles of
completeness, accuracy, consistency and balance as well as with gri g4 indicator criteria. we planned and
performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations that we believed were necessary to provide a
basis for our assurance conclusions.
a global, multi-disciplinary team of corporate responsibility (cr) and assurance specialists performed the
following activities:
    •   attendance as observer at a materiality workshop in september 2015.
    •   an external factors review of media and internet sources to understand potential material corporate
        responsibility issues for the 2015 state street cr report.
    •   attendance and q&a at the interviews undertaken by the report writers with key state street management
        representatives.
    •   a review of documentation relating to state street’s stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment
        to ensure the list of material issues reflects the results of these processes.
    •   in order to collect further evidence, we also undertook interviews with key state street managers
        representing the following offices: global human resources, esg investing, cbre real estate services
        (for the ghg and environmental data), corporate social responsibility, procurement and compliance &
        ethics.
    •   interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and processes
        (including it systems and internal review processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected data;




                                                                                     corporate responsibility       54

     •    for the selected environmental data, interviews with the external consultant cbre responsible for collecting
          and consolidating utility data across state street’s operations as well as a review of the completeness and
          accuracy of the data including unit and emission conversion factors for energy use and ghg emissions, the
          reasonableness of estimations and extrapolations and the accuracy of the consolidation.
     •    a check of the consistency of the financial data with state street’s 2015 10k submission for the relevant data.
     •    for the selected information, a review of the consistency of reporting in the cr report with the
          information in the 2015 gri g4 report.
the limitations of our assurance engagement
for the financial data, we have restricted our work to checking consistency with the audited state street annual
report on form 10k for the year ending december 31, 2015 for the relevant data. we have not assured personal
views expressed in the letters and interviews incorporated in the cr report. our work was restricted to the 2015
reporting year, so no assurance is given on prior year data, or on future performance or expectations. the
reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining,
calculating or estimating the underlying information.
our conclusions
based on our activities, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the selected information in the state
street 2015 cr reporting, as described under the “scope” above, is not fairly presented, in all material respects,
with the reporting criteria.

our observations
we have provided state street with a separate, detailed management report. without affecting the conclusions
presented above, we have the following key observations:
    • state street has further developed its stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment during 2015. it
       has used these as a basis for building the cr report around the 15 material cr topics identified in these
       processes, providing more focus for this year’s cr report. however, we note that the cr report does not
       always include disclosure of the management approach (gri dma) and the 2015 performance (gri
       indicators) for each material topic, so users need to reference the information in the state street gri g4
       report to obtain a more comprehensive picture. we therefore recommend that state street considers
       publishing a fully standalone cr report next year including the dma elements and key annual
       performance for each material topic, in addition to insets with interviews or more qualitative information.
    • while state street has included more graphics in the cr report this year, a number of key performance data
       are reported in the text and are for 2015 only, rather than in comparison to the prior years’ performance. we
       recommend the consistent use of multi-year graphs for the presentation of key performance indicators for
       each material topic in next year’s report to give the user a clear picture of performance over time.
