great place to work
the hr policies are framed to ensure
that employees have a conducive
environment to reach high levels of
performance and realise their potential.
high levels of employee engagement,
regular dialogue with the employee
associations, a healthy work life balance
and grievance handling mechanisms
enable us to identify employee concerns
and effectively address them.


employee engagement
formal communication channels ensure
that all employees are focussed on the
vision, strategic goals and values of
the bank and are aware of significant
changes in policies or governance
structures through both written and
electronic communications. all manuals
including the employee code of conduct
and business ethics is available on
the intranet and also in hard copy
for reference when required. regular
meetings within strategic business units
also form a vital link in formal channels of
communication.

informal engagement is encouraged
through recreational events that are
organised at strategic business unit
level, regional level and for the country
entity as a whole. these events include
annual trips for employee families where
the bank provides an allowance to all
staff, celebration of festivals and sports
tournaments where employees compete
with friendly camaraderie. employee
participation levels at these events are
high and the bank makes a substantial
contribution to subsidise the cost of
these events.

      a positive impact – economic impact




a positive impact
our philosophy is to optimise positive impacts taking a long term view whilst minimising any negative impacts that may arise as
a consequence of pursuing our strategic goals. we are aware that both positive and negative impacts must be measured and
managed in order to understand the consequences of our actions. the impact report seeks to present a balanced review of our
economic, social and environmental impact.


economic impact
as sri lanka’s largest private sector bank and bangladesh’s 3rd largest foreign bank, our economic impact on sri lanka is
considerable whilst that of in bangladesh is not significant given the lower footprint in that country. our economic performance
is discussed in 'financial capital report' on pages 154 to 159. the table below gives our track record for adding value in our
principal geographic locations.

a positive impact – social impact




social impact
we invest in communities to empower people and support their development as part of our normal business and also through
the csr trust established in 2004. the csr trust receives up to 1% of our post tax profits and engages in activities which are
completely altruistic with no expectation of a financial return to the bank.

the integration of csr endeavours in business operating activities of the bank has been identified as highly essential to ensure
sustainable development of an economy in a broader sense. in the financial sector several international initiatives such as united
nations environment programme’s finance initiative, global reporting initiative are underway to ensure the healthy adoption of
csr practices in routine business operations that the bank very well adheres to.

12. net interest income
interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the eir method. the ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that
exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts throughout the expected life of the financial asset or financial
liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. when calculating
the effective interest rate, the group estimates future cash flows, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but
not future credit losses.

the calculation of the eir includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the eir.
transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

interest income and expense presented in the income statement include:
zz interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated using eir method;

zz held-for-trading calculated using eir method;

zz interest on available-for-sale investment securities calculated using eir method;

zz the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in cash flow hedges of variability in

  interest cash flows, in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect interest income/expense, if any; and
zz the effective portion of fair value changes in qualifying hedging derivatives designated in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, if any.

13. net fees and commission income
fees and commission income and expenses that are integral to the eir of a financial asset or liability are capitalised and included
in the measurement of the eir and recognised in the income statement over the expected life of the instruments.
other fees and commission income, including account servicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission,
placement fees and syndication fees, are recognised as the related services are performed. if a loan commitment is not expected
to result in the drawdown of a loan, then the related loan commitment fees are recognised on a straight-line basis over the
commitment period.
other fees and commission expenses relate mainly to transaction and service fees, which are expensed as the services are received.

the gains or losses on the disposal of assets is determined on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets at the
time of disposal and the proceeds of disposal, net of incremental disposal costs. this is recognised as an item of other income in
the year in which significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.


16.2 rental income
rental income is recognised in the profit or loss on an accrual basis.

notes to the financial statements




17. impairment charges for loans and other losses
individual assessment of impairment
individual assessment of impairment for financial assets carried at amortised cost (such as amounts due from banks, loans
and advances to customers as well as held to maturity investments), the group first assesses individually, whether objective
evidence of impairment exists for financial assets that are individually significant or collectively for financial assets that are not
individually significant. assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to
be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.

if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit
losses that have not yet been incurred). the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and
the amount of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. interest income continues to be accrued and recorded in ‘interest
income’ on the reduced carrying amount/impaired balance and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future
cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.

the present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original eir. if a loan has a variable
interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current eir. if the bank has reclassified trading assets to
loans and advances, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the new eir determined at the reclassification date.
the calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset, reflects the cash flows
that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable.

loans together with the associated impairment provision are written off when there is no realistic prospect of future recovery
and all collateral has been realised or has been transferred to the bank. if, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated
impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously
recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the provision account. if a future write-off is later recovered,
the recovery is credited to ‘other income’.

collective assessment of impairment
if the group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, it includes the
asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment.

for the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of the bank’s internal credit
grading system, that considers credit risk characteristics such as asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type,
past-due status and other relevant factors.

future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment, are estimated on the basis of
historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to those in the group. historical loss experience is
adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions on which the historical loss experience
is based and to remove the effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist currently. estimates of changes in future
cash flows reflect and are directionally consistent with changes in related observable data from year-to-year such as changes in;
zz interest rates,

zz inflation rates,

zz growth in gross domestic product (gdp),

zz global gdp growth rates,

zz countries’ sovereign ratings, ease of doing business indices,

zz exchange rates,

zz political stability,

zz portfolio factors including percentage of restructured performing loans.


the methodology and assumptions used for estimating provision for impairment including assumptions for projecting future cash
flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.			

details of impairment losses and provisions (both individual and collective) on financial assets carried at amortised cost and an
analysis of the impairment provision on loans and advances by class are given in note 32 on pages 300 to 307.

impairment of rescheduled loans and advances
where possible, the bank seeks to reschedule loans and advances rather than to take possession of collateral. this may involve
extending the payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan conditions. in case of individually significant rescheduled
credit facilities, once the terms have been renegotiated, any impairment is measured using the original eir as calculated
before the modification of terms and the loan/advance is no longer considered past due. the management continually reviews
renegotiated loans and advances to ensure that all criteria are met and that future repayments are likely to occur.

collateral valuation
the bank seeks to use collateral, where possible, to mitigate its risks on financial assets. the collateral comes in various forms
such as cash, gold, government securities, letters of credit/guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories, other non-financial
assets and credit enhancements such as netting agreements, etc. the fair value of collateral is generally assessed, at a minimum,
at inception and based on the bank’s annual reporting schedule.

collateral repossessed
the bank’s policy is to carry collaterals repossessed at fair value at the repossession date and such assets will be disposed at the
earliest possible opportunity. these assets are recorded under assets held for sale as per the sri lanka accounting standard –
slfrs 5 on ‘non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’.

notes to the financial statements




18.1 salary, bonus and pension costs
salary, bonus and contributions to defined contribution/benefit plans, reported above also include amounts paid to and
contribution made on behalf of executive directors.


18.2 share based payment
the bank has an equity-settled share based compensation plan, the details of which are given in note 52.


18.3 others
this includes expenses such as overtime payments, medical and hospitalisation charges, expenses incurred on staff
training/recruitment and staff welfare activities, etc.


19. depreciation and amortisation
depreciation
depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of property, plant & equipment less their estimated residual values using
the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is recognised in profit or loss. leased assets under finance leases
are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. freehold land is not depreciated.

the estimated useful lives of the property, plant & equipment of the bank as at december 31, 2015 are as follows:		


 class of asset                            depreciation %         period
                                              per annum

 freehold and leasehold buildings                    2.5      40 years
 motor vehicles                                       20       5 years
 computer equipment                                   20       5 years
 office equipment                                     20       5 years
 office interior work                                 20       5 years
 furniture & fittings                                 10      10 years
 machinery & equipment                                10      10 years



the above rates are compatible with the rates used by all group entities.

the depreciation rates are determined separately for each significant part of an item of property, plant & equipment and
commence to depreciate when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by the management. depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is
classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised.

all classes of property, plant & equipment together with the reconciliation of carrying amounts and accumulated depreciation at
the beginning and at the end of the year are given in note 37 on pages 320 to 332.

depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each reporting date and adjusted, if required.

amortisation of intangible assets
intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method to write down the cost over its estimated useful economic lives,
at the rates specified below:

  class of asset                                amortisation %     period
                                                   per annum

  computer software                                        20    5 years



the above rate is compatible with the rates used by all group entities.

the unamortised balances of intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment
and recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are no longer probable of being recovered from the expected future benefits.

notes to the financial statements




20.1 directors’ emoluments
directors’ emoluments represent the fees paid to both executive and non-executive directors of the group.


21. income tax expense
income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. income tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except to
the extent it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in oci.
						
current taxation
‘current tax’ comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to
the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. it is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, at the
reporting date.

accordingly, provision for taxation is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year, as adjusted for taxation purposes,
in accordance with the provisions of the inland revenue act no. 10 of 2006 and amendments thereto, at the rates specified in
note 21.1 on page 281. this note also includes the major components of tax expense, the effective tax rates and a reconciliation
between the profit before tax and tax expense, as required by the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 12 on ‘income taxes’.

provision for taxation on the overseas operation is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year, as adjusted for taxation
purposes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statutes in those countries, using the tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted, at the reporting date.


deferred taxation
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. deferred tax is not recognised for:
zz temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that

  affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; 						
zz temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the

  foreseeable future; and 						
zz taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.



deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. deferred tax assets are reviewed at
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

the measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the group expects, at the
reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

additional taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends by the group are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay
the related dividend is recognised. these amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss as they generally relate to income
arising from transactions that were originally recognised in profit or loss.

22. earnings per share (eps)
the group computes basic and diluted eps data for its ordinary shares. basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit or loss that
is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the group/bank by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during
the period. diluted eps is determined by adjusting the profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the group/bank
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares,
which comprise share options granted to employees.

details of basic and diluted eps are given below:

dividend of rs. 3.00 per share and the balance entitlement of rs.2.00 per share will be satisfied in the form of issue and allotment
of new shares for both voting and non-voting ordinary shareholders of the bank for the year ended december 31, 2015
(bank declared a final dividend of rs. 4.00 per share in 2014 and this was satisfied by way of rs. 2.00 per share in the form
of cash and rs. 2.00 per share in the form of shares). the total dividend recommended by the board is to be approved at the
forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on march 31, 2016. in accordance with provisions of the sri lanka accounting
standard no.10 on ‘events after the reporting period’. the proposed final dividend has not been recognised as a liability as at
the year end. final dividend payable for the year 2015 has been estimated at rs. 4,384.334 mn. (actual final dividend for 2014
amounted to rs. 3,466.221 mn. due to exercise of options under esops).

accordingly, the dividend per ordinary share (for both voting and non-voting) for the year 2015 would be rs. 6.50 (2014 – rs. 6.50).

25. fair value measurement
the group measures the fair value using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used
in making the measurement. an analysis of fair value measurement of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is
provided below.

level 1
inputs that are unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.

when available, the group measures the fair value of an instrument using active quoted prices or dealer price quotations
(assets and long positions are measured at a bid price; liabilities and short positions are measured at an ask price), without
any deduction for transaction costs. a market is regarded as active if transactions for asset or liability take place with sufficient
frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

level 2
inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices) this category includes instruments valued using;
(a) quoted market in active markets for similar instruments,
(b) quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered to be less active, or
(c) other valuation techniques in which almost all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.


level 3
inputs that are unobservable,
this category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and
the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s value.

valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models comparison with similar instruments for which
observable market prices exist, option pricing models and other valuation models.

assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, risk premiums in estimating
discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign exchange rates, expected price volatilities and corrections.

observable prices or model inputs such as market interest rates are usually available in the market for listed equity securities and
government securities such as treasury bills and bonds. availability of observable prices and model inputs reduces the need for
management judgement and estimation while reducing uncertainty associated in determining the fair values.

models are adjusted to reflect the spread for bid and ask prices to reflect costs to close out positions, credit and debit valuation
adjustments, liquidity spread and limitations in the models. also, profit or loss calculated when such financial instruments are
first recorded (‘day 1’ profit or loss) is deferred and recognised only when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of
the instrument.

25.3 financial instruments not measured at fair value and fair value hierarchy
methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair value of financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair value
in the statement of financial position are as follows.


fixed rate financial instruments
the fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost (eg. fixed rate loans and receivables, due to
other customers, subordinate liabilities) are estimated based on the discounted cash flow approach. this approach employs the
current market interest rates of similar financial instruments as a significant unobservable input in measuring the fair value and
hence it is categorised under level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.


sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used to measure fair value of fixed rate financial instruments.
a significant increase/(decrease) in the market interest rate would result in lower/(higher) fair value being disclosed.


assets for which fair value approximates carrying value
for financial assets and liabilities with short term maturities or with short term re-pricing intervals, it is assumed that the carrying
amounts approximate to their fair value. this assumption is also applied to demand deposits and savings deposits which do not
have a specific maturity.

the following table sets out the fair values of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value and related fair
value hierarchy:

notes to the financial statements




29. derivative financial assets
the bank uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, etc.
derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as assets when their fair value is positive. changes in the fair value of derivatives
are included in ‘net gains/(losses) from trading’ (under customers) in the income statement.
derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their
economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract, and the host contract is not itself held for
trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. the embedded derivatives separated from the host are carried at fair
value in the trading portfolio with changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss.

30. other financial instruments - held-for-trading
financial assets are classified as held-for-trading if;
they are acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term; or
they hold as a part of a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit or position taking; or
they form part of derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge
relationships as per the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 39 on ‘financial instruments: recognition and measurement’.
financial assets held-for-trading are recorded in the statement of financial position at fair value. changes in fair value are recognised
in profit or loss. interest and dividend income are recorded in ‘interest income’ and ‘net gains/(losses) from trading’ respectively in
the income statement according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to receive the payment has been established.
the group evaluates its financial assets held-for-trading, other than derivatives, to determine whether the intention to sell
them in the near term is still appropriate. when the group is unable to trade these financial assets due to inactive markets and
management’s intention to sell them in the foreseeable future significantly changes, the group may elect to reclassify these
financial assets in rare circumstances.
financial assets held-for-trading include instruments such as government and other debt securities and equity instruments that
have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term and derivatives, including separated
embedded derivatives explained below unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

‘loans and receivables to banks’ comprised of non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market, other than:				
zz those that the group intends to sell immediately or in the near term and those that the group, upon initial recognition, designates

  as at fair value through profit or loss.				
zz those that the group, upon initial recognition, designates as available-for-sale.				

zz those for which the group may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration.

  			
‘loans and receivables to banks’ include amounts due from banks. after initial measurement, ‘loans and receivables to banks
and other customers’ are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eir, less provision for impairment, except when the
group designates loans and receivables at fair value through profit or loss. amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the eir. the amortisation is included in
‘interest income’ while the losses arising from impairment are recognised in ‘impairment charges for loans and other losses’ in the
income statement.

notes to the financial statements




the bank did not make any payments to counter party banks for the oil hedging transactions with effect from june 02, 2009 in
response to a directive received from the exchange controller of the central bank of sri lanka. consequently, one of the counter
party banks appropriated us$ 4.170 mn. (rs. 601.106 mn.) which has been kept as a deposit with them. this action has been
contested by the bank. in view of the stance taken by the bank in this regard, both the deposit (made by the bank) and amount
due to the said counter party bank, have been recorded in the statement of financial position.

32. loans and receivables to other customers
‘loans and receivables to other customers’ comprised of non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market, other than:
zz those that the group intends to sell immediately or in the near term and those that the group, upon initial recognition, designates

  as at fair value through profit or loss
zz those that the group, upon initial recognition, designates as available-for-sale					

zz those for which the group may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration.


‘loans and receivables to other customers’ include, loans & advances and lease receivables of the group.

when the group is the lessor in a lease agreement that transfers substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the
asset to the lessee, the arrangement is classified as a finance lease. amounts receivable under finance leases net of initial rentals
received, unearned lease income and provision for impairment are classified as lease receivable and are presented within ‘loans
and receivables to customers’ in the statement of financial position.

after initial measurement, ‘loans and receivables to other customers’ are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
eir, less provision for impairment except when the group designates loans and receivables at fair value through profit or loss.
amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an
integral part of the eir. the amortisation is included in ‘interest income’ while the losses arising from impairment are recognised in
‘impairment charges for loans and other losses’ in the income statement.

the bank may enter into certain lending commitments where the loan, on drawdown, is expected to be classified as held for
trading because the intent is to sell the loans in the short term. these commitments to lend, if any, are recorded as derivatives and
measured at fair value through profit or loss. where the loan, on drawdown, is expected to be retained by the bank and not sold in
the short term, the commitment is recorded only when it is an onerous contract that is likely to give rise to a loss.

33. financial investments – available-for-sale
available-for-sale financial investments include equity and debt securities. equity investments classified as available-for-sale are
those which are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss. debt securities in this
category are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response
to changes in the market conditions.

derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as liabilities when their fair value is negative.

the group has not designated any loans or receivables as available-for-sale. after initial measurement, available-for-sale financial
investments are subsequently measured at fair value.

unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity through oci in the ‘available-for-sale reserve’. when these financial
investments are disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit or loss in ‘other
operating income’. interest earned whilst holding available-for-sale financial investments is reported as ‘interest income’ using
the eir. dividend earned whilst holding available-for-sale financial investments are recognised in the income statement as ‘other
operating income’ when the right to receive the payment has been established. the losses arising from impairment of such
investments too are recognised in the income statement in ‘impairment losses on financial investments’ and removed from the
‘available-for-sale reserve’.

34. financial investments – loans and receivables
financial investments classified as loans and receivables’ include unquoted debt instruments. after initial measurement, these
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eir, less provision for impairment. amortised cost is calculated by taking
into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the eir. the amortisation is
included in ‘interest income’ while the losses arising from impairment are recognised in ‘impairment charges for loans and other
losses’ in the income statement.

35. investments in subsidiaries
subsidiaries are investees controlled by the group. the group ‘controls’ an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
the group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. this includes
circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a lending relationship) become substantive and lead to the
group having power over an investee.

the cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration. the acquired
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. subsequent to the
initial measurement the bank continues to recognise the investments in subsidiaries at cost.

the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control
commences until the date when control ceases.

the financial statements of all subsidiaries in the group have a common financial year which ends on december 31, except for
the serendib finance ltd., a licensed finance company, whose financial year ends on march 31. the financial statements of the
bank’s subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies.

the reason for using a different reporting date by the aforesaid subsidiary is due to the requirement imposed by the central bank
of sri lanka for licensed finance companies to publish their key financial data and key performance indicators for 12-month period
ended march 31 and 6-month period ended september 30, every year, in accordance with a format prescribed by the director of
the department of supervision of non-bank financial institutions of the central bank of sri lanka.

all intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions, income and expenses
are eliminated in full.

there are no significant restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the parent (the bank) in the form of cash
dividend or repayment of loans and advances.

all subsidiaries of the bank have been incorporated in sri lanka except commex sri lanka s.r.l. which was incorporated in italy.

(*) the board of directors of the bank resolved to reduce the shareholding of commercial development company plc, (in which the bank had a stake of
94.55%) to comply with the requirements of the listing rule no. 7.13 of the colombo stock exchange on minimum public holding. accordingly, the bank
disposed 32,415 shares during the year through the colombo stock exchange and reduced the shareholding in the above company to 94.28% by december
31, 2015 and is in the process of taking steps to dispose the required number of shares to adhere to the requirements of the listing rules.
consequent to the above disposal, ownership interests of the bank has changed while retaining control. as per slfrs 10 on ‘consolidated financial
statements’, changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent losing control are equity transactions and hence, the
resulting gain/loss is recognised in equity. as majority of the share trades had occurred in december 2015, it was assumed that disposals took place on
december 31, 2015 for the purpose of reporting.									
(**) during the year, the bank was able to obtain the money transfer license from the bank of italy. however, the bank is yet to commence intended commercial
operations in italy and as such, made provisions for the expenses incurred on account of italy operations when finalising the banks’ financial statements.
as set out above, the bank does not have any subsidiaries with material non-controlling interest. accordingly, no additional disclosures have been made as
required by the slfrs 12 on ‘disclosure of interests in other entities’.


the maturity analysis of investments in subsidiaries is given in note 60 on pages 362 and 363.

36. investments in associates
associates are those entities in which the group has significant influence, but not control, over the variable returns through its
power over the investee. significant influence is presumed to exist when the group holds 20% or more of the voting power of
another entity.

investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost, in terms of sri lanka
accounting standards – lkas 28 on ‘investments in associates and joint venture’. the group’s investment includes goodwill
identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. the consolidated financial statements include the group’s
share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting
policies with those of the group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
accordingly, under the equity method, investments in associates are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group’s
share of net assets of the associates and are reported as a separate line item in the statement of financial position.
the income statement reflects the group’s share of the results of operations of the associates. any change in oci of those
investees is presented as part of the group’s oci. in addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity
of the associate, the group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in equity through oci. unrealised gains and
losses resulting from transactions between the group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in associate.

when the group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including
any long term investments, is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the group
has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. if the associate subsequently reports profits, the group resumes
recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equal the share of losses not recognised previously.

the group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date that it ceases to have significant influence over an associate
and accounts for such investments in accordance with the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 39 on ‘financial instruments:
recognition and measurement’.

upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value.
any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained
investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

notes to the financial statements




after application of the equity method, the group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its
investment in its associate. at each reporting date, the group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment
in the associate is impaired. if there is such evidence, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between
the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value then recognises the loss as ‘share of profit of an associate’ in the
income statement.

notes to the financial statements




37. property, plant & equipment
the group applies the requirements of the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 16 on ‘property, plant & equipment’ in accounting
for its owned assets (including buildings under operating leases where the group is the lessor) which are held for and use in the
provision of services, for rental to others or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one year.

basis of recognition
property, plant & equipment are recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the
group and cost of the asset can be reliably measured.								

basis of measurement
an item of property, plant & equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost. cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent costs (excluding the costs of day-to-day
servicing) as explained in the note on ‘subsequent cost’. the cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and
direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of
dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. purchased
software which is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of computer equipment.
when parts of an item of property or equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items
(major components) of property and equipment.

   cost model
    the group applies the cost model to all property, plant & equipment except freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings
    and records at cost of purchase together with any incidental expenses thereon, less accumulated depreciation and any
    accumulated impairment losses.

   revaluation model
    the group applies the revaluation model for the entire class of freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings for
    measurement after initial recognition. such properties are carried at revalued amounts, being their fair value at the date of
    revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and any accumulated impairment losses charged
    subsequent to the date of valuation. freehold land and buildings of the group are revalued by independent professional valuers
    every three years or more frequently if the fair values are substantially different from their carrying amounts to ensure that the
    carrying amounts do not differ from the fair values at the reporting date. 							
    		
    on revaluation of an asset, any increase in the carrying amount is recognised in revaluation reserve in equity through oci
    or used to reverse a previous loss on revaluation of the same asset, which was charged to the income statement. in this
    circumstance, the increase is recognised as income only to the extent of the previous write down in value. any decrease
    in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense in the income statement or charged to revaluation reserve in equity
    through oci, only to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation reserve in respect of that asset. any balance
    remaining in the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset, is transferred directly to retained earnings on retirement or
    disposal of the asset.
    the group revalued all its freehold land and freehold and leasehold buildings as at december 31, 2014. methods and
    significant assumptions including unobservable market inputs employed in estimating the fair value together with the sensitivity
    of same are given in note 37.5 (b) on pages 326 to 330.

subsequent cost
subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the
group. ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

an item of property, plant & equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its
use. any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and
the carrying amount of the asset), is recognised in ‘other income (net)’ in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

when replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of property, plant & equipment, the remaining carrying
amount of the replaced part is derecognised as required by sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 16 on ‘property, plant & equipment’.

capital work-in-progress
these are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system
development, awaiting capitalisation. these are stated in the statement of financial position at cost less any accumulated
impairment losses. capital work-in-progress is transferred to the relevant asset when it is in the location and condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management (i.e. available for use).

  market comparable method
  this method considers the selling price of a                      price per perch for land                               estimated fair value would increase
  similar property within a reasonably recent                       price per squire foot for building                     (decrease) if;		
  period of time in determining the fair value of the               depreciation rate for building                         price per perch would higher (lower)
  property being revalued. this involves evaluation                                                                        price per squire feet would higher (lower)
  of recent active market prices of similar assets,                                                                        depreciation rate for building would
  making appropriate adjustments for differences                                                                           lower (higher)
  in size, nature, location, condition of specific
  property. in this process, outlier transactions,
  indicative of particularly motivated buyers or

notes to the financial statements




38. intangible assets
the group’s intangible assets include the value of acquired goodwill and computer software.


basis of recognition
an intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the
cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 38 on ‘intangible assets’.

intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. the cost of intangible assets acquired in a
business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. following initial recognition, these assets are stated in the
statement of financial position at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.


subsequent expenditure
subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. all other expenditure is expensed as incurred.


useful economic lives, amortisation and impairment
the useful economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. the group does not possess intangible
assets with indefinite useful economic lives. useful economic lives, amortisation and impairment of finite and indefinite intangible
assets are described below:
zz intangible assets with finite lives and amortisation

intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic lives. the amortisation period and the amortisation
method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each reporting date. changes in the expected useful
life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates, which require prospective
application. the amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is expensed as incurred.
zz goodwill

goodwill that arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets (refer note 5.1.1 on page 257). goodwill
is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for
non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. for the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the group’s
cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the
acquiree are assigned to those units.
zz computer software

software acquired by the group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the group is able to demonstrate its intention and
ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and can reliably
measure the costs to complete the development. the capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly
attributable to developing the software and capitalised borrowing costs, and are amortised over its useful life. internally developed
software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the
specific asset to which it relates. all other expenditure is expensed as incurred.

                                                                                                        notes to the financial statements




zz research and development costs

research costs are expensed as incurred. development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible
asset when the group can demonstrate:
    the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale.
    its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset.
    the asset will generate future economic benefits.
    the availability of resources to complete the asset.
    the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development.
    the ability to use the intangible asset generated.

following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

as at the reporting date, the group does not have development costs capitalised as an internally-generated intangible asset.

notes to the financial statements




42. derivative financial liabilities
financial liabilities are classified as held-for-trading, if they are incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing in the near
term or holds as a part of a portfolio that is managed together for short term profit or position taking.
this category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the group that are not designated as hedging instruments
in hedge relationships as per the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 39 on ‘financial instruments: recognition and
measurement’. separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held-for-trading unless they are designated as effective
hedging instruments.
derivatives are recorded at fair value and carried as liabilities when their fair value is negative. gains or losses on financial
liabilities held-for-trading are recognised in the income statement.

since the new tax rates had not been published through a gazette by the parliament as at the reporting date, being december
31, 2015, the new rate was not considered to be substanially enacted as at that date. accordingly, the group/bank has provided
for deferred taxation at the existing rate of 28% in the financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2015.

the potential impact on the deferred tax had the group/bank applied the proposed rate as above is shown below:

47. other provisions
a provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be
estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. provisions
are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. the unwinding of the discount is recognised in ‘interest expense’
in profit or loss.

51.2 employee share option plan – 2008
the bank obtained the approval of the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on april 16, 2008, to introduce
an employee share option plan for the benefit of all the executive officers in grade iii and above by creating up to 3% of the
ordinary voting shares at the rate of 1% shares each year over a period of three to five years, upon the bank achieving specified
performance targets.

option price is determined on the basis of the weighted average market price of bank’s voting shares, during the period of ten
market days immediately prior to each option offer date.

number of options offered under each tranche is based on the overall performance of the bank and the individual performance
of the eligible employees in the preceding year. in the event of a rights issue of shares, capitalisation of reserves, stock splits or
stock dividends by the bank during the vesting period, the number of options offered and the price are suitably adjusted as per
the applicable rules of esop – 2008 which have been drafted in line with the accepted market practices.

1/3 of the options offered under each tranche is vested to eligible employees after one year from the date of offer, second 1/3 of
the options after two years from the date of offer and final 1/3 after three years from the date of offer as detailed below:

all options are to be settled by physical delivery of ordinary voting shares of the bank. there are neither cash settlement
alternatives nor the bank has a past practice of cash settlement for these type of options.

the exercise price of each tranche is computed based on a volume-weighted average market price of the bank’s ordinary (voting)
shares, during the period of thirty (30) market days, on six months prior to the date of vesting.

52.2 measurement of fair value
as required by slfrs 2 on ‘share-based payment’, the fair value of the esop 2015 was estimated at the grant date using
the binomial valuation model taking into consideration various terms and conditions upon which the share options are granted.

the inputs used in measurement of fair value at the grant date of esop 2015 were as follows:

                                                                                                    tranches

share price increases stated above have been based on evaluation of the historical volatility of the bank’s share price over past 10
years, adjusted for post war growth in all share price index published by the colombo stock exchange.


52.3 reconciliation of outstanding share options
there were no outstanding options of esop 2015 as at december 31, 2015 since the vesting date has not yet reached.
[refer note 52.1 above].


52.4 expense recognised in income statement
the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent
to which the vesting period has expired and the group’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately
vest. accordingly, the expense in the income statement represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the
beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense [refer note 18].


53. statutory reserves				
several statutory and voluntary reserves are maintained by the group in order to meet various legal and operational requirements.
the details of these reserves including the nature and purpose of maintaining them are given in notes 53, 54 and 55 on pages 353

dividend or any profits that are transferred elsewhere until the reserve is equal to 50% of the bank’s stated capital and thereafter a
further sum equivalent to 2% of such profit until the amount of said the reserve fund is equal to the stated capital of the bank.

as per the direction issued by the public debt department of central bank of sri lanka on april 18, 2005, with effect from
july 01, 2005 primary dealers who maintain a capital above rs. 300 mn., were required to transfer 25% of post-tax profits of the
primary dealer unit to a special risk reserve annually. the bank duly complied with the above requirement up to december 31, 2013.

during 2014, the bank received a confirmation from the public debt – department of the central bank of sri lanka on the
cessation of maintaining a special risk reserve as the bank is functioning as a primary dealer. hence, the bank transferred the
balances that were built up in the above reserve to the general reserve.

57. contingent liabilities and commitments
contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present
obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be readily measured as defined in the sri lanka
accounting standard – lkas 37 on ‘provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’.

to meet the financial needs of customers, the bank enters into various irrevocable commitments and contingent liabilities. these
consist of financial guarantees, letters of credit and other undrawn commitments to lend. letters of credit and guarantees commit
the bank to make payments on behalf of customers in the event of a specific act, generally related to the import or export of
goods. guarantees and standby letters of credit carry a similar credit risk to loans.

contingent liabilities are not recognised in the statement of financial position but are disclosed unless its occurrence is remote.

operating lease commitments of the group (as a lessor and as a lessee) form part of commitments and pending legal claims
against the group form part of contingencies.

even though these obligations may not be recognised on the statement of financial position, they do contain credit risk and are
therefore part of the overall risk of the bank as disclosed in note 57.1 on page 359.

in the normal course of business, the bank makes various irrevocable commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities with
legal recourse to its customers. even though these obligations may not be recognised on the date of the statement of financial
position, they do contain credit risk and are therefore form part of the overall risk profile of the bank.

61. operating segments
an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and
incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components, whose
operating results are reviewed regularly by the corporate management team headed by the managing director/chief executive
officer (being the chief operating decision-maker) to make decisions about resources allocated to each segment and assess its
performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

the group has five strategic divisions which are reportable segments, namely:

segment performance is evaluated based on operating profits or losses which, in certain respects, are measured differently from
operating profits or losses in the consolidated financial statements. income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not
allocated to operating segments.

the following table presents the income, profit, asset and liability information on the group’s strategic business divisions for the
year ended december 31, 2015 and comparative figures for the year ended december 31, 2014.

62. related party disclosures
the bank carried out transactions in the ordinary course of business on an arm’s length basis at commercial rates with parties
who are defined as related parties as per the sri lanka accounting standard – lkas 24 ‘related party disclosures’, except
for the transactions that the key management personnel (kmp) have availed under schemes uniformly applicable to all staff at
concessionary rates.


62.1 parent and ultimate controlling party
the bank does not have an identifiable parent of its own.


62.2 key management personnel (kmp)
key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the
activities of the entity directly or indirectly.


kmp of the bank
the board of directors (including executive and non-executive) of the bank have been classified as kmp of the bank.


kmp of the group
as the bank is the ultimate parent of the subsidiaries listed out in page 249, the board of directors of the bank have the authority
and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group directly or indirectly. accordingly, the board
of directors of the bank (including executive and non-executive) are also kmp of the group. therefore, officers who are only
directors of the subsidiaries and not of the bank have been classified as kmp only for that respective subsidiary.

introduction
as a financial intermediary, the bank is exposed to various types of risks including credit, market, liquidity and operational
risks which are inherent in the bank’s activities. managing these risks is critical for the sustainability of the bank and
plays a pivotal role in all activities of the bank. risk management function strives to identify potential risks in advance, analyse
them and take precautionary steps to mitigate the impact of risk whilst optimising through risk adjusted returns within the risk
appetite of the bank.


risk management framework
the overall responsibility and oversight of the risk management framework of the bank is vested with the board of directors
(bod). the board integrated risk management committee (birmc), a mandatory sub-committee set up by the board, in turn is
entrusted with the development of the bank’s risk management policies and monitoring of due compliance of same through the
executive integrated risk management committee (eirmc).

                                                                                                    notes to the financial statements




the risk management policies spell out the risk appetite of the bank and has incorporated risk exposure limits and controls
to monitor adherence to the limits in force. these policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect the changing market
conditions and the products and services offered.

the bank strives to inculcate a risk management culture through continuous training, work ethics and standards.

refer note 3 on pages 253 to 256 for more information on the risk management framework of the bank.


integrated risk management department (irmd)
business units are the risk owners and have the primary responsibility for risk management. the irmd acts as the second line of
defence in managing the risk. the irmd through chief risk officer reports to the birmc thus ensuring its independence.


risk measurement and reporting
the bank uses robust risk measurement techniques based on the type of risk and industry best practices. the bank also carries
out stress testing which is a key aspect of the internal capital adequacy assessment process (icaap) and the risk management
framework and provides an insight on the impact of extreme, but plausible scenarios on the bank’s risk profile. the results are
reported to the eirmc and to the birmc on a periodic basis.

the bank establishes policies, limits and thresholds within the risk appetite. these limits reflect the business strategy and market
environment of the bank as well as the level of risk that the bank is willing to accept (risk appetite). the monitoring and control
mechanism therefore, is based on risk appetite of the bank.


67.1 credit risk
the financial loss resulting from a borrower or counterparty to a financial instrument failing or delaying to meet its contractual
obligations is referred to as credit risk. it arises principally from the loans and receivables to banks and other customers and
investments in debt securities. in addition to the credit risk from direct funding exposure i.e., on-balance sheet exposure, indirect
liabilities such as letters of credit, guarantees etc. also would expose the bank to credit risk.

the bank considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure (such as individual obliger default risk, country and
sector concentration risks) to ensure stringent credit risk management.

the methodology of the impairment assessment is explained in the note 17 on pages 276 and 277.


67.1.1 (c) credit risk exposure for each internal credit rating on facilities and historical default rates
through adoption of a robust risk grading system that falls in line with basel requirements, the bank maintains accurate
and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio in accordance with the established policy framework to ensure the quality
of its credit portfolio. the risk grading framework consists of several ratings of risks to represent varying degrees of risks as
an indicator for lending officers to evaluate the overall risk profile of counterpart and to arrive at an acceptable risk return
trade-off. it also provides a tool for the management to assess the credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic
regions and products. the risk grading of the borrowers are reviewed at least annually or more frequently in a deteriorating risk
profile of the counterparties.

67.1.3 collateral held
loan to value ratio of residential mortgage lending
the table below stratifies mortgaged credit exposures to retail customers by ranges of loan-to-value (ltv) ratio. ltv is calculated
as the ratio of the gross amount of the loan to the value of the collateral which is also used to compute the risk weighted assets for
the calculation of capital adequacy ratios. the value of the collateral for residential mortgage loan is based on the forced sale value
determined by professional valuers.

* ltv ratio of more than 100% was due to the inflated numerator resulted from subsequent disbursements made to the borrower which was compared against
the initial fair value of the property (the denominator).


assets obtained by taking the possession of collaterals
repossession of collaterals is resorted to in extreme situations where action is necessitated to recover the dues. the repossessed
assets are disposed, in an orderly and transparent manner and the proceeds are used to reduce or recover the outstanding claims.


67.1.4 concentrations of credit risk
by setting various concentration limits under different criteria within the established risk appetite framework (i.e., single borrower/
group, industry sectors, product, counterparty and country etc.), the bank ensures that an acceptable level of risk diversification
is maintained on an ongoing basis. these limits are continuously monitored and periodically reviewed by the credit policy
committee, the executive integrated risk management committee and the board integrated risk management committee to
capture the developments in market, political and economical environment both locally and internationally to strengthen the
dynamic portfolio management practices and to provide an early warning on possible credit concentrations.

67.1.4 (b) geographical distribution of loans and receivables portfolio
the western province has recorded a higher percentage of lending based on geographical distribution of the bank’s lending
portfolio. it has accounted for 76% (approximately) of total advances portfolio of the bank (excluding bangladesh operation) as
at december 31, 2015. although, western province is vested with highest credit concentration, we believe that a sizable portion
of these lending has been utilised to facilitate industries scattered around the country. for example, most of the large corporates
which have island-wide operations are being accommodated by the branches and corporate banking division situated in the
western province thereby reflecting a fairly diversified geographical concentration on such borrowers.

67.2 liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the bank’s inability to meet on or off-balance sheet contractual and contingent financial obligations, as they fall
due without incurring unacceptable losses. the principal objective in liquidity risk management is to assess the need for funds to
meet such obligations and to ensure the availability of adequate funding to fulfil those needs at the appropriate time, under both
normal and stressed conditions.

therefore, the bank continuously analyses and monitors its liquidity profile, maintains adequate levels of high quality liquid assets,
ensures access to diverse funding sources and has contingency funding agreements with peer banks to meet any unforeseen the
liquidity requirements. exposures and ratios against tolerance limits as well as stressed scenarios are regularly monitored in order
to identify the bank’s liquidity position and potential funding requirements.


assets and liability management committee (alco)
alco chaired by the managing director, has representatives from treasury, corporate banking, personal banking, risk and finance
departments. the committee meets fortnightly or more frequently to monitor and manage the assets and liabilities of the bank and
also the overall liquidity position to keep the bank’s liquidity at healthy levels, whilst satisfying the regulatory requirements.

interest rate risk. the bank’s policy is to continuously monitor portfolios and adopt hedging strategies to ensure that interest rate
risk is maintained within prudent levels.

the tables below analyse the bank’s interest rate risk exposure on financial assets and financial liabilities. the bank’s assets and
liabilities are included at carrying amount and categorised by the earlier of contractual re-pricing or maturity dates.

notes to the financial statements




67.3.2 (b) exposure to interest rate risk – non-trading portfolio (rate shocks)
the management of interest rate risk against interest rate gap limits is supplemented by monitoring the sensitivity of the bank’s
financial assets and financial liabilities to various interest rate scenarios.

the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the bank’s income statement as at reporting date to a reasonable possible
change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant.

the graph below depicts the impact on the net interest income (nii) of sri lankan operations – rate shock of 100 bp on rupee
denominated assets and liabilities and 10 bp on fcy denominated assets and liabilities.




the impact of changes in interest rates on nii is measured using a static balance sheet which is subjected to 100bps and 10bps
shocks on rupee and foreign currency denominated interest earning assets and interest bearing liability portfolios, respectively.
thereafter, the potential impact on the bank’s profitability due to changes in rupee and foreign currency interest rates is evaluated
to ensure that the volatilities are prudently managed within the internal tolerance limits. above graph depicts the sensitivity of nii
to rate shocks during the years 2014 and 2015. right throughout 2015, the impact of rate shocks on projected nii has been well
below the management action trigger (mat) limit. since august, 2014 the impact has gradually decreased due to the conscious
decision of the bank to rebalance the fixed income securities (fis) portfolio.

rate to assess the exposure to foreign exchange risk. an appropriate shock based on historical us$/lkr exchange rate is
applied on the nop which is measured against the board approved threshold limits.

67.4 operational risk
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.
operational risk events which include legal and regulatory implications could lead to financial and reputation losses to the bank.

the operational risk management framework of the bank has been defined under the board approved operational risk
management policy. operational risk is managed by establishing an appropriate internal control system that requires a mechanism
for segregation of related responsibilities within the bank, and a detailed testing and verification of the bank’s overall operational
systems, and achieving a full harmony between internal and external systems and establishing a fully independent back-up facility
for business continuity planning.

for more details on ‘operational risk’ refer page 135 of the section on ‘managing risk at commercial bank’.


67.5 capital management
objective
the bank is required to manage its capital taking into account the need to meet the regulatory requirements as well as the current
and future business needs, stakeholder expectations and available options for raising capital.


67.5.1 regulatory capital
capital adequacy ratio (car) is calculated based on the cbsl directions stemming from basel ii accord. these guidelines
require the bank to maintain a car of not less than 5% with core capital (tier i) in relation to total risk-weighted assets
and a minimum overall car of 10% inclusive of tier i and tier ii (supplementary capital) in relation to total risk-weighted assets.

the bank’s regulator, the central bank of sri lanka sets and monitors capital requirements for the bank as a whole.

historically, the bank has been maintaining a relatively higher car, stability and reliance.

the higher level of capital maintained by the bank too contributed to the growth of the bank.

the bank has a well-structured corporate planning and budgeting procedure. capital budgeting decisions are arrived at after
evaluating the impact of such decisions on the income of the bank.


67.5.2 capital allocation						
management uses regulatory capital ratios to monitor its capital base. the allocation of capital between specific operations and
activities, to a large extent, driven by optimisation of the return achieved on the capital allocated. the amount of capital allocated
to each operation or activity is based primarily on regulatory capital requirements, but in some cases the regulatory requirements
do not fully reflect the varying degree of risk associated with different activities. in such cases, the capital requirements may be
flexed to reflect differing risk profiles, subject to the overall level of capital to support a particular operation or activity not falling
below the minimum requirements for regulatory.


68. events after the reporting date
no circumstances have arisen since the reporting date which would require adjustments or disclosure in the financial statements
other than disclosed below:


68.1 final dividend – 2015
the board of directors of the bank have recommended the payment of a final dividend of rs. 5/- per share which consist of a cash
dividend of rs. 3/- per share and the balance entitlement of rs. 2/- per share that will be satisfied in the form of
issue and allotment of new shares for both voting and non-voting ordinary shareholders of the bank for the year ended december
31, 2015.

this dividend is yet to be approved at the annual general meeting to be held on march 31, 2016. in accordance with the sri lanka
accounting standard no.10 – ‘events after the reporting period’, this proposed final dividend has not been recognised as a
liability as at december 31, 2015. under the inland revenue act no. 10 of 2006, a withholding tax of 10% has been imposed on
dividends declared.

compliance with sections 56 and 57 of the companies act no. 07 of 2007
as required by section 56 of the companies act no. 07 of 2007, the board of directors of the bank satisfied the solvency test in
accordance with the section 57, prior to recommending the final dividend. a statement of solvency completed and duly signed by
the directors on february 24, 2016 has been audited by kpmg.
