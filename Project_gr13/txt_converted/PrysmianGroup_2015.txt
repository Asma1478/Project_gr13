   letter to stakeholders

   the prysmian group confirmed its commitment to sustain-
   ability during 2014 by renewing investment in the search
   for sustainable products, strengthening the process for
   developing its human resources and participating actively in
   projects and initiatives carried out in the public interest, as
   well as by reducing where possible the environmental impact
   of its products and production activities. various initiatives
   commenced during the year, representing important mile-
   stones in the group’s pursuit of sustainability and seeking to
   generate short and medium-term benefits for all stakeholders.
   these efforts were accompanied by work to spread a culture of
   sustainability throughout the organisation and by ever more
   complete and effective reporting, with an increase in the
   breadth and depth of the economic, social and environmental
   matters addressed. in particular, this sustainability report
   applies the new «sustainability reporting guidelines g4»
   defined in 2013 by the gri – global reporting initiative, which
   place greater emphasis on the matters considered important
   for the group and its stakeholders. in addition, with a view to
   guaranteeing the reliability of the information contained in
   this report, deloitte was appointed once again to check the
   details provided and release an auditors’ report.
   the sustainability strategy adopted by the group focuses
   on such key topics as sustainable, technological innovation
   in the solutions offered, the environmental responsibility
   of production processes, the management of relations with
   the local communities in which the group operates, safety at
   work and the development of personnel.
   with regard to the economic and financial responsibilities
   of the group, relations with the financial market were
   particularly intense during 2014, involving more than 400
   meetings with institutional investors, whether in the form of
   conference calls or one-to-one or group sessions. in addition,
   following the success achieved at international level last
   year, prysmian has repeated the yes (your employee shares)
   programme. this scheme enables employees to acquire
   shares on discounted terms, with a view to enhancing their        sustainable cable for electrical circuits to use recyclable raw

1900-1950          both companies expanded by internal growth during the first half of the 20th century, broadening
                   their product ranges and opening factories in such strategic markets as spain, the united kingdom,
                   north america, argentina and brazil.

1990-2000          the 1990s saw both companies engaged on acquisitions followed by major restructuring work, with
                   a view to expanding their industrial and commercial activities.

2005               pirelli cavi was sold by pirelli and prysmian was founded.

2007               prysmian was listed on the milan exchange’s ftse mib.

2010               prysmian became a public company. the assets and know-how accumulated in more than a century
                   of history allow the company to pursue growth in markets and businesses with a high degree of value added.

2011               the acquisition of draka by prysmian gave birth to a new world leader in the cables sector:
                   the prysmian group.

                         the group re-opened the
                         yes (your employee shares)
                         programme        in    february
    2015. this scheme, serviced by treasury shares,
    enables employees to acquire prysmian shares at
    discounts of up to 25%. the scheme was launched
    in 27 countries during 2013 and communicated via the
    production of 17,000 information kits in 25 different
    languages. the details and benefits were explained
    by a team of 250 ambassadors selected specially for
    this purpose from the various business functions. the
    objective of the initiative is to increase the engage-
    ment, sense of belonging and business understanding
    of our employees, making them owners of a small part
    of the group in which they work and strengthening
    the internal perception of the prysmian group as “one
    company”. following the broad success achieved at in-
    ternational level last year, with 32% of employees taking
    the opportunity to purchase prysmian group shares, the
    company now seeks to make the yes programme an even
    greater success. for the same purposes, the group’s first
    app was launched at the end of 2014 in order to monitor
    the price of prysmian shares, thus enabling employees to
    monitor the performance of their shares.

code of ethics
“the code of ethics represents the group’s “constitution”, being the charter of rights and
moral duties that defines the ethical-social responsibilities of each participant
in the organisation”.
the structure of the prysmian group’s code of ethics rests on three pillars:

           ethics in business activities: the profit motive does not justify improper behaviour. profit must be achieved by
  1        respect for the rules and competitors, and by fair and transparent actions that anticipate and meet market needs,
           thus generating value for distribution to all stakeholders.

           ethics in internal relations: the group is aware of the importance of our ties with employees, which are strengthened
  2        by respecting their rights, expectations and needs, and by facilitating improvement in their living conditions and
           professional growth. the individual is central to all activities, as the engine for future development.

           ethics in environmental and social matters: given our strong belief in the principle of sustainable development, the
  3        prysmian group operates worldwide with respect for the environment and social communities; at the same time,
           we encourage the responsible use of resources and promote local projects designed to enhance well-being in the
           areas concerned.

all companies within the prysmian group agree to comply strictly with the code of ethics, applicable regulations and the rules
and procedures adopted from time to time by the group. in order to ensure the widest possible distribution of its contents, the
code of ethics - available in the 26 languages used by the group - is also published on the website, www.prysmiangroup.com.

           eco-sustainable solutions

afumex
cables with lower harmful emissions when in contact with
flames.
prysmian technology has perfected a generation of cables
under the afumex™ name using jacketing that is low smoke,
zero halogen (lsoh). on contact with flames, this type of
jacketing greatly limits the emissions of acidic gases, toxic
gases and smoke that often cause panic and physical injury
while also, from an ecological standpoint, corroding surfaces
and polluting the water table.
prysmian’s afumex cables have been used in some of the world’s
most prestigious buildings, where safety is paramount.

afumex green
the first ecological building wire.
the new afumex green cable, presented in the 450/750v class
and made at the sorocaba factory in brazil, replaces part of the
petroleum-based polymer with green polyethylene, which is a
100% recyclable material obtained from sugar cane. this initiative
is consistent with the efforts made by the group to offer customers
eco-sustainable products that reduce co2 emissions.
estimates indicate that for every tonne of green resin produced up
to 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide are captured and removed from the
atmosphere.

p-laser
the first ecological cable for electrical circuits.
p-laser is the first high performance, eco-sustainable cable for elec-
trical circuits. produced using recyclable materials, p-laser lowers the
environmental impact of circuits while also raising their efficiency and
power transportation capacity.
the prysmian group’s r&d department has completed a project that
compared the environmental impact of two different systems for the
production of medium voltage power cables: p-laser and xlpe. this
study used the carbon footprint methodology to quantify the entire
environmental impact of each system in terms of its emissions of co2
equivalent. the results showed that the co2 emissions associated with
p-laser cables are 30% of the total emissions attributable to xlpe cables,
being about 800-1,000 kg of co2 for each kilometre of cable produced.




      commitments for the future
in 2014, the group launched a project to identify and             products concerned, while also reducing the dissipation of

    investing in people


    for the prysmian group, intellectual capital and talent are
    strategic assets for the achievement of our profitability and
    value creation objectives and, as such, must be supported
    by appropriate actions to develop and enhance their worth.
    for all activities, the group relies on the performance of its
    people, be it the steady improvement of product quality, the
    expansion of markets, the management of customers or the
    acquisition of new businesses.
    consolidated processes for the management of human
    resources, incentives and personal motivation, combined
    with opportunities for international exchanges, ensure that
    group employees are able to grow both personally and pro-
    fessionally.
    prysmian launched a system of talent management back in
    2011 since, consistent with the group’s business strategies,
    there was clearly an important and urgent need to implement
    processes and initiatives designed to attract, develop,
    promote and retain talented personnel.
    during 2014, the group consolidated its personnel training
    and development programme, which is founded on the
    following four initiatives:

                 corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy
    with a view to defining common, shared rules within the group for identifying corporate citizenship and philanthropy initiatives
    correlated with business operations, during 2014 prysmian decided to update our policy regarding activities that benefit local
    communities.
    the group believes that access to energy and telecommunications is a prerequisite for the economic and social development of
    local communities and countries. for this reason, the corporate citizenship and philanthropy activities promoted by the group
    must be principally intended to support initiatives that facilitate access to energy and telecommunications by local communi-
    ties, with particular reference to those in developing countries.
    the group considers initiatives for the benefit of the community as those relating to:
    •     communities: long-term initiatives that aim to mitigate socio-environmental issues in the communities in which the
          group does business;
    •     charitable gifts: short-term initiatives, or one-off donations to non-governmental organisations and supranational and
          local non-profit organisations;
    •     commercial initiatives that benefit the community: initiatives that support prysmian’s success directly, conducted in
          partnership with community-based organisations.

     water consumption (m3)

     water consumption by the group in 2014 amounted to 7,421,534 m3, which was about 2% less than in the prior year and about
     17% lower than in 2012.
     the reduction in 2014 was principally due to a decline in the water consumption of the optical fibre category (-11.29%).

     with regard to the telecom sector, during 2014 the majority                        and a marked reduction in the energy sector (-16.7%): the
     (about 60%) of ozone-depleting gases were concentrated                             first was mainly due to the first-time inclusion of the wuhan
     at 2 factories, which implement a preventive maintenance                           factory in the scope of reporting, while the second was due
     programme for the equipment concerned (see box above).                             to the replacement - at some factories - of ozone-depleting
     compared with the prior year, there has been a slight increase                     refrigerant gases with “hfc” gases that are less problematic.
     in ozone-depleting substances in the telecom sector (4.9%)




     *   most of the ozone-depleting substances reported relate to hcfcs, especially freon (a.k.a. r-22), which is less problematic than other families of refrigerant
         gases already banned by law, such as cfc and halon.

     (1)   the information for the power cables category includes the telecom, energy and accessories operating units at the oulu factory (available information
           relates to each factory as a whole). the quantities produced in relation to such information have been normalised, so the telecom cables produced by the
           above operating units are identified in weight terms (rather than in km, as in the “telecom cables” category).
     (2)   hazardous and non-hazardous waste: the information for the power cables category includes combined data for the telecom and energy operating units at
           the bishopstoke factory, since this factory does not accumulate separate details for each unit (available information relates to the factory as a whole).
     (3)   water consumption and hazardous waste: the information for the power cables category includes combined data for the accessories and energy operating
           units at the gron factory, since this factory does not accumulate separate details for each unit (available information relates to the factory as a whole).
     (4)   the information is significant at sector level. in fact, the quantity of ozone-depleting substances does not relate to production activities and, accordingly, it
           is reported separately in total for the energy and telecom sectors.
     (5)   for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters, the volume of “power cables” produced is expressed in tonnes, being the sum of the weights
           of the cables produced in the years concerned (2013 and 2014) and the related compounds produced by prysmian, excluding the compounds purchased in the
           marketplace and simply added to the products.
     (6)   for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters, the production in km relates to finished optical fibre, excluding any semi-finished fibre sold
           as such by the “optical fibre” factories considered in this report.
     (7)   the production of “telecom cables” is expressed in km and obtained by summing the production of cables made from optical fibre, quantified in fibre km,
           and with those made from copper, quantified in pair km. the decision to use km rather than tonnes to quantify the total production of telecom cables was
           taken due to the fact that the unit of measure expressed in length reflects the production process (and the related impact of environmental parameters)
           more closely than the unit of measure of production expressed in weight terms.
     (8)   only absolute amounts are reported for accessories, since normalised units of production are not available for this category. in particular, the nature of
           production included in this category various considerably (connectors for cables, accessories for lifts etc.).




     *     the environmental data for the production sites not included in this analysis is not thought to be significant, with respect to the mass of environmental data
           reported, considering the low number of sites involved (maximum 5% of the total) and the limited extent of production at those locations.
