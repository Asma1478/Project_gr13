also in the environmental business, the cosmo group sup-

which is widely considered an effective fertilizer. we are work-
ing to expand the applications for ala, such as for hair growth
treatment and supplements and cosmetics.

today, we are making steady strides toward growth in the oil
exploration, petrochemical, and environmental business seg-

on the environmental business in addition to oil exploration, oil
reﬁning and sales, and petrochemicals.

risk management initiatives
the cosmo oil group has established a risk management committee2 to serve as an execu-
tion organization under the csr promotion committee. the risk management committee fol-
lows a plan-do-check-act (pdca) cycle with the following steps: 1) identify risks, 2) organize/
draw up countermeasures, 3) reevaluate risk and review countermeasures, 4) implement
countermeasures, and 5) monitor.
     after the great east japan earthquake, cosmo oil conducted a review of its earthquake
response measures. the company established new business continuity plans (bcp) against
major quakes that could occur in the tokai, tonankai and nankai regions, respectively, where
major earthquakes have occurred regularly in the past. the bcp for an earthquake occurring
directly beneath tokyo was also revised. on march 12, 2012, the company carried out a
general bcp training for the ﬁfth time, based on the hypothetical scenarios of earthquakes in
the tokai, tonankai, and nankai regions.

    fostering an acute awareness of
    safety in the workplace on the part of
    each and every employee is as impor-

    and systems to prevent accidents.
    the cosmo oil group focuses daily on
    safety in order to build an environment
    in which employees are able to work
    with peace of mind. placing the high-
    est priority on safety at all times and
    working to eliminate accidents entirely,
    the cosmo oil group is committed to
    building a society where all people can

                                                        the training on the simulator gave us conﬁdence about operating the real machinery.
                                                        having the training makes a big difference in terms of how easy it is to do the job. even

disaster drills
each year, disaster drills are conducted at the cosmo oil head ofﬁce and reﬁneries. in ﬁscal
2011, a disaster drill was carried out based on lessons learned from the great east japan
earthquake. the drill at the chiba reﬁnery, where a ﬁre broke out following the quake, included
a conﬁrmation of the system for notifying the government and nearby companies and was
conducted in cooperation with relevant government agencies and maruzen petrochemical co.,
ltd. which is located in the same industrial area.
      emergency drills assuming a tsunami warning were also carried out at the yokkaichi
reﬁnery, sakai reﬁnery, and sakaide reﬁnery, which would be affected in the case of an
earthquake in the historically active seismic zones of tonankai or nankai.
                                                                                                                   fireﬁghting drill using an elevated water cannon
      the cosmo oil group will continue to carry out disaster prevention training in order to
minimize the impact of any future disaster, including secondary disasters. in this way, the group
strives to earn the trust and conﬁdence of society, including people living near cosmo oil facilities.

         “using the volunteer leave program, i helped out with earthquake     surprisingly, my biggest shock came when i became the recipi-

         leave using the new program and paid absence.                        to make my own personal disaster readiness preparations.
               the reason i participated in volunteer earthquake                   that’s why this experience became an opportunity to renew
         reconstruction work was that i wanted to see the situation in the    my awareness of dangers on the job. i would also like to use

ecopower’s strengths and future growth
established in 1997, ecopower co., ltd., is a pioneer in the japanese
wind power industry and now plays a central role in the cosmo oil group’s
renewable energy business. it operates 128 wind turbines, mostly in tohoku
and hokkaido, where wind conditions are ideal. the company’s total gener-
ating capacity of about 146,000 kw is enough to power 80,000 homes.
      since joining the cosmo oil group, ecopower has focused on
improving its operating rates by rebuilding its maintenance system. it has
now established itself as a sustainable and proﬁtable business.
      since the great east japan earthquake, there have been growing
expectations for the creation of a renewable energy society. a feed-in tariff
(fit) scheme has also been introduced in japan, and there has been a major
shift toward the popularization of renewable energy. utilizing the expertise
that it has accumulated over the years, ecopower is actively expanding its
business, including the development of new power generation sites.

                                           protecting employee health by reducing long working hours
                                           in the third consolidated medium-term human rights/personnel plan, the cosmo oil group included
                                           the theme of prohibiting excessive work and implementing speciﬁed health exams in order to maintain
                                           employee health. the group is making efforts to decrease excessive working hours gradually. it sets
                                           limits on the number of overtime hours on a monthly and yearly basis. however, in ﬁscal 2011 the number
                                           of employees working long hours on a yearly basis increased by 87 from the previous year to 446. the
                                           increase is due to signiﬁcant overtime that was mainly accrued at reﬁneries and distribution sites for
                                           recovery efforts in response to the great east japan earthquake that occurred in march 2011. despite this
                                           temporary increase, the group is committed to reducing excessive working hours.

workplaces and the head ofﬁce departments that oversee these workplaces. in ﬁscal 2011, safety
inspections were conducted at 12 workplaces and departments, including three reﬁneries (except for the
chiba reﬁnery).2 especially in the inspection of reﬁneries, efforts are made to enable better, more effective
improvements and guidance from a third-party perspective by including personnel from other reﬁneries in                                                                                                                                            2. fiscal 2011 safety inspection

increased to 17.90 kiloliters of freight per trip, an improvement of 0.05 kiloliters year on year, while unit
energy consumption also improved to 36.26 kiloliters per trip, an improvement of 0.15 kiloliters year on
year. actual energy consumption from diesel oil was up 1.0% year on year, but the total freight volume
increased signiﬁcantly, so that the unit energy consumption improved year on year. the company will
continue striving to achieve further energy reductions through efﬁciency improvements centering on
systematic and driver-controlled deliveries.
     for marine transport involving the use of coastal tankers, the company is making ongoing efforts to
maintain high stowage rates and use larger tankers. however, due to circumstances such as accidents
at the chiba reﬁnery and production stoppages during the great east japan earthquake, unit energy
consumption from marine transport was 6.62 kl/mt-km, up 0.48 kl/mt-km, or 7.8% year on year. the
company will continue working to reduce energy consumption in ﬁscal 2012, taking into account the fact
that production will resume at the chiba reﬁnery.

being used at nine service stations, including those with led lighting
for canopies only, while new service stations are being designed
to incorporate all-led lighting including in signage. the cosmo oil

eco ofﬁce activities
the cosmo oil group conducts “eco ofﬁce” activities to reduce the amount of copy paper used, the
amount of fuel consumed by company vehicles and the amount of electricity consumed at its ofﬁces.
every employee is engaging in initiatives to achieve reduction targets set by each workplace.
     the group achieved each goal established for ﬁscal 2011, with targets being set by taking the aver-
age performance for the ﬁscal years from 2007 to 2009 and multiplying it by the reduction rate. notably,
the group attained a signiﬁcant reduction of electricity consumption at ofﬁces in response to energy-
savings campaigns instituted after the great east japan earthquake, as ofﬁces in areas serviced by tokyo
electric power and tohoku-electric power raised their reduction goals.
