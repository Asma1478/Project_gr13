letter from julius robinson
union bank’s corporate social responsibility efforts continue to grow along with our business,
creating positive change in our communities and deepening those connections among our
employees, customers, neighbors, and partners. our 2012 csr report illustrates a broad cross-
section of environmental, economic and social contributions that together represent the best of
union bank and, i believe, reveal the character of our business and employees.
    our dedicated csr team works closely with the business units of union bank and a wide
range of partners and stakeholders to coordinate and leverage our community efforts. a reflection
of our commitment, creativity, and drive, union bank results far exceed what one might expect
from a bank of our size.
    in 2012, we reached or exceeded goals in many key areas, including community
reinvestment act-related loans and activities, employee volunteer hours, donations from the
union bank foundation, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions per square foot of real estate.
meanwhile, we are focusing our attention and energy on those areas where more progress is still
needed.
     looking to the future, i am particularly enthusiastic about our fresno community economic
development initiative, a multi-faceted project to leverage the full resources and expertise of
union bank, as well as those of our partners, to benefit the economically distressed city of fresno,
california. organized in 2012 and launching in 2013, our three-year commitment exemplifies the
innovation and heart that make union bank a unique institution.
    this is the second csr report that adheres to the framework of the global reporting initiative
(gri). adopting this standard promotes transparency and accountability with regard to union
bank’s community progress, which we believe will strengthen trust in our institution from the
partners and stakeholders we rely on for our success.
    thank you for your ongoing support and interest in our work.

           lending                                       union bank is built on the heritage of five banking lineages, stretching back to the bank of
                                                         california’s incorporation in 1864. through the decades, each of these businesses and their
                                                         leadership played important roles in their communities.

                                                         cohn, a prussian immigrant who, in 1902, also founded a hospital that would become the
                         responsible                     world-famous cedars-sinai medical center. four years later, homer king, president of the bank

our
community
beyond simply pledging to support our communities, union bank
makes a firm commitment to do so through our community service
action plan (csap). under our current 10-year csap, union bank
has agreed to invest at least 5.2 percent of our total annual assets
in loans and activities related to the community reinvestment act
(cra) through 2014. our aspirational target is 6.5 percent of total
assets. these community-related loan activities include everything
from small business and farm loans to low-income consumer loans,
affordable housing investments, and charitable contributions.
     we are dedicated to maintaining industry leadership in terms of
achieving our cra targets. in 2012, we surpassed both our agreed-
upon goal and our aspirational target, directing nearly $6.5 billion to
cra-related activities, or 7.9 percent of our average annual assets
for 2011. this reflects an increase of $645 million over our 2011
performance.
     also in 2012, union bank received a cra performance rating
of “satisfactory” on its three-year evaluation by the office of the
comptroller of the currency, a key government regulator, with
“outstanding” ratings in the examination’s investment and service
tests. that evaluation followed two consecutive “outstanding” ratings
over the previous two evaluation periods.
     while a “satisfactory” rating reflects that we have successfully
complied with cra and met the needs of our customers, we

are committed to achieving an “outstanding” rating in the next
evaluation, scheduled for 2015. in the meantime, we are taking

advantage of this rating as an opportunity to re-examine and refine
the way we target our resources to ensure we have the greatest
possible impact, particularly among low- and moderate-income
(lmi) communities.

an engaged partner
active and responsive engagement with our stakeholders is fundamental to the union bank way of banking. it starts with
a commitment to listen to our stakeholders, and extends to the actions we take. we have many stakeholders, including
customers, employees, suppliers, local communities, executive committees, community advisory board, internal
committees, outside advocacy groups, regulators, and local government, among others. although union bank did not
formally solicit feedback through a dedicated stakeholder engagement process in 2012, we listened carefully to our
partners and audiences through a variety of channels. what follows is a sample of the extensive outreach efforts we
conducted during the year.

community development finance
union bank believes that an adequate supply of affordable housing is an essential component of healthy
communities. however, affordable housing in california suffered a significant setback recently with the
elimination of the state’s redevelopment agencies, which had served as a major funding source for the
development of new units. that challenge has led union bank’s community development finance (cdf) group
to work even harder and more creatively to help its partners provide as many people as possible with access to
a home they can afford.

     cdf serves as a financial partner and trusted advisor to nonprofit and for-profit developers, public housing
agencies, and other groups to develop housing for low-income individuals and families as well as senior citizens,
the formerly homeless, those living with disabilities or hiv/aids, survivors of domestic violence, and others who               a hollywood site, reborn

    “the instructors helped open my
    eyes to the vision and strategy
    of a true entrepreneur, and the
    business network stemming from the mde
    program has been a great support for me.”
– henry alcon, president of american contractor services and
management development for entrepreneurs program participant.

     during the two-week program, faculty members work with
owners to analyze their entire business strategies, from marketing
to finances to it, and help them develop detailed business
improvement plans. following graduation, mde participants receive
ongoing support from university faculty as needed.
    a recent survey showed the mde program is delivering real
results: 37 of 40 responding business owners reported that they
had doubled their revenue since participating in the program. the
remaining three had seen revenue increases of 80 to 90 percent.

surroundings
vibrant bank branches contribute to healthy and
stable neighborhoods, stimulating economic activity
while providing financial services to consumers.
although union bank regularly opens new branches,
it is necessary at times to close branches as well.
in 2012, we developed new, more comprehensive
procedures to analyze the impact, particularly on lmi
residents, of a potential branch closing. we conduct
a full economic analysis of a potential branch closing,
and at times we require steps to mitigate the branch
closing’s impact on the surrounding community.
these steps include developing alternative financial
service options as well as steps related to marketing or
staffing to ensure that communities maintain access
to credit and financial services.

     union bank has set a goal of
reducing normalized greenhouse gas
intensity by 9 percent by the end of
2013 compared to 2008 levels. we are
well on track to accomplish that goal.
     our progress is the result of a
variety of technological advances,
green practices and policies, innovative
thinking, and mindfulness on the part
of our workforce. in 2012, we launched
a variety of new capital projects that
included lighting upgrades in 117 of
our branches in california and the
installation of power-saving software to
our computers. we also spearheaded
a variety of additional steps to                                                                                             paper consumption
