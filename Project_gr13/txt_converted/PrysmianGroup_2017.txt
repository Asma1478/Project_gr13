letter to stakeholders
prysmian performed well in 2016, as evidenced by an 8% rise in the economic value generated and
distributed compared with the prior year. recent efforts have borne fruit across every dimension of
sustainability, including reductions in the emissions of co 2 and ozone–depleting substances, an increase in
the percentage of factories with health and safety certification, the launch of such innovative products as the
66 kv, which has been qualified for the carbon trust programmes, and the issue of new policies and
procedures confirming that our fundamental values include a focus on individuals and ethics.

turning to personnel management, prysmian has developed a policy on human rights in order to define
objectives for the protection of those rights, both within the organisation and throughout the value chain. in
terms of acquiring and managing talent, our recruiting programmes have achieved excellent participation
rates and the intensive training activities of the prysmian group academy – an international school for
managerial and professional training – have continued, with support from the manufacturing academy
opened recently in turkey.
lastly, the success of the internal yes programme continues, enabling group employees to purchase
prysmian shares at an advantageous price. currently, about 44% of employees have participated in this
programme and, following authorisation to extend it for another three years, this percentage is expected to
rise in the near future, to as much as 1.5% of the entire shareholder base.

as part of the dialogue with stakeholders on sustainability matters, the third multi-stakeholder
engagement event was held recently in pikkala (finland), where the group has a large submarine cables
factory. these initiatives have become an integral part of our sustainability strategy, as they represent a
useful communications channel for defining shared objectives.

with regard to sustainable innovation, 2016 was a very important year. the group reached a series of
technological milestones that will have an impact on the market in terms of energy saving and sustainability.
key among these, hvdc technology will enable large quantities of electricity to be transmitted over long
distances, frequently across national borders. in a world first, prysmian has launched systems using 700 kv
(ppl) and 600 kv (xlpe) hvdc cables, which guarantee improvements of up to 15% in network reliability.
in addition, we have extended our p-laser technology – for the manufacture of recyclable and eco-
sustainable cables – to hvdc systems by launching the p-laser 600 kv. the new 66 kv cable system,
which allows reductions of up to 15% in the cost of offshore wind farms, has also been qualified for carbon
trust programmes. in the telecom area, the flextube optical cable has achieved another world first by
bundling together 2,112 fibres, in a solution that reduces the impact of the construction work needed for each
installation.

prysmian has also worked to improve performance in the environmental area. in 2016, operations in 8
european countries purchased 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. in addition, the quantity of
ozone-depleting substances emitted at group level fell by 6%.

                                                                     2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


during the year, the group finalised its model of governance, by making the compensation and
appointments committee responsible for the supervision of sustainability matters and establishing a
sustainability steering committee, composed of all function and business directors and chaired by coo
andrea pirondini, to define strategies and the related activities.

the group has devised a clear sustainability strategy, founded on the universally-accepted elements
agreed and documented by the united nations, in its definition of 17 sustainable development goals. these
should lead governments around the world to adopt more responsible practices and outcomes over the next
fifteen years. the approach taken by the group seeks not only endorsement, but also alignment with the
expectations and good sustainable practices of our stakeholders. the same values will be spread throughout
the entire value chain.

for these reasons, prysmian has defined a sustainability policy that establishes the group's strategic
priorities for the medium-long term, making reference to the sustainable development goals, the main
international indicators and the expectations of our stakeholders.
analysis of these elements has led prysmian to select the five sustainable development goals to which we
can contribute most, and to translate them into a sustainability plan consisting of priorities, objectives and
actions that are consistent with our business and corporate values. building on this foundation, the group
has also devised a “scorecard” that identifies 16 sustainability targets to be met by 2020, each measured by
quantitative kpis that will be monitored closely so progress can be reported on a regular basis.
this vision of sustainability in strategic terms is further demonstrated by the decision, with effect from 2017,
to link our sustainability objectives with the incentive systems in place for the entire management team.

i am also pleased to announce the improvement of our positioning in numerous international sustainability
rankings, including the authoritative dow jones sustainability index (djsi): the group now ranks fourth in
its own sector, following an improvement in score attributable to the numerous steps taken in the
environmental, social and governance fields. the excellence of our sustainability management was also
                                                                                            ®
confirmed in the cdp climate change report 2016 and by our inclusion in the stoxx global esg index
and the carbon clean 200 list.

in closing, i am proud to mention the inauguration of the group's new headquarters in milan, which is
expected to lower administrative costs, with respect to the previous location, by about 50%. naturally
enough, our new headquarters has taken a sustainable approach, as evidenced by the project to obtain the
international leed platinum certification. this sets the standard for the measurement and evaluation of
sustainable buildings, considering the reduction of co 2 emissions and the quality of the materials used
during the construction phase.

introduction

methodology
the sustainability report of the prysmian group (also "prysmian" or the "group"), now in its sixth edition
(the fifth edition, relating to 2015, was published in march 2016), is a document used to inform stakeholders
each year about the group's performance on economic, social and environmental matters. the report
describes prysmian's commitment to the creation of value for all stakeholders, and not just for the firm.
continuing in the direction first taken in 2014, this sustainability report and its attachments have again been
prepared in accordance with the core option of the “g4 sustainability reporting guidelines”, which ensures
broad and effective disclosures.
the gri g4 guidelines for sustainability reporting require the sustainability report to contain information
about topics that are considered important, being those with a significant economic, environmental and
social impact on the organisation and that significantly influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders.
the process of collecting data and information in order to prepare the report was managed by the
“corporate and business communications” function in collaboration with various other business functions,
in order to identify clearly and precisely the information deemed most meaningful for stakeholders, in terms
of its balance, comparability, accuracy, timeliness, clarity and reliability.
except as indicated where appropriate, the data and information contained in this report relate to those
companies within the prysmian group as of 31 december 2016 that are consolidated on a line-by-line basis
in the annual report. where available, data relating to prior years has also been reported, in order to ensure
the comparability of indicators over time and enable readers to compare group performance and analyse
trends over time. in addition, in order to guarantee the reliability of the information presented in this
document, the parameters included are directly measurable wherever possible. when recourse to estimates
is necessary, these are made using the best methodologies available and disclosed appropriately in the text.
there were no significant changes in the ownership structure or scale of the group during 2016 that would
affect the scope of this report.
in order to guarantee the reliability of the information presented, deloitte has performed a limited assurance
engagement in relation to the sustainability report, releasing its auditors' report in accordance with the
criteria indicated in standard isae 3000 revised. this report, attached to this document, includes compliance
with the principles of audit independence.

structure of the sustainability report
the "group id card" chapter is dedicated to presenting the group, the areas in which we work, the main
events and awards received during the year, and the values that guide the way we work. it also describes
the governance of prysmian, our economic performance and the activities arranged to communicate with
and involve our shareholders and investors.
the following chapters, “integrated sustainability”, “sustainable innovation” and “supply chain”, show how
sustainability is an all-encompassing concept that influences the entire life cycle of every product: from
research into and the development of innovative and sustainable solutions, to the networks that transport the
product to market.
the "prysmian's people" chapter is dedicated to our human resources, health and safety policies, the
involvement of employees and their personal growth via initiatives that develop their skills.
this focus on our human resources is also reflected in the activities carried out for the benefit of the local
communities in which the group works, which are described in the chapter on “communities”.
the “environment” chapter presents our environmental policies and performance by analysing the most
significant aspects, such as our use of natural resources and raw materials, our consumption of energy and
the related emission of greenhouse gases, and our elimination of processing waste.
the report closes with the "attachments" that provide further details about certain information contained in
the report, not least for consistency with the gri-g4 guidelines, the "auditors' report" and the "gri content
index".

the group's sustainability strategy

sustainability policy and plan


sustainability plays a central role for prysmian, which seeks to promote a responsible business model by
encouraging the increased integration of sustainability within the strategy adopted.
operating in accordance with a philosophy founded on the values of excellence, integrity and
comprehension, prysmian has consolidated its economic, environmental and social commitment over time,
seeking to create value for all stakeholders and contributing to the sustainable development of the territories
in which the group operates.
consistent with the corporate vision and values, which seek to promote 'the efficient, effective and
sustainable supply of energy and information as the main driver for the development of communities”, the
group took important steps over the past year to further integrate sustainability matters within its business
activities. in particular, prysmian defined a sustainability policy during 2016 that establishes the group's
strategic priorities for the medium-long term, making reference to the sustainable development goals
(sdgs) promoted by the united nations, the main international indicators and the expectations of our
stakeholders.
analysis of these expectations and the sustainable development goals has enabled the group to identify
the emerging trends with regard to sustainability and, therefore, to determine our own strategic priorities,
objectives and actions for the creation of shared value. specifically, prysmian has selected the five
sustainable development goals to which we can contribute most, and translated them into a sustainability
plan consisting of priorities, objectives and actions that are consistent with our business and corporate
values.
building on this foundation, the group has also devised a “scorecard” that identifies 16 sustainability targets
to be met by 2020, each measured by quantitative kpis that will be monitored closely so progress can be
reported on a regular basis.

governance of sustainability


recognising the importance of sustainability topics in the management of business processes and accepting
the invitation to formalise the approach taken to them contained in the code of corporate governance for
listed companies, the board of directors has tasked the compensation and appointments committee with
supervising, from 1 january 2016, the sustainability matters associated with the group's activities and the
dynamics of its interactions with all stakeholders. as part of the system for the governance of sustainability, a
sustainability steering committee comprising leaders from within the organisation is responsible for defining
strategies and actions for presentation to the compensation and appointments committee. in particular, the
steering committee is tasked with periodically discussing the strategic sustainability priorities, as well as with
defining and implementing the action plans needed to reach specific targets consistent with those strategic
priorities. the corporate and business communications function plays a significant role, having
responsibility for mapping and monitoring the expectations of stakeholders in relation to the group,
proposing guidelines and actions, organising stakeholder engagement activities and, drawing on the multiple
resources available, guaranteeing constant and transparent communications with the stakeholders. this
function also coordinates sustainability activities at corporate level, including the collection of data and
information for the group sustainability report from each country and the various business functions. these
functions are called on to adopt the sustainability priorities and practices promoted centrally, by applying
within their daily activities the principles and rules embodied in group policies. in this way, by embracing the
underlying vision and values, they improve their approach to corporate responsibility and their awareness of
sustainability matters.



sustainability in the daily activities of the group

leadership in the supply of cables and systems for energy and telecommunications influences the group's
approach to sustainability, guiding the growth strategy on such key matters as sustainable, technological
innovation in the solutions offered, the environmental responsibility of production processes, the
management of relations with the local communities in which the group operates, and attention to safety at
work and the development of personnel. this focus results in great efforts to improve our skills in the areas
of customer centricity, research and innovation, environmental sustainability and employee development.

                                                                 2016 sustainability report – prysmian group




always aware of the challenges posed by climate change, the group seeks to develop innovative products
and services that will transform these challenges into opportunities. the objective is to offer efficient and
sustainable solutions to customers, which generate value while reducing the related environmental impact.
turning to personnel management, prysmian has developed a policy on human rights in order to define
objectives for the protection of those rights, both within the organisation and throughout the value chain, by
engaging with our suppliers on these matters. this policy was approved in early 2017 and will be shared
within the organisation, via various internal communication initiatives, and throughout the value chain.
the group’s approach to sustainability is also evident in the relations established with our commercial
partners. among the measures taken to include environmental and social criteria in the process of selecting
and qualifying suppliers, prysmian has continued to assess all new suppliers using a qualification
questionnaire on their policies for the safeguarding of environmental and social matters. in addition, as part
of the management of metals suppliers, work has continued on their mapping, classification and involvement
using a self-assessment questionnaire designed to assess the main parameters affecting sustainability, such
as ethics, human and workers’ rights, the environment, mining activities and conflict minerals.
the efforts made in relation to sustainability have also resulted in transparent and structured
communications to all group stakeholders. in particular, the annual publication of this sustainability report
enables all readers to analyse in depth the policies promoted and the performance achieved in economic,
environmental, social and product terms. continuing the work carried out in prior years, the 2016
sustainability report has been prepared in conformity with the “sustainability reporting guidelines g4”,
issued in 2013 by the gri – global reporting initiative. the gri g4 guidelines for sustainability reporting
require the sustainability report to contain information about matters that are considered important, being
those with a significant economic, environmental and social impact on the organisation and that significantly
influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. the report has also been subjected to specific
auditing procedures by a recognised external firm, in order to assure all stakeholders of the reliability of the
information provided.

as confirmation of the efforts made, the group is still included in the ftse4good, a prestigious global index
comprising firms that stand out for both their ethical and transparent management practices, and the
implementation of sustainable policies. seeking to ensure continuity with prior years, during 2017 prysmian
will once again participate in the main assessments of sustainability organised at an international level
including, in particular, the robecosam assessment for the dow jones sustainability index (djsi) and the
questionnaire for the carbon disclosure project (cdp).
the following pages of the 2016 sustainability report provide a complete view of how we work and the
performance achieved on the economic, environmental and social aspects considered important for the
group and its stakeholders.

dialogue with stakeholders
the sustainability strategy adopted by prysmian is marked by the importance recognised to the group's
numerous stakeholders. in pursuing our corporate objectives, it is fundamental for prysmian to develop
forms of constant dialogue and interaction with both the internal and external stakeholders, in order to
understand the various needs, interests and expectations (social, economic, professional, human) of all the
actors involved. in particular, against a background that is dynamic, competitive and subject to major
changes, being able to foresee changes and identify emerging trends enables the group to generate
constant and shared value added over the long term.
establishing and developing trust-based relationships, founded on the principles of transparency, openness
and listening, enables prysmian to understand the constantly changing expectations and requirements of
those stakeholders that, directly or indirectly, influence the activities of the group or that, in turn, are
influenced by us. in particular, these relationships represent a fundamental step in the development of
structured processes that seek to identify emerging trends and predict future changes, especially in view of
the current economic scenario that is highly dynamic and competitive, with a high propensity to embrace
change.
the approach used by the group to communicate with stakeholders has evolved steadily over time, involving
various initiatives intended to make best use of the multiple channels available.
multi-stakeholder engagement initiatives have become an integral part of the group's growth strategy, as
well as an effective communications channel. these initiatives are organised in pursuit of the following
objectives:
         obtain suggestions from stakeholders that might improve products and processes;
         improvement the management of reputational risk;
         inform, educate and involve stakeholders in a manner that enables them to improve their decision
          making and actions, with consequent benefits for the company and the group;
         contribute to the development of relations with stakeholders based on trust and transparency.
following the second multi-stakeholder engagement event held in february 2016 in vilanova i la geltru
(barcelona), spain, the group organised a new event in february 2017 in pikkala, finland, where prysmian
has a factory. this event involved 25 local representatives of seven categories of external stakeholder:
customers; suppliers; local communities; universities and research centres; ngos, public administrations
and environment. the participants were able to play an active role in the discussions and workshops, during
which they were free to express and exchange ideas, opinions and views on a variety of topics related to
sustainability and corporate social responsibility. this open dialogue resulted in discussion of prysmian's
approach to sustainability, drawing out the subject areas considered priority by the stakeholders, in order to
guide the group towards new and ever broader horizons. in addition, during the discussions, participants
made a significant contribution to identifying the main effects of group activities on the various stages of the
value chain, highlighting the relevance and perceived importance of each sustainability-related matter. the
main matters identified were associated with the following topics: technological development, innovation and
eco-design, sustainability in the value chain, sustainable production and consumption, clean energy,
sustainable infrastructure and smart cities, and human rights.

lastly, the stakeholders discussed the sustainability challenges that the group should tackle over the long
term, consistent with the sdgs that they identified as most significant for the organisation, in order to
continue along the road towards sustainable development.
during 2017, prysmian will continue the stakeholder involvement activities commenced last year. in
particular, work to re-map the group's stakeholders and their expectations is under way, with a view to
expanding and giving new impetus to the related activities. the approach adopted is more inclusive, taking
account of the sustainability indices and ratings that are routinely used by investors and commercial partners
when making investment and purchasing decisions. additionally, a new multi-stakeholder engagement
event will be organised during the year in a country in which the group is active.

standards and the gri. this analysis was updated during 2015.

                                                               15

materiality analysis
updating the work begun in 2014, once again prysmian has carried out a materiality analysis in order to map
and classify the sustainability matters that are important for the group and its stakeholders. this analysis
identified the matters considered important, being those with a significant economic, environmental and
social impact on the organisation and that significantly influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders. understanding the viewpoints of stakeholders is in fact key, if the group is to continue to
generate shared value over the short, medium and long term.
consistent with the “g4 sustainability reporting guidelines” defined in 2013 by the gri – global reporting
initiative and adopted for the first time when preparing the 2014 sustainability report, prysmian's materiality
analysis has been updated to take account of the new needs and requirements of the group's external
stakeholders identified at the multi-stakeholder engagement event organised in pikkala, finland.
the output of the analysis identified the important sustainability matters for the prysmian group, which
represent a starting point for reporting on the significant aspects central to the group's commitments.
analysis of these matters took account of the impact of each, both within the group and beyond, throughout
the entire value creation chain. further information about this analysis is presented in the attachments to this
report.

a story that began two centuries ago
with almost 140 years of combined experience, the history of prysmian and draka is marked by numerous
successes and ever more ambitious and challenging milestones. over time, these achievements have
enabled the prysmian group to consolidate its reputation as a pioneer in the sector, whose paramount
objective is to meet the requirements of its customers.


1900
at the start of the 20th century, pirelli cavi, part of the italian pirelli group, achieved international recognition
thanks to several high profile projects, such as laying 5,150 km of telegraph cable across the atlantic from
italy to america, linking north africa with brazil and installing a telephone line between brazil and italy.
1910
hollandsche draad en kabelfabrieken was founded in 1910 and later became draka.
1900-1950
both companies expanded by internal growth during the first half of the 20th century, broadening their
product ranges and opening factories in such strategic markets as spain, the united kingdom, north
america, argentina and brazil.
1990-2000
the 1990s saw both companies engaged on acquisitions followed by major restructuring work, with a view to
expanding their industrial and commercial activities.
2005
pirelli cavi was sold by pirelli and prysmian was founded.
2007
prysmian was listed on the milan exchange's ftse mib.
2010
prysmian became a public company. the assets and know-how accumulated in more than a century of
history allow the company to pursue growth in markets and businesses with a high degree of value added.
2011
the acquisition of draka by prysmian gave birth to a new world leader in the cables sector: the prysmian
group.
2015
prysmian celebrates its first decade.
2016
the prysmian group inaugurates its new headquarters in the ansaldo 20 industrial district of milan-bicocca.

new headquarters, a sustainable revolution
after more than three years of work, the group’s new headquarters was opened in milan-bicocca during
                                       2
2016. extending over about 22,000 m , the facility was designed specifically to obtain the international leed
platinum certification, which sets the standard for the measurement and evaluation of sustainable buildings,
considering the reduction of co2 emissions and the quality of the materials used during the construction
phase.
the central theme of the new headquarters is smart working, as an innovative and functional approach to
the time spent in the working environment, employing: digitalisation, as the promotion of a work place that
facilitates the creation and sharing of electronic information; team work and community building, where
efficiency and a collaborative spirit are the order of the day; work-life integration, to improve the balance
between work and private life via the increased flexibility of working hours; a war on waste and incentives to
recycle materials via the separation of waste; the use of recyclable glass bottles to distribute water to
employees and guests; a paperless approach, via the further implementation of practices designed to reduce
drastically the use of paper and promote respect for the environment.
the headquarters consist of new buildings separated by two full height, glass-covered areas providing
sustainable recreation areas that, at the same time, ensure the maintenance of a stable micro-climate via the
use of natural light. internally, the various open spaces encourage interpersonal relations and promote the
quality of the work performed.
this approach to sustainability is not limited to structural matters, but also includes good practices: the “fruit
initiative” makes seasonal fresh fruit available to employees twice each week, while prysmian provides urban
transport passes free to all those who agree not to use polluting vehicles for travel between home and work.

a year of awards and recognition


     for the second consecutive year, prysmian has placed in the top 10 of the comprend webranking
      2016 report, published in italy by lunquist. this report shows how and how well firms are able to
      dialogue with their stakeholders via the websites and digital channels available to them.
      comprend webranking research is considered to be the leading european survey of corporate
      websites and is the only global classification based on requests from stakeholders. in its 20th edition,
      this survey assessed more than 800 firms worldwide, measuring how well they meet the
      expectations of their main stakeholders.
     in 2016, the group was recognised by the italian chamber of commerce in singapore (iccs) as the
      “best italian multinational in singapore” at the annual business awards ceremony held for the best
      italian firm operating in singapore.
     once again during 2016, the group was retained in the ftse4good, a prestigious global index
      comprising firms that stand out for their ethical and transparent management practices, as well as
      the implementation of sustainable policies. in particular, prysmian obtained the highest ratings for
      corporate governance and social matters, such as health and safety, human rights and the supply
      chain.

      group is included in the stoxx global esg leaders index, which is an index of sustainability
      created by stoxx limited. this index is derived from an assessment process that identifies a
      selection of global firms based on environmental, social and governance (esg) indicators.
     during 2016, prysmian celebrated inclusion in the prestigious carbon clean 200 report, as the only
      italian firm present in forty-ninth place. produced as a collaboration between as you sow, a non-
      profit, and corporate knights, the carbon clean 200 report assesses the world’s largest firms, in
      terms of shareholder base, with reference to their revenues derived from green energy. for
      inclusion, firms must meet certain characteristics, such a share capitalisation in excess of one billion
      dollars and revenues from green energy that exceed 10% of total revenues.


  improved sustainability
  prysmian has achieved higher rankings in numerous international indices of sustainability, including a
  marked improvement in the assessment made by the dow jones sustainability index (djsi). the group
  came fourth in the “electrical components & equipment” sector, following an improvement due to the
  many efforts made in the environmental, social and governance fields. these include tasking the
  compensation and appointments board committee with the supervision of sustainability; adopting
  inclusion and diversity policies; implementing and code of business conduct designed to spread
  responsible business practices throughout the supply chain; reducing the emission of ozone-depleting
  substances.
  the attention dedicated to environmental sustainability has also been confirmed in the 2016 cdp
  climate change report, in the italian edition of which prysmian is classified in the “industrials” segment
  with a b (on a scale of 8 from a to d). this represents a benchmark against which cdp will monitor

progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, consistent with the cop 21 objectives
established in paris.
the group has also been included recently in two further indices of sustainability: the stoxx® global
esg leaders index – created by stoxx limited, a global provider of stock exchange indices – based
on a transparent process of performance assessment that identifies a panel of global leaders in terms of
environmental, social and governance (esg) kpis, and the carbon clean 200 – a report that assesses
the world's largest public companies on the basis of their “green energy revenues.”
prysmian has also been retained in the ftse4good, a prestigious global index comprises firms that
stand out for the ethical, transparent and sustainable management of their activities.

association memberships
prysmian's leadership of the cables sector is strengthened by the inclusion of the group in the principal and
most strategic global trade associations. in fact, participation in technical round-table discussions means that
prysmian can play a prominent role in the definition of guidelines, and in debates with partners and
competitors.
prysmian actively participates in the following major trade associations:
  europacable: founded in 1991, members represent about 85% of the european cables market. the
    major global players in the sector are all members, together with more than 200 smes with a high
    degree of specialisation.
    the group has been a signatory of the europacable industry charter since 2015. this document
    recognises and formalises the collective commitment made by the cables industry to support
    manufacturing and development objectives and principles founded on ethics, sustainability and high
    quality standards.
  friends of the supergrid (fosg): brings together technology firms specialised in electricity
    transmission systems and firms that develop, install, own and manage the related infrastructure, in
    order to promote the development of a large-scale, pan-european, offshore electricity grid in order to
    distribute the energy generated by renewable sources.
  norstec: represents the leading global operators in the energy sector, with a view to supporting the
    production of renewable energy by offshore wind farms in the north sea.
  medgrid: started in 2009 to study the feasibility of an electricity link across the mediterranean, between
    europe and the wind and solar farms established in north africa. twenty of europe's leading operators
    in the energy sector are participating in this project;
  ftth council: non-profit organisation that seeks to accelerate the adoption of fibre to the home
    (ftth) technology. members include manufacturers, system designers, consultancy firms and
    academic organisations. the main aim of the ftth council is to interact with regulators and other
    bodies, such as the european union, in order to enhance awareness within the regulatory environment
    about the adoption of this technology. the prysmian group is an active member of the ftth council in
    europe, north america, the middle east, north africa, latin america and asia-pacific. via the various
    working parties, the trade associations develop and disseminate tools for the management of legislative
    requirements and for the development for sector-specific initiatives, such as the environmental
    declaration required for cables.

ethics and integrity
the sustainability strategy adopted by the prysmian group is founded on a system of values that mark the
behaviour of individuals both within and outside the organisation. the code of ethics establishes the
principles for all to follow, consistent with the vision and mission of the group. acting as a veritable guide to
daily behaviour, the code of ethics plays a strategic role for the group as a tool for preventing irresponsible
or illegal conduct by those who work in the name and on behalf of prysmian. the values and principles
expressed in the vision, mission and values of the group are integral to this document. the code of ethics
lives and evolves with the development of the business in the competitive world. it is always open to receive
and accept requests for legality and propriety expressed by any group of prysmian stakeholders.
the code of ethics complies with international best practices and adopts the principles embodied in the un
universal declaration of human rights and the fundamental conventions of the international labour
organization (ilo).
with a view to managing the issues of corruption and unfair competition, prysmian has adopted an anti-
bribery policy and an antitrust code of conduct, as part of the group's compliance policies. these policies
are published on the group's website and on the corporate intranet, while updates are communicated to all
group employees. in addition, during 2016, prysmian updated and implemented throughout the group a
whistle-blowing procedure that complies with the main best practices on ethical and compliance matters.
in order to support and sustain one of prysmian's key values, namely integrity, during 2016 the group
established a compliance structure that, among other activities, monitors observance of the code of ethics
and the compliance policies. this organisation comprises the following roles:
        - chief compliance and internal audit officer: reports to the control and risks committee and to the
        chief executive officer of the group. responsible for managing all compliance policies and
        procedures, including the code of ethics.
        - local compliance officers: present at each group company, with responsibility for implementing
        and the constantly applying all compliance policies.
the code and the above policies reflect a common and shared approach to business, honest, ethical and
compliant with all current laws and regulations, which must be respected by all group employees wherever
they work and live around the world. it is fundamental, in fact, for all employees to take responsibility for their
daily work and accept personally, with conviction, the spirit of the code.
as part of the group's commitment to ethical and legal behaviour, the code of ethics invites interested
parties to report any real or apparent violations of the law, the code or ethical standards, so that they can be
examined and dealt with appropriately. in order to achieve this and create conditions that assure
confidentiality, security and ease of reporting, prysmian has adopted a procedure for collecting and
managing reports on alleged violations of the code of ethics (so-called “whistle-blowing procedure”). this
procedure offers everyone (whether employees or not) the opportunity to submit reports to the group, even
on-line and in anonymous form, about improper conduct and alleged illegal activities within the organisation.
this process implements two channels for the collection of reports, comprising dedicated telephone lines
and a web portal, that are both managed by independent operators and available in the 26 languages used
by the group.

the whistle-blowing mechanism: integrity above all
the system of values adopted by the prysmian group guides the conduct of individuals both within and
outside the firm. this system is documented in the code of ethics, which establishes the principles to be
followed by all and represents an effective tool for preventing irresponsible or illegal conduct by persons who
work for and in the name of prysmian. prysmian has decided to take another step forward by launching the
whistle-blowing mechanism at group level. this tool, which enables stakeholders to report any improper
practices, is intended to disseminate further the principles and practice of ethical conduct. the mechanism is
consistent with the best practices relating to ethics and compliance, given that whistle-blowing procedures
based on anonymous reporting have been shown to be the most effective way to identify fraud and
improprieties. an independent third party (the network, inc.) manages the whistle-blowing channels and
ensures their security, with a strict mandate to protect the identity of whistle-blowers and to act as
intermediary for the transmission of questions and follow-up replies, as well as to communicate information
about the outcome of each case. the group has also established a specific whistle-blowing committee,
which will assess all reports carefully, carry out investigations and, if appropriate, take the necessary action.


code of ethics
"the code of ethics represents the group's "constitution", being the charter of rights and moral
duties that defines the ethical-social responsibilities of each participant in the organisation".
the structure of the prysmian group’s code of ethics is founded on three pillars:
        • ethics in business activities: the profit motive does not justify improper behaviour. profit must be
        achieved by respect for the rules and competitors, and by fair and transparent actions that anticipate
        and meet market needs, thus generating value for distribution to all stakeholders.
        • ethics in internal relations: the group is aware of the importance of our ties with employees, which
        are strengthened by respecting their rights, expectations and needs, and by facilitating improvement
        in their living conditions and professional growth. the individual is central to all activities, as the
        engine for future development.
        • ethics in environmental and social matters: given our strong belief in the principle of sustainable
        development, the prysmian group operates worldwide with respect for the environment and local
        communities; at the same time, we encourage the responsible use of resources and promote local
        projects designed to enhance well-being in the areas concerned.
all companies within the prysmian group agree to comply strictly with the code of ethics, applicable
regulations and the rules and procedures adopted from time to time by the group. in order to ensure the
widest possible distribution of its contents, the code of ethics – available in the 26 languages used by the
group – is also published on the company's website, www.prysmiangroup.com.


anti-corruption policy
with a view to managing corruption-related matters, prysmian has adopted an anti-bribery policy that
prohibits the corruption of public officials and private individuals, requiring prysmian employees to comply

with the policy and, if more restrictive, to observe and respect all the anti-corruption legislation in force in the
countries in which they work or are active.
no employee may make, promise to make, offer or approve the payment of anything of value, whether
directly or indirectly, for the benefit of public officials.
in particular, the term "public officials" means the employees of a public agency or company controlled by the
government, including commercial entities, or international public organisations, political parties or party
officials or candidates for public office.
specific actions to prevent corrupt practices within the group include:
        mandatory due diligence to be performed during the agent selection process (before signing the
         contract) and updated every 3 years, in accordance with group policy.
        supply of periodic information from each area to the supervisory body, pursuant to decree
         231/2001. these areas comprise:
                  - new prysmian agents
                  - results of due diligence
                  - commission payments above a certain threshold
        e-learning (training and testing) activities for compliance with the anti-bribery rules applicable to all
         group personnel.
        implementation of acl tools, with the definition of a number of key indicators for the
         “general/ledger” and “accounts payable” processes. the system can also be used to monitor the
         high transaction risks associated with agents.
        implementation of a central database of all agents, in order to guarantee the collection and filing of
         agency contracts, so that specific checks can be carried out on the related payment transactions.
partly in view of the increased complexity of the regulatory framework, during 2016 the prysmian group
decided to strengthen further the supervision and central guidance of compliance matters, by launching an
anti-bribery compliance program based on the guidelines promulgated by iso 37001 “anti-bribery
management systems” dated 15 october 2016.




                                                               33

governance
effective and efficient, to create sustainable value over time and give rise to a virtuous spiral centred
on business integrity.
prysmian is aware of the importance of a good system of corporate governance for achieving the group's
strategic objectives and creating sustainable value over the long term. the system must ensure that
governance is effective, with respect for the institutions and the rules, efficient, with respect for the principles
of cost saving, and proper in relation to all parties involved in the life of the group.
with a view to sparking this virtuous spiral, the group strives to ensure that the system of governance is
aligned constantly with the relevant recommendations and regulations, and complies with domestic and
international best practices. in addition, the group has adopted principles, rules and procedures that govern
and guide the activities of all organisational and operational units, as well as guarantee that all operations
are carried out in an effective and transparent manner.
with a view to constantly improving the system of corporate governance, prysmian took various additional
                                                                                                                        2
steps during 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the code of corporate governance for
listed companies, adopted by the group, and strengthen the principles of transparency and integrity applied.
the structure of corporate governance within the group is founded on the core role of the board of directors
– as the most senior body appointed to manage the company in the interests of shareholders – in providing
strategic direction, guaranteeing the transparency of decision-making processes and establishing an
effective system of internal controls and risk management that encompasses the decisions made with
internal and/or external effects. the board of directors exercises the widest powers of ordinary and
extraordinary administration, except for those that by law are reserved solely for the shareholders' meeting.
consistent with the recommendations of the code of self-regulation, the number and standing of the non-
executive directors ensures that their opinions carry significant weight in the adoption of board resolutions.
the traditional model of governance and control adopted by prysmian involves the presence of a
shareholders' meeting, a board of directors and a board of statutory auditors.
in compliance with art. 14 of the articles of association, the company is administered by a board of directors
comprising eleven directors – in office until the date of the shareholders' meeting called to approve the
financial statements for the year ending on 31 december 2017 – of which seven are non-executive directors.
among all the directors, eight are men and three are women, four are aged between 30 and 50 and seven
are over 50 years of age. six of the non-executive directors are also deemed to be independent pursuant to
art. 148, para. 3, of decree 58 dated 24 february 1998 (t.u.f. – consolidated finance law) and application
criteria 3.c.1. and 3.c.2. of the code of self-regulation, while one non-executive director is considered
independent pursuant to art. 148, para. 3, t.u.f. the board of directors has identified from among its
members a chief executive officer and general manager, granting him all powers of ordinary administration
that may be necessary or useful for the conduct of the business. the directors are responsible for managing
the firm and carry out the operations necessary in order to achieve the corporate objects. the board of
directors is also responsible for the group's system of internal control and risk management and,
accordingly, must check its adequacy and adopt specific guidelines specified by that system. the board is

governance of sustainability
the corporate governance committee of borsa italiana approved certain changes to the details of the code
of corporate governance for listed companies in july 2015. in particular, the new version of the code
indicates the principles to be followed in the area of social responsibility, and the actions to be taken to
guarantee the transparency and legality of business processes.
reflecting the importance of sustainability matters in the management of business processes and accepting
the invitation to formalise the approach taken to them contained in the code of corporate governance for
listed companies, the board of directors has tasked the compensation and appointments committee with
supervising, from 1 january 2016, the sustainability matters associated with the group's activities and the
dynamics of its interactions with all stakeholders.

anti-trust regulations
competition law on restrictive practices and the abuse of dominant positions now plays a central role in
governing the activities of firms operating in all sectors of economic life. prysmian’s strong international
presence in more than 50 countries subjects the group to the competition regulations in force in europe and
in all other countries in which we operate. each of these is more or less demanding in terms of the civil-
administrative responsibilities and criminal penalties imposed for violation of the applicable laws. over the
past decade, the various local anti-trust authorities have dedicated increasing attention to the business
activities of market players and, furthermore, have showed a greater propensity for international
collaboration amongst themselves. prysmian intends to operate in the marketplace in compliance with the
rules in place to protect competition.
consistent with the priorities defined in the erm process, the board of directors has adopted an anti-trust
code of conduct that all directors, executives and employees of the group are expected to know and
comply with in the performance of their duties and in relations with third parties. in addition, during 2017
prysmian has introduced an anti-trust training programme designed to increase awareness among those
who work in the name and on behalf of the group, so that during their activities they comply with the rules
safeguarding competition. the antitrust code of conduct, which is an integral part of this training programme,
seeks to describe the issues relating to the application of italian and eu competition policy with regard to
cartels and the abuse of dominant positions. the specific situations arising must be assessed against this
framework on a case-by-case basis. this action, stimulating knowledge and making individuals more aware
of their professional duties and responsibilities, represents a further step in establishing an "anti-trust culture"
within the group.


at the end of january 2009, the european commission launched an investigation into the various european
and asian manufacturers of electrical cables, in order to check the existence of alleged anti-competitive
agreements in the hv terrestrial and submarine cable businesses. on 2 april 2014, the european
commission ruled that, between 18 february 1999 and 28 january 2009, the world's largest cable
manufacturers, including prysmian cavi e sistemi s.r.l., had acted to restrict competition in the european
markets for, respectively, submarine and high voltage terrestrial power cables.
the european commission deemed prysmian cavi e sistemi s.r.l., together with pirelli & c. s.p.a.,
responsible for the alleged violation during the period from 18 february 1999 to 28 july 2005 and
condemned them to pay a fine of 67.3 million euro. it also deemed prysmian cavi e sistemi s.r.l., together
with prysmian s.p.a. and the goldman sachs group inc., responsible for the alleged violation during the
period from 29 july 2005 to 28 january 2009, condemning them to pay a fine of 37.3 million euro. prysmian
appealed to the european court against this decision and applied to participate in the appeals against the
same decision filed by pirelli & c. s.p.a. and the goldman sachs group inc. both pirelli & c. s.p.a. and
the goldman sachs group inc. have, in turn, presented requests to participate in the appeals promoted by
prysmian against the decision taken by the european commission. the participation requests presented by
prysmian, pirelli and the goldman sachs group inc. have been accepted by the european court. prysmian
has not made any cash payments as a result of the above decision, having elected – while awaiting the

appeal – to give bank sureties guaranteeing payment of half the fine levied by the european commission
(amounting to about 52 million euro) for the disputed violation in both the above periods. prysmian
understands that pirelli & c. s.p.a. has also given bank sureties to the european commission covering half
the fine levied in relation to the disputed violation in the period from 18 february 1999 to 28 july 2005. pirelli
& c. s.p.a. has also taken civil action against prysmian cavi e sistemi s.r.l., before the milan court,
requesting to be held free from any demands advanced by the european commission consequent to the
enforcement of its decision and from any related enforcement charges.
in february 2015, prysmian cavi e sistemi s.r.l. filed in relation to the above action, requesting complete
rejection of the demands advanced by pirelli & c. s.p.a. and, with reference to the disputed violation in the
period from 18 february 1999 to 28 july 2005, that pirelli & c. s.p.a. be required to hold prysmian cavi e
sistemi s.r.l. free from any demands advanced by the european commission consequent to the
enforcement of its decision and from any related enforcement charges. the action was then suspended, by
order of the court in april 2015, while awaiting the outcome of the appeal against the european commission
decision promoted in the european courts by both prysmian and pirelli. pirelli appealed to the court of
cassation to overturn this order, which however confirmed the suspension ordered by the milan court.

analysis of share ownership by geographical area confirms the predominance of the united states, with 30%
of capital held by institutional investors following a slight decrease since 2015. at the end of 2016, investors
in the united kingdom held about 19% of capital, following and increase since 2015. institutional investors in
italy held about 17% of capital at the end of 2016, following a rise since 2015, as was the case in france
where institutional investors held 9% of capital. the weighting of asian investors is stable.

about 68% of the capital held by institutional investors is owned by value, growth or garp investment
funds that have a medium/long-term time horizon. with respect to the prior year, there has been a decrease
in the number of shareholders adopting an index investment strategy, based on the main stock indices, while
the hedge fund component – with a shorter time horizon – has now increased to 4% of the total.
once again, the prysmian group has attracted the attention of numerous socially responsible investors
(sri), whose investment strategy is linked both to financial objectives and an assessment of the social and
environmental impact. these investors are increasingly important component of the financial markets.
prysmian shares are also included in the ftse ecpi italia sri leaders, comprising a basket of selected
italian shares that excel on environmental, social and governance (esg) matters.

investor relations
transparency in communications, increased market confidence in the company and promotion of a
long-term approach to investment in the shares.
the creation of value for shareholders and other stakeholders is a key priority for prysmian, whose group
policy for strategic and financial communications is founded on the highest standards of propriety, clarity and
transparency. actions and procedures are designed to provide the market with credible information about the
business, with a view to boosting confidence in the company and facilitating a long-term approach to
investment in our shares. every effort is made to avoid biased disclosures and ensure that all current and
potential investors receive the same information, so that balanced investment decisions can be made.
upon publishing its quarterly data, the company organises conference calls with institutional investors and
financial analysts and also invites specialist media representatives to take part. in addition, the company
promptly informs shareholders and potential shareholders about every action or decision that could have a
material impact on their investment.
relations with the financial market were intense during 2016, with more than 400 meetings with institutional
investors at the company’s offices, whether in the form of conference calls or one-to-one or group sessions.
the company was also involved in numerous road shows during the year, visiting the main financial markets
in europe and north america, and also took part in conferences organised by leading international brokers.
in addition, the increasing attention paid to the activities of the group by socially responsible investors (sri)
was confirmed by their growing attendance at the road shows and meetings held for them. lastly, the group
organised various visits to factories and r&d centres for institutional investors and financial analysts during
the year, in order to provide them with more detailed information about its products and production
processes.
the coverage of prysmian shares by analysts remains very high, with wide geographical diversification.
the investor relations function has maintained constant contacts with institutional investors, not least via the
website www.prysmiangroup.com, which includes the recordings of conference calls and presentations to
the financial community, corporate documentation, press releases and all other information relating to the
group, in both italian and english. the investor relations section also contains the financial calendar,
meeting documents, the code of ethics and contact information for the analysts that track the stock, as well
as specific sections on corporate governance, risk factors and the share price.

risk management
the prysmian group adopts a system of internal control and risk management based on tools and
information flows that enable the board of directors to take strategic decisions and establish
guidelines for the system in an informed manner, considering the context in which the group
operates and the related financial, environmental and social risks.

the value creation policy pursued by the prysmian group is and always has been based on the effective
management of risks. commencing from 2012, on adoption of the recommendations of the "code of
corporate governance for companies listed on the italian stock exchange" regarding the management of
risks, prysmian has taken the opportunity to strengthen the group's governance model and implement an
advanced risk management system. this promotes the pro-active management of risks using a structured
and systematic tool that supports the main decision-making processes. this “enterprise risk management”
(erm) model, developed in line with internationally recognised models and best practices, allows the board
of directors and management to evaluate in an informed manner those risk scenarios that might compromise
the achievement of strategic objectives, and to adopt tools that are able to foresee, mitigate or manage
significant exposures.
the group's chief risk officer (cro), appointed to govern the erm process, is responsible for
guaranteeing together with management that the main risks faced by prysmian and its subsidiaries are
identified, assessed and monitored on a timely basis. in addition, an internal risk management committee
comprising senior managers ensures, via the cro, that the erm process remains dynamic to reflect
changes in the business, requirements and events affecting the group over time. the cro reports
periodically (at least twice each year) to senior management on these changes.
the erm model adopted, formalised in the group erm policy that incorporates the guidelines for the
system of internal control and risk management approved, in turn, by the board of directors back in 2014,
follows a top-down approach, i.e. based on direction from senior management and the medium/long-term
strategies and objectives of the business. this extends to all types of risk/opportunity that are potentially
significant for the group. these are shown in the risk model – presented below – which groups the areas of
internal and external risk into five families that characterise prysmian's business model:
       strategic risks: risks deriving from internal and external factors, such as changes in market
        conditions, business decisions that are wrong and/or implemented improperly, and slow reactions to
        changes in the competitive environment that might threaten the group's competitive position and the
        achievement of its strategic objectives;
       financial risks: risks associated with the availability or sources of finance, or the ability to manage
        efficiently the volatility of exchange and interest rates;
       operational risks: risks deriving from events or situations that limit the effectiveness and efficiency
        of key processes, affecting the ability of the group to create value;
       legal and compliance risks: risks connected with violations of national, international and sector
        regulations or professionally improper behaviour that does not comply with the code of ethics, which
        expose the group to possible penalties and damage its reputation in the marketplace;

        planning and reporting risks: risks associated with the adverse impact of incomplete, incorrect
         and/or untimely information, with possible effects on the group's strategic, operational and financial
         decisions.


                                  risk model adopted by the prysmian group




managers involved in the erm process are required to use a clearly defined, common methodology to
measure and evaluate specific risk events in terms of "impact - probability of occurrence" and the adequacy
of the system of controls in place. erm is a continuous process that contributes, as defined in the erm
policy, to the determination of the group's three-year business and strategic plan by identifying possible
events that could influence the sustainability of the plan, which is updated annually with the involvement of
all key managers.
during 2016, the erm process involved the group's main business/function managers, resulting in
identification and assessment of the main risk factors that are summarised below, together with the
mitigation strategies adopted.


sustainability risks
the group constantly reviews its approach to the management of risks. consistent with this and aware of
the important opportunities deriving from the efficient management of sustainability risks, as well as the
growing attention paid by regulators and stakeholders, prysmian has decided to adopt a more holistic
approach by identifying, for each area, the risks deriving from the environmental, social and economic impact
of its activities.

organisational model (decree 231/2001)
prysmian adopted an organisational model (the "model") in compliance with the requirements of decree
231/2001 on 24 january 2006. this model is periodically revised and updated to take account of changes in
the list of administrative offences and crimes envisaged by the decree, as well as the dynamics of the
system of corporate governance and the organisational structure of the group. this activity ensures that the
model is always up to date and applicable over time. the company is and has always been determined to
comply with the related legislative requirements, to implement the principles of proper management laid
down in the decree and to improve systematically the system of corporate governance, in order to combine
the achievement of excellent results with full compliance with the regulations and the highest ethical
standards.
the model, which is an integral part of the group's broader system of governance, is designed to establish
operational rules of behaviour that are suitable for preventing illicit conduct deemed significant by the
company pursuant to the decree, based on analyses of prysmian's business activities, decision-making
processes and system of internal control.
the model comprises two sections. the first part, of a general nature, describes the decree, the rules of
governance and the general principles on which the model is based.
            code of ethics, which sets out the key principles of ethical behaviour that must be observed by all
             those who work on behalf of prysmian or its affiliates. translated into 26 languages, the code of
             ethics is displayed at each group affiliate and periodic training sessions are held for employees and
             collaborators;
            guidelines for conduct that, by analysing the key principles expressed in the code of ethics, identify
             required behaviours in the areas of "what to do" and "what not to do", thus responding to the need to
             prevent possible offence risk scenarios.
the second section, on the other hand, seeks to identify and govern the specific conduct required in areas
that are known to expose the company to offence risk situations.
the fundamental principles laid down in the code of ethics and the guidelines for conduct are rendered
operational by the definition of specific decision, management and control protocols that govern, for each
process exposed to offence risk: the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, the decision-
making/authorisation procedures, and the management and control methodologies adopted.
lastly, the governance rules for the model specify the organisational rules for implementation, ensuring the
continuous functioning of the model.

internal audit, compliance and internal control
in order to strengthen the system of internal control and risk management, commencing from 28 july 2016
the board of directors established a compliance function and, acting on a recommendation from the
director responsible for the system of internal control and risk management approved by the audit
committee and having consulted the board of statutory auditors, appointed a compliance and internal audit
officer to manage the new compliance department as well as the internal audit department. as a
consequence, the compliance and internal audit officer was granted the rights and duties envisaged in the
code of self-regulation for the managers of internal audit functions. the group decided to maintain a
separate internal audit organisation, which now reports hierarchically and functionally to the compliance and
internal audit officer. including the compliance function, the internal audit function has now become larger
and more structured.
the compliance and internal audit officer reports hierarchically to the board of directors who appointed him,
while also reporting on his work to the audit committee and the board of statutory auditors. this person is
not responsible for any operational areas, despite having direct access to all the information needed for the
performance of his functions.
the compliance and internal audit officer is mandated to check the adequacy and functioning of the system
of internal control and risk management in compliance with international professional standards, both on an
ongoing basis and with regard to specific requirements. accordingly, he prepares an annual audit and
compliance plan for the group, based on the risk assessment carried out as part of the erm process.

economic performance
economic value distributed to stakeholders
the prysmian group makes a constant effort to create and distribute value to its stakeholders. economic
value represents the wealth produced by the group that, in various forms, is distributed to the stakeholders
in the following ways: remuneration of human resources (direct remuneration, comprising wages, salaries
and severance indemnities, and indirect remuneration in the form of social security and pension
contributions), remuneration of lenders (interest expense), remuneration of group shareholders (dividends
paid) and other investors, remuneration of the public administration (total taxes paid), gifts and donations to
the community. the value retained by the group is represented by the profit reserves carried forward.

integrated sustainability

group approach
prysmian strives to find technologically advanced solutions and to develop efficient products that
are both cutting-edge and sustainable, in order to meet and satisfy the expectations of customers.

the prysmian group has consolidated its leadership position in the design, development, production, supply
and installation of terrestrial and submarine cables and systems for the transmission of electricity, special
cables for applications in various industrial segments, medium and low voltage cables for buildings and
infrastructure, and cables and accessories for the transmission of voice, video and data.
quality, an ability to innovate and high value-added solutions mark prysmian's strategic approach in every
sector, whether those in which technology is a differentiating factor or those that are more standardised,
such as medium and low voltage cables.
the constant development and improvement of power and information networks are key to achieving the
group's objectives of supplying electricity efficiently and effectively, and improving the level of worldwide
telecommunications. modern, reliable, eco-sustainable and efficient electricity grids and telecommunications
networks are both critical and strategic for the growth of the global economy.
via its products, prysmian supplies electricity and lighting to cities, enabled people to move around and
communicate with each other, and contributes to the steady industrial development of the sectors in which
we operate.
prysmian products are central to the concept of sustainability. they are used in the construction of major
wind and solar farms, of infrastructure that accelerates the flow of information and communications between
communities throughout the world while reducing energy losses, and of terrestrial and submarine electricity
links that improve the efficiency of the entire electrical power network. our product responsibility is
considered throughout the entire life cycle of each product, from design to delivery, by constantly monitoring
performance against specific standards.
for this reason, the group strives constantly to develop innovative and technologically advanced solutions
that strengthen our leadership and meet the requirements of our commercial partners and end users. the
group's growth strategy is founded on our ability to innovate and, therefore, promote the improvement of the
entire sector via the development of leading-edge products.
the prysmian group is strongly oriented towards the creation of value for all stakeholders. daily activities
principally draw inspiration from the concepts of:
       customer centricity, being the ability to foresee and satisfy customer requirements via the offer of
        innovative products and cabling systems on a solution-driven basis. for this reason, the group
        tirelessly seeks improvement in the areas of r&d, employee development and environmental
        sustainability.
       value creation for shareholders, in terms of return on investment and profitability in the short term
        and, above all, in the medium and long term.

                                                                 2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


customer centricity
over the years, the prysmian group has perfected its approach to the market by placing the customer at the
centre of every strategic, organisational and business decision. the efforts made to analyse the expectations
of customers, and how these change over time, in fact allow the group to develop organisational and
operational models that translate into rapid, efficient and targeted responses to the markets concerned.
pivotal to this approach is our "customer centricity", being the ability to understand early and satisfy the
needs of the customer. this calls for the dedication of constant attention at all stages, from product design to
delivery, with performance measured against predetermined and agreed parameters.
the prysmian group is able to develop solutions that meet specific standards responding the precise
requirements of an individual customer.
in particular, the group is able to serve highly diverse segments and markets due to an ad hoc matrix
organisational structure. this means that highly specific local markets are served by country development
and commercial organisations, while markets with global products and customers are served by fully-
integrated business units. other segments requiring both a local presence and cooperation between
countries benefit from the matrix structure.
customer centricity and satisfaction underpin a strategy that is implemented via the fast, smooth
organisation of the entire supply chain. this approach accelerates decisions and the time to market, while
adapting to the needs of various industries and ensuring continuous investment in innovation.
"factory reliability" is one way to implement customer centricity. this process improves the reliability of
production planning and performance in terms of both mix and volume, with ever faster response times and
stricter control over inventory levels of every type (raw materials, semi-finished items and finished products).
this enables the group to deal efficiently and effectively with fluctuating sales volumes and the consequent
changes in production levels.
in addition to the “customer centricity and factory reliability” initiatives, the prysmian group has also
launched “supply chain integration” projects together with a number of major global customers. the
objective is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all processes throughout the supply chain, from the
producers of the raw materials and semi-finished products used in factories to the end users of our cables.
in the context of customer satisfaction, prysmian seeks to become the partner of choice. given this, the
group works with customers using essentially two main tools: specific surveys and one-on-one interviews.
since 2005, the group has commissioned specific surveys to measure the level of customer satisfaction. in
the past, these surveys were carried out by a market research agency and used standardised questionnaires
that were completed by telephone interviews (cati methodology) with the managers of prysmian’s main
customers (in the purchasing, logistics and technical sectors). the surveys were carried out every two years
(most recently in 2014/2015) and, over the years, involved 900 customers in the trade & installers sector, in
15 countries. the scores ranged from 1 to 10 and the areas covered were sales, services, product and
marketing.
in view of the growing digital sophistication of customers, from 2016 prysmian decided to introduce a new
system capable of conducting specific interviews and collecting the data provided via a web portal dedicated
to surveys, which is administered directly by the central customer centricity office. using this new and more

powerful tool, the group expects to increase the quality of interviews, the opportunities for customer contact
and, most importantly, the openness of the interactions between prysmian and its customers. the new tool
will make it possible to improve our follow-up and problem-solving capabilities, while also increasing the
satisfaction of customers with their partnerships with prysmian. in addition, this more electronic approach will
make it possible for those group divisions that have already developed a crm tool to manage directly the
interview feedback, taking specific action as necessary and monitoring developments in order to ensure that
their customers receive the best treatment.
the new web interviews will commence during the first four months of 2017, principally involving customers
in the t&i sector. in particular, two pilot projects will be launched (south america and spain) and then
followed during the year by the addition of other countries. the scores will range from 1 to 5, in order to
simplify and accelerate the activities requested of customers. the questionnaires will cover the following
areas: commercial conditions, products and services offered, customer support, brand awareness, product
range, net promoter score and effort score.
in addition to these surveys, customer centricity has also been developed from 2015 via specific interviews
with customers. the objective of the group is to strengthen its relations with end users, holding specific
interviews that are customised depending on the customer, the business unit and the geographical area
concerned. this approach is managed directly from prysmian’s headquarters, thus enabling the group to
increase its commitment to each customer, regardless of the countries in which they are located. over the
years, these one-on-one interviews have given very positive results, as the persons involved have
appreciated the opportunity to share their ideas and feedback directly with the group's headquarters. the
interviews cover the following areas: conditions of sale, product range, service/delivery, documentation,
customer support, brand/relationship, net promoter score and effort score, as well as more specific questions.
the one-on-one interviews will continue in parallel with the new web portal for the annual on-line surveys,
involving the main customers in specific business and geographical areas.
following the one-on-one interviews carried out in china and hong kong during 2015, in 2016 the group
selected eight major customers in the t&i and utility business sectors in north america. the results were
positive, especially in the united states, where the overall score from a distributor was 8.7/10, rising to 9/10
from the utility customers. in particular, the interview with the distributor identified as areas for improvement
the price/quality ratio and variety with the product range (score of 7/10). on the other hand, the scores
obtained from the utility customers were never less than 8/10 in any area.
with regard to the interviews held in canada, the group obtained an overall score from one distributor of
6.8/10, and scores of 6.5/10 and 7/10 from other distributors. in particular, the new areas for improvement
identified were the ability to track information about the various orders placed, the accessibility of the contact
centers, the delivery process and customer support. lastly, the results obtained from utility customers were
higher overall, reaching 7.4/10 and 8.7/10.
based on the results of these interviews, the north american organisation decided to take specific action
during 2016 and 2017. the prysmian headquarters in milan is providing support to north america.

on time delivery
prysmian has confirmed our strong orientation to continuous improvement in the punctuality and reliability of
our processes. as shown in the chart below, the measurement of on-time delivery (otd), being the ability
to serve customers by respecting the delivery date promised on confirmation of the order received, highlights
further improvement by the energy products segment and the stability of the telecom segment, despite a
strong upturn in volume.
in addition to the improvement in on-time deliveries in absolute terms, the number of units performing below
the 90% threshold decreased further in 2016, thus ensuring greater uniformity in the service provided by the
group's factories.


the projects designed to reduce time to market were completed during the year. the “fast order entry”
project has slashed by 90% the time taken to input and process orders by sales customer care, optimising
product searches and inventory availability, as well as the ability to input many order items at the same time
with just one operation.

operations
the prysmian group's manufacturing operations are highly decentralised, with 82 factories in 30 countries.
this enables us to react in good time to the various requests received from world markets. once again
during 2016 the group continued to implement an industrial strategy based on the following factors:
       manufacture of higher value-added products with greater technological content at a limited number
        of factories, which thus become centres of excellence with outstanding technological skills. this
        ensures the generation of significant economies of scale, with a consequent increase in production
        efficiency while reducing capital invested.
       constant search for greater manufacturing efficiency in the commodities sector, while maintaining at
        the same time a well-diversified territorial presence in order to minimise distribution costs.
gross capital investment amounted to euro 233 million in 2016, following an increase with respect to the
prior year (euro 210 million). in addition to the usual investment in submarine cables and fibre optics, the
largest block of expenditure reflected the priority given to the reduction of our industrial footprint and
continuation of the work on the new headquarters in milan.
in particular, the drive to downsize manufacturing was reflected in further efforts to rationalise the group’s
production capacity. in this context, the factories in brondby (denmark), angy and neuf prè (france),
amsterdam e delfzijl (netherlands) and quilmes (argentina) were closed during 2016. the related
production volume was reassigned to other factories within the group. this concentration of production was
carried out to optimise the cost structure and guarantee the appropriate saturation of plant capacity in each
country. analysing capital investment in more detail, it is important to note that the work dedicated to
increasing production capacity and to changes in mix was very significant, representing 40% of the total.
in the energy projects sector, we have almost completed the investment to increase the capacity of the
group's two main factories dedicated to submarine cables: arco felice (italy) and pikkala (finland). this
investment became necessary on the signature of the “50 hertz” contract in 2014. this contract, worth more
than 700 million euro, involves the design, supply and installation of high voltage submarine cable systems
between offshore wind farms situated in german waters. at the same time, work is well advanced at pikkala
on the completion of a new vertical extrusion line needed for the manufacture of the cobra cable, which
will be supplied for the undersea link between denmark and the netherlands. lastly, improvement work that
began in 2015 has been completed on the "ulisse", a new cable-laying ship; as a result, the group now has
a third vessel dedicated to installation services, alongside the "giulio verne" and the "cable enterprise".
with regard to the high voltage business, a long-term plan to upgrade the capacity to test cables has been
launched in various geographical areas (north america, northern and southern europe), in order to ensure
the full verticalisation of the manufacturing process for all cable produced by the group, including those in
the highest voltage class.
lastly, towards the end of the year, the group commenced procedures for the purchase of certain assets
from the factory in yixing, china, that was previously operated by shenhuan cable technologies. the
machines at this facility, which produces hv cables, include two vertical extrusion lines.
considering the investments made around the world, the energy products sector benefited from major
efforts to satisfy the increasing demand from various value-added sectors. investment in suzhou and tianjin,

china, has increased the production capacity of trade & installer, rolling stock and elevator cables. a
catenary line for medium voltage cables has been installed in north america at prescott (ontario, canada).
with reference to the european market, a catenary line has been installed at pikkala (finland), while the
capacity to manufacture fire-resistant cables has been expanded at bishopstoke (england); the capacity to
produce elevator cables has been increased at velke mezirici (czech republic) and work on the production
of rubber cables for the central european market has commenced at kistelek (hungary).
in addition, from this year, the prysmian group is consolidating the investments made at oman cables
industry, after having acquired majority ownership last year. these investments principally focus on low and
medium voltage cables, which are used by local utilities as well as the major epc (engineering procurement
and construction) companies active in the arabian peninsula.
with regard to the telecom business, major investment in the optical fibre factory at sorocaba (brazil) has
been completed. this was necessary in order to verticalise production for the south american market –
especially brazil. in the same sector, a vertical plant has also been installed at claremont (usa), while
increasing drawing capacity at the same time, in order to satisfy the demand for fibre needed for the
production of optical cables.
lastly, the group has decided to invest in the optical cables factory in lexington (usa), where the capacity
to produce ribbon cable has been expanded.
about 30% of total investment was allocated to achieving efficiency improvements and reductions in fixed
and variable costs (mainly product design and material usage). in addition to the rationalisation of production
capacity already described, prysmian has worked hard to optimise production costs throughout the entire
telecom business segment. this was made possible by the construction of two new factories in eastern
europe: the first in slatina (romania) for the production of optical cables used in telecommunications, and
the second in presov (slovak republic) for the production of optical cables for multimedia applications. at
the latter location, the current capacity to manufacture copper cables has also been expanded. these two
new factories confirm the group's interest in creating two centres of excellence in europe for these types of
cable. with the same objective in mind, work has begun on a factory at durango (mexico) for the production
of optical cables used in telecommunications, in order to satisfy the growing demand from north and central
america.
in addition, investment to enhance efficiency has continued at the european factories for the production of
optical fibre in battipaglia (italy) and douvrin (france), with a view to reducing fibre manufacturing costs
significantly while focusing particular attention on increasing the size of preforms. lastly, work is well
advanced in tunisia to expand the existing plant for the kitting of cables used for connectivity, following a
decision to bring activities in-house that were previously outsourced.
prysmian dedicated 7% of total investment to research and development during 2016. in particular,
investment continued on the development of the “sap consolidation (1c)” software, with a view to
harmonising the back-office it systems used by all units throughout the group. the infrastructure of the sap
1c system was significantly upgraded during the year by adopting the sap hana in-memory technology
(with a marked improvement in operational performance) and, at the same time, the system was extended
geographically to australia and new zealand. in parallel, work commenced on the data center

consolidation project, which will harmonise and strengthen the infrastructure layer of the group's systems,
while generating at the same time a significant reduction in the associated operating costs.
lastly, the main business components of the customer centricity software (pricing tool, crm, customer
portal) have been developed, with a view to creating a modern integrated platform that will support the
group's business processes.
capital investment on structural maintenance work amounted to 11% of the total, in line with prior years. a
significant part of this amount related to the start of work to remove all asbestos present at every group
factory around the world.
lastly, other investment included the purchase of land in taunton (massachusetts, usa) next to the existing
factory that makes industrial cables, as well as completion of work on the group's new headquarters at the
ansaldo 20 industrial area in the bicocca district of milan.

the positive performance reported in the prior year with regard to customer claims was confirmed by
prysmian in 2016, as the volume was essentially unchanged. special attention has been given to the related
response times, which have decreased by about 40% due to a series of actions designed to improve internal
efficiency.

sustainable innovation
commitment to innovation
being a leader means knowing how to innovate. the prysmian group seeks to generate innovation,
quality and know-how, with a view to developing innovative products and systems with a lower
environmental impact and higher value added for customers, even in those sectors in which
products are largely standardised.

the group's commitment to innovation and the development of new products with a reduced environmental
impact stems from the conviction that this is the best way to guarantee economic sustainability over the long
term. such a commitment is essential in order to assure well-being and the quality of life in today's society
and for future generations. in particular, development projects seek to increase the efficiency and reliability
of the finished products offered by prysmian while, at the same time, lowering energy and power losses, as
well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of electricity and water during the
production processes.
sustainability is a constant focus for the prysmian group, in step with the times and the markets; it is not
only a prerogative for research, development and innovation in the more developed countries, but also for
that performed in the emerging countries. investment in sustainability helps, in fact, to lower risk in places
where energy costs are rising and access to energy sources remains unstable. in addition, the group's
engineers employ advanced tools to validate the performance of our cables and simulate applications, even
before any prototypes are made. this process helps to maximise the use of laboratory time, for example by
avoiding unnecessary repetitions, and therefore reduce the consumption of materials and energy.
spending by prysmian on research, development and innovation during 2016 totalled about 83 million
        10
euro , confirming our constant commitment and focus on sustainable growth over the long term.
work dedicated to the optimisation of costs via the design-to-cost (dtc) programme has also continued.
this methodology is used to lower production costs, both when developing a new product and when re-
engineering an existing product. this programme achieved cost savings totalling almost 17 million euro in
2016. more than 1,100 projects have benefited from this programme.
the group's constant drive to innovate is also supported by 17 centres of excellence, which have their
headquarters in milan and employ more than 550 experienced professionals.


cables as the driver of sustainability
sustainable innovation had a profound effect on prysmian during 2016. on the energy and
telecommunications fronts, the group reached a series of technological milestones that will have a
considerable market impact in terms of energy saving and sustainability. key among these, hvdc
technology will enable large quantities of electricity to be transmitted over long distances, frequently across
national borders. in a world first, prysmian has launched systems using 700 kv (ppl) and 600 kv (xlpe)
hvdc cables, which guarantee increases of up to 15% in power transmission capacity and network reliability.

10
     including 75 million opex and 8 million capex.

in addition, the group has extended p-laser technology – for the manufacture of cables that are 100%
recyclable and eco-sustainable – to hvdc systems, by bringing to market the p-laser 600 kv, which can
achieve cost reductions of up to 30% per mw transmitted.
in addition to the application of p-laser technologies to terrestrial and subsea hvdc cable systems, marking
an absolute innovation in the cables industry, the group has also introduced a 66 kv cable system, which
represents the highest voltage for electrical connections between offshore wind turbines and enables wind
farms to lower their costs by up to 15%. this system has been qualified for the offshore wind accelerator
(owa) programme promoted by carbon trust, an independent company based in the uk whose mission is
to stimulate the accelerated achievement of a low-carbon, sustainable economy. the owa project is one of
carbon trust’s most important r&d programmes and, with support from the uk government's department of
business, energy and industrial strategy (beis) and from the scottish government, its objective is to reduce
the cost of offshore wind energy via the development of innovative ideas and their translation into
commercial solutions.

universities and research centres
prysmian has established consolidated collaborative relations with major universities (more than 40
agreements) and research centres in various countries around the world: china, netherlands, new zealand,
brazil, finland, uk, united states, spain and italy. such collaboration is strategic for prysmian, in order to
keep constantly updated about all technological innovations and ensure adoption of the most advanced
technologies available to the scientific community.
among the numerous collaborations, those with the following bodies are particularly worthy of mention:
   politecnico di milano
   university of milan-bicocca
   university of salerno
   university of palermo
   department of information engineering, university of padua
   department diten, university of genoa

during 2016, the prysmian group continued work on the project to develop subsea cables using the
composite materials technology identified, together with mip (politecnico di milano) by applying a new
methodology for innovation: the design-driven funnel. in addition, in collaboration with human foundation,
the group has launched the second edition of the technology for human beings contest, which assesses
the undergraduate and post-graduate dissertations of engineering, physics and science students enrolled at
italian universities, on topics relating to the applicability of new technologies to sustainable development.
this year, prysmian chose to focus on sustainable development goals: the theses submitted analysed the
following topics from a technical/applications point of view:
    o   resilient infrastructure, fair, responsible and sustainable innovation and industrialisation
    o   access to information and communications technology
    o   sustainable models of production and consumption: sustainable and efficient management of natural
        resources
    o   technologies and access to economic, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems
cash prizes were awarded to 3 first-cycle dissertations and 3 second-cycle dissertations and the winners of
each category were offered a six-month internship with the firm. the scientific committee consisted of
experts on the topics addressed by the competition appointed by prysmian and human foundation. the
objective of this project, in line with the corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy, is to support the study
of sustainable technologies with potential practical applications in the sectors in which the group is active.
one of the winners of the previous edition (2015) has been employed by the group.

main projects
prysmian developed numerous r&d projects during the year. the most significant are presented in
this section.

energy
submarine cables
the year saw completion of the type-approval process and a good part of the production of the 50 hz 220 kv
                        2
cable, with 1,200 mm copper conductors. in addition, a new design of unipolar cable, with optical elements
incorporated in the sheathing, was installed and entered into service as part of the undersea project in the
philippines.
the group has continued work on new splicing techniques linked to the diameter of the conductors, making
it possible to join large aluminium conductors and splice conductors with different sections and made of
different metals, for both 320 kvdc and 220 kvac systems. the development work includes testing and
long-term trials that will be completed in the coming years.
with regard to the development of systems for installations at great depth, the prototype with optimised
double sheathing has been completed and tested internally, confirming the feasibility of installations at
depths of up to 3,000 metres.
in addition to the work on mi (mass impregnated) cables intended to improve the recovery plan for the
westernlink project, the first phase of research has been completed into alternative materials and
optimisation of the design and production process, obtaining internal qualification at 700 kv.
with regard to the project for 600 kvdc extruded cables, the first positive results have been confirmed for
application of the xlpe and p-laser technologies. in particular, feasibility studies have been carried out for
the development of long distance ehvac submarine systems (up to 200 km), as well as for the monitoring
(partial discharges) of long distance ehvac or dc submarine systems, using the prycam gate technology.
lastly, the project for the implementation and industrialisation of lead-less submarine systems, with welded
copper sheathing, has been approved and launched at the pikkala factory in finland. the industrialisation
work will be completed by the end of 2017.


terrestrial cables
with regard to the product development of ehv terrestrial cables, the development and type tests have
been completed on the new 600 kv hvdc system with extruded sheathing, as certified in accordance with
the cigre tb496 specifications. this important result is a milestone in the cable transmission of power,
enabling the transportation using a single bipole of power in excess of 2.6 gw. the know-how of the
prysmian group, in terms of materials, technology and electrical testing, was decisive in achieving this
result. hvdc systems are preferred for high power transmissions via insulated cables over long distances.
in terms of ehv product development, three prototype cables with extruded insulation have been produced
with milliken conductors comprising 2,500 and 3,500 mm² section copper with aluminium sheathing welded
longitudinally; the two 2,500 mm² prototypes have been insulated with alternative materials with respect to
those currently used.

                                                                  2016 sustainability report – prysmian group



t&i (trade and installers)
with regard to the t&i business, r&d has focused on three key topics: safety, sustainability and new
product indicators.
on the subject of safety, the entry into force of en 50575, a harmonised european standard, on 10 june
2016 was an important change. there will be a one year transition period before this standard becomes
compulsory throughout the european union (on 1 july 2017). during this period, it will be possible to launch
old products compliant with current national legislation, as well as new products compliant with the new eu
directive. nevertheless, only the latter will be authorised for sale from 1 july 2017 onwards. as a
consequence, all affiliates of the prysmian group operating in the european countries covered by the new
legislation are making a major effort to align the characteristics of their product portfolios (cables for
permanent installation in closed environments) with the performance categories adopted by each country.
this development activity is accompanied by intensive certification work, given that the new standard
establishes very rigorous criteria for the testing and type approval of the cables concerned. in this regard,
the results achieved during 2016 mean that we can view with optimism the 1 july 2017 deadline, when the
cpr (construction product regulation) comes into force in eu countries.


oil & gas
this year, the o&g sector focused on two main aspects. the first related to the development of solutions
designed to increase the safety of cables used in gas (formerly lng) projects. one of the most significant
efforts made involved the assessment and improvement of seals against the passage of gas via cables
connecting areas at risk of explosion with those at lower risk or the exterior. consistent with the vision of the
prysmian group, this project seeks to offer customers support in assessing the effects of cables and
complete systems, and not just technical solutions.
the other area of focus for development activities related to electrical submersible pumps (esp). the
prysmian group is currently developing a new generation of products that will have a vast range of
applications (for operating conditions that are more or less challenging), with accelerated testing procedures
on full-scale samples, as well as hybrid solutions for downhole technology that cope with high temperatures
and are highly resistant to corrosion, which is a new concept in this sector of the market.


oems
with regard to cables for special oem (original equipment manufacturer) applications, the breadth of the
product portfolio and the number of live applications has resulted in a substantial number of development
projects dedicated to various markets and customers. the main efforts are concentrated on the application
of methodologies for extreme climates – such as in the arctic – and for the north american, australian and
chinese markets.


development and transfer of technology
in terms of development and technological improvement, the project to optimise conductors for medium and
high voltages has continued, with a view to reducing the weight and diameter of cables, while complying with


                                                       61

the regulatory specifications for resistance under direct current. work this year has focused on aluminium,
given the 2016 production mix. weight savings of around 1-1.5% have been achieved and work to rationalise
the grades of aluminium used has been completed, resulting in a shift from 16 to 12 and, therefore, savings
for the purchase and management of raw materials.


monitoring systems
with regard to the prycam technology, work on the development of pry-cam® gate was completed during
2016. this new patented technology can automatically measure the time interval between two partial
discharges and therefore establish, with absolute certainty, if an accessory or a stretch of cable is affected
by partial discharges, without having employ any kind of expertise or ai algorithms. pry-cam® cable is a
second important innovation at an advance stage of development. this hybrid cable, used exclusively for
sensing, is consider to be the embryo of the next generation of integrated monitoring systems, which is
currently under development for presentation in 2017.


telecom
optical fibre
in terms of the optical fibre sector, 2016 saw further improvements in the process of manufacturing fibres at
the factories in the usa and brazil, where an autonomous production process is now operational.
numerous group factories have been equipped to produce bendbrightxs (bbxs) fibres, which perform
better than competitive products in the presence of micro and macro bends. the bending performance of this
fibre, even at low diameters, means that it can be used in the manufacture of smaller cables for various
layers of ftth (fiber to the home) networks.
with regard to multi-mode fibres, adoption of the om5 standard from september confirms the leadership of
the group in this sector too. in particular, this fibre is able to transmit 4 channels at 25 gbit/s, or even 50
gbit/s, at wavelengths of between 850 nm and 950 nm.
another important innovation benefits from the few mode technology. in single mode fibres, information is
coded and sent in association with a single mode of transmission, while in few mode fibres it is associated
with a few modes of transmission. a number of preliminary tests, conducted together with various partners,
were successful in the transmission of data (100 gbit/s systems with 10 gbit/s signals transmitted at 1310
nm in each mode) and in the field of access networks.


optical cables
group activities in the optical cables field principally involved three types of product. firstly, flextube cables
have shown their suitability for many markets and their production has been extended to multiple factories. a
version for aerial cables (adss), operating under adverse environmental conditions, has also been
industrialised. cables with 2,112 fibres have been developed and installed successfully, while work
continues with a view to obtaining cables with 4,000 fibres.
development activity on the multiloose family of cables has mainly focused on reducing their diameter, in
order to maximise the number of fibres that can be blown into the dedicated underground conduits. in these
cases, the high level of stress to which the fibres are subjected requires them to perform particularly well.

                                                                 2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


lastly, the range of ribbon cables has been extended by adding 864 fibre and 1,728 fibre products (ul riser
rated indoor/outdoor cables), which lower cost and complexity within hyper scale data centers. our "dry”
cable technology has also been certified for highly saline environments.


accessories and connectivity
with regard to connectivity, prysmian has continued to develop new accessories for the use of ftth (ultra
broadband access networks). the group has focused on the cabinets, with the development of optical
distribution racks (switches), joint boxes for the splicing of cables, and termination solutions for customers
with wall-mounted boxes. a series of new components has been designed to supplement the range of
multifunction joint boxes (compact joint - cmj, medium joint - mmj and lmj) and make them suitable for
global markets. in addition, a new range of termination caps has been developed, specifically for the french
market, and industrialised at the menzel plant (tunisia).
the connectivity products currently under development include the pbo solution designed to simplify
externally protected connectors, roe16 and roe32 optical distributor termination boxes for the italian
market, a new modular subrack system (srs) increasing joint/termination capacity from 48 to 144 fibres in
the same space (1u), that should become available in may 2017, and the design of plastic versions of the
modular racks (currently made from metal) for the french market.


opgw (special and submarine optical cables)
efforts with regard to opgw cables have concentrated on developing the portfolio of steel tubes in the high
fibre content segment: both central tube structures (1x96fo) and multi-loose structures. a number of steel
tubes for opgw applications have also been developed and qualified.
with regard to the transfer of technology, the production of alpa/alpam and sheathed submarine cables
has been moved from delfzijl to vilanova.


multimedia and data centre solutions
improvements were made during 2016 in the solutions based on the discontinuous metallic ribbon in
category 6a u/utp cables for cabling structured using copper cables.
in addition, there have been interesting developments in the remote-powering technology. in particular,
power over ethernet (poe) technology has been incorporated in a family of cables, optimised for
connections over longer distances than is standard for cat. 7 cables, that supply both power and data in
order to connect such devices as wireless access points and security cameras. a complete family of optical
cables, based on flextube technology, has been developed for the cabling of buildings.
there were further developments with regard to data centres during 2016. working together with an
industrial partner, the first fully cat. 8.2 connection has been qualified and is now available on the market.
this product allows transmission at 40 gbit/s over a 30m copper channel.
high speed (40/100 gb/s) cables using mm fibre have also been developed and are available in two
versions: plenum/riser and low emission of toxic fumes and gases.

lastly, the group is making a major effort to adopt the eu construction product regulation (cpr). most of
our existing products will be classified in accordance with the new fire resistance classes, but development
work is in progress in order to achieve the more advanced categories.


industrial innovations
prysmian is strengthening the exploratory studies into materials, in view of the strategic role they play in the
technologies employed by cables and accessories. the main results achieved during 2016 include:
   laboratory production of joints with variable resistance compounds, confirming the good performance
    of the materials studied. as a result, full-size joints have been made for electricity testing in a circuit.
   production of new compounds with high electric permittivity for both joints and terminals, enabling new
    accessories to be qualified in the 36 kv class.
   the group is considering the use of grafene and nanotubes in polyethylene sheathing in order to
    improve, respectively, its impermeability to water and its conductivity. a further area of research into
    nanotubes relates to their possible use in low voltage insulation, in order to determine if they might help
    inhibit the propagation of flames.
   studies are currently under way into substances that absorb water without subsequently releasing it,
    which might provide solutions capable of replacing the metal insulation used in the group’s products.
   experimental work continues on the light sheathing of submarine cables, with a view to optimising the
    designs for new cable structures. in addition, prysmian is working with an external supplier on the joint
    development of a new traction element.
   a special type of polymer that absorbs methane has been identified and synthesised. the method for
    assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of absorption at ambient temperature and at 70°c has also
    been optimised. the group is moving on to industrial trials, in a bid to confirm the good performance
    found in the laboratory.
   a number of analytical techniques have been defined in order to improve our understanding of the
    behaviour of cable materials (content of the ashes of materials for fire-resistant cables, impermeability
    of paper and ppl at various temperatures, simulation of the jacketing and impregnation of insulation
    with ppl, efficiency of water absorption of swellable tapes).
   the study of polymers resistant to oils, considering both thermoplastic and cross-linked materials, is still
    in progress. this study is supported by the development of a new method of cross-linking using a
    process similar to that of silanes, but with improved cross-linking density.
   the new afumex compounds for high levels of cpr classification have been industrialised and
    commercialised, confirming the high levels of fire resistance expected.
   prototype cables have been made in australia, the united kingdom and italy with enamelling
    compounds that have intriguing fire-resistant properties. experimental work on this product will continue
    during 2017.
   based on a system of tests devised and carried out by the group, it has been shown that aluminium
    coating is more resistant to corrosion than zinc in aggressive environments (being the combined
    presence of salt water, h2s and co2).

                                                                 2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


   the use of tetrazoles to inhibit the corrosion of aluminium has been shown to be a valid alternative to
    the current methods. at least 200g are being synthesised for an industrial trial. in addition, we are
    studying suitable methods for applying these inhibitors to aluminium wire.


rationalisation and management of materials
   work on the approval of alternative materials, especially those of major technical or commercial
    importance, is continuing throughout the group in order to eliminate monopoly suppliers.
   work to rationalise the raw material codes for cables has been completed.
   software has been written that will make the specifications of raw materials available at the time that
    the material code is activated. this software will supply all the specifications to prysmian in a unified
    database that can be searched.
   software for cataloguing the technical sheets of compounds has been written and is now being
    implemented.


thoughts about the environment
the r&d activities of the prysmian group dedicate great attention to the social and environmental aspects,
seeking to use materials that do not represent a hazard for human health or the environment. efforts include
performing up-front analyses of the data for materials, in order to check their possible impact on the
environment and the group. during the year, the group therefore developed initiatives and projects
designed to reduce the environmental impact of the product range.
in order to increase the efficiency and reliability of finished products while, at the same time, lowering the
dissipation of energy and power, prysmian has worked to reduce the set-up times of the machines used and
increase the speed with which products are manufactured. as a result of introducing these innovations, the
group has achieved greater manufacturing efficiency, increase the volume produced per unit of time and,
consequently, reducing the energy consumed per unit of production.
additionally, all hv projects have focused on increasing the transmission capacity of links and therefore
improving efficiency, while the monitoring systems developed by the group seek to facilitate the
management of assets, by optimising losses and downtime.
lastly, with regard to the new generation of afumex ls0h cables, energy consumption during production
has been reduced significantly and better surface finishing has been achieved by the development and
industrialisation of new formulas. examples of this initiative within the telecom business include the
efficiencies achieved in the manufacture of data transmission cables and optical cables with loose tube and
flextube micro-module design. in a specific improvement programme, the speeds of the buffering lines and
the insulation lines were compared at various factories, using a best practices approach. this resulted in
efficiency improvements, as well as a reduction in the energy consumed by these manufacturing processes.
improvements achieved in relation to the category copper cables included reductions in conductor diameter
and ribbon width, as well as the thickness of the insulator. the use of recycled materials has been further
optimised at a number of factories.
with regard to optical cables, where filler is normally used to block the longitudinal penetration of water, the
prysmian group's 'dry/dry' platform has been further developed.


                                                      65

                                                                   2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


the family of dry/dry cables with flextube micro-modules has been expanded. this technology is used
advantageously to reduce installation times even further and thus lower the total cost of the system.
elimination of the filler in fact facilitates recycling and the separation of components.
another important step has been taken in reducing the energy consumed to manufacture optical fibres. the
system employed to mesh the plastic sheathing of the glass is phasing out the use of uv lamps in favour of
led lamps. the qualification trials have already been completed: the energy consumed to manufacture a
bobbin of fibre could be reduced by more than 20%.
with regard to the gas getters technology, further industrial trials have identified the possibilities and
limitations of the system. initial studies of materials capable of absorbing water and gas vapour have
produced interesting results.
lastly, improvements have been made to the cables manufactured using pvc compounds or halogen-free
formulations, in order to reduce the quantity of materials used in a considerable number of products.


cfp – carbon footprint
work has started on the development and application of a tool capable of providing a partial assessment of
the environmental impact of prysmian products, in terms of their carbon footprint (co 2 equivalent) and
recyclability.
these parameters will be assessed with reference to the standard design data for each product (bom and
routing), considering just that part of the life of each cable directly controlled or influenced by the
manufacturer. the intention is to apply this tool extensively to the group's products. a pilot project will be

carried out during 2017, followed by application on a vast scale in 2018.

npi – new products introduction
an information tool has been developed to monitor and quantify the impact of the development of new
products at all prysmian operating units. the tool is applied to new products, classified into three categories
(innovation, product development and technology transfer), and the economic results, sales and
contribution margin are assessed over the first 3 years in the life of each new product, starting from the first
sale.


eco-sustainable solutions
afumex family
in line with the main developments of safe, reliable and sustainable technologies, prysmian has once again
confirmed its pioneering and innovative spirit by continuing to expand the range of afumex green cables.
the new member of the afumex family, afumex green 1kv, is now the safest and most sustainable cable on
the market.
with this launch, the traditional petroleum-derived polyethylene, used for insulation purposes, is replaced by
bio-polyethylene (“green” polyethylene) derived from sugar cane, which is 100% renewable, certified at
international level and reduces co2 emissions. it is calculated that for every tonne of green polyethylene
produced, more than two tonnes of carbon dioxide are captured from the atmosphere.
afumex green 1kv cables meet the standards (nbr5410 and nbr12570) for electrical installations in areas
with a high concentration of people in a confined environment. the new green cables are used to power
machines, equipment and lighting systems in general; accordingly, they are particularly suitable for stadiums
and arenas, airports, shopping centres, libraries, museums, cinemas, theatres, underground railways, data
centres, hospitals, schools and commercial and residential buildings.
the afumex green range does not propagate flames in the event of fire and has very low emissions, without
any toxic gases. as a result, it is the safest range on the market. these cables are extra flexible, have a
double layer, do not contain lead or other heavy materials, and resist temperatures of up to 90 degrees.


p-laser
p-laser is the first high performance, eco-sustainable cable for electrical circuits. produced using recyclable
materials, p-laser lowers the environmental impact of circuits while also raising their efficiency and power
transportation capacity.
the prysmian group's r&d department has completed a project that compared the environmental impact of
two different systems for the production of medium voltage power cables: p-laser and xlpe. this study
used the carbon footprint methodology to quantify the entire environmental impact of each system in terms
of its emissions of co2 equivalent. the results showed that the co 2 emissions associated with p-laser
cables are 30% of the total emissions attributable to xlpe cables, being about 800-1,000 kg of co2 for each
kilometre of cable produced. the group is ready with the market launch of an innovative product offering
better performance at a lower cost. in particular, the new p-laser 525 kvdc cable (hvdc technology)
represents a point of strength for prysmian, as it will be manufactured using materials that are completely
recyclable with, at the same time, a reduction in co 2 emissions. the manufacturing process has just one
continuous phase, without chemical reactions, thereby making the product faster with a lower consumption

of energy and release of greenhouse gases. at the same time, the technology employed also achieves a 10%
reduction in power transmission costs with respect to the classic xlpe technology.


p-laser 600 kv hvdc
prysmian has launched an innovative technology for power transmission networks that guarantees better
electrical performance, lower costs and greater environmental sustainability. the 600kv p-laser cable,
designed for direct current (hvdc) applications, is more efficient to manufacture than traditional xlpe
cables. the world's most powerful cable solution for the transmission of electricity is considered to be an
innovation of strategic importance in the field of high voltage cables. in particular, the product is able to reach
the maximum level of power transmissible while reducing costs by up to 30% per mw transmitted.


aircraft completes flight around the world using solar energy
after a journey of 40,000 km that took more than 500 hours, leaving from abu dhabi and landing in asia,
japan, hawaii, the united states and north africa, the solar impulse 2 has completed a world tour fuelled
solely by solar energy. this achievement, unparalleled in the history of aviation and energy engineering, was
supported by prysmian, which supplied 150 km of cables designed specifically for the devices that
distributed power throughout the entire aircraft.


commitments for the future
in 2017, the prysmian group is committed to pursuing product development that increases the efficiency and
reliability of products, while also reducing the dissipation of energy and power. implementation of the design
to cost (dtc) project will also continue, resulting in reductions in the weight of conductors and direct
materials used in the production of cables.

intellectual property rights
protecting the portfolio of patents and trademarks is a key part of the group's business, particularly in
relation to our strategy of growth in high-tech market segments. in particular, the intensive r&d activity
carried out in the energy projects, energy products and oil & gas segments, as well as in the telecom
sector, has resulted in further growth in the number of patents held by the group, especially in the high-tech
and high value-added segments. these justify the major investment made in these areas by the group in
recent years, and protect the current and future activities of these businesses.
as of 31 december 2016, the prysmian group holds 4,651 patents and patent applications throughout the
world, covering 749 inventions (of which 210 in the energy projects and energy products segments, 13 in
the oil & gas segment and 526 in the telecom sector). a total of 31 patent applications were filed during
2016, of which 20 in the telecom sector and 11 in the energy sector. following examination, 183 patents
were granted during the year, 47 by the european patent office (epo) and 33 in the united states.
the most important products, typically involving specific characteristics or a specific production process, are
protected by trademarks that allow them to be identified and guarantee their uniqueness. as of 31 december
2016, the prysmian group owns 570 trademarks, with 2,597 registrations in the various countries in which
we operate, covering the names and logos of our companies, activities, products and product lines.

supply chain
strategic approach by the group
the group constantly strengthens relations with strategic suppliers, seeking to build together a
common organisational process focused on sustainability throughout the entire production chain.

the focus on customer service continued during 2016. this policy was adopted in prior years with the
objective of improving flexibility, reliability and time to market. implementation of the "factory reliability"
concept, introduced in 2010, has improved the quality of our planning and supply processes with regard to
the control of volumes and inventory levels.
group suppliers source the main raw materials used by prysmian in the production processes: copper,
aluminium, lead, various petroleum derivatives (such as pvc and polyethylene) and components for power
and telecom cable accessories, as well as special types of glass and sheathing for optical fibre.
with reference to the strategic approach adopted to supply chain management, the group has established
five priorities that take environmental and social objectives into account:
           only use qualified suppliers;
           only use materials whose technical characteristics have been authorised;
           develop strategies for commodities that guarantee continuity of supply and availability of the
            required volume. in particular, the financial health of the supplier is important, as is only modest
            dependency on specific suppliers by prysmian;
           guarantee on-time delivery and a high level of quality over time;
           ensure competitive prices.


purchasing of metals
the majority of the group's purchases of raw materials, about 70%, comprise metals (especially copper and
aluminium), which are a fundamental resources for our activities.
with regard to the procurement of metals, prysmian purchases copper and aluminium wire rod, from the
world's leading manufacturers, in order to make the conductors for cables. in special cases, prysmian
produces its own copper rod from copper cathode, but the output volume is less than 10% of total
consumption.
the group absorbs slightly more than 2% of the world's copper production and about 5% of the copper used
                                               11
in the electrical and electronic sector . given the substantial fragmentation of the copper market, prysmian
is one of the leading economic players in the sector.
accordingly, considering the importance of the role played by suppliers within the group's value chain, the
high consumption of metal and the very broad geographical distribution of prysmian's factories, the
procurement of metals follows two strategic directions. firstly, prysmian uses manufacturers that are as
integrated as possible, with direct access to the raw material (mines or concentrates) and the ability to

     source: global data source from natixis, reuters and morgan stanley.


                                                                  70

                                                                    2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


guarantee long-term suppliers; secondly, prysmian purchases from all major global manufacturers, in order
to ensure the efficient coverage of requirements and optimise the metals logistics chain.
the group has therefore chosen to develop long-term agreements, veritable industrial partnerships, with
integrated suppliers that guarantee sourcing for extended periods via reciprocal volume commitments. the
necessary flexibility needed to follow the natural cycles of demand is assured by short-term agreements
(usually annual, with considerable flexibility regarding volume). these include suppliers that are not
integrated, since this characteristic guarantees greater flexibility.
even with regard to the purchasing of aluminium, the group has decided to concentrate increasingly on
suppliers that are vertically integrated (with processes that manufacture aluminium rod directly from
aluminium oxide), in preference to those that are not integrated (manufacturers that smelt aluminium ingots
in order to produce rod). this strategy assures the security of supplies and also has cost and environmental
advantages, due to simplification of the logistics and elimination of the ingot re-smelting cycle.
long-term strategies for the purchasing of copper and aluminium naturally lead prysmian to work with the
largest and most important companies in the respective sectors. with regard to the main quantities of non-
ferrous metals, this approach enables the group to deal with suppliers that focus strongly on all aspects of
sustainability, thus creating a highly sustainable end-to-end cycle.


the group's sustainable supply chain
in terms of supplier management, prysmian identifies its suppliers via a formal process founded on economic
and financial analysis. specifically, the group examines data and information about the risk of dependency
on the suppliers considered and, also, about their technical and technological capabilities and skills.
in order to monitor the sustainability of the supply chain, especially with regard to critical suppliers, the group
analyses all associated risks and opportunities on a centralised and integrated basis, focusing most on the
critical risks.
in this regard, prysmian carried out an internal analysis of key suppliers during 2014, assessing them
against a number of sustainability criteria. this analysis considered the group's strategic suppliers: those
that are critical and those deemed significant in terms of the value of purchases. the selected suppliers
covered about 51% of the group's purchases in 2014.
continuing this approach, prysmian implemented multiple initiatives in 2015, with a view to strengthening its
commitment on sustainability matters. in order to guarantee the quality of the materials purchased, the
group is committed to using only those raw materials approved by the responsible technical functions
following laboratory tests and extended processing trials conducted both in-house and by qualified suppliers.
this process seeks to check the environmental and social aspects, as well as those of a qualitative nature.
the qualification process starts by sending a questionnaire that the supplier is required to complete in full,
addressing every aspect. this is followed by an audit of the materials classified as critical, or if further details
are needed because, for example, the replies to the questionnaire were not considered sufficiently complete.
raw materials are considered critical if purchased from a single supplier or if the supply percentages are
particularly high, or if they are used in applications that are especially demanding in terms of the
performance required.




                                                         71

                                                                    2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


the work commenced in prior years was continued during 2016 and new initiatives were launched. in
particular, 10 audits of raw material and base metal suppliers were carried out, consistent with the level of
activity in the prior year. in one case, these checks identified the need for a plan to improve certain phases of
the production process and product testing, in order to guarantee the stability of quality levels.
following activation in 2015, once again all new suppliers in 2016 were assessed using a qualification
questionnaire that covers environmental, social and sustainability matters.
with regard to the work commenced in 2015 on the management of metals suppliers, work on their mapping,
classification and involvement continued in 2016 using a self-assessment questionnaire designed to assess
the main parameters affecting sustainability:
       integrity: fair trade, conflicts of interest, gifts and entertainment, bribery and corruption
       human and workers' rights: under-age working, health and safety, non-discrimination
       environment: use of raw materials, use of energy and carbon dioxide emissions, water consumption
        and associated risks
       mining activities and conflict minerals: resettlement, closure plans and sustainable use of land
compared with 2015, when the self-assessment questionnaires covered about 80% of all metals suppliers,
in 2016 the mapping managed to analyse all regular suppliers.


once again in 2016, the replies to the self-assessment questionnaire were analysed by an external agency
specialised in sustainability audits. this agency prepared evaluation forms for each supplier, highlighting any
areas for improvement that prysmian then discussed directly during the usual negotiation meetings. in this
way, the group's supply chain has become much more aware of the importance that prysmian attaches to
sustainability as a criterion for the selections of suppliers and the assignment of contracts. based on the
information and data collected, there are no sustainability issues with any of the main base metal suppliers
used by prysmian in 2017.
with regard to the work performed in relation to the suppliers of raw materials other than base metals, the
group has launched 3 initiatives focusing on:
       stability and continuity of production processes: new system for the collection of data and the
        monitoring of supplier service levels;
       anti-corruption ethics, especially in geographical areas commonly thought to be at risk: special
        initiative addressing the supply base in china;
       under-age working ethics: special initiative addressing mica suppliers.
with a view to increasing awareness about environmental, social and sustainability matters, a new system
for monitoring supplier service levels was developed and implemented during 2016. the main objective is to
reduce the risk of interruptions in the flow of purchased raw materials.
the report was developed together by the purchasing, logistics and quality functions, which defined the
related operating procedures. the instrument, which has already been implemented throughout europe and
is now being extended to other regions, provides monthly performance indicators analysed by
country/factory/supplier. in addition, a number of initiatives were launched during 2016 on matters and
geographical areas commonly thought to be at risk. the entire supply base in china was asked to sign a
document confirming their commitment to and focus on our anti-corruption policies and practices.

further action launched in 2016 addressed a specific product category: mica.


a responsible approach to mica mining
in order to manufacture certain safety cables and make them fire resistant, prysmian purchases limited
quantities of a few types of tape that contain small quantities of mica-glass, but we do not use this mineral
directly in our products and production processes. the extraction process for this mineral is considered to be
at risk of under-age working, especially in geographical areas like india where large quantities are mined.
the group tackled this issue during 2016 by requesting all suppliers of products with a sub-supply of mica to
complete a questionnaire certifying the absence of child labour anywhere in the supply chain.
in addition, prysmian opened a dialogue on this matter with significant international peers and ngos,
participating in numerous workshops and initiatives intended to analyse the issues in a responsible manner.
in particular, building on the report entitled ‘beauty and a beast, let's beat child labour in the mica industry'
published in may 2016 by terre des hommes – an international organisation dedicated to the defence of
children's rights and to the promotion of fair development without discrimination – prysmian took part in a
working party on these topics chaired by the ngo in collaboration with several international firms affected by
the use of this mineral. possible solutions were agreed and opportunities for action were identified in order to
establish a sustainable chain of production for this mineral in the mining areas.


lastly, group management of potential risks in the business relationship includes supplier approval of
prysmian's code of ethics. in particular, whenever a contract is awarded, the supplier must accept and sign
the group's code of ethics, in full awareness of the related rights and obligations.


code of business conduct
with a view to spreading responsible commercial practices and ensuring that ethical, economic,
environmental and social standards are met throughout the value chain, in 2014 the prysmian group
decided to promote a responsible and sustainable chain of supply by adopting a code of business conduct.
this code took effect in 2015 and applies to all employees and business relations. the principles set down
in the code apply to the business transactions and daily activities of the employees of all group entities and
their suppliers, commercial partners, commercial agents, sub-contractors and distributors. the document
covers the following matters: business integrity (fair trade, conflicts of interest, gifts and offers of
entertainment, corruption, accountability); human rights and those of workers (under-age working and
slavery, health and safety at work, non-discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining);
environment (principle of precautions, use of raw materials and compliance, use of energy, greenhouse
gases and other emissions, water consumption, waste production and recycling).
the prysmian code of business conduct was published on the group's website in 2015. in addition, its
existence and prysmian's application of the related guidelines are highlighted to suppliers at the scouting
and qualification stages.
the above work on anti-corruption and child labour in specific geographical areas and product categories
was carried out in 2016 in order to support the operational implementation of the principles laid down in the
code of business conduct. in addition, the group’s human rights policy was extended by adding a specific

chapter on the monitoring and identification of potential violations in the supply chain, with remedial action in
the first instance and, if necessary, the exclusion from all commercial and business relations of suppliers that
do not respond promptly to the standards required.


prysmian powerlink: an innovative approach to the sustainability of suppliers
prysmian powerlink implemented a cloud platform for the vendor management process about 2 years ago,
with a view to improving the process of qualifying suppliers by facilitating customer-supplier communications.
the portal comprises two distinct section: supplier information management (sim) and supplier
performance management (spm), respectively used to manage the qualification phase (ex-ante) and the
performance evaluation phase (ex-post) of suppliers. in particular, the first area (sim) provides a centralised
system for managing the entire life cycle of the customer-supplier relationship, from the creation of the
master details database to the monitoring of financial strength indicators. the data used for the selection
process is input by suppliers with direct access to the system, via the completion of a questionnaire that,
once completed, is sent to the following functions for assessment: purchasing, hse, installation/pm, quality.
the second area (spm) guides the process of defining, measuring, monitoring and analysing the
performance of suppliers in terms of the service provided. the purpose of the system is to improve the
quality of service, while achieving an overall reduction in costs and the related risks. each supplier is
assessed against specific criteria: compliance with technical, hse and quality requirements, and level of
contractual and business flexibility. in the event of an adverse result, prysmian will be able to promote
corrective actions designed to steadily improve performance or, depending on the seriousness of the case,
to "black-list" the supplier. to date, out of 355 registered suppliers, more than 90% have been qualified and
84% are used regularly. the others must still complete the qualification process, while a small number
representing about 2% of the total have been black-listed and are not used.


purchasing professional academy
prysmian group academy is the group's international professional and management education and training
school. over the past three years, the professional school has specifically addressed purchasing by
delivering an annual one-week course for 30 participants that combines contributions from highly
professional internal lecturers (from both corporate hq and country management) with those from external
supply chain professionals. attendance is open to buyers from all group companies, with a view to reviewing
purchasing fundamentals and the integrated management of global commodities.
a section dedicated to understanding the importance of sustainability matters, entitled “purchasing &
sustainability”, has been included since 2015. this lesson focused on sustainability with the prysmian group,
as it relates to the supply chain and purchasing, highlighting the activities and topics of concern to the
function and also covering aspects of the group's code of business conduct. additionally, the lesson guided
buyers to take full account of sustainability when scouting for and selecting suppliers, alongside the
traditional selection criteria based on technical, economic and financial parameters, risk management and
overall cost effectiveness. by the end of 2016, 25% of prysmian purchasing personnel around the world
have received training in this area.

commitments for the future
in confirmation of the commitment to manage the sustainability risks relating to first-level suppliers, prysmian
expects to continue the programme of supplier audits during 2017 at the same level of intensity as in prior
years.

logistics
the logistics function manages all the group's intercompany flows, both at annual budget and monthly
operational level, with the aim of satisfying demand in all markets that do not have a local production source
due to capability or production capacity reasons. the logistics function also manages short and medium-
term production allocations and planning through the sales & operations planning (s&op) process, which
links the demand cycle (sales) with the supply cycle (manufacturing and procurement). the group's planning
activities differ, depending on how the product is classified. "engineer to order" products are used mostly in
energy projects for submarine, high voltage and umbilical cables, being businesses in which the prysmian
group supports customers from the design of the “system” to the final laying of the cables. "assemble to
order" products allow the group to respond rapidly to demand for items that use standard components, and
which are only differentiated at the final stages of production or in terms of packaging, while maintaining
minimum inventories of finished products. “make to order” products are only manufactured and shipped after
receiving an order from the customer, thus reducing the level of slow-moving inventories considerably while
increasing the rotation of raw materials, components and finished products. the "make to stock" approach is
generally used for the most standardised products, which require an inventory management policy capable
of responding rapidly to demand. this last model is mostly applied in the “energy products” and “telecom”
areas.
the prysmian group continued the strategic focus on customer centricity during 2016, stabilising the high
level of service achieved in terms of delivery reliability while, at the same time, starting work to reduce the
lead-time between the receipt of an order to delivery of the product to the customer. the group has also
continued work on the reduction of inventories (overall, 60 million euro lower than in 2015, on a like-for-like
basis), with a further positive effect on cash flows.
further, the optimisation of the distribution chain has continued at the operational macro-region level, with a
particular focus on the consolidation of warehouses/distribution centres and the outsourcing of logistics
services in order to lower distribution costs.
the logistics function has optimised the allocation of production, with an increase in intercompany flows in
line with the consolidation of the global organisation into regions. consistent with the group's strategic
objectives and in addition to the customer centricity and factory reliability initiatives, during 2016 the
prysmian group continued the work carried out in recent years to improve our logistics services in terms of
flexibility, timeliness and shorter lead-times.
the distribution logistics market in 2016 was characterised by the continued excess capacity of all leading
airlines, while carriage by sea also continued to demonstrate unused capacity due to an increased number of
ships and containers, as well as to the ongoing consolidation processes implemented by the main global
carriers. prysmian has concentrated work to improve physical distribution in the south-east asia / china
region, reducing the number of sea carriers to just one, with a marked reduction in costs and improved
efficiency.
in addition, projects for the outsourcing of logistics (3pl) have been implemented in north america (usa
and canada) and in europe (united kingdom), applying the same format and best practices already found in
the area, in order to obtain significant cost savings.

       during the year, in the context of the prysmian academy, the logistics function continued the process
       (launched in 2015) of training the logistics-manufacturing personnel who work for the group's affiliates
       around the world. implemented over a period of several days and using internal lecturers, the objective of
       this course is to facilitate networking, enhance the professional standing of the individuals concerned and
       share ways to improve the group's logistics and make them more efficient.


       commitments for the future
       during 2017, the optical fibre business unit will continue to prefer sea shipments between north america
       and europe, rather than air shipments, with a view to reducing the environmental impact of product
       transportation.
       the expected reduction in air carriage was not achieved in 2016 due to a shortage of optical fibre caused by
       the growth in the world market (china in particular) for optical cables. however prysmian has planned
       capacity increases that will enable the more balanced scheduling of optical fibre in raw material form during
       2017. this will ensure a reduction in air transport costs for the optical fibre business, with a consequent
       beneficial effect on the environment in terms of emissions.
       in addition, the group will continue to encourage the replacement of road transportation with carriage by sea.
       lastly, prysmian is committed to using 3pl when negotiating future north american and australian carriage
       contracts, in order to actively reduce ghg emissions via the optimisation of transportation.

       small diameter drums are made from plastic/plywood, wood is used up to 3 metres in diameter, while larger
       drums for cables are made from steel. in general, the drum material selected depends on the diameter and
       length of the cable, criteria for the optimisation of logistics in order to reduce the carbon footprint, and
       specific requests from customers associated with regulatory aspects in the destination country.
       the group is heavily committed to maximising the re-utilisation of drums and lowering their environmentalwooden drums
       impact. for example, this involves using wood from replanted forests and implementing lagging solutions
       that reduce the recourse made to quality materials, while continuing to use recyclable materials. this
       commitment over the years has helped to improve the re-use rate of drums, as a consequence of our more
       precise and modern management techniques.

as regards transport, prysmian not only gives preference to local suppliers but is also committed to
optimising the carriage of goods by air and by sea, as well as to selecting road hauliers that seek to
implement sustainable policies and actions. in recent years, the group has increased efforts to minimise the
adverse effects of transportation on the environment.
as in prior years, road transport was the main type of transport used by the group during 2016.

prysmian's people
enhancement of personnel
sustainability also means creating value internally. prysmian knows that our people represent the
most important value added; accordingly, the group strives to ensure their growth, while also
maintaining the cohesion needed to compete at the highest levels of the sectors concerned.

within the social dimension of our business, prysmian recognises its commitment and responsibility towards
the persons who work for the group, as well as those who form the local communities in the territories in
which we are active. over more than 140 years, the group has built its history and successes on the abilities
of its employees. individuals who have been leading actors in the achievement of these results, thanks to
their ability to transmit to younger colleagues, generation after generation, their values, experience and
attachment to the firm.
the new human capital strategy, launched in 2015 in support of our business strategy, our growth in the
period to 2020 and our sustainability objectives, will guide the development of specific initiatives in this area.
the human capital strategy is founded on the following pillars:
       constant improvement and development of the organisational model, consistent with our business
        strategies and priorities;
       strategic planning of resources in order to ensure, over the medium term, the compatibility of our
        human capital with the needs of the group in terms of ability and skill;
       development of employer branding: increase awareness of the prysmian brand as an employer and
        develop the positioning of the brand in the international job market, partly via strategic recruitment
        initiatives;
       creation of a strong talent pipeline that ensures the sustainability of the group's human capital
        strategy;
       development of technical, professional and managerial skills via the training initiatives of the
        prysmian academy, which has now been active for six years;
       development of meritocracy and sustainability via global initiatives focused on improvement;
       development of employee engagement and sense of belonging via a structured approach to
        measuring the corporate climate, in order to align management and the initiatives with the perceived
        priorities of employees and, in particular, via a broad share ownership programme designed to make
        most of them shareholders.

new milestones
to maintain the commitments made last year, during 2016 prysmian launched a series of employee-focused
initiatives that are described below:
       continuation and expansion of the strategic recruitment initiatives: the build the future programme
        has resulted in the recruitment of an additional 40 persons, while successful implementation of the
        make-it programme, to recruit professionals for critical roles in the manufacturing and quality areas
        in particular, enabled us to find 50 persons. the group intends to repeat this initiative in future.

   hr management has organised a roadshow that visited every region with the involvement of local
    management, sharing the results of the viewpoint (engagement) survey, as well as the main ongoing
    hr initiatives, with a special emphasis on personnel development. the results of the survey were
    also described to employees in the various countries, both via special meetings organised locally
    and via a dedicated page on the intranet.
   prysmian developed a human rights policy during 2016 that was published in early 2017. the
    objective is to define the group's commitment to the protection of human rights in the world and the
    criteria to be agreed with our suppliers.
   while providing an opportunity for employees to present their personal objectives, the p3
    performance management process will also enable colleagues at the same level to exchange
    feedback.
   a process for the evaluation of potential (p4) was implemented during the year, enabling us to make
    a worldwide assessment of management succession paths.
   the senior leadership program, attended by senior managers in order to create a common
    corporate language to deal with managerial challenges, has been completed within the leadership
    academy.


human rights policy
prysmian is committed to respecting human rights via the adoption of a human rights policy, activating
a structured, long-term process to support internationally-recognised human rights and avoid any
involvement in their violation.
protecting the dignity, liberty and equality of all human beings is the cornerstone of our ethos. the group
rejects all discrimination and illegal deeds or activities, such as corruption, slavery and child labour. the
policy adheres to and complies with numerous international conventions, such the international human
rights charter, including the universal declaration of human rights and the ilo fundamental
conventions, included in the ilo declaration on the fundamental principles and rights at work. this
policy defines prysmian’s commitment to protect the fundamental human rights, including the dignity of
the persons who work for the group, and also to promote respect for all human rights throughout the
entire value chain and in the group's business relationships.
ethical principles play an extremely important role in the context of prysmian’s commitment to
sustainability. the group believes, in fact, that ethical business conduct is a key success factor for the
business.


commitments for the future
in 2017 the prysmian group expects to launch a new series of initiatives for staff and external
stakeholders. in particular:
   the global recruitment programme “sell it”, which was launched at the end of 2016 to fill critical
    professional positions in the commercial, marketing and product management areas, is expected to
    find 40-50 staff with experience and will be repeated in future;

   a new group viewpoint survey will be conducted, while also implementing the actions identified in
    relation to the topics already determined to be important;
   the "build the future" recruitment programme for new graduates will be held for the sixth time, with
    the aim of making recruitment a key element of the group's workforce and skills planning strategy.
   the human rights policy, approved in early 2017, will be circulated to all employees during the
    year, promoted via specific communications and implemented throughout the value chain together
    with the supply and distribution network, in order to create synergies within the entire business
    process;
   the p3 performance management process will be further improved, by giving staff the opportunity to
    state their objectives to their superiors in order to boost engagement and participation. in the near
    future, this system will also allow the exchange of peer-to-peer feedback.

investing in people
for prysmian, intellectual capital and talent are strategic assets for the achievement of our profitability and
value creation objectives. as such, they must be supported by appropriate actions to develop and enhance
their worth.
over the period 2012-2016, the group designed and implemented a human capital development strategy in
order to minimise the errors made when deciding on people and, therefore, to equip the business with
valuable resources capable of contributing to future growth and maintaining our global leadership position in
the sector.
the human capital development strategies based on an integrated management system that can attract,
develop, promote and retain talented people.
the talent management system is based on four pillars:
       recruiting and talent acquisition
       training and development
       performance management
       talent and succession management

recruiting and talent acquisition
employer branding
numerous initiatives during 2016 were designed to position the group as the employer of choice on a
global scale:
       the group has carried out employer branding campaigns on linkedin, building a strong partnership
        with the most important professional social network. this involved opening an increasingly detailed
        careers pages and publishing job vacancies
       we held numerous career fairs in order to strengthen the participation at job fairs of the world’s best
        engineering and business universities
       lastly, prysmian also carried out intensive and targeted recruiting and communications activities on
        facebook, linkedin and other social networks. in particular, during 2016 prysmian made use of live
        webcasts to candidates in order to present the group and its culture in the best possible way,
        respond in real time to the more important questions and keep them updated regularly about the
        selection process. this tool has proved to be a great success, being rewarded by thousands of
        comments and visits.


graduate program
the development of managers and technicians of the future starts by recruiting the most capable individuals
available, with particular reference to new graduates. “build the future, the graduate program” is an
international programme for the recruitment and induction of new graduates. the objective is to place young
graduates with high-potential profiles in various functions and geographical areas.
the graduate program comprises the following phases: a careful selection process; 2 weeks of induction in
milan during the first year with the group, plus another 3 weeks of training in the following two years, as part

of the post graduate program (pgp); job rotation for a year with support from a mentor; a two-year
international assignment in one of the group’s locations; lastly, assignment to an important technical or
managerial role at the end of the 3-year program.
starting from 2012, this programme has already resulted in the recruitment of about 170 young people from
all over the world. forty new international staff were taken on during the first half of the year, while in the
second half of the year 28,000 applications were received. this will lead to the selection and recruitment of
another 50 persons in 2017.

make it
in 2016, in line with the talent acquisition strategy, prysmian presented again the international recruiting
programme known as "make it". this specifically targets engineers with 3/5 years' experience, who are
interested in taking key, highly challenging positions at the main factories within the group.
the aim is to recruit engineers from other sectors and given them an opportunity to contribute to the growth
of the manufacturing business.
the objective of the programme is to develop and grow additional industrial talent. the make it steps involve:
on boarding & training on the job for about 2 months in order to settle into the local business and the
specific role assigned; a period of technical and managerial induction at the manufacturing academy in
mudanya (turkey); support from a mentor and continuous technical training linked to participation in the
lean six sigma skills development programme; lastly, opportunities for career development via assessments
of performance and potential.
the first edition, which attracted about 6,000 direct and 1,500 indirect candidates, resulted in the global
recruitment during 2016 of about 50 engineers from the most advanced sectors.

sell it
consistent with the various strategic recruitment activities, a new recruitment programme known as “sell
it”, addressing the commercial area, was devised in 2016. the objective for 2017 is to identity engineers
and others with a passion for and 3/5 years’ experience in the commercial area, who are interested in taking
key and highly challenging positions in the energy and telecom businesses at the group's most important
factories.
this programme was developed with a major line contribution, drawing on detailed interviews and a survey
of a representative sample of about 100 employees working in the commercial function.

training and development: prysmian group academy
1,200 employees involved in 2016
in order to develop its people, the group has created the prysmian group academy, an international
managerial and professional training school, whose objective is to develop and consolidate the leadership
and technical expertise of its management. the academy is organised into two distinct but synergistic
schools: the school of management and the professional school.
school of management
the school of management, which is run in partnership with sda bocconi and a network of another 9
leading international business schools (esade, fudan, smu, stenbeis, corvinus, sse, fgv, essec,

usc), has involved 563 participants over 5 years and has already awarded 333 diplomas, with plans for
further growth in 2017.
the school is designed to attract talented staff with the aim of sharing a common vision of the business,
diffusing the values and culture of prysmian and exposing them to the best managerial practices.
the prysmian group’s school of management is unique in that, due to a system of credits and examinations,
the complete portfolio of training programmes leads to obtaining the internationally-recognised gemba
(global executive master business administration), awarded by sda bocconi in partnership with an
international network of business schools.
additionally, all programme content has been heavily customised to meet the competitive challenges of the
industry in which prysmian operates. this has been made possible thanks to the contribution of the faculty
of sda bocconi in preparing "prysmian global and regional case studies". based on real situations, these
case studies allow participants to pit themselves against the daily challenges they will find when developing
strategies in the world of cables. the portfolio of management training is therefore organised into seven
leadership programmes:
       post graduate program: a group training programme for new graduates that have just joined the
        prysmian group, introducing them to the fundamentals of business, products, processes and
        customers;
       international leadership program: an intensive group programme for talents with 5/7 years’
        experience, preparing them to take leadership positions within the prysmian group at an
        international level;
       regional leadership programs: programmes for each region (southern europe, northern
        europe, south america, north america, central-eastern europe, apac), designed together with
        leading business schools for regional middle management not involved in the global programmes.
        the programmes are tailored to suit the particular characteristics of the various businesses and
        local markets, reinforcing the network within the region without losing sight of the group's unitary
        strategy;
       advanced leadership program: an ad-hoc group programme for middle and senior managers
        intended to assess and develop their managerial skills and ability, in preparation for rapid career
        advancement within the group;
       gemba global: executive mba from sda bocconi;
       slp (senior leadership program): programme introduced in 2016, based on training and business

manufacturing academy, where training meets production
prysmian group has launched the new manufacturing academy, which seeks to consolidate the skills
relating to the production of all product ranges throughout the group, as well as to established a solid
manufacturing community. based in mudanya (turkey), the academy will receive and train the greatest
manufacturing talents, with a view to expanding group know-how in this field. according to fabrizio
rutschmann, svp human resources and organisation, “the manufacturing academy is hugely important for
the group and its employees. global and local experts can meet at this outstanding centre for production
excellence to exchange more readily their knowledge and experiences and, therefore, consolidate best
practices in the technical area.”
given the location, at one of the largest prysmian factories in the world, and its role as a centre of excellence
and skills, the facility is able to provide in-depth knowledge that is unparalleled in the manufacturing world.
the manufacturing academy will offer prysmian employees three different programmes, depending on their
roles and seniority: "manufacturing fundamentals”, “advanced manufacturing” and “excellence in
manufacturing”. the teachers, including experts from within the group, will share their specialist knowledge
and experience on various subjects. the training will address such topics as kpis, processes, materials,
controls, worker management, continuous improvement, instruments and methods, best practices and
efficiency, maintenance and machinery, cost management and cross-functional knowledge.

performance management: p3 prysmian people performance
about 5,000 staff involved in 2016
in order to achieve our business objectives and continue to improve our results, each employee must be put
in a position to make a daily contribution. this requires the allocation of clear objectives agreed with
management and the provision of constant feedback about the work performed and results obtained.
the prysmian people performance system (p3) was introduced for the first time in 2012. after a pilot phase
targeting the group's executives, the system was then extended to the entire managerial and clerical
population in all countries involving, as in the past two years, around 5,000 persons in 2016.
the objectives of the prysmian people performance system are to:
       align personal objectives with those of the group, thereby motivating each employee to do their best
        and generate value for the entire organisation, creating a single business identity;
       guide leadership behaviour;
       facilitate communications between managers and staff, so that the results achieved can be shared;
       train those deemed most deserving, based on objective appraisals.
this process, backed by an on-line platform, implements 5 main steps:
       definition of performance: determine targets and expected behaviours;
       overall assessment: appraisal of the quantitative and qualitative results achieved;
       calibration: sharing and comparison of the assessments made by management at various levels
        (country/region, business unit, group);
       feedback: provision of feedback to staff.
as part of the constant improvement of the business and business processes, a number of actions were
implemented and monitored in 2016 in order to enhance the meritocracy and employee engagement:
       possibility for staff to present their target objectives, agreeing them with their superiors, and redefine
        them during the year in response to changes in their roles or external conditions;
       preparation and documentation of an action plan for the improvement of performance;
       alignment of the performance process with career programmes;
       association of assessment systems with the reward system.

talent and succession management: p4 prysmian people performance potential
about 800 staff involved in 2016
following various talent assessment and measurement projects and, not least, in accordance with the
recommendations of the italian stock exchange code of self-governance on management succession, in
2015 the group – acting on a mandate from the compensation and appointments committee – decided to
streamline its talent assessment procedure by introducing a single process for the identification of talent and
the preparation of succession plans.
accordingly, for the first time, the group introduced a structured process for the identification of talent in
2016, known as p4 (prysmian people performance potential), together with mercer, a consultancy. the
main purpose of this process is to assess potential and predict future performance in roles of greater
responsibility.
the process is based on prysmian's definition of talent, as the sum of consistent performance and potential,
that was identified from a series of structured interviews with 35 key group managers.
consistent performance means having delivery good results in at least the two previous years, as
determined using the p3 assessment system, while potential means a combination of 8 personality traits that
are important for the group.
this process, launched in march 2016, involved all participants in the p3 process in the following phases:
            potential scouting: all employees were screened with reference to the consistent performance
             criteria. this scouting activity involved about 800 employees (defined as consistent performers),
             via the guided observation of 8 traits indicating potential and a rating of potential on a scale of 1
             to 3;
            talent pools: all assessments were consolidated in a 9-quadrant matrix and consolidated by
             organisational band, giving rise to the talent pools;
            talent discussion: discussion committees met in each country in order to review the results of
             the observations made and prepare the succession tables;
            group validation: all country-level reports were discussed at an annual meeting in order to
             identify a talent pool of about 300 persons, which will be reviewed every year;
            external assessment: for 10 strategic positions, an external partner (spencer stuart) was
             involved on completion of the process, to make an independent assessment of the potential of
             about 30 managers, in order to evaluate their readiness.
given the good results achieved in 2016 and the importance of this process in terms of risk assessment and
the sustainability of the business, it has been confirmed and established as an annual process that will
constantly monitor the pipelines and the risk of discontinuities affecting critical positions.
with regard to the evaluation of talent, it is useful to highlight the work carried out in the academy
classrooms in partnership with ceb, a consultancy. in particular, consistent with the p4 process, a “process
of leadership assessment and development” was included in the leadership programmes of the school of
management and in some programmes of the professional school. to date, about 400 executives, middle
managers and technicians have benefited. this process supplements the programmes of the prysmian
academy with action plans and individual development plans. the same methodology was also used by

various group affiliates for critical selection processes, thus obtaining additional information about the
candidates and strengthening the decision-making process.


commitments for the future
strategic recruitment
“build the future, the graduate program”, “make it, manufacturing career at prysmian group” and “sell it;
a growing path at prysmian group”: 120 new staff are ready to join the group in 2017, which confirms the
great success of the two strategic recruitment programmes aimed at building the future of our business.

training and development
for 2017, prysmian group academy plans to run more than 60 technical/managerial courses with the aim of
diffusing technical and specialist knowledge and of strengthening the managers' ability to guide the business
and manage their staff along with the many change processes currently under way on the industrial,
strategic, organisational and commercial front.
in particular, the school of management will launch the following initiatives:
       the first edition of the women in leadership program (wlp) that, as part of side by side, the
        project to promote diversity within the group, and in collaboration with sda bocconi and valore d,
        seeks to train a group of talented women from various countries and regions within the group on the
        topics of strategy, leadership, social intelligence and the change management;
       a broader programme of awareness about diversity matters, again as part of the side by side
        project. initially, those attending the courses provided by the school of management will be involved;
       the first edition of the telecom business leadership program, which is an induction programme for
        new recruits of the telecom bu who are not involved in other programmes at the school of
        management. lecturers from sda bocconi and bu managers and senior managers will talk to the
        participants on such topics as strategy, market, business, finance, culture and organisation.


activity at the professional school during 2017 will, on the other hand, include:
       strong commitment to preparing for the start-up of the group’s technology and product school in
        lexington;
       expansion of the digital academy, with further innovations in the types and methods of learning;
       launch and implementation of training programme on compliance matters in general and anti-trust
        issues in particular. this programme, to be delivered to a large number of managers working in the
        sales function, will consist of a mixture of digital and classroom training. the purpose of both
        initiatives is to increase the awareness of participants about the importance of adopting managerial
        practices founded on ethics and integrity.


performance, career and total rewarding
in line with the strategic development of the business and the systems for managing the performance and
careers of employees, the integrated management of talent on a meritocratic basis is becoming of more
central importance. accordingly, the systems for the management of performance (p3) and scouting for

potential (p4) will be supplemented with reward policies, thus structuring all initiatives to quantify the value of
merit and making them more transparent.


sharing of knowledge: learn from others
last october, 10 employees of the supply chain and corporate purchasing functions at various factories in
the netherlands participated in a two-day meeting in delft (netherlands) on good practices, with a view to
enhancing coordination and efficiency among business functions and improving the safety and performance
of the compliance lines.

international mobility
as of 31 december 2016, the prysmian group's expat population counts about 233 employees from about
30 different countries (36% are italians) who are living in 36 different destination countries. of these, 72%
are at a non-executive level and 16% are women. there were 88 new departures during 2016.
these statistics evidence the importance of the international mobility programme within the group.
international mobility is an integral part of the group's policies for the growth and development of talent. on
the one hand, it spreads the culture and values of prysmian to all countries and group affiliates, which is a
need that became central following the acquisition of the draka group in 2011. on the other hand,
international mobility helps to meet local organisational requirements, via the transfer of managerial and
technical know-how from one country to another.
in this regard, the implementation of the new policy and mobility processes continued during 2016, with a
view to aligning prysmian's policy with the most advanced market practices, in order to facilitate expatriation
even outside of the group's headquarters, align the conditions and segment the various types of assignment.
international experience is also central to the professional and managerial growth of the young talents
participating in the graduate programme.
during 2016, 40 new graduates from 18 countries of origin commenced an international experience due to
last two years in 19 destination countries.
despite this great attention to internationalism and the cross-country development of resources, the
prysmian group also dedicates much energy to appreciation of the cultural diversity that exists within each
country where the group is present. about 58% of the group's senior executives work in their country of
origin.
international mobility during 2017 will again focus on guaranteeing the success of the international
assignments, as measured in terms of its effectiveness in transferring know-how and developing the local
team. efforts will also be made to improve the career planning for expatriates on completion of their
international assignment.
the success of the international mobility policy very much depends on expatriates sharing and strengthening
prysmian's identity, culture and values with local teams, thus strengthening cohesion, while also drawing on
the diversity of talent available across borders in order to obtain superior results for the group.

remuneration policies
the compensation & benefit policies adopted by the prysmian group are designed to attract and retain
highly professional resources, especially for key positions, having regard for the complexity and specialised
nature of the business. growing internationalisation requires constant focus on the different geographical
realities in order to ensure assignment of the right talents in the context of a competitive marketplace. the
policies are defined in a way that aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders, pursuing
the priority objective of creating sustainable value over the medium-long-term by building a real, verifiable
link between pay and performance both individually and at group level.
these policies are defined and implemented centrally in relation to executive personnel (about 300
employees) and expatriates (233 employees), but are addressed locally for all other employees subject to
the guidelines which are issued centrally.
the main new measures introduced in 2016 were:
       launch of the special-rate share purchase plan (named yes) for the period 2016-2018:
       introduction of a sector benchmark for the executive directors;
       launch of a total reward project that links remuneration policies more directly with processes of
        assessing performance and potential.
in addition, detailed and specific analyses of earning levels were carried out in certain pilot countries during
2016, in order to develop a method of analysis that can be implemented by all divisions within the group. in
particular, data was analysed for the population in a number of the group's main regions.
the remuneration policy for executive directors and executives with strategic responsibilities is determined
as the result of an agreed and transparent process, during which the compensation and nominations
committee and the board of directors of the company both play a central role. every year, in fact, the
compensation and nominations committee submits the remuneration policy to the board of directors for
approval and checks on its application during the year.
the pay structure for executive directors and managers with strategic responsibilities and executives
comprises a fixed component, a short-term variable component and a medium-long-term variable component.
the monetary-equity offer is supported by additional benefits such as supplementary welfare, additional
medical care, personal accident policies, a company car for staff who are entitled to one, and company
canteen or restaurant vouchers. these benefits are adapted to local conditions, having regard for market
characteristics and relevant regulations. all employees in the milan office have access to doctors at
specialist medical facilities, and their children can obtain grants for advanced secondary education and for
their university studies. the benefits available to full-time workers are also available to those on part-time
contracts. the analysis was broadened in 2016 to include such new “intangible” benefits as smart working
and flexible hours.
work also continues on the global mapping of benefit policies, prior to commencing rationalisation work and
welfare development projects.
after this analysis, the group intends to evaluate the implementation, where possible, of flexible benefit
projects and the launch of new initiatives that draw on existing approaches. greater focus and investment in
this area will undoubtedly improve employee engagement and, consequently, the results of the group. this

focus on individuals is confirmed by the prysmian group's commitment to investing in the development of
employee-company relations, via numerous initiatives designed to encourage involvement. the group also
signs agreements with external partners for the supply of products and services on attractive terms to
employees, such as discounts on theatre tickets, gym subscriptions, magazines and products purchased in
shops. notable initiatives include that of prysmian australia which, via the issue of discount coupons and
other benefits for employees, has launched a partnership with a supplier and an on-line and mobile service
that allows benefits to be customised to meet the needs of each person. in addition, prysmian hungary
organised a corporate family day and other minor events during the year, while action taken in romania
promoted health insurance discounts for employees, as well as the implementation of a welfare policy that
supports the families of employees afflicted by serious or incurable illnesses. prysmian brazil has also taken
similar action, while also providing its employees with health cover.
following a trial last year, prysmian russia offers employees a chance to send their children to summer
camps, with 80% reimbursement of the cost. additionally, the most deserving children of employees are
eligible for study grants from the age of 14 until they graduate from university.
in finland, prysmian has promoted healthcare designed to increase wellness in the workplace, involving
medical examinations, vaccines and other specific procedures.
the prysmian group also provides a series of post-employment benefit plans via programmes that include
defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
the defined contribution plans envisage payment by the group, based on legal or contractual obligations, of
contributions to public or private insurance institutions.
the group satisfies its obligations by making these contributions. the defined benefit plans principally
include pension funds, employee severance indemnities (for italian companies), medical care plans and
other benefits, such as long-service awards.
the remuneration policy and long-term incentive plans were well received by the stakeholders (votes in
favour exceeded 98%), whose opinions and feedback are considered when preparing the annual policy. in
fact, the human resources department analyses the reports and opinions obtained from the main proxy
advisors about the compensation report and the incentive plans, and recommends amendments and
changes in practices in response to this input.
in the context of transparency on compensation matters, the group has issued guidelines in accordance with
local laws to link pay measures to all levels of the organisation, while variable pay schemes will be linked to
individual performance appraisal. the fixed element of remuneration is reviewed annually and, if necessary,
updated to remain competitive with market conditions, while also considering internal equity, personal
performance and the requirements of local regulations. this meritocratic approach is based on a global
system of performance assessment (p3) that is applied on a consistent basis throughout the entire group.


yes: your employee shares
towards the end of 2013, the group launched the yes (your employee shares) plan, which is a share
ownership scheme open to all employees. the plan has been introduced in 28 countries, informing
employees via an intensive communications campaign and dedicated training sessions. the plan regulations
allowed employees to purchase prysmian shares, in certain time windows during 2014, 2015 and 2016, on

advantageous terms with the agreement not to sell the shares for at least 36 months subsequent to their
purchase date. employees would have obtained shares at a variable discount, ranging from 1% for the chief
executive officer and senior managers, to 15% for other executives and 25% for the remaining employees,
in order to encourage employees at all levels to take part. in addition, all participants were given 6 free
shares as a welcome bonus. the objectives pursued by this plan are to increase the involvement, sense of
belonging and business understanding of our employees, confirm the shared, long-term mutual interests of
employees, customers and shareholders, and strengthen the internal perception of the prysmian group as
truly "one company". in short, the wish expressed by the group via the launch of this plan is to encourage
employees to become stable shareholders, thus making them owners of a small part of the business in
which they work.
the yes programme has proved to be a real success. it was taken up by more than 7,200 employees:
around 44% of the entitled population became shareholders. participation in the plan in certain countries
was very high throughout the entire three-year period. for example, almost all staff in romania joined the
plan, 85% in turkey and about 65% at the milan head office. the results of the programme are summarised
below:
        over 7,200 employees involved, being 44% of those entitled;
        16.8 million euro invested;
        420,000 treasury shares assigned to employees.
following the success of yes, a meeting was held at the milan stock exchange during 2016, where over
200 employees from many countries, acting as yes ambassadors, participated in one day of courses on the
programme.
the high level of participation convinced prysmian to extend the programme with a few changes for another
three years, with a view to increasing employee share ownership to at least 1.5% of the total.
the shareholders’ meeting held in april 2016 approved extension of the plan to 2019, raised the number of
bonus shares at the time of subscription (8 for those who have already participated, 3 in subsequent years),
introduced a loyalty bonus for those who decide to extend the lock-up period for their shares, and improved
the flexibility of the plan rules (multiple windows, purchase close to the subscription, exit clauses linked to the
personal life of individuals).
the promotional campaign carried out in december 2016 suggests that the results will be good, with a
considerable number of acceptances (5,200 participants) and investment estimated to exceed 6 million euro.
based on this, more than 50% of employees will be shareholders. the shares will be purchased during 2017.

new three-year plan for yes – your employee shares
prysmian has launched a new three-year share participation plan reserved for employees. this plan, named
yes – your employee shares, has already generated much interest within the group and, to date, more
than 40% of the group’s approximately 20,000 employees in 50 countries have become shareholders. “our
objective – explained valerio battista – is for employee shareholders to represent 1.5% of the shareholder
base by the end of this second three-year period. the alignment of the interests of shareholders and
employees is of fundamental importance for a public company like prysmian”. “however – added fabrizio
rutschmann, svp human resources & organization – we don’t just want to offer our employees a financial
investment opportunity. our objective is to promote their involvement and awareness that we all work for a
common goal, which is the creation of value for the benefit of all stakeholders, both inside and outside the
group.”
yes represents one of the various programmes for the employees of the prysmian group, which constantly
promotes policies designed to develop and train our personnel and position the group among the leaders in
people value management.


commitments for the future
for 2017, the group has planned new transparency and process automation activities with regard to pay
issues, designed to simplify procedures and provide employees with immediate information.

diversity and equal opportunity
prysmian has identified the promotion of diversity and equal opportunity as a strategic objective for the
management of human resources. given this commitment, the group has begun by implementing a global
diversity and inclusion policy and developing a number of supporting initiatives.
during 2016, prysmian launched the “side by side” programme with a view to promoting and supporting
diversity within the group. the initial scope of this activity is to support gender diversity and then extend to
diversity of other kinds (age, culture etc.). this programme is founded on four pillars:
           in addition to the diversity and inclusion policy that has already been defined and communicated,
            recruitment and gender equality policies will also be disseminated;
           identification of quantitative objectives for female participation at each level of the business and for
            inclusion in hr processes (e.g. selection);
           specific internal and external communications campaigns;
           development and delivery by the prysmian academy of training and awareness-building initiatives
            about diversity. in order to ensure maximum employee agreement and involvement, all initiatives will
            be designed with the help of focus groups comprising persons at all levels within the organisation
            and of all ages.
the project was presented to and approved by senior management during 2016 and the first initiatives will
take place in 2017.
another prysmian objective is to increase the female presence at each organisational level by 2020, with set
targets for the inclusion of female candidates in the personnel selection process.

                                                                                                                    19

industrial relations
the group maintains constant, profitable relations with workers' representatives and trade unions. these are
founded on mutual understanding and fair discussion, in the conviction that – while respecting the reciprocal
roles of each party – there are common interests to be pursued via constructive dialogue. the workers'
representative and trade unions are therefore free to operate in compliance with local legislation and
practices.
in many of the countries where the group has factories, 2016 was marked by the signature of agreements
with workers' representatives and trade unions. these agreements covered the normal renewal of the
economic and regulatory terms of current payroll contracts, as well as specific actions to improve
competitiveness/reduce costs where required by market conditions.

internal communications and involvement
internal communications are playing a key role in supporting and facilitating integration within
prysmian, by creating shared values and informing personnel about corporate strategies and
policies, as well as about the most significant events that have taken place.

internal communications are important, not only to promote a sense of belonging among employees, but also
to highlight and share with personnel the activities and projects undertaken and the goals reached.
communications are fundamental for creating a pro-active working environment, motivated to achieve
common objectives. this tool draws employees closer to the strategic direction of the business, informing
them about the events taking place elsewhere in the group.
appropriate systems of communication help to create transparent relations based on mutual trust. the most
important tools employed to guarantee communications in 50 countries are:

       "inside" (the group intranet), an information tool designed to create a global community that helps to
        establish a common identity within the group. the intranet functions as an on-line magazine for
        around 8000 white-collar workers, and is managed by an editorial committee with members in each
        country, business and division.
       “insight”, the group's quarterly magazine dedicated to all internal and external stakeholders.
        published on the website, this magazine is a privileged channel for reporting regularly on the
        progress of the group, from the latest financial results to changes in the share price, with in-depth
        commentary on the businesses and the markets in which prysmian operates, as well as a focus on
        individuals and the initiatives taken throughout the world;
       "yes app”, created to facilitate the exchange of information with employees participating in the yes
        share plan, the group's first app has become a point of reference for anyone interested in the latest
        information about the prysmian group. its main purpose is to reach all categories of employee,
        especially those without a workstation with direct access to the intranet.
       social networks: prysmian is active on the main social networks with its own pages, not only at
        corporate level but also at country level, thus facilitating interactions with employees in the local
        language and building brand awareness and employer branding externally.


action to encourage involvement, intended to address better the needs of different cultures within the group,
is promoted by hr departments at both central and local level. activity in 2016 included the internal prysmart
communications campaign dedicated to hq employees and designed to facilitate the transfer to the new
headquarters and the adoption of smart working practices; the yes campaign to promote the new three-
year share ownership plan, made using internal testimonials from every country; and the integrity first plan
that presented the whistle-blowing procedure to both white-collar and factory personnel in every country.

                                                                 2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


health and safety
the prysmian group is as committed as ever to protecting the health, safety and well-being of its employees
at their places of work. the objective is to promote activities that take increasing account of health, safety
and well-being matters, both within and outside the working environment.
although not necessarily required by local legislation, the group has established education and training
programmes on such topics as safety at work, first aid, the fire prevention regulations, the consequence of
alcohol and drug abuse, and environmental matters.
in the firm belief that rules, training and information play a key role in risk management and the prevention of
accidents, the group directs its activities and regulates key work phases with work instructions, which set
out the rules and precautions to be observed, and ensures that they are implemented. for each key work
phase, the residual risk is then calculated, and the necessary measures are defined in order to minimise it.
in order to distribute this culture extensively, prysmian provides training on equipment safety, proper waste
management, and on the safety of machines and installations both during construction and in the
maintenance phase. a spotlight is placed on the personal protective equipment allocated to each worker in
order to mitigate the residual risks associated with the work performed. in order to ensure a concrete and
systematic approach to safety, the group adopts the ohsas 18001 health and safety management system,
which is being applied at all production locations.
partly to ensure compliance with current regulations, the hr functions at country level prepare training plans
for their personnel and determine specific training paths for the various categories of worker, depending on
their roles, duties, levels of responsibility and working environment. the commitment to health and safety
was reinforced once again during 2016, via the coordination of central and local activities under the guidance
of the hse function. at the start of the year, hse gathered, analysed and shared with top management the
results achieved in 2014 and the performance of the group and each country/geographical area,
determined with reference to relevant indicators (total number of events involving the loss of work and
related ‘frequency indicator’).
on the basis of the technical evaluations and taking into account the changes and local requirements, the
hse division has set its objectives for 2016. to facilitate this it has also encouraged a series of support
projects involving various levels of the company, as described below:
       making more effective and accepted the process of analysing events and defining corrective and
        preventive actions: in the case of serious accidents, analysing the causes in detail, both in order to
        contribute to the management of the cases concerned and to identify from them ideas for the
        prevention of repetitions at the group's other operating units;
       continuation of training on specific safety matters: a number of training sessions were held during the
        year. training sessions and meetings are also seen as an opportunity to analyse the results
        obtained and difficulties encountered by the various areas and business units, in order to identify
        practices and experience and present the projects and tools promoted by the central hse function
        for the increasingly efficient and agreed management of hse matters;

       continuation of support for the hse functions at country/geographical area and unit level in
        implementing their health and safety management systems and assessing the safety aspects of new
        investment.
the group's priority objective is to reduce accidents, as measured by the if index (ohsa lta). this index
was about 2.6 at the end of 2016. accidents are also monitored with reference to other parameters, such as
their gravity considering days absent from work.
with regard to industrial illnesses, prevention and monitoring activities are organised using suitable tools at
local level in order to improve their effectiveness; the hse function is responsible for establishing the related
guidelines and action points.


blumatica platform implemented
work to implement blumatica commenced during 2016. this platform is used to manage and communicate
matters relating to health, safety and the environment. specifically, the platform was fully implemented at all
italian factories. the platform is however operational at 50% of all locations, including the headquarters, via
the input to blumatica of the elements concerned. in addition, certain operating units have a system for the
management of chemical substances.
the platform can be used to manage (both locally and centrally) various elements comprising the safety and
environment management system, such as: training forms, risk assessment documents, identification of the
ppe to be used for the various job descriptions, health monitoring. with a view to extending blumatica to
other factories within the group, a feasibility study has been devised following a pilot implementation that
was carried out at the slatina factory (romania) in order to test the regulatory aspects and related content.


italy loves safety: a day dedicated to health and safety in the workplace
the italy loves safety (#ils2016) project was carried out in italy on 19 may 2016 to highlight the importance
of health and safety in the workplace. this event resulted in the simultaneous creation of numerous
workshops in about 35 italian towns, where multiple supporting theatrical and other events, childcare
seminars etc. also took place. the prysmian group participated in this project with prysmian powerlink
health, safety and the environment, actively contributing via the preparation of video interviews and
collaboration with associazione professionale italiana ambiente e sicurezza.

walkabout in the regions of central-eastern europe
confirming the central importance to the group of our employees and their well-being, the prysmian central-
eastern europe division recently launched an initiative designed to enhance the lifestyle and physical
wellness of personnel. group's comprising a maximum of three persons accepted the challenge to walk a
distance of 5,826 km as quickly as possible, at the same time throughout central-eastern europe, taking
photographs and sharing them on the social networks using the hashtag #prysmianwalkacrosscee. the
objective was to promote a culture of psycho-physical wellness.

communities
corporate citizenship and philanthropy initiatives
aware of the importance of people and the territories in which it operates, the prysmian group is
committed to building a socially responsible business by supporting, via specific initiatives, the
economic, social and cultural development of those areas.

relations with local communities are important for the creation of value around prysmian. during 2016, the
group continued pursuit of its commitment to be socially responsible by supporting, via specific initiatives,
the economic, social and cultural development of the areas in which it is present. in addition to direct
economic contributions and donations in kind when allowed by the corporate citizenship and philanthropy
policy, the prysmian group also provides indirect support for social projects via the hours paid to employees
involved in the charitable activities.
the main activities during the year involved various areas and were concentrated in italy, other european
countries such as france, hungary, spain and germany, and elsewhere such as russia, china and
australia.


corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy
with a view to defining common, shared rules within the group for identifying corporate citizenship and
philanthropy initiatives correlated with business operations, during 2014 prysmian decided to update the
policy governing activities that benefit local communities.
the group believes that access to energy and telecommunications is a prerequisite for the economic and
social development of local communities. for this reason, the corporate citizenship and philanthropy
activities promoted must be principally intended to support initiatives that facilitate access to energy and
telecommunications by local populations, with particular reference to those in developing countries.
the group considers initiatives for the benefit of the community as those relating to:
    communities: long-term initiatives that aim to mitigate socio-environmental issues in the communities in
     which the group does business;
    charitable gifts: short-term initiatives, or one-off donations to non-governmental organisations and
     supranational and local non-profit organisations;
    commercial initiatives that benefit the community: initiatives that support prysmian's success directly,
     conducted in partnership with community-based organisations.

headquarters
in line with the initiatives undertaken in 2015, prysmian decided to renew our commitment in favour of the
unhcr (united nations high commission for refugees) in 2016, by making a donation from employees and
the group in favour of the population of ecuador afflicted by an earthquake there in april 2016. the unhcr
used part of the donation to give those affected basic supplies, such as tents and other immediate
necessities, such as kitchen sets and mosquito repellents, given the risk of zika virus contagion. in addition,
some of the funds were used to purchase solar-powered lights.
the decision to work with the unhcr by supplying solar lamps was part of the wider strategy described in
the group's corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy, which commits prysmian to providing active
support for initiatives that promote access to solar energy and telecommunications.
in 2016, prysmian also contributed significantly to the collection of funds by the italian red cross in favour of
the victims of the earthquake that hit central italy in august. in particular, the group decided to double the
amount donated by employees, thereby raising a considerable sum. the italian red cross activated more
than 4,000 volunteers, right from the start, and guaranteed more than 33,000 meals to the populations
affected.
lastly, the group contributed – via a cash donation – to the "las mariposas” project that, in siena and the
surrounding area, provides psychological support to the victims of sexual abuse. the project is part of the
codice rosa service that provides access to first aid solely for the victims of violence: women, men and
children who have been mistreated and abused. in order to improve steadily the first-aid services that
include codice rosa cover, the objective is to enhance understanding of the health needs of victims by
supplementing the diagnostic skills with psychological support. as a consequence, first-aid personnel will be
able to request help from psychologists trained in codice rosa matters, on a 24/7 basis every day of the
year.


italy
the group has participated in numerous charitable projects, such as the development of "hospitality homes”
in milan, together with onlus lilt, so that the families of children with cancer can more to the city for the
necessary treatment, as well as the expansion of the milan science museum. additional projects worthy of
mention included the project to provide ftth cover in the rural areas of topol pri begunje, in solvenia, and
implementation of the ultra-broadband connections for wikimania 2016.


france
in 2016, prysmian france contributed to the donation of industrial cables under a three-year contract (from
1.1.2016 to 31.12.2018) with electriciens sans frontières (esf), an ngo. these cables are used for
numerous initiatives promoted by the ngo that, founded in 1986, is involved in many projects including,
above all, the transmission and delivery of power to developing countries and communities afflicted by
catastrophes. at present, the organisation has more than 1,000 volunteers working on 136 projects in 35
countries. the first project, “saponé” in burkina faso, where esf contributes to improving the access to
power by 27 medical centres, involved prysmian donating the cables needed to upgrade the local electrical
installations.

germany
in germany, prysmian has been involved in numerous initiatives in the field of corporate citizenship,
principally working with local associations in neustadt. the group is committed to the promotion of cultural
and sporting activities and to support the german division of the red cross.


spain
prysmian spain worked on numerous social initiatives during the year. in particular, the group supported the
activities of the human age institute, a non-profit foundation whose main objective is to facilitate the
development of talent, especially among young people, in order to improve their job prospects. other
initiatives worthy of mention included the donation made to the san juan de dios hospital, a non-profit
religious body that provides medical assistance to persons in financial difficulties, and official sponsorship of
union esportiva castelldefels.


hungary
during 2016, prysmian hungary organised and managed the first “prysmian design competition in hungary”,
intended to support young artists from the regions of central-eastern europe. many local universities
supported the initiative, including the university of fine art, the studio of young artists’ association and the
studio of young applied artists’ association. the young artists presented works created using scrap
electrical and telecommunications cables. the three winners of the competitions were able to display their
works at budapest university of technology and economics.
prysmian hungary also made a donation to the autistic children foundation.


russia
prysmian russia has worked on a series of initiatives the fields of health, sport and culture, collaborating
with cash donations to many local organisations, such as the association of italian ladies in russia, which
has carried out projects in moscow, vladivostok, novosibirsk, volgograd, astrakhan and elista, with a view to
help the homeless, orphans and persons in difficulty.


china
consistent with the initiatives implemented last year, prysmian china has participated in a corporate
citizenship & philanthropy initiative at the china welfare center via a cash donation from both the group
and local employees. the main purpose of this initiative was to help disabled children.
the group also made a donation to the red cross in favour of the earthquake victims in italy.


australia
prysmian australia supported several health-related initiatives during 2016. as an example, a donation was
made to cancer council australia to help persons affected by skin cancer, which is a common problem in
that country. via this and other initiatives, prysmian australia also actively involved its employees (dedicating
350 hours) and therefore increased their awareness of the matters tackled. the initiatives undertaken by
prysmian australia also included the sponsorship of worldskills australia, for which prysmian gave cables to

the young electricians participating, so that they could compete and show their skills, as well as to know and
appreciate the group's cables.


commitments for the future
during 2017, prysmian will analyse additional group corporate citizenship and philanthropy initiatives using
the social return on investment (sroi) methodology. this methodology makes it possible to measure the
social, environmental and economic impact of the activities assessed, using monetary values that highlight
the relationship between the investment made in an initiative and the return on that investment.

                                                                2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


environment

prysmian and the environment
the group strives actively to safeguard and protect the environment and conserve natural resources,
in order to create sustainable value for the benefit of both the organisation and our stakeholders.
the group's commitment to safeguarding the environment and conserving natural resources is expressed
not only by the intrinsic characteristics of our products, but also by how our production systems are managed.
in particular, the prevention and reduction of their environmental impact is achieved, for example, by the
efficient use of natural resources, the optimisation of logistics flows and the responsible management of
waste. prysmian worked hard during the year to enhance our performance on environmental matters.
additionally, considering the aspects deemed significant at group level, the health, safety & environment
function (also "hse") worked with other business functions to establish the hse objectives for the period to
2020, and plan the actions required each year in order to make steady progress towards these goals.
the hse function has further consolidated the scope of its activities at various levels within the group –
corporate, country or region, business unit or production unit – centralising activities and coordinating the
work of the local hse functions. application of the health, safety and environment policy, the operating
procedures and the group's technical standards was maintained and extended to additional operating units.
the effectiveness and proper application at local level of the health, safety and environment rules were also
checked periodically, with support from a group-level audit team.
furthermore, significant variables and indicators were again monitored regularly to check the effectiveness
of health, safety and environment activities, including compliance with health and safety at work standards,
energy consumption, waste management, water usage and greenhouse gas emissions. in particular, with
reference to the last mentioned, the group has strengthened the process of collecting energy consumption
data in order to track both "direct" emissions (deriving from production processes) and "indirect" emissions
(deriving from the energy purchased). this system of monitoring and reporting enabled the group to
participate in 2016, once again, in the carbon disclosure project (cdp), climate change section. the cdp
is an international initiative that seeks to contribute to the pursuit of the objectives agreed in the kyoto
protocol regarding the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
further developments in this area will be made possible by considering the outcome of the energy audits
carried out in 2015 and 2016 at a number of european factories, deemed representative, in order to identify
actions to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. work is well advanced on the
implementation of tools for assessing and managing the environmental impact of products and, in particular,
their carbon footprints.
about 160 inspections for certification purposes were carried out at the various factories during the year, of
which about 12% were carried out by experienced prysmian personnel. the other inspections were
performed by auditors from external certification agencies.
significant events during 2016 included the investment of about 8 million euro in health, safety and
environmental activities.

                                                                   2016 sustainability report – prysmian group


in addition to training initiatives, prysmian has continued to manage various activities including active
participation in various working parties and on association committees, such as europacable's ecoe
committee, orgalime's “substances task force”, anie's environment committee and aice's environment
working party, and the iec maintenance team that is drafting the standard environmental declaration for
power cables.
the approach to integration adopted represents an opportunity to improve and, in this light, operational
policies and practices for the management of the environment, health and safety by all operating units will be
further developed and agreed. in this regard, the prysmian group uses quali-quantitative parameters to
monitor environmental performance and health and safety in the workplace.
the environment and safety management system was established centrally from the start, in order to
guarantee uniformity throughout the group via the coordination provided by the corporate hse function. in
particular, hse involvement in defining the preventive and corrective actions applicable at group level, and
in checking effectiveness at local level, has contributed to the maintenance and consolidation of the hse
system and to the creation of a team of hse-qualified auditors within the group.
future developments will include further strengthening of the "central coordination" concept, with a view to
transforming the environment and safety management system into a "multi-site" model that is certified by the
corporate head office in accordance with an annual audit plan. this change will maximise the efficiencies
and synergies released by the revised system, especially in terms of improved performance and lower costs.
in this context, the new milan headquarters will be certified as a specific operating unit resulting, therefore, in
its immediate inclusion in the multi-site model as the head office.
among the common initiatives, the hse function identified two projects – “relamping with led” and “smart
metering”, relating respectively to the replacement of traditional lighting with led bulbs and the introduction
of systems for the measurement of consumption at production units – to be pursued from 2016 onwards.
the hse function activated the “relamping with led” project during 2016, giving priority to a number of
operating units that have already had an energy audit, and has commenced the preparatory work. in order to
ensure a consistent approach within the group, the hse function has distributed guidelines to all local
organisations on the replacement of traditional lighting with led bulbs. in addition, prysmian has selected a
partner for the performance of certain preliminary work, which includes checking adoption of the guidelines
with reference to local legislative requirements and preparing technical specifications. following this work,
suppliers will be selected for the design and installation of the first led lighting systems during 2017.
as a result of this project, electricity consumption will be reduced together with the operating costs of the
lighting installations; depending on location, the estimated savings range from 10% to 70% of the current
consumption for lighting purposes. led technology has, in fact, a various advantages over traditional lighting
sources, such as energy saving, an average life that is 6 times longer than traditional bulbs, easy
maintenance and relatively rapid recovery of the initial investment.
in addition, during 2016 a number of pilot projects were launched at production units considered
representative within the group, in order to carry out a more detailed and specific analysis of energy
consumption, considering the production, plant engineering and maintenance needs of each location, the
types of supply, any existing restrictions and climate data. the objective is to determine if there are any plant
engineering or operational solutions that would reduce energy consumption and the emission of pollutants.

november, energy efficiency month in italy
the group decided to participate actively in the initiatives carried out in italy during november, which was
labelled energy efficiency month. the prysmian group responded to this invitation in order to increase
employee awareness about the importance of energy efficiency, by explaining the results of current and
future projects at group level and promoting new action on the topic of energy saving.
this campaign, promoted by the ministry of economic development and implemented by the national
agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable development (enea), involved institutions and
companies in events intended to raise public awareness of the need to stop wasting energy. our
participation included seminars and work to analyse and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases,
as well as adoption of the smart metering project. this project was launched with the preparation of
prysmian guidelines that will be circulated to all local organisations in early 2017, in order to introduce
systems for the measurement of consumption that will facilitate reporting on consumption and the savings
made, as well as optimise the use of energy via the effect of constant monitoring. smart metering is a system
based on sensors with a wireless interface that monitors energy consumption and facilitates the storage of
data, so that aggregated data can be used subsequently.


management systems
during the year, the prysmian group continued work to coordinate the group's hse management systems
by:
         extending ohsas 18001 certification of the safety management system to an additional 5 locations,
          and iso 14001 certification of the environmental management system to one additional location;
         upgrading the iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certifications of prysmian power link (the organisation
          that installs hv terrestrial and submarine cables), by extending their field of application to the design
          and supervision of production and by combining the iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 audits into one
          programme;
         adopting an integrated auditing system (two additional factories compared with 2015);
         using the official certification agency at factories previously certified by other agencies. in particular,
          during 2016, 4 factories changed to the official agency for iso 14001 certification (regarding
          environment management systems) and 2 changed in relation to ihsas 18001 certification. this
          change has helped to coordinate the management systems, with the periodic checking of the
          group's hse procedures by the external agency and the involvement of hse in defining and
          agreeing the corrective actions to be taken at the various group factories, 91% and 73% of which
          were, respectively, iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certified at the end of 2016. these percentages
          take account of the new certifications mentioned above (5 additional locations with ohsas 18001
          certification and 1 with iso 14001).


life cycle assessment
implementation of the life cycle assessment methodologies continued during 2016, with a particular focus
on the carbon footprint aspects. the methodology chosen was to create an automatic assessment system
that, by combining environmental information about materials and processes with the design data for the

various families of cable, determines their environmental impact in carbon footprint terms. accordingly, the
collaboration between hse and r&d has been consolidated, with a view to bringing together the two types
of information. the system will therefore enable rapid assessment of the carbon footprint of various types of
cable, considering both the production of their raw materials and all the stages and processes in their
manufacture, starting from within prysmian to the final storage of the cable. the definition of the automatic
assessment system will be completed during 2017, leading to the launch of a second phase involving initial
practical use of the system in order to identify specific categories of cable for priority attention.


restart of the guatapé hydroelectric plant
prysmian mexico has successfully completed a massive recovery task – coordinated with two south
american customers, empresas publicas de medellìn (eps), a columbian public utility, and mexico’s
federal electricity commission (cfo) – relating to the restart of the guatapé hydroelectric plant. this plant,
on columbia's largest dam, supplies about 4% of the country's electricity. a fire seriously damaged many
installations in february 2016 and, as a result, it was also found necessary to replace the 230kv cables
previously supplied by prysmian to eps, but never installed. acting as a mediator between customers from
different countries, prysmian facilitated transfer of the required cables between eps and cfo. given the
great urgency of the operation, the transportation was organised using two ukrainian aircraft. the recovery
efforts, completed in june 2016, involved over 100 persons counting eps employees and prysmian
professionals.


pikkala factories open to visitors
a number of guided tours of the prysmian factories in pikkala (finland) were arranged in september 2016,
enabling many local residents to make contact with the business and understand better the work carried out
by the group in their country. in particular, the visitors – including many children – were able to find out how
cables are designed and produced, and learn about the importance of safety in the workplace. the pikkala
factory is considered to be of great strategic importance to the group, to the extent that it was chosen to hold
the meeting with stakeholders scheduled for february 2017.


alert! not all cables are the same...
prysmian turkey’s advertising campaign, launched in 2012 and now in its fourth edition, focuses attention on
a different product each time. the objective for 2016 was to increase consumer awareness about cables for
photovoltaic installations. working together with prysmian germany, the turkish division participated at the
solar energy and technology exhibition – solarex istanbul at the istanbul exhibition centre, where the
impact of environmental factors on cables was discussed and consumers were helped to understand the
risks associated with choosing the wrong cables.


commitments for the future
with reference to the hse policy and use of the hse management system, in recent years prysmian has
launched various initiatives intended to use resources efficiently and reduce the environmental impact of
production processes at a number of factories (e.g. replacement of lighting systems, recycling of sf6,

awareness campaigns about the consumption of energy). these initiatives have generated various benefits
in both environmental and cost reduction terms. in order to proceed in a systematic and orderly manner, the
activities already started have been included within a group project entitled energy efficiency and carbon
reduction, which is coordinated centrally by the corporate hse function in order to:
    •    report increasingly precise and reliable data and information, at group level, about consumption and
         greenhouse gas emissions;
    •    define improvement objectives, particularly in relation to the reduction of energy consumption and
         greenhouse gas emissions at group level, involving corporate and all other levels of the
         organisation in planning the initiatives and activities necessary in order to meet the commitments
         made;
    •    propose and launch energy efficiency initiatives consistent with the regulations (e.g. directive
         2012/27/eu on energy efficiency), the specific campaigns promoted at national level and, more
         generally, the commitments accepted at the paris conference on climate change cop 21;
    •    select and coordinate the specific projects to be implemented by the group’s operating units, in
         order to comply with prysmian’s commitments with regard to sustainability, while calibrating carefully
         the effort required with reference to local operating needs.
interesting results have emerged with reference to the possible introduction of co-generation systems and
review of the re-phasing logic for electrical installations. in order to increase the number of concrete results,
these studies will be extended to additional operating units within the group during 2017.
based on the experience and positive results obtained following the energy audits carried out in prior years,
during 2017 group hse will plan and coordinate further energy diagnostics, in order to obtain a database
and information for the launch of similar efficiency improvement projects at other operating units within the
group.
with regard to management systems, the prysmian group plans to obtain additional ohsas 18001
certifications and to obtain both iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certifications for the milan headquarters..

main initiatives to lower environmental impact


power cables
a process for the recovery and re-use of waste copper found in the sludge generated from the production of
wire rod has been introduced in rayong (thailand). this process separates the sludge from the recoverable
copper that, once collected, can be recycled as a raw material in the smelting process. before implementing
this process, a feasibility study was carried out to ensure that the recovered copper would not degrade the
quality of the wire rod. activation of this recycling process has therefore reduced the weight of the copper
sludge, resulting in disposal of just that fraction of the sludge remaining after the copper has been separated
out.
the water cooling plant has been replaced at kistelek (hungary), thus reducing the quantity of r422d
refrigerant gas (a greenhouse gas).
the quantity of fluorinated gases has been reduced at the slatina plant (in romania) by replaced a number
of refrigeration units with one centralised device. this device also reduces gas leaks and the necessary
maintenance work. action to improve the efficiency of water consumption has also been completed at this
factory. this work, which commenced in 2014, had two distinct phases: initially, repair of the levelling
systems for the water tanks (to avoid accidental discharges); subsequently, efforts concentrated on retaining
the industrial water (including the cooling water for testing activities) within the recirculation circuits for a
longer period, thus reducing the water replacement frequency. all these actions were carried out by the
factory's technical services, under the supervision of the hse function. lastly, the percentage of waste sent
for recycling was increased during 2016 via a procedure that involves storing the waste for two days, so that
the portion to be recycled can be separated from the rest.
numerous improvements in the waste sector have been made at gron (france), largely with regard to waste
compounds, solvents that generate hazardous waste, packaging and water consumption. in particular, the
water recirculation circuit has been improved.
water consumption at prysmian berlin has been reduced by optimising the cooling system for certain
process lines.
action has been taken at giovinazzo (italy) to reduce the amount of waste compound disposed, by
recovering and re-using waste polymers; in addition, water consumption has been optimised by repairing
losses in the recirculation circuit for the waters used in insulation line processes.
lastly, work has been carried out to reduce water consumption in north dighton (usa) and nieuw bergen
(netherlands), by making improvements to the steam generator and a new water cooling system.

the slatina factory (romania) has reached an important milestone by sending 100% of all waste generated
for recycling.


telecom cables
in nuremberg, prysmian germany has worked to reduce water consumption by installing wider diameter
pipes in the water return circuit, thus avoiding excessive filling (and consequent overflows), especially during
periods of heavy rain. this, together with the overflow control system, has reduced the need to replace the
cooling waters used for processing purposes, as a specified volume of water can now be maintained in the
circuit at all times.

presentation of environmental data
among the matters common to all operating units, prysmian has selected those that are significant not only
in environmental terms, but also in terms of its responsibilities towards employees and local communities,
and as a competitive factor that contributes value to the group. these aspects are considered significant
and this report presents indicators showing their importance:
           energy consumption, obtained as the sum of all energy sources used in manufacturing and service
            activities;
           water consumption, which is significant due to the large volumes needed for cooling in the various
            production cycles;
           hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with a potential impact on various environmental factors and
            very considerable importance in the assessment of process efficiency;
           ozone-depleting substances which, although small in amount, are present in almost every production
            unit, in order to prevent leakages and reduce their potential atmospheric impact;
           greenhouse gas emissions (ghg), primarily linked to the use of sources of energy and, to a very
            limited extent, to the use of greenhouse gases at certain stages of production;
           efficiency in the use of raw materials, given the intensive use of valuable metals, such as copper and
            aluminium, as an essential part of most production processes, as well as the amount of scrap
            generated.
based on assessments and past experience, the group does not report on the following aspects, which are
considered to be less significant:
           waste water originating from cooling systems, if not contained within a closed-circuit system and if
            not requiring special treatment;
           atmospheric emissions generated by production processes, which are not especially significant in
            most cases.
further details about the performance indicators and the scope and methods of reporting are available in the
attachments to this document.

energy consumption (gj)
energy consumption by the group, which has changed slightly due largely to production trends and the non-
proportional change in electricity consumption, totalled 6,261,714 gj in 2016, up by 1.17% compared with
2015 due, in the main, to an increase in consumption per unit of product in the power cables category.

greenhouse gas emissions (ghg)
greenhouse gas emissions, measured in tonnes of co 2 equivalent, were calculated using the methodologies
indicated in “the greenhouse gas protocol: a corporate accounting and reporting standard (revised
edition, 2004)” considering, for the scope 1 emissions, the consumption of fuels, the release of overflow
refrigerant gases and the use of sf6 and, for the scope 2 emissions, the consumption of purchased
energy (mainly electricity).
emissions totalled 683,562 tco2eq in 2016, down with respect to 2015. the reduction was mostly
attributable to the scope 2 emissions, due to a change in the scope of reporting following the closure of a
number of factories.

greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) following the purchase of guarantee of origin
certificates
prysmian is a diversified, multinational group; accordingly, two main methods are used to account for scope
2 emissions: the location-based method and the market-based method. both methods, described below, are
recognised and required by the ghg protocol and must be used to report on scope 2 emissions in the
cdp’s climate change program from 2016.

location-based method
this method for quantifying scope 2 co2 emissions is based on average emission factors for the generation
of electricity within well-defined geographical boundaries: local, sub-national or national.
market-based method
this method for quantifying scope 2 co2 emissions is based on the co2 emissions of the energy suppliers
from which the reporter (company that prepares the report) purchases a package of electricity under
contract. markets are differentiated by the contracts available for the purchase of energy or by the specific
attributes claimed, but can include: certificates guaranteeing the origin of the energy and direct contracts with
suppliers (recs, gos, i-rec, etc.); specific emission factors of the supplier; default emission factors
representing the energy and emissions that are not monitored or not claimed (known as "residual mix");
regional or average sub-national or national emission factors.

with reference to electricity consumption in 2016, the prysmian group purchased guarantee of origin
certificates from a number of european suppliers in order to increase the percentage of energy consumed by
the group that was derived from renewable sources, thus reducing the corresponding co 2 emissions
determined using the market-based method of calculation. this initiative further contributed to reducing the
group’s co2 emissions, which were 17.6% lower than in 2015. using the location-based approach, on the
other hand, the group’s co2 emission were 4.9% lower than in 2015.

waste
the main types of waste generated by productive activities have been split into specific categories,
classifying their level of danger (hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste) according to the related
classification system, regardless of the waste's country of origin and disposal. an exception is made for
certain types of waste (such as laboratory chemicals), whose allocation among the categories depends on
local regulatory requirements.
overall, the total volume of waste disposed has fallen with respect to 2015. in particular, the volume of non-
hazardous waste (-7.4%), while the volume of hazardous waste rose slightly (+4%). total waste disposed in
2016 amounted to 91,453,247 kg.

hazardous waste has increased in general, except in the optical fibre sector. there are several reasons for
this, mostly linked to the disposal of certain types of waste that, not being generated constantly over time,
fluctuates from one annual report to another. the main categories of waste concerned are spent oils,
emulsions from drawing tanks and machinery, processing residue and other waste generated by preventive
maintenance work. other factors might also include specific anomalies affecting certain processing lines (the
malfunction of a metal sheathing extruder that resulted in the exceptional disposal of contaminated oils and
metals; changes in the production mix; the malfunction of the level control and circuits of tanks containing oil-
based emulsions).
by contrast with the hazardous waste, the production of non-hazardous waste has decreased more,
especially in the two main production categories: telecom cables and energy cables. at individual factory
level, the greatest changes were due to the types of waste whose disposal is not a continuous process
(packaging reused for a period and then eliminated en bloc, cleaning work, disposal of machines, disposal of

total water consumption fell by about 8% in 2016 compared with 2015. this outcome is, however, partly
influenced by locations that – due to closure or time-related factors – did not communicated their
environmental data. these factories were, by contrast, included in the scope of reporting in 2015.

the combined energy factories together achieved a net reduction in consumption, even on a unit of
production basis. this reduction is therefore real and not due solely to the exit of operating units from the
scope of reporting. despite a slight decrease in the quantity of water consumed per unit of production, the
consumption of the optical fibre factories increased overall, although the increases in the telecom and
accessories sectors were more evident.
in many cases, the differences at local level were due to losses from water pipes (which resulted in
increased consumption if they occurred during 2016, but decreased consumption if they occurred previously
and were repaired in 2016). in a few cases, the changes were due to meter malfunctions (occurring in 2016,
or occurring previously and resolved in 2016).

percentage of process water recirculated
process water – e.g. that used to cool semi-finished products – is recirculated at numerous factories, in
whole or in part depending on the situation, in order to avoid excessive consumption. in order to better
understand the degree of efficiency achieved in the use of water, the application of the methodology, devised
in collaboration with the merlino factory, to determine the "percentage of water recirculated" with respect to
total water consumption has been extended. the concept is based on how much is saved (compared with
not having a recirculation plant) in relation to the total quantity of water consumed for processing reasons
(due to evaporation, occasional emptying of the circuit, or the lack or only partial installation of a recirculation
plant).
the formula is being applied to an increasing number of factories and, in 2016, about 60% of operating units
supplied results in terms of water recirculated as a percentage of the total quantity used. in the
overwhelming majority of cases, hydraulic circuits are served by a recirculation system and, in over 60% of
these, recirculated water accounts for 99% or more of the total water used, while about 20% of factories
recirculate between 95% and 99% of their water, just 10% between 90% and 95% and 10% less than 90%
(since their recirculation systems do not cover all their hydraulic circuits, yet).
the above results were provided by the following countries: argentina, brazil, china, estonia, france,
germany, indonesia, italy, norway, russia, sweden, turkey, uk, hungary, romania, slovak republic,
czech republic, certain us operating units, netherlands.
the percentages stated above may of course change as application of the formula is extended to other
factories, in order to obtain full coverage of the group.

ozone-depleting substances27
the steady elimination of chlorinated gases and their replacement with hfcs continued during 2016.
accordingly, the quantities of ozone-depleting substances have decreased with respect to 2015 (-6.22%) at
both the telecom and energy factory.

  most of the ozone-depleting substances reported relate to hcfcs, especially freon (a.k.a. r-22), which is less problematic than
other families of refrigerant gases already banned by law, such as cfc and halon.

environment
notes on the scope and methods of reporting
the environmental indicators presented in this report derive from a system of reporting that, compared with
the scope of reporting stated in this report, do not include data relating to the r&d laboratories or the
offices, as their environmental impact is low. two recently-acquired production units both in oman (muscat
and sohar), a factory in malaysia (kuala lumpur) and one in china (wuhan), no longer under prysmian
control, are also not included in the data, together with the factories at presov (slovak republic) and merlino
(italy), for which data was unavailable, and certain production units whose data collection methods are not
fully aligned with those of the group, being: pune, chiplun (india); grombalia (tunisia). lastly, compared
with last year, the scope of reporting does not include data from shanghai (china) were production has been
suspended, or data from certain factories that were closed during 2016: amsterdam and delfzijl
(netherlands); baoying (china); bronby (denmark); one of the factories located in vilanova y la geltru
(spain). on the other hand, the data includes the two french factories at neuf pre (closed) and cornimont
(formerly xoulces) – where production activities have changed considerably. in addition, the operating unit
dedicated solely to the production of wire rod has been excluded from the analysis.
the environmental data for the production sites not included in this analysis is not thought to be significant,
considering the low number of sites excluded with respect to the total (5% maximum) and the limited extent
of production at those locations.
environmental data is not yet reported in relation to the installation of terrestrial and submarine cables (the
environmental aspects and methods of management differ greatly from those of the operating units), since a
project is currently in progress for the future collection and reporting of representative indicators, using
dedicated tools.
the environmental performance indicators relating to energy, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water and
ozone-depleting substances have partly been derived from estimates, in view of the deadlines for the
preparation of this report. actual data might therefore be subject to insignificant changes.
in this regard, it is confirmed that the above data has been subjected to a reliability analysis. at the time of
preparing this report, the data from about 60% of our factories has been validated in full, while validation of
the data from the other factories is still in progress, due to the time required.
in addition, it is noted that production at the douvrin factory – required in order to quantify the environmental
indices per unit of product – has been quantified with reference to estimates.

(1) the information for the power cables category includes the telecom, energy and accessories operating
units at the oulu factory (available information relates to each factory as a whole). the quantities produced
in relation to such information have been normalised, so the telecom cables produced by the above
operating units are identified in weight terms (rather than in km, as in the "telecom cables" category).


(2) hazardous and non-hazardous waste: the information for the power cables category includes combined
data for the telecom and energy operating units at the bishopstoke factory, since this factory does not
accumulate separate details for each unit (available information relates to the factory as a whole).

(3) water consumption and hazardous waste: the information for the power cables category includes
combined data for the accessories and energy operating units at the gron factory, since this factory does
not accumulate separate details for each unit (available information relates to the factory as a whole).

(4) the information is significant at sector level. in fact, the quantity of ozone-depleting substances does
not relate to production activities and, accordingly, it is reported separately in total for the energy and
telecom sectors.

(5) for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters, the volume of “power cables” produced
is expressed in tonnes, being the sum of the weights of the cables produced in the years concerned and
the related compounds produced by prysmian, excluding the compounds purchased in the marketplace
and simply added to the products.

(6) for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters, the production in km relates to finished
optical fibre, excluding any semi-finished fibre sold as such by the "optical fibre" factories considered in this
report.

(7) the production of “telecom cables” is expressed in km and obtained by summing the production of
cables made from optical fibre, quantified in fibre km, and with those made from copper, quantified in pair
km. the decision to use km rather than tonnes to quantify the total production of telecom cables was taken
due to the fact that the unit of measure expressed in length reflects the production process (and the related
impact of environmental parameters) more closely than the unit of measure of production expressed in
weight terms.

(8) only absolute amounts are reported for accessories, since normalised units of production are not
available for this category. in particular, the nature of production included in this category various
considerably (connectors for cables, accessories for lifts etc.).
