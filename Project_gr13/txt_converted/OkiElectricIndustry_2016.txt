about oki

corporate philosophy
the people of oki, true to the company’s “enterprising spirit,”
are committed to creating superior network solutions and
providing excellent information and communications services
globally to meet the diversified needs of communities worldwide
in the information age.

  profile
  founded in 1881, meikosha, ltd. was the forerunner of today’s oki and japan’s first tele-
  communications equipment manufacturer. meikosha’s success came from the company’s
  “enterprising spirit” to attempt to become the first domestic manufacturer of telephones
  only five years after alexander graham bell’s invention of the telephone in 1876.
     underpinned by this “enterprising spirit,” which has been nurtured and passed down through-
  out the company’s long history, oki has developed and provided a succession of products that
  have contributed to the development of today’s information society. always in the vanguard
  of technology innovation, oki began selling computers containing japan’s first domestically
  developed core memories, developed the world’s first cash recycling automated teller machine
  (atm) that recycles deposited bills as funds for withdrawals, developed led printers, and intro-
  duced the first voice-over-internet protocol (voip) system to the japanese market.
     as a company that supports social infrastructural development, oki will quickly grasp
  and incorporate the needs of the market into the development of products that satisfy
  customers, while contributing to the development of an information society. guided by its
  brand statement, “open up your dreams,” oki will diligently strive to achieve the dreams
  and hopes of stakeholders, to become the preferred global partner of choice and achieve
  continuous growth.

  responsibility for people’s safety infuses our monozukuri culture
  for medical equipment, adherence to extremely high task process standards is necessary because
  malfunctions could result in incidents that put people’s lives at risk. there is considerable pride that
  goes into a monozukuri culture that prizes high quality, and medical equipment requires a different
  sort of monozukuri approach than what is commonly accepted for info-telecom systems. it was a
  culture shock for me, but i have gained an appreciation for the safety-first values and sense of mis-
  sion necessary to manufacture medical equipment where people’s lives could be at stake. morale
  among frontline employees is high, and we constantly look for ways to be original and creative
  every day, such as coming up with our own ideas for tools.

requires a space of just 42cm across, so it can fit into a small store where a con-

  a major strength of the optical fiber sensing technology is that it can comprehensively grasp the status of structures without using
  a large number of sensors. capitalizing fully on this strength of this technology, we are working to develop data mining and reliable
  sensing technologies that can accurately grasp the status of large structures such as bridges and tunnels that are seen as an aging
  risk given their long service record.

  we created new value with the development of an “intelligent surveillance camera” that combines two notable technologies,
  image recognition and video coding. the face sensing engine (fse) is based on image recognition technologies we developed,
  and oki has worked on video coding for many years. i was impressed with how interesting it is to fuse together elemental
  technologies, along with the depth of the well for elemental technologies.

     corporate governance

     the oki group recognizes sustainable growth and increases corporate value over mid- and long-term as
     its most important management priorities in earning the trust of its various stakeholders. to this end, we
     are working to bolster and enhance corporate governance based on our fundamental policies, including
     “enhancement of management fairness and transparency,” “timely decision-making processes,” and “full
     compliance and fortification of risk management.”

corporate governance code: overview of general principles
1. securing the rights and equal treatment of shareholders
   companies should take appropriate measures to fully secure shareholder rights and develop an environment in which shareholders can exercise their rights
   appropriately and effectively. in addition, companies should secure effective equal treatment of shareholders. adequate consideration should also be given to
   minority shareholders and foreign shareholders.
2. appropriate cooperation with stakeholders other than shareholders
   companies should fully recognize that their sustainable growth and the creation of mid- to long-term corporate value are brought as a result of the provision of
   resources and contributions made by a range of stakeholders, including employees, customers, business partners, creditors and local communities. as such,
   companies should endeavor to appropriately cooperate with these stakeholders. the board and the management should exercise their leadership in establish-
   ing a corporate culture where the rights and positions of stakeholders are respected and sound business ethics are ensured.
3. ensuring appropriate information disclosures and transparency
   companies should appropriately make information disclosure in compliance with the relevant laws and regulations, but should also strive to actively provide
   information beyond that required by law. this includes both financial information, such as financial standing and operating results, and non-financial information,
   such as business strategies and business issues, risk, and governance. the board should ensure that such disclosed information is useful.
4. responsibilities of the board
   given its fiduciary responsibility and accountability to shareholders, in order to promote sustainable corporate growth and the increase of corporate value over
   mid- to long-term and enhance profitability and capital efficiency, the board should equally and appropriately fulfill its roles and responsibilities, including:
   (1) setting the broad direction of corporate strategy;
   (2) establishing an environment where appropriate risk-taking by the senior management is supported; and
   (3) carrying out effective oversight of directors and the management from an independent and objective standpoint.
   such roles and responsibilities should be equally and appropriately fulfilled regardless of the form of corporate organization.
5. dialogue with shareholders
   in order to contribute to sustainable growth and the increase of corporate value over mid- to long-term, companies should engage in constructive dialogue
   with shareholders even outside the general shareholder meeting, and work for developing a balanced understanding of the positions of shareholders and other
   stakeholders and acting accordingly.

main disclosure items based on principles in the corporate governance code
                                     apart from stocks held for pure investment purposes, oki works to strengthen, maintain, and built relationships with business partners
                                     and alliance partners and, on this basis, oki holds shares in those parties where it recognizes it is conducive to increasing corporate
 cross shareholdings                 value over mid- and long-term. as for voting rights as to its cross shareholdings, oki exercises them on the basis of whether actions
                                     are suitable for the investee company as well as whether doing so increases oki’s corporate value over mid- and long-term.
                                     aiming to promote transparent processes and ensure objective judgments concerning decisions on the selection of directors and
 policies and procedures for         executive officers and their compensation, oki established the “personnel affairs and compensation advisory committee” com-

     corporate governance




     two outside directors with a high level of independence on oki’s board of directors use their expertise to
     support strong and effective governance.



     strong and effective governance that is
     positive and forward-looking
     i have endeavored over the past six years as an outside director to contribute to strong
     and effective governance using my knowledge as a legal specialist. with the addition in
     2015 of mr. minoru morio, who has extensive experience as a corporate executive, the
     board has two outside directors who can each draw on their fields of expertise to voice
     their objective viewpoints. my impression is debate at board meetings has become
     much livelier. there were times soon after i joined the board when i felt perplexed
     because i could not grasp insider terms unique to oki used in debates. now agenda
     items are explained to us in advance much more thoroughly, and i can come to meet-
     ings well prepared for debates.
         the word “governance” tends to be seen as imposing “constraints” or “top-down
     controls” but the sort of governance we should aspire to is one that cultivates a “cor-
     porate culture where executive officers do not fear failure” and boldly seek to address
     challenges with confidence. with a new president at the helm, the oki group will need
     to reinforce the group’s management system so it can fly even further. if, in doing so,
     it restrains or rejects free speech in the workplace and value creation by those offer-
     ing a rich variety of ideas, this would put the methods “cart” before the “value cre-
     ation” horse. i would like to check steadfastly from an objective viewpoint whether
     decision-making by management is carried out properly while always keeping in mind
     the notions of “positive and forward-looking.”
                                                                                                   outside director
                                                                                                   takuma ishiyama




                                                  turning an urgent sense of need for
                                                  “change” into seeds for growth
                                                  this is my second tenure as an outside director at oki. i began my career at a company
                                                  that was in many ways a pioneer in japanese corporate governance such as its decision
                                                  to seat an outside director on its board, so when i joined oki’s board for the first time in
                                                  2001, my first impression was that its culture was quite traditional. even when i voiced
                                                  my views as an outside director at board meetings, this more often than not did not
                                                  provoke discussion, so i felt more than a few times there were missed opportunities.
                                                      oki’s current management team feels a strong sense of urgency on the need for
                                                  change, and has put into place a framework for change. the operation of the board of
                                                  directors has improved as executive officers provide us with detailed explanations of
                                                  agenda items in advance so board members can openly debate them based on the
                                                  current situation facing those closest to the matter. even for companies with a con-
                                                  servative governance approach, i believe fostering an environment where employees
                                                  feel they can openly state whatever they believe to be the truth inside the company—
                                                  rather than just the board of directors—is very important for risk management, etc. the
                                                  personnel affairs and compensation advisory committee was formed in the previous
                                                  fiscal year. as a member of the committee, i made an effort to offer objective view-
                                                  points as someone outside the company such as confirming the processes by which
                                                  the names of executive officer candidates are escalated up to the committee.
                            outside director          i will continue to support further growth at the group through the sort of strong and
                           minoru morio           effective governance that oki ought to have.

     on the basis of the “oki group environmental policy” developed by taking environmental issues into consid-
     eration, the oki group plans specific activities and implements them under the banner of our “environmental
     vision 2020” that comprises mid- and long-term targets around four themes. moreover, we operate environ-
     ment management systems for the entire group as the foundation for our environmental management.

     notes:
     1. fair value measurements of financial instruments and investment in securities and derivative transaction
     assets
     (1) cash on hand and in banks, and (2) notes and accounts receivable
         these fair values are presented at amount recorded in balance sheets, since they are settled in a short period of time and their fair value
         reasonably approximates the amount recorded in the balance sheets.
     (3) investments in securities
         the fair value of securities is based on the market price on the stock exchange. the fair value of bond is based on the quotes presented
         by the financial institutions.
     liabilities
     (1) notes and accounts payable, (2) short-term borrowings, and (3) other accrued expenses
         these fair values are presented at amount recorded in balance sheets, since they are settled in a short period of time and their fair value
         reasonably approximates the amount recorded in the balance sheets.
     (4) long-term debt
         the fair value is based primarily on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest amounts is discounted by an as-
         sumed interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed long-term loans. some long-term borrowings with floating interest rates and related
         interest rate swaps are accounted for using special accounting treatment applicable to interest rate swaps. hence, the fair value of a
         long-term borrowing is based on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest, treated in combination with the said
         interest rate swap, is discounted by a reasonably estimable interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed long-term loans under similar
         borrowing terms.
     derivative transactions
         described in note13.

     2. financial instruments whose fair value is considered extremely difficult to assess
     unlisted equity securities (¥9,612 million ($85,821 thousand) and ¥9,690 million) at march 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are not included in
     (3) securities and investments in securities because they have no market price and it is deemed extremely difficult to assess their fair values.

8. retirement benefits
the company and domestic consolidated subsidiaries have either funded or unfunded defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.
   the noncontributory defined benefit plan that is a funded plan adopts a cash balance plan. in this plan, amount of benefit in which the “point”
based on the pay level is multiplied by rate based on the japanese government bonds is provided to employee as pension or lump-sum payment.
   the lump-sum retirement benefit is provided employee in accordance with the “point” based on the business results, and the length of
service. the lump-sum retirement payment plans are unfunded plans excluding the company. the company’s plan is a funded plan due to contri-
bution to the pension and retirement benefit trust.
   several overseas consolidated subsidiaries have defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
   the company has pension and retirement benefit trust.
   certain consolidated subsidiaries appraise projected benefit obligation and retirement benefit expenses of lump-sum retirement payment plans
by the simplified method.

the changes in the retirement benefit obligation during the year ended march 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

owners of parent of common stock and the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each year. diluted earn-
ings per share is computed based on the profit attributable to owners of parent available for distribution to the shareholders and the weighted-
average numbers of shares of common stock outstanding during each year assuming full conversion of the convertible bonds and full exercise
of the subscription rights to shares. net assets per share are based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the year end.
