12. follow-up of previous goals and setting of new goals

follow-up of goals set in 2013
to ensure sustainable development and business success, we need to follow-up and evaluate past performance, keep setting new goals, improve our existing systems and seek new opportunities created by chan-
ges in technology and business. in line with this, the following table shows the fulfilment of our goals set in 2013 and new goals for 2015 whose progress will be shown in our next sustainability report.


                                                                                                     follow-up of goals set in 2013

 our reporting system

                                                             we want the representatives of stakeholder groups to get more closely involved in developing this report. besides questionnaire surveys,

                                                             we will also use one-to-one interviews and roundtable discussions to learn their views.

 improving data collection methods                           we will install a software to modernize the system of data collection and enhance its efficiency.

 extending certification                                     next year’s report will be fully certified not only for compliance with gri principles but also in terms of data conformity by a third party.

 responsible corporate governance

 improving corruption-related employee awareness             we will further educate our employees on corruption through new e-learning materials and transparency enhancement programmes.

 ensuring sustainability in the supply chain                 more supplier partners will be subject to sustainability performance audits.

 environmental management

 improving goals monitoring                                  we will use more efficient tools to promote the realization of telenor’s environmental performance goals and organize more and more frequent environmental activities.

 improving employees’ environmental consciousness            we want to make our employees more environmentally conscious through awareness and education programmes with a special focus on environmentally friendly travel options.

 employee involvement                                        employees will be increasingly involved in internet safety awareness programmes both as organisers and as participants.
