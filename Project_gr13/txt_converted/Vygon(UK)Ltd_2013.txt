about vygon (uk) ltd

impact of business responsibility at vygon (uk) ltd

as a sales and distribution organisation the impact upon sustainability is not as great as it would be if
we were a manufacturing organisation similar to other units within the vygon group. later sections of
the report illustrate risks and opportunities arising through this and through involvement in the highly
regulated medical and surgical supply market. vygon (uk) ltd has established processes through
which identified key stakeholder interest areas are addressed.

for example:
• product packaging is an issue in most organisations. the subject was covered extensively in our
    first report and we continue to address it here.

•   vehicle emissions targets were established a year ago. progress against these targets and
    additional issues are addressed later in the report.

•   the use of pvc, polyethylene, polyurethane, polycarbonate or silicone within our products, while
    not raised as a specific issue by stakeholders is one which employees must be prepared to
    address. the materials are necessary in the medical and surgical process. any attempt to use
    alternatives has a detrimental effect on patient care. vygon is able to illustrate further benefits in
    product development and innovation to counter use of these materials. the subject is addressed
    in detail in this report. this report covers all of these subjects as well as the processes by which     assurance
    vygon (uk) ltd has chosen to address, prioritise and handle them.

business responsibility steering group, ensuring stakeholder requirements and emphasis, remain
topical and the business responsibility process retains active targets.                                      •

the first vygon (uk) ltd business responsibility report set out to establish primary areas to focus and
initiate processes whereby achievements on material issues may be measured. business responsibility
reports are intended to cover the immediate preceding financial year and produced annually. the
intention of this report is to:

a ensure this process continues
b create more quantifiable target measurements
c enable the steering group to make judgements on the status of chosen issues.

the primary stakeholder and greatest influence on business responsibility for vygon (uk) ltd remains
the customer, with the employees also contributing throughout the year. engagement has continued
at established, pre-defined levels aided by the greater awareness of employees as the process has
become integrated throughout the company.


         any form of feedback is deemed essential for the process of
         business responsibility and vygon (uk) ltd has established an email
         address specifically for this purpose. any comments are welcomed,
         and stakeholders or any other readers may e-mail: business.

structure

vygon (uk) ltd established a steering group in the early stages of business responsibility integration and this
has taken an increasing role in all key areas of sustainable development management, either directly or through
management of one of the two employee groups. the steering group includes the managing director in the chair
and members of senior management of vygon (uk) ltd, finance manager, operations manager, commercial
manager, as well as the business responsibility co-ordinator. the group is responsible for the phased
introduction of business responsibility to all departments and for the methods by which it is adopted.

meetings are held quarterly and more frequently if required and include the function of self-evaluation of
performance.

vygon has a duty to support the local economy and recruits employees from the local population. the average distance
travelled to work by head office employees is 13.02 miles. it is also vygon (uk) ltd’s policy to employ field based staff
from the area in which they will be working. all employees are encouraged to learn and develop within the company
and 48% of managers and supervisors were recruited from within the 13.02 mile average journey to work radius.

medical and surgical products are of a specialist nature and are only available from a small number of locations
internationally. vygon is able to source a small number of products that are not supplied by the vygon group, from
within the uk. however operational supplies and services are sourced locally wherever possible.
