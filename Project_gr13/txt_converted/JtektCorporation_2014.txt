the foundation supporting csr

the 3 pillars of sincere business activities
at jtekt, we believe that the continual implementation of sin-

one thing that is essential to sincere business activities is a                                                            h^cxzgz

statutory and social norms. the three pillars, “corporate gover-
nance”, “compliance” and “risk management”, are positioned
as important mechanisms to achieve this. all of these three have
been emphasized in recent years in all corporations however the
                                                                                                                8dgedgviz<dkzgcvcxz                   m _ 04
important thing is whether they are actually being implemented
or not. in order to use these 3 pillars effectively, jtekt makes                                                     8dbea^vcxz                        m _ 05

business partners, in order to share with them the purpose of the
jtekt csr policy. these guidelines clarify items relating to man-
agement, sociality, and environment that we would like our busi-
ness partners to observe. since 2013, our business partners have
also been cooperating with our survey concerning conflict minerals.

quit smoking campaign
the quit smoking campaign is an activity that supports people
who want to quit smoking, with detailed assistance from an indus-
trial doctor and a nurse. we ran the campaign once a year in the
past, but conducted it twice in fy2013. a total of 49 employees
participated, and 49% of them successfully quit.
the overall number of smokers among employees showed a de-
creasing trend year by year, but it unfortunately increased in fy2013.
we will continue to support employees in quitting smoking.

    i feel most rewarded when people at jtekt talk to me and tell
    me, “i was able to quit smoking thanks to you”, or “i’ve been
    walking every day since i received your advice.” i can interact
    with many people working at jtekt through companywide
    health management activities, which is one of the appeals of my
    work. i want to be a public health nurse to whom everyone can
    talk to— this is my determination, which has not changed since
    i joined this company. i continue to put my all into caring for
    jtekt employees’ health.

   in november of 2013, kbde (germany) obtained the energy
   management system international standard iso50001
   certification. iso50001 evaluates co2 emission reduction results
   obtained from actual activities, in addition to the efforts required
   by environmental management system iso14001 towards
   continual improvements.
   throughout 2013, an improvement team consisting of plant
   employees conducted energy-saving activities, achieving a 47%
   reduction in gas and electricity usage for air conditioning,
   compared with the previous year. these results will be shared with
   all employees in the monthly report to improve employee
   awareness. we will promote energy-saving through actions such
   as production line integration, and continually raise our energy use
   efficiency under the guidance of the energy management system.

to reduce the usage of water, a precious resource, jtekt
engages in activities to decrease wasteful usage and recycle
water. in fy2013, we engaged in activities to improve the water
usage base unit and water usage by more than 1% compared with
fy2012, resulting in a 9.5% improvement in the base unit (170
m3/100 million yen) and a 6.3% reduction in usage (176,000 m3),
including the increase in recycling to 786,000 m3.
we have already achieved our planned target for fy2014, an
improvement 2% higher than fy2012. we will therefore continue
activities toward a target of 0.5% or higher improvement
compared with fy2013 results.

woodland conservation activities (okazaki plant) n e w !
in an effort to conserve biodiversity, since february 2014, the
okazaki plant has been engaging in the “okazaki eco-education
forest”, woodland conservation activities such as maintaining
bamboo groves, repairing walking paths, and creating biotopes.
the first activity for wooded area conservation was held on febru-
ary 12th, in which we cut (thinned) bamboo trees with the
okazaki city hall staff. trees cut as a result of bamboo grove
maintenance will be used for children’s craft making at a nature
experience workshop and bamboo charcoal making, and used as
materials in creating bamboo brooms. we will continue these
seasonal woodland conservation activities to contribute to forest
preservation in okazaki city.                      s̲18 related article

creating a workplace conscious of the natural environment
(jrdc: china) n ew!
in july 2013, a new office building of jrdc (china) in wuxi,
kiangsu china was completed. this environmentally-friendly
building has solar and small wind power generation facilities,
effectively utilizes geothermal energy, and recycles rainwater. the
building also has a biotope, providing an opportunity for employ-
ees to have contact with nature. just after the building was com-
pleted, dragonflies were observed flying in the biotope. as a result
of planting aquatic plants typical of the region, we now see frogs,
water striders, and other creatures inhabiting the biotope. employ-
ees feel the importance of nature by hearing the sound of frogs
and seeing dragonflies at lunchtime or when coming to and
leaving work. we will continue to raise environmental awareness
within the employees and contribute to the global environment.
