based on the summary of tap water and artesian water of the machinery center displayed in the table above, it
can be seen that the quantity of water consumed in 2014 decreases when compared with 2012 and 2013, because
it is foreseen that the consumption of artesian water may cause land collapse. therefore, the machinery center
turns to use more tap water.

re prescription of standard of vibration for avoidance        ascent way to ramp kn06-01. according to the

the mrt blue line project,trackwork, contract5                           sri-rat outer ring road expressway project

presently, construction under contract 5 had not been
commenced, because the construction area had not
been delivered. currently, civil work is being carried
out by other contractors. therefore, the activities of
the contractor under contract 5 are just procurement
and storage of materials and equipment for use in
installation of the railway.

with regard to monitoring the quality of surface water,
ch. karnchang had conducted in one project only, i.e.
mrta blue line, extension portion, bang sue-tha phra
section and hua lamphong-bang khae section under
contract 2, as it is underground construction and
closed to chao phraya river area, and under contract
5, which is the rail system of the whole project,
therefore it involves the portion of chao phraya river
similar to the construction of civil work under contract 2.

description of accidents

an accident occurred at the special expressway sirat- west outer ring project, but with no death result and no
work stoppage.

on 24 april 2014, at 9.00 pm, the company employed expert transport co., ltd. to transport a truss structure
from mrta purple line project to the special expressway sirat-west outer ring project. an accident occurred
during the transport when the truck loaded with the truss structure hit a flyover at speed time intersection,
where liang mueang (bypass) road intersected pibul songkhram road, and such flyover fell down on the truck
loaded with the truss structure and a passenger car. it obstructed the traffic at the point of the accident. the
company dispatched personnel and machinery to remove the flyover from the point until the traffic could flow
as normal.




causes of the accident

1. the contractor changed the route from the route that was regularly used, which had been surveyed in terms
   of safety as a primary caution.
2. the contractor failed to check the height of the flyover as compared to the height of the truck body.




                                                                                                                         113
