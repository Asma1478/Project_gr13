state funding of saa
during the prior financial year, the group launched a legal challenge in
the high court of south africa against government’s r5 billion guarantee
provided to saa, on the basis that such action was contrary to government’s
domestic aviation policy, implemented just prior to the deregulation of the
south african skies to create an equal playing field amongst domestic
competitors, and in contravention with, amongst others, the public finance
management act. while it was hoped that the matter would go to trial in
august and/or a settlement would be reached with government, it appears
more likely, but not certain as yet, that the matter could be set down for
hearing in october/november 2014 about a settlement with government.

broad-based black economic empowerment
the group recognises the importance of implementing a broad-based
black economic empowerment (b-bbee) programme that addresses
the inequality of the past, and regularly reviews its b-bbee strategy so
as to ensure that it remains an integral part of the political, social and
economic community of south africa. in addition, the international air
services licensing council and domestic air services licensing council
review the b-bbee score of companies applying for licences.

skills shortages
training, employment and retention of skilled staff remains a major challenge,
with particular regard to pilots from previously disadvantaged groups.
the group has attempted to address this challenge through its cadet
pilot training programme and through its policy of having its pilots signing
training bonds in an attempt to ensure that they remain in the employ of
the group for a certain period of time to cover the cost of their training.

remuneration report

the group has a dedicated board committee that, inter alia, determines the governance of remuneration matters, group remuneration philosophy,
remuneration of executive directors and other senior managers, as well as the compensation of non-executive directors, which is ultimately approved
by the shareholders.


detail on the mandate, composition and attendance of meetings held by the remuneration and nominations committees are set out in the corporate
governance report.


remuneration approach
the group’s remuneration approach aims to ensure that it remunerates its directors and senior managers in a manner that supports the achievement
of the strategic objectives of the group, while attracting and retaining scarce skills and rewarding high levels of performance. the remuneration offered
by the group needs to be competitive in order to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre staff.


the remuneration philosophy is based on the following principles:


•    affordability;
•    internal fairness; and
•    external fairness.


the remuneration approach, which guides the level of salaries of all directors and senior management, is aimed at:


•    ensuring that no discrimination occurs;
•    recognising exceptional and value adding performance;
•    encouraging team performance and participation;
•    promoting cost-effectiveness and efficiency; and
•    achieving the strategic objectives of the group.


in order to balance external equity with affordability and to ensure that market-related salaries are offered to staff, the group participates in several salary
surveys and uses that information for benchmarking purposes.


remuneration structures
management remuneration structures comprise fixed and variable components as follows:


•    fixed pay: base salary and benefits; and
•    variable pay: short-term merit bonus and a long-term executive incentive scheme based on group profits before tax and the group’s share price
     performance (payable every three years).


these structures are detailed below:


fixed pay

base salary
market data is used to benchmark individual salary levels for directors and senior managers. this information, combined with the individual’s performance
assessment, is the key consideration for the annual salary reviews.


retirement benefits
the group offers membership to a defined contribution pension fund to all permanent employees in south africa. this fund is part of an umbrella
arrangement known as evergreen superfund and is administered by old mutual.




                                                                                                                                                                   55

     remuneration report (continued)



     other benefits
     this includes benefits such as medical aid, risk benefit insurance (i.e. death and disability) to permanent employees in south africa, and leave.


     pilots
     pilots are currently guaranteed a 13th cheque.


     variable pay

     short-term incentives
     executive directors and senior managers participate in a short-term, cash based management incentive scheme. payment in terms of the short-term
     incentive scheme is dependent upon achievement against key performance criterion, namely profit after tax and subject to three (3) components:


     •    achievement by the qualifying employee of key performance indicators (40%);
     •    group profit performance (40%); and
     •    20% of the bonus is payable at the discretion of the board.


     the payment of any short-term incentive to executive directors and senior managers is subject to board approval.


     employees who do not participate in the short-term incentive scheme would be entitled to a 13th cheque, or a portion thereof, based on personal
     performance and company affordability and a discretionary amount based on the group’s performance. this does not apply to pilots, who are guaranteed

     long-term executive incentive scheme
     executive directors and designated senior managers who were in the employ of the group on or prior to 31 december 2012 and are still in the employ
     of the group as at 30 september 2015 participate in the long-term executive incentive scheme (“the scheme”).


     the purpose of the scheme is to retain talent as well as to reward participants of the scheme based on the group’s performance. the scheme comprises
     two components as follows:


     profit linked component (35%)
     in terms of this component, 7% of the aggregated headline profits before tax (excluding profits from damages awards and profits from new business
     ventures that are not managed by the participants), made by the group during the 2013, 2014 and 2015 financial years in excess of r250 million, but
     capped to a maximum of r17.5 million, would be allocated to participants in the scheme in proportion to their basic salary versus the combined basic
     salary of the participants in the scheme.


     share price linked component (65%)
     this component is based on the trade weighted average share price of the group for the six months to 30 june 2015, with the bonus payable to
     participants being the difference between the group share price as determined on 30 june 2015 and a share price of r1.50c, but capped to a maximum
     of r32.5 million.


     executive directors’ remuneration
     remuneration of executive directors is compared to the market for comparable roles in companies of similar size.


     the annual bonus payable to executive directors in terms of the short-term management incentive scheme is limited to 100% of their annual base salary.


     executive directors have standard service contracts with no fixed duration, no restraint and with a one-month notice period. this is currently under review.


     details of the remuneration of individual executive and non-executive directors are set out in the report of the directors on pages 63 and 64.

the directors are responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the annual financial statements and other financial information
included in this report.

support the viability of the company and the group.


the annual financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm, grant thornton (jhb) inc., which was given unrestricted access
to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of shareholders, the board of directors and committees of the board. the
directors believe that all representations made to the independent auditors during the audit were valid and appropriate.


the annual financial statements, which appear on pages 68 to 108, were approved by the board of directors on 8 september 2014 and signed on
its behalf.

are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.


borrowing costs
pre-delivery payment assets are regarded as qualifying assets for the
purpose of the capitalisation of borrowing costs. exchange differences
arising from foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they are
regarded as an adjustment to interest costs, are capitalised as part of
borrowing costs as these expenses are considered part of the cost of
borrowing in foreign currency.


taxation
judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes
due to the complexity of legislation. there are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate taxation determination is uncertain
during the ordinary course of business. the group recognises liabilities for
anticipated taxation audit issues based on estimates of whether additional
taxes will be due. where the final taxation outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences
will impact the income taxation and deferred taxation provisions in the
period in which such determination is made.


recovery of deferred tax assets
the group recognises the net future taxation benefit related to deferred
income taxation assets to the extent that it is probable that the deductible
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. assessing
the recoverability of deferred income taxation assets requires the group
to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable
income. estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash
flows from operations and the application of existing taxation laws in
each jurisdiction. to the extent that future cash flows and taxable income
differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the group to realise the
net deferred taxation assets recorded at the end of the reporting period
could be impacted.

     the recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on
     value-in-use calculations. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow
     projections based on financial budgets approved by management
     covering a five-year period. a growth rate of 7% and a pre-tax
     discount rate of 25% was used. as a result of the acquisition of
     holiday tours (proprietary) limited, the group’s footprint in africa has
     been enhanced and the synergies that the group will add has resulted
     in the recognition of goodwill. no impairment has occurred in the
     current financial year. the goodwill relates to the travel business that is
     part of the non-airline business.

15. financial risk management and financial instruments
the group finances its operations through a mixture of accumulated profits, current borrowings and non-current borrowings. the group also enters into
forward exchange contracts to manage the currency risks of its operations. the main risks arising in the normal course of business from the group’s
financial instruments are currency, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. this note presents information on the group’s exposure to these risks. the board
of directors is responsible for risk management activities in the group. the carrying values equate to the fair values of each financial instrument.


the carrying value of short-term financial instruments approximate fair value due to their short-term nature, and all interest-bearing financial liabilities
carried at amortised cost bear interest at market-related rates. hence the carrying values of these financial instruments equate to their fair values.

     financial assets are substantially the same for the group and the company, however loans to subsidiaries amount to r37.3 million (2013: r37.3 million)
     and are classified as loans and receivables.


     financial liabilities are substantially the same for the group and the company.

     interest rate risk
     the group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows and places funds. this risk is managed by managing the group’s exposures on long-term loans
     and placing surplus funds in investments that yield a market-linked return.

management reviews the interest rate risk on an ongoing basis. where new loans are entered into, management compares interest rates offered by
various institutions and where considered more favourable, may enter into loans in foreign currency. the interest rate risk is viewed in conjunction with
the foreign exchange risk.


the group, as part of its financing activities, enters into foreign denominated interest-bearing loans. the foreign exchange rate exposure is monitored
by management in conjunction with the interest rate exposure which would have been incurred had a rand-denominated loan been taken out. refer
to sensitivity analysis below.


credit risk
credit risk relates to the potential of non-recovery of bank and call deposits and loans and trade receivables. at the reporting date, the group did not
consider there to be any significant concentration of credit risk which has not been adequately provided for.


liquidity risk
the liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the group manages liquidity risk by monitoring
forecast cash flows and ensuring that adequate cash resources and unutilised borrowing facilities are maintained.

foreign currency risk
the group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency, which therefore have exposure to exchange rate variations. the group
may enter into forward exchange contracts to manage exchange rate exposure. where appropriate, open positions are maintained. the group does
not speculate in derivative instruments and all foreign exchange contracts are supported by underlying transactions.


approximately 48% of operating costs are incurred and approximately 30% of revenue is based in foreign currency. the following uncovered foreign
currency amounts are included in the financial statements at year end: net short-term liabilities of us$6,774,987 (2013: us$4,294,324) and gbp1,480,062
(2013: gbp1,027,964) and net short term receivables of gbp3,993,836 (2013: gbp5,820,456).


the group, as part of its financing activities, enters into foreign denominated interest-bearing loans. the foreign exchange rate exposure is monitored
by management in conjunction with the interest rate exposure which would have been incurred had a rand-denominated loan been taken out.

     interest and related foreign currency amounts incurred on account of aircraft and other qualifying assets under construction are capitalised and added
     to the asset concerned and therefore do not affect profit or loss.


     the movements are recognised in other comprehensive income until such time as the other qualifying asset is complete and the aircraft has been
     delivered and recognised, in which case these amounts are no longer recognised and are expensed in profit or loss when incurred. the effect of a 5%
     movement in foreign exchange would be rnil (2013: rnil) and of a 2% interest rate adjustment would be rnil (2013: rnil).


     the effect of the movement in the interest rate was only calculated for the estimated period that the loan will be outstanding.

capital risk management
the group’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.


the group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. the group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes
in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust
the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt.


the group monitors capital on the basis of the debt-to-adjusted-capital ratio. this ratio is calculated as net debt divided by adjusted capital. net debt
is calculated as total interest-bearing debt (as shown in the statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. adjusted capital comprises
all components of equity (i.e. ordinary shares, share premium, accumulated profits and other reserves).

      26. share incentive trust

      staff share incentive scheme (excluding bee equity-settled, share-based payment)
      in terms of the staff share incentive scheme, shares are offered on an option or outright sale basis. options vest over a period of one to five years.
      all options must be taken up by way of purchase by no later than ten years after the date of grant. the exercise price of the option is not less than the
      market value of the ordinary shares on the date preceding the day of grant and the option is exercisable provided the participant has remained in the
      group’s employ until the option vests. in the case of retirement/death/retrenchment, all options immediately vest. options must be converted into shares.


      in the event of retirement/death/retrenchment of a participant, options may be taken up and converted into cash within 12 months of such an event.
      the directors of the group have the discretion to extend this by a further 12 months. in the case of the resignation of a participant, options which have
      vested may be exercised within 30 days after date of resignation. options which have not vested will be forfeited.

             year shall not exceed 10% (ten percent) of the company issued ordinary share capital as at the beginning of the financial year, provided
             that the acquisition of shares as treasury shares by a subsidiary of the company shall not be effected to the extent that in aggregate more

             taken together;
     8.1.3   at any point in time, the company may only appoint one agent to effect any repurchases on the company’s behalf;

             understanding or arrangement between the company and the counter party (reported trades are prohibited);

             authority, the maximum premium at which such ordinary shares may be acquired will be 10% (ten percent) of the weighted average of
             the market price at which such ordinary shares are traded on the jse, as determined over the five (5) trading days immediately preceding
             the date of the repurchase of such ordinary shares by the company. the jse should be consulted for a ruling if the company’s securities
             have not traded in such five (5) business day period;
     8.1.7   the company or its subsidiary may not repurchase securities during a prohibited period as defined in the jse listings requirements

             subsidiary has authorised the repurchase, that the company and/or the relevant subsidiary has satisfied the solvency and liquidity tests
             contemplated in the companies act, and that since the test was done there have been no material changes to the financial position of
             the group.

each shareholder is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need not be a shareholder/s of the company) to attend, speak and vote in place of that
shareholder at the annual general meeting.

please read the notes on the reverse side hereof

notes to the form of proxy

1.   a certificated shareholder or ‘own-name’ dematerialised shareholder may insert the names of two alternative proxies of the shareholder’s choice in the space
     provided, with or without deleting ‘the chairman of the annual general meeting’. the person whose name appears first on the form of proxy and whose
     name has not been deleted will be entitled and authorised to act as proxy to the exclusion of those whose names follow.

2.   a shareholder’s instructions to the proxy must be indicated by the insertion of an ‘x’ in the appropriate box provided. failure to comply herewith will be
     deemed to authorise the proxy to vote or to abstain from voting at the annual general meeting as he/she deems fit in respect of all the shareholder’s votes
     exercisable thereat. where the proxy is the chairman, such failure shall be deemed to authorise the chairman to vote in favour of the resolutions to be
     considered at the annual general meeting in respect of all the shareholder’s votes exercisable thereat.

3.   the completion and lodging of this form will not preclude the relevant shareholders from attending the annual general meeting and speaking and voting in
     person thereat to the exclusion of any proxy appointed in terms hereof, should such shareholder wish to do so. forms of proxy should be lodged with or
     posted to the company’s transfer secretaries to be received not later than 48 hours before the annual general meeting, being wednesday, 5 november
     2014 at 13h00. nevertheless, forms of proxy may be lodged at any time prior to the commencement of voting on the resolutions at the annual general
     meeting. any forms of proxy not received by this time must be handed to the chairperson of the meeting immediately prior to the meeting.

4.   the chairman of the annual general meeting may accept or reject any form of proxy which is completed and/or received other than in accordance with
     these notes and instructions, provided that the chairman is satisfied as to the manner in which the shareholder wishes to vote.

5.   documentary evidence establishing the authority of a person signing this form of proxy in a representative or other legal capacity such as a power of attorney
     or other written authority must be attached to this form unless previously recorded by the transfer secretaries of the company or waived by the chairman
     of the annual general meeting.

6.   the chairman shall be entitled to decline to accept the authority of a person signing the proxy form:

     (a)   under a power of attorney; and/or
     (b)   on behalf of a company

     if that person’s power of attorney or authority is not deposited with the transfer secretaries of the company as set out in note 3 at least 48 hours before
     the holding of the annual general meeting.

7.   an instrument of proxy shall be valid for any adjournment or postponement of the annual general meeting, unless the contrary is stated therein, but shall not
     be used at the resumption of an adjourned annual general meeting if it could not have been used at the annual general meeting from which it was adjourned
     for any reason other than that it was not lodged timeously for the meeting from which the adjournment took place.

8.   a vote cast or act done in accordance with the terms of a form of proxy shall be deemed to be valid notwithstanding:

     (a)   the previous death, insanity or any other legal disability of the person appointing the proxy; or
     (b)   the revocation of the proxy; or
     (c)   the transfer of a share in respect of which the proxy was given,

     unless notice as to any of the above-mentioned matters shall have been received by the company care of its transfer secretaries as set out in note 3 or
     by the chairman of the annual general meeting if not held at the principal place of business of the company, before the commencement or resumption (if
     adjourned) of the annual general meeting at which the vote was cast or the act was done or before the poll on which the vote was cast.

9.   a minor must be assisted by his/her parent or guardian unless the relevant documents establishing his/her legal capacity are produced or have been registered
     by the company’s transfer secretaries.

10. where shares are held jointly, all joint holders are required to sign the form of proxy.

11. any alteration or correction made to this form of proxy must be initialled by the signatory/ies.
