    editorial policy

    we have created this report to help our stakeholders improve their understanding of sumitomo chemical’s approach to corpo-
    rate social responsibility (csr), including measures taken by the company to fulfill such responsibilities.
         in preparing the report, we referred to the global reporting initiative’s (gri) “sustainability reporting guidelines” (version 3.1),
    the japanese ministry of the environment’s “environmental reporting guidelines” (2012 edition) and “environmental accounting
    guidelines” (2005 edition), and the iso 26000 international standard on social responsibility (sr). we also kept in mind all of the
    feedback we received (internal and external) via questionnaire surveys on our past csr reports and csr-related information
    previously made available in the media. in reference to these materials and internal discussions, we have included information
    deemed important for both society and sumitomo chemical in this report. for the gri content index, please see pages 70 to 72.
         in particular, we have provided details on the company and its approach to csr in the “sumitomo chemical’s operations
    and csr” section found on pages 7 to 18. details are presented in the context of the business principles the company established
    at the time of its foundation, focusing on contributions to society through business operations, and specific measures that help
    bring these principles to fruition.
         regarding quantitative information, assurance is provided on the indicators labeled with a star mark ( ★ ) by kpmg azsa
    sustainability co., ltd. we have also obtained a third-party opinion from itaru yasui, former vice rector of united nations univer-
    sity and professor emeritus of the university of tokyo.
         for detailed numerical data, we have prepared a separate booklet titled “csr report 2013 data book” for easy reference.

      sumitomo chemical s corporate philosophy
      sumitomo chemical’s corporate philosophy is based on the sumitomo spirit, which have been upheld over generations for 400 years
      since the start of business by the house of sumitomo in the 17th century. specifically we possess a business philosophy, which outlines
      the fundamental ethos, missions, and values of the company as well as our corporate slogan and statement, which are intended to
      help instill “pride and commitment” among employees. moreover, we use the sumitomo chemical charter for business conduct as the
      basis for the company’s compliance system.




                                                                  the sumitomo spirit
                                                          sumitomo’s business principles

                           pledge 1         sumitomo shall achieve prosperity based on solid foundation by
                                            placing prime importance on integrity and sound management in
                                            the conduct of its business.
                           pledge 2         sumitomo’s business interest must always be in harmony with
                                            public interest; sumitomo shall adapt to good times and bad times
                                            but will not pursue immoral business.

                           harmony between the individual, the nation, and society

                   the sumitomo spirit is based on the guiding principles set in monjuin shiigaki, a document written by masatomo sumitomo, the
                   founding father of the house of sumitomo, that urged family members to conduct business with honesty, prudence, and certainty.
                   sumitomo’s business principles (established in 1891) communicate the importance of maintaining the trust of business partners and
                   of society, and calls for refraining from the pursuit of easy gains under the sumitomo spirit.
                    while the essence has not been formally codified, sumitomo also places importance on “harmony between the individual, the
                   nation, and society.” based on the idea that sumitomo must seek to benefit not only its own business, but also both the nation and
                   society, sumitomo chemical and other sumitomo group companies have long been committed to maintaining harmony between
                   their own interests and those of the public.




                                                 1. we commit ourselves to creating new value by building on innovation.

                   the sumitomo chemical group has become diversified in terms of culture and value, as the group progressively globalizes its
                   business. with this diverse profile, it is important for all employees to share the group’s business philosophy and increase their
                   awareness as members of the group. to meet this requirement, in 2009, we formulated sumitomo chemical’s business philoso-
                   phy to outline the company’s fundamental ethos, missions, and values based on the sumitomo spirit.

                    sumitomo chemical started business in 1913 as a producer of fertilizers from sulfur dioxide gas
corporate           emitted by copper smelters. this business, which solved the environmental problem of air
                    pollution while meeting the social demand for more agricultural production, embodied the
statement           business philosophy of the sumitomo family handed down from the 17th century.

                    “our business must benefit society, not just our interests.” throughout our history of almost a
                    century, we at sumitomo chemical have lived by this credo. we have worked to build better
                    lives by developing various businesses that meet people’s evolving needs. at the same time,
                    we have continuously delivered technological innovation while paying special attention to
                    product quality, safety, and the environment.

                    looking to the future, we will create new value beyond the boundaries of chemistry by
                    combining a variety of ideas, views, and technologies. we will also continue to take up the
                    challenges facing the globe, from meeting basic needs, to protecting the environment, to
                    addressing the issues of adequate supplies of food, energy, and other resources.

                    in this endeavor, each of us at sumitomo chemical will work together to enhance our capabili-
                    ties, explore new possibilities every day, and overcome the challenges lying ahead with
                    enthusiasm and a strong sense of mission.

                    sumitomo chemical will seek to continue to build trust and bring joy to people across the
                    world through constant innovation.



              sumitomo chemical formulated its corporate statement after a project team comprising members from
              across the company held lengthy discussions on the important theme of “pride and commitment” to be
              constantly shared by employees. the corporate slogan summarizes the statement in one phrase.

      sumitomo chemical s operations and csr
      sumitomo chemical’s business dates back to 1913, when the company was founded to manufacture fertilizer using hazard-
      ous sulfur dioxide extracted from exhaust gas generated in copper smelting operations. sumitomo chemical, thus, got its
      start as a company committed to overcoming environmental problems while actively contributing to the development of
      agriculture.
        since then, sumitomo chemical’s corporate philosophy has been to conduct its business not only to expand profits, but
      also to contribute to society through its business operations in the spirit of csr.

      revised our relevant support systems in april 2011. specifically,
      we enacted the following initiatives: extended the childcare leave

      three years of age) and partially introduced paid holidays to the
      system, newly established a leave system to support male
