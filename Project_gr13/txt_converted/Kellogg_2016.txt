at kellogg, consumers are at the heart of all we do. we listen to our consumers
and meet their changing tastes. we’re offering foods with more of what people want
and need—and less of what they don’t. we also are adapting to evolving consumer
preferences and lifestyles while providing greater transparency, especially regarding
the ingredients in our foods, where those ingredients come from, and the impact
they have on our world.
our portfolio of foods offers important nutrients and               moreover, we have reduced sodium and sugar, announced

positive nutrition around the globe
we constantly introduce and update foods that reflect
new and emerging consumer needs and preferences,
particularly around health and wellness. for example:

• we introduced two new cereals in our special k
  nourish® line in the u.s. and canada—both with
  multi-grain quinoa flakes, crunchy granola, almonds
  and real fruit. the cereals have 22 to 26 grams of
  whole grain and five grams of fiber per serving and
  no artificial colors or flavors.

• in australia/new zealand, we introduced kellogg’s®
  nutri-grain edge™ oat clusters, made with oats, wheat
  and nuts in three flavors (malt, peanuts & cashews;
  tropical blend & caramelized peanuts; and caramelized
  peanuts & almonds). these cereals, along with a
  redesigned nutri-grain® original, qualify for four
  stars under australia’s health star rating system, a
  governmental labeling initiative that ranks foods
  on a scale of half a star to five stars for overall nutritional
  profile (five being the best).

• in the u.k., we introduced a new range of kellogg’s®
  ancient legends™ mueslis, cereals and granolas made
  with a blend of ancient grains and seeds, such as barley,
  spelt, quinoa, chia, pumpkin and flaxseed.

reducing sugar and sodium
for more than a decade, we have been committed to reducing the sugar and sodium in our cereals. in 2014, we
set specific reduction targets, to be achieved by 2020, as part of our kellogg’s global breakfast food beliefs. we
have pledged to lower sugar so that 90 percent of our ready-to-eat cereals have 10 grams or less of sugar per
30 gram serving. we also promised to reduce the sodium in our cereals with a two-part goal (see charts below).

in 2015, we continued to make progress across the board, boosting the percentages of our portfolio with reduced
sugar and sodium per serving. in fact, we exceeded our goal of a 30 percent overall sodium reduction in ready-to-eat
cereals five years ahead of schedule. at the end of 2015, we were at 33 percent, up from 29 percent a year earlier.
however, we still have work to do on the second half of our sodium goal: achieving 85 percent of cereals with
150 mg or less of sodium per 30 gram serving.

at kellogg, we aim to earn and retain consumers’ trust by operating in line with
our values and being transparent about how our foods are grown and made.
in the environmental realm, this means working to reduce our own use of natural
resources as we make our foods and reporting on our progress, as well as taking
an industry-leading role in the global effort to stem climate change.

advocating for breakfast
on behalf of hungry children everywhere, we’re increasing
awareness and partnering with others to help solve this
important issue.

in the u.k., for example, we partnered with yougov and
fareshare to develop a thought leadership report about
the impact of school holidays on struggling families whose
children miss out on free breakfasts when classes aren’t
in session. the report was delivered to 650 members
of parliament and to media, generating over 30 million
media impressions. in italy, kellogg supported the italian
food bank federation with the launch of its report on
“surplus food management: against food waste” at the
expo milan, calling on italian politicians and authorities to
introduce a new law simplifying the process for donating
food to food banks. such a law is predicted to result in
increased donations worth 2 billion euros.

in latin america, kellogg participated in the cmr
foundation congress in mexico city with 83 non-
governmental organizations that were focusing on
nutrition for vulnerable populations. and in canada,
we supported food banks canada hunger awareness

and facebook promotions.
