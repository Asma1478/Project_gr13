our objective is always to optimise our return on capital
employed through the allocation of aircraft and capacity across
the network, regularly moving them to airports and routes with
better opportunities. in february we closed our base at rome
fiumicino and redistributed the eight base aircraft to other
bases in italy, including the opening of a new base in venice.
every year we also churn routes that have not reached their
targeted objectives. these actions reiterate our focus on
returns and will increase the return on capital employed of the
company as a whole, as we have done regularly in the past
and will do so in the future.
we continue to add frequencies and commit to basing aircraft
around the network in scale. in 2016 we broadly maintained our
asset utilisation across the network, at an average of just under
11 block hours per day (2015: 11 hours).

the year-on-year variance in average euro exchange rates for revenue and costs was principally due to the timing of revenue and
cost cash flows. on average, revenue cash inflows occur several months before cost cash outflows, resulting in a change in euro
exchange rates impacting revenue later than costs. the net adverse impact on profit due to the year-on-year changes in exchange
rates was mainly driven by the stronger average euro rate:

financial review continued




revenue per seat decreased by 6.4% to £58.46 (2015: £62.48). at constant currency, revenue per seat fell by 6.9% to £58.16. the
decrease is attributable to the terrorist events in egypt, paris, brussels, turkey and nice resulting in lower demand and yield, the
increasingly competitive capacity environment associated with the lower oil prices and the impact of the uk’s vote to leave the
european union leading to a more expensive euro for british travellers during the summer.
load factor increased by 0.1 percentage points to 91.6%.
revenue per ask decreased by 4.8% (or by 5.3% at constant currency), impacted by a 6.4% decrease in revenue per seat, partially
offset by a 1.7% decrease in the average sector length, mainly from reduced flying to egypt.

cost per seat excluding fuel increased by 2.6% to £38.31 but decreased by 1.1% per seat at constant currency.
airports and ground handling cost per seat increased by 6.1% and by 1.5% at constant currency. charges at regulated airports
increased as anticipated, primarily in italy, combined with an increase in airport and ground handling costs at gatwick. however,
these were partially offset by volume deals, combined with savings from renegotiated airport and ground handling contracts.
crew cost per seat increased by 0.7% to £6.78 but decreased by 2.2% at constant currency. this was driven by efficiencies
obtained from the up-gauging of our fleet, combined with a 1.7% decrease in average sector length and improved crew scheduling.
this was partially offset by pay increases.
navigation costs increased by 0.8% per seat to £4.21 but decreased by 4.7% at constant currency driven by a 1.7% decrease in
average sector length, annual price decreases primarily in france and germany and a one-off £8 million settlement with
eurocontrol in the 2015 financial year.
maintenance costs per seat decreased by 3.0% to £2.97 and decreased by 5.3% at constant currency. a reduction in the number
of leased aircraft resulted in reduced maintenance costs, combined with savings obtained from a new maintenance contract.
other costs per seat increased by 0.8% to £3.71 per seat, and decreased by 1.9% at constant currency. this was driven by a
reduction in aircraft wet leasing and savings in employee costs, which was largely offset by an increase in disruption costs as a
result of the terrorist events in egypt, paris, brussels, turkey and nice, combined with air traffic control industrial action and
adverse weather conditions, resulting in an increase in eu261 associated costs.
aircraft dry leasing cost per seat decreased by 14.4% to £1.30 and by 14.3% at constant currency. depreciation costs increased by
18.5% on a per seat basis. the movements are principally driven by the acquisition of 20 new aircraft last year and a decrease in
the number of leased aircraft in the fleet. the average leased fleet decreased by 6.4% to 64 and the average owned and finance
leased fleet increased by 12.6% to 185.

million (2015: £939 million) and borrowings of £756 million (2015: £504 million). after allowing for the impact of aircraft operating
leases (seven times operating lease costs incurred in the year), adjusted net debt increased by £145 million to £508 million.
net capital expenditure includes the acquisition of 20 a320 aircraft (2015: 20 aircraft), the purchase of life-limited parts used in
engine restoration and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases. the number of scheduled aircraft operating in the fleet
increased from 233 at 30 september 2015 to 249 at 30 september 2016.

easyjet secured credit ratings from moody's (baa1 stable) and standard & poor's (bbb+ stable) and announced a £3,000 million
euro medium term note programme. under this programme, on 9 february 2016 easyjet plc issued notes amounting to €500
million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750%. this increase in borrowings was offset by the repayment
of four finance leases and early repayment of five loans.
in the year ending 30 september 2015 easyjet signed a $500 million revolving credit facility with a minimum five-year term. the
facility is due to mature in february 2021.

financial review continued




net assets increased by £463 million, due to the profit generated in the period and favourable movements on the hedging reserve,
which were only partially offset by the payment of the ordinary dividend. the movement on the hedging reserve was primarily due
to the maturity of out of the money contracts.
the net book value of property, plant and equipment increased by £375 million driven principally by the acquisition of 20 a320
family aircraft, and pre-delivery payments relating to aircraft purchases.

field trip
in april 2016 four easyjet employees visited cameroon to
witness first-hand how on-board donations are helping protect
children from polio. they were selected through an application
process that considered their support for unicef and ability to
become an internal ambassador for the partnership.
polio is no longer endemic in cameroon, but in 2014 there was
an outbreak in the eastern region. the group learnt about the
complexities involved in ensuring every child is vaccinated in
order to prevent future outbreaks. they joined a group of
trained community volunteers as they went from house to
house encouraging mothers to vaccinate their children, and
they saw babies being vaccinated against polio in remote
health clinics.
employee fundraising for unicef
in november 2015, to mark easyjet’s 20th birthday, 17 easyjet
employees cycled from glasgow to london, to reflect easyjet’s
first route. the group, which included pilots, cabin crew and
engineers, covered over 400 miles and raised money
for unicef.

      events) and of unanticipated and severe air traffic congestion. this adjustment neutralises the impact of these external factors and means that the
      resulting comparison implies the same level of stretch as was intended by the committee when the target was set. this adjustment is consistent with the
      approach taken for all other employees whose bonus is also subject to this measure.

directors’ remuneration report continued




annual bonus
a sliding scale of targets for each objective was set at the start of the 2016 financial year. 10% of each element is payable for
achieving the threshold target, increasing to 50% for on-target performance and 100% for achieving maximum performance.
achievements between these points are calculated on a straight-line basis.
challenging business conditions during the 2016 financial year meant that performance in the year declined from the results
achieved in 2015. performance highlights during the year were:
•     profit before tax was £495 million (2015: £686 million);
•     roce (including lease adjustments) was 14.6% (2015: 22.2%); and
•     there was an improvement in total cost per seat but on-time performance and customer satisfaction saw declines.

13% of the maximum bonus was awarded to the chief executive in respect of performance for the year ended 30 september
2016. this will result in a bonus payment of £188,632 to the chief executive. one-third of the bonus is compulsorily deferred into
shares for three years and subject to continued employment.
21% of the maximum bonus was awarded to the chief financial officer in respect of performance for the year ended
30 september 2016. this will result in a bonus payment of £154,855 to the chief financial officer. one-third of the bonus
is compulsorily deferred into shares for three years and subject to continued employment.
the committee is satisfied with the overall payments in light of the level of performance achieved.
ltip
the awards made to executive directors in december 2013 were subject to a combination of average roce (including lease
adjustments) and relative tsr compared to ftse 51-150 companies performance conditions measured over the three financial
years ended 30 september 2016. the percentage which could be earned was determined using the following vesting schedule:
                                                                               below threshold             threshold           on target              maximum

three-year average roce (including lease adjustments) to 30 september 2016 was 19.1% and the company did not meet the
threshold tsr performance target; correspondingly 32% of awards of performance shares and matching shares are due to vest in
december 2016, subject to continued service.

price following announcement of the half year results.
note 2: for ltip awards made in december 2012, 50% of vesting was based on three-year average roce (including lease adjustment) performance for the
three financial years ending 30 september 2015. this was the first award where roce calculations included operating leases and this is the basis for all
subsequent awards. 50% of vesting was based on relative tsr performance compared to companies ranked ftse 51-150. three year average roce (including
lease adjustments) was 20.0% and the company was ranked at the 94th percentile versus ftse 51-150 companies in terms of tsr; correspondingly 100% of
these awards vested in december 2015. the following targets applied for these awards:

note 6: an award made to compensate andrew findlay for the forfeiture of the ltip award he received in august 2013 from his previous employer. since
around two-thirds of the vesting period for this award had already run its course, the committee assessed the extent to which the performance targets were
likely to be met (based on current market forecasts) in respect of the shares comprising two-thirds of the award and converted this number of shares into an
equivalent value of easyjet shares on joining. these vested on 7 august 2016, so as to mirror the original time horizon of the award.
note 7: an award of 14,625 easyjet shares relating to the forfeiture of the ltip andrew findlay received in august 2013 from his previous employer. this award
was calculated based on the value of one-third of the award at the time of joining easyjet, but these shares will only vest to the extent that the performance
targets set for the 2013 easyjet ltip award (as provided in note 3 above) are met and continued employment to 17 december 2016. this compensation
replicated the assessed value of the awards forfeit and also, in part, switched into easyjet performance on a pro-rata basis for part of the award.
note 8: an award to compensate for the forfeiture of the award granted to andrew findlay in august 2014 from his previous employer. this award comprised
an exchange of the maximum number of shares that could vest under his previous employer's award which were then converted to easyjet shares on joining.
these shares will only vest based on the extent to which the performance targets applying to the 2014 easyjet ltip award (as provided in note 4 above) are
met and andrew remaining in employment until 19 december 2017, being the ordinary vesting date for the easyjet award and later than the vesting date of
the original award at his former employer.
note 9: participants buy partnership shares monthly under the share incentive plan. the company provides one matching share for each partnership share
purchased, up to the first £1,500 per year. these matching shares are first available for vesting three years after purchase.

directors’ remuneration report continued




position against dilution limits
easyjet complies with the investment association's principles of remuneration with regard to dilution limits. these principles
require that commitments under all of the company’s share ownership schemes must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital
in any rolling 10 year period. the requirement for shares under all current share incentive schemes (ltip, save as you earn and
share incentive plan) will be satisfied with share purchases on the market. the company’s current position against its dilution limit
is therefore under the maximum 10% limit.
employee share plan participation
easyjet encourages share ownership throughout the group by the use of performance (free) shares and matching shares within
a share incentive plan and a save as you earn scheme. all staff subject to minimum service were granted shares during the year.
executive directors may also participate in these plans on the same terms as other eligible staff. they are summarised in the
corporate responsibility report on page 38.

statement of compliance
easyjet plc (the ‘company’) and its subsidiaries (‘easyjet’ or the ‘group’ as applicable) is a low-cost airline carrier operating principally
in europe. the company is a public limited company whose shares are listed on the london stock exchange under the ticker
symbol ezj and is incorporated and domiciled in the united kingdom. the address of its registered office is hangar 89, london
luton airport, luton, bedfordshire, lu2 9pf.
the accounts are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the european
union, taking into account ifrs interpretations committee (ifrsic) interpretations and those parts of the companies act 2006




                                                                                                                                                governance
applicable to companies reporting under ifrs.
basis of preparation
the accounts are prepared based on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including
derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value.
the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all years presented in these accounts.
easyjet’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are described in the




                                                                                                                                                accounts
strategic report on pages 1 to 42. principal risks and uncertainties are described on pages 24 to 31. note 22 to the accounts sets out
the group’s objectives, policies and procedures for managing its capital and gives details of the risks related to financial instruments
held by the group.
the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. details on going concern are provided on page 22.
significant judgements, estimates and critical accounting policies
the preparation of accounts in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the reporting period. although these amounts are based on management’s best estimates of the
amount, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates, and these differences may be
material. the estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly.
the following three accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies as they require a significant amount of
management judgement and the results are material to easyjet’s accounts.
aircraft maintenance provisions (note 16)
easyjet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased under operating leases during the term of the lease.
these arise from legal and constructive contractual obligations relating to the condition of the aircraft when it is returned to the
lessor. to discharge these obligations, easyjet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the
engines and the airframe during the lease term.
a charge is made in the income statement, based on hours or cycles flown, to provide for the cost of these obligations. estimates
required include the likely utilisation of the aircraft, the expected cost of the heavy maintenance check at the time it is expected to
occur, the condition of the aircraft and the lifespan of life-limited parts.
the bases of all estimates are reviewed annually, and also when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material
change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the
cost of heavy maintenance services.
other provisions (note 16)
easyjet incurs liabilities for amounts payable to customers who make claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations, and
refunds of air passenger duty or similar charges. estimates include passenger claim rates, level of claims that will be made and the
period of time over which claims will be made. the bases of all estimates are reviewed at least annually and also when information
becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to the estimate.
goodwill and landing rights (note 8)
goodwill and landing rights are tested for impairment at least annually. easyjet has one cash-generating unit, being its route
network. in making this assessment, easyjet has considered the manner in which the business is managed including the centralised
nature of its operations and the ability to open or close routes and redeploy aircraft and crew across the whole route network.
the value in use of the cash-generating unit is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value. when applying
this method, easyjet relies on a number of estimates including its strategic plans, fuel prices, exchange rates, long-term economic
growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates, and its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.




                                                                                                                    www.easyjet.com        91

notes to the accounts continued




1. significant accounting policies continued
basis of consolidation
the consolidated accounts incorporate those of easyjet plc and its subsidiaries for the years ended 30 september 2015 and 2016.
a full list of subsidiaries can be found in the notes to the company accounts on page 117.
a subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyjet plc. control is achieved when easyjet is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns
from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power, directly or indirectly, over
the investee.
intragroup balances, transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing
the consolidated accounts.
foreign currencies
the primary economic environment in which a subsidiary operates determines its functional currency. the consolidated accounts
of easyjet are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest £million, which is the company’s functional currency and the group’s
presentation currency. certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling. exchange
differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to shareholders’ equity until all or part of the interest is
sold, when the relevant portion of the accumulated exchange gains or losses is recognised in the income statement. profits and
losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, since this approximates the
rates on the dates of the transactions.
transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the end of
a reporting period and (except where the asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge) the gains or losses on translation are
included in the income statement. non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling
at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
revenue recognition
revenue comprises seat revenue, being the value of airline services (net of air passenger duty and similar charges, vat and
discounts), and non-seat revenue.
seat revenue arises from the sale of flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating, administration, credit
card and change fees. seat revenue is recognised when the service is provided. this is generally when the flight takes place, but in
the following cases, this is at the time of booking:
•    administration and credit card fees as they are contractually non-refundable; and
•    change fees as the service provided is that of allowing customers to change bookings.

amounts paid by ‘no-show’ customers are recognised as seat revenue when the booked service is provided as such customers are
not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed.
unearned revenue represents flight seats, including the provision of checked baggage and allocated seating, sold but not yet flown
and is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the service is provided.
non-seat revenue arises from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and is recognised when the service is
provided. this is generally when the related flight takes place. in the case of commission earned from travel insurance, revenue is
recognised at the time of booking as easyjet acts solely as appointed representative of the insurance company.
business combinations
business combinations in prior years were accounted for by applying the purchase method. the cost of the acquisition is measured
at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed plus any costs directly
attributable to the business combination. the acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the
acquisition date. there have been no business combinations since the effective date of ifrs 3 business combinations (revised).
goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business
combination over easyjet’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
goodwill and other intangible assets
goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. it has an indefinite expected useful life and is tested for
impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
landing rights are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. they are considered to have an indefinite useful life as
they will remain available for use for the foreseeable future provided minimum utilisation requirements are observed, and are tested
for impairment at least annually or where there is any indication of impairment.
other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated to write off their cost, less estimated
residual value, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. expected useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually.

equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis. the carrying value is reviewed for
impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. for aircraft, easyjet
is dependent on airbus as its sole supplier. this gives rise to a valuation risk which crystallises when aircraft exit the fleet, where
easyjet is reliant on the future demand for second-hand aircraft.
an element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is depreciated over a period
ranging from seven to ten years from the date of manufacture. subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future
periods, such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines, are capitalised and depreciated
over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements. all other maintenance costs are charged to the income statement
as incurred.
pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft are recorded in property, plant and equipment at cost. these amounts
are not depreciated. interest attributed to pre-delivery and option payments made in respect of aircraft and other qualifying assets
under construction are capitalised and added to the cost of the asset concerned.
gains and losses on disposals (other than aircraft sale and leaseback transactions) are determined by comparing the net proceeds
with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.

an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair
value less cost to sell and its value in use. impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed. impairment losses recognised
on assets other than goodwill are only reversed where changes in the estimates used result in an increase in recoverable amount.
leases
easyjet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells either new or mid-life aircraft to a third party and immediately
leases it back under an operating lease. surpluses arising on disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is above fair value,
are recognised in deferred income and amortised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.
in some operating sale and leaseback arrangements, receipt of part of the proceeds is deferred until the end of the lease, the
amount of which is recorded as deferred consideration within non-current or current assets as appropriate.
additionally, in some cases, receipt of part of the sales proceeds due is exchanged for a reduction in future lease rentals, which
consequently are below market price. as a result, the proceeds received on sale and leaseback are lower than the fair value of the
aircraft sold. the resulting shortfall is deferred within non-current or current assets as appropriate, and amortised on a straight-line
basis in the income statement over the expected lease term.
non-contingent operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
a number of operating leases require easyjet to make contingent rental payments based on variable interest rates; these are
expensed as incurred.
finance leases, which transfer to easyjet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are
recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease
payments. any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset
recognised. lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. finance charges are included in interest payable and other
financing charges.

1. significant accounting policies continued
financial instruments
financial instruments are recognised when easyjet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and
derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
where market values are not available, the fair value of financial instruments is calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing
interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
non-derivative financial assets
non-derivative financial assets are recorded at amortised cost and include trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and money
market deposits.
cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held in bank accounts with no access restrictions and bank deposits and tri-party
repos repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception. interest income on cash and money market deposits is
recognised using the effective interest method. restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing their
use and is classified as a current or non-current asset based on the estimated remaining length of the restriction.
impairment losses are recognised on financial assets carried at amortised cost where there is objective evidence that an impairment
loss has been incurred. the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present
value of future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
if, subsequently, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event that
occurred after the impairment was recognised, the appropriate portion of the loss is reversed. both impairment losses and reversals
are recognised in the income statement as components of net finance charges.
non-derivative financial liabilities
non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently at
amortised cost, and include trade and other payables, borrowings and provisions. interest expense on borrowings is recognised
using the effective interest method.
borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless there is an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
12 months after the reporting period date.
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
easyjet uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency risks on transactions denominated in us
dollars, euros, swiss francs and south african rand. these transactions primarily affect revenue, fuel and aircraft dry leasing costs,
and the carrying value of owned aircraft. easyjet also uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge currency and interest rate
risk on certain borrowings, and jet fuel forward contracts to hedge fuel price risks.
derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value. hedge accounting is applied to those derivative financial instruments that
are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.
fair value hedges
changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement,
together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.
cash flow hedges
gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of forward contracts are recognised in other comprehensive income and
deferred in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are determined to be effective. all other changes in fair value are
recognised immediately in the income statement.
when the hedged forecast transaction relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, the relevant accumulated gains and
losses are transferred from the hedging reserve and included in the initial carrying amount of that purchased asset. otherwise they
are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects the income statement.
in the event that a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable, any related gains and losses are
immediately transferred from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement.
hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies
for hedge accounting. where the hedged item remains a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain
deferred in the hedging reserve until the transaction takes place.
financial guarantees
if a claim on a financial guarantee given to a third party becomes probable, the obligation is recognised at fair value. for subsequent
measurement, the carrying amount is the higher of initial measurement and best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the
obligation at the reporting date.
tax
tax expense in the income statement consists of current and deferred tax. tax is recognised in the income statement except when
it relates to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or shareholders’ equity. the charge for current tax is
based on the results for the year, as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible, using tax rates that
are applicable to the taxable income.

deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is




                                                                                                                                               strategic report
probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future, with the
following exceptions:
•   where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination)
    of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit; and
•   deferred tax arising on investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where easyjet is able to control the reversal of the
    temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.




                                                                                                                                               governance
deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of
liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the date of the statement of
financial position.
deferred tax assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and tax
credits carried forwards. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits
from which they can be deducted.
deferred tax liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.




                                                                                                                                               accounts
deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax
liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
aircraft maintenance provisions
the accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned and finance-leased
aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
easyjet has contractual obligations to maintain aircraft held under operating leases. provisions are created over the term of the
lease based on the estimated future costs of major airframe checks, engine shop visits and end of lease liabilities. these costs are
discounted to present value.
where an aircraft is sold and leased back, other than when first delivered to easyjet, a liability to undertake future maintenance
activities, resulting from past flying activity, arises at the point the lease agreement is signed. this liability is treated as part of the
surplus or shortfall arising on the sale and leaseback, the accounting treatment of which is described in the leases accounting policy.
a number of leases also require easyjet to pay recoverable supplemental rent to the lessor. the purpose of these payments is
to provide the lessor with collateral should an aircraft be returned in a condition that does not meet the requirements of the lease.
this recoverable supplemental rent is included in trade and other receivables within current assets and other non-current assets, as
applicable, and is refunded when qualifying heavy maintenance is performed, or is offset against the costs incurred at the end of
the lease.
employee benefits
easyjet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of its employees. easyjet has no further payment
obligations once the contributions have been paid. the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of easyjet in
independently administered funds. easyjet's contributions are charged to the income statement in the year in which they
are incurred.
the expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related employees' services are provided.
share capital and dividend distribution
ordinary shares are classified as equity. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
where any group company or employee benefit trust purchases the company’s equity shares, the consideration paid and any
directly attributable incremental costs are deducted from retained earnings until the shares are cancelled or re-issued. proceeds
from re-issue are shown as a credit to retained earnings.
easyjet settles share awards under the long term incentive plan, the save as you earn scheme and share incentive plans by
purchasing its own shares on the market through employee benefit trusts. the cost of such purchases is deducted from retained
earnings in the period that the transaction occurs.
dividend distributions to the company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved
by the company’s shareholders.
share-based payments
easyjet has a number of equity-settled share incentive schemes. the fair value of share options granted under the save as you
earn scheme is measured at the date of grant using the binomial lattice option pricing model. the fair value of grants under the
tsr-based long term incentive plan is estimated under the stochastic model (also known as the monte carlo model). the fair value
of all other awards is the share price at the date of grant.




                                                                                                                   www.easyjet.com       95

notes to the accounts continued




1. significant accounting policies continued
the fair value of the estimated number of options and awards that are expected to vest is expensed to the income statement on
a straight-line basis over the period that employees’ services are rendered, with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity.
where non-market performance criteria (such as roce) attached to the share options and awards are not met, any cumulative
expense previously recognised is reversed. for awards with market-related performance criteria (such as tsr), an expense is
recognised irrespective of whether the market condition is satisfied.
the social security obligations payable in connection with grant of the share options are an integral part of the grant itself and the
charge is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
segmental disclosures
easyjet has one operating segment, being its route network, based on management information provided to the executive
management team, which is easyjet’s chief operating decision maker. resource allocation decisions are made for the benefit of the
route network as a whole, rather than for individual routes within the network. performance of the network is assessed based on the
consolidated profit or loss before tax for the year.
revenue is allocated to geographic segments on the following bases:
•    revenue earned from passengers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking; and
•    commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.

effective for the year ending 30 september 2019 (not yet eu endorsed)
ifrs 2 ‘share-based payment’ – amendments clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based payment transactions.
ifrs 9 ‘financial instruments’ – introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets and financial
liabilities, impairment methodology and hedge accounting.
ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ – provides a single model for measuring and recognising revenue arising from
contracts with customers, unless the contracts are in the scope of other standards, such as ias 17. it supersedes all existing revenue
requirements in ifrs.
effective for the year ending 30 september 2020 (not yet eu endorsed)
ifrs 16 ‘leases’ – provides a single lessee accounting model, specifying how leases are recognised, measured, presented
and disclosed.
the directors are currently evaluating the financial and operational impact of adopting ifrs 15 ‘revenue from contracts with
customers’ and ifrs 16 ‘leases’. the review of the impact of ifrs 15 and ifrs 16 will require an assessment of all leases and all
revenue streams, and the impact of adopting these standards cannot be reliably estimated until this work is substantially complete.
the directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations listed above will have a material impact
on easyjet’s accounts. certain of these standards and interpretations will, when adopted, require addition to or amendment of
disclosures in the accounts.

it is estimated that deferred tax assets of approximately £1 million (2015: deferred tax assets of £50 million) will reverse during the
next financial year.
deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority. as a result the
net uk deferred tax liability is £237 million (2015: £176 million). the net overseas deferred tax asset is £nil (2015: £nil).
no deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be
payable in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the group.
6. earnings per share
basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year by the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the year after adjusting for shares held in employee benefit trusts.
to calculate diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion
of all dilutive potential shares. share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price
of the company’s ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares. where share options are exercisable
based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the year, these options are included in the
calculation of dilutive potential shares.

generating unit exceeding its recoverable amount.

trade and other receivables of £24 million (2015: £14 million) are up to three months past due but not impaired.
with respect to trade receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications at the reporting date that the
payment obligations will not be met. amounts due from trade receivables are short-term in nature and largely comprise credit card
receivables due from financial institutions with credit ratings of at least a and, accordingly, the possibility of significant default is
considered to be unlikely.

on 7 january 2016, the uk listing authority approved a prospectus relating to the establishment of a £3,000 million euro
medium term note programme of easyjet plc. under this programme, on 9 february 2016 easyjet plc issued notes amounting
to €500 million for a seven year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750% and on 11 october 2016 easyjet plc issued notes
amounting to €500 million for a seven year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.125%.
the €500 million eurobond issued on 9 february 2016 was designated as the hedged item in an effective fair value hedging
relationship. the group used cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the fixed rate eurobond to a sterling floating rate
exposure. the cross-currency interest rate swaps have the same maturity and common terms as the eurobond that they are
hedging. the carrying value of the fixed rate eurobond net of cross-currency interest rate swaps at 30 september 2016 was
£376 million. see note 21 for additional details.

shares worth up to 250% (200% up to 31 december 2014) of salary each year. for awards granted from the 2015 financial year,




                                                                                                                                            governance
the vesting of these shares is dependent on return on capital employed (roce) targets and total shareholder return (tsr) targets
compared to ftse 31-130 ranked companies at the start of the performance period. all awards have a three year vesting period;
2016 awards are assessed on performance conditions measured over the three financial years ended 30 september 2018.
save as you earn scheme
the scheme is open to all employees on the uk payroll. participants may elect to save up to £500 per month under a three year
savings contract. an option is granted by the company to buy shares at a discount of 20% from market price at the time of the
grant. at the end of the savings period the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months. employees who are not paid




                                                                                                                                            accounts
through the uk payroll may participate in the scheme under similar terms and conditions, albeit without the same tax benefits.
share incentive plan
the plan is open to all employees on the uk payroll. participants may invest up to £1,800 of their pre-tax salary each year to
purchase partnership shares in easyjet. for each partnership share acquired easyjet purchases a matching share up to a maximum
value of £1,500 per annum. employees must remain with easyjet for three years from the date of purchase of each partnership
share in order to qualify for the matching share, and for five years for the shares to be transferred to them tax free. the employee
is entitled to dividends on shares purchased and to vote at shareholder meetings.
subject to company performance, easyjet also issues free shares to uk employees under an approved share incentive plan of up
to £3,000 per annum in value. there is a similar unapproved free shares scheme for international employees.
the fair value of grants under the save as you earn scheme are calculated by applying the binomial lattice option pricing model.
the fair value of grants under the tsr based long term incentive plan is estimated under the stochastic model (also known as the
monte carlo model). the fair value of grants under all other schemes is the share price on the date of grant. the following
assumptions are used:

(1)   on 9 february 2016, easyjet plc issued a €500 million eurobond under the £3,000 million euro medium term programme guaranteed by easyjet airline
      company limited. the eurobond pays an annual fixed coupon of 1.750%. at the same time the group entered into three cross-currency interest rate
      swaps to convert the entire €500 million fixed rate eurobond to a sterling floating rate exposure. all three swaps pay floating interest (3 month libor plus
      a margin) quarterly, receive fixed interest annually, and have maturities matching the eurobond. the group designated all three cross-currency interest rate
      swaps as a fair value hedge of the interest rate and currency risks on the €500 million eurobond. the swaps are measured at fair value through profit or
      loss, with any gains or losses being taken immediately to the income statement. the carrying value of the eurobond is adjusted for changes in fair value
      attributable to the risks being hedged. this net carrying value differs to the fair value depending on movements in the group’s credit risk. the fair value of
      the eurobond represents the quoted market price of the eurobond as at 30 september 2016. the carrying value of the fixed rate eurobond net of cross-
      currency interest rate swaps at 30 september 2016 was £376 million.

the fair value of the eurobond is classified as level 1 of the ifrs 13 ‘fair value measurement’ fair value hierarchy. the remaining
financial instruments for which fair value is disclosed in the table above, and derivative financial instruments, are classified as level 2.




                                                                                                                                                              accounts
the fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows:
•   level 1, fair value of financial instruments based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•   level 2, fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over the counter derivatives)
    which are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible
    on entity-specific estimates.
•   level 3, fair value of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data.

amounts disclosed in the ‘other’ column are items that do not meet the definition of a financial instrument. they are disclosed to
facilitate reconciliation of the carrying values of financial instruments to line items presented in the statement of financial position.
fair value calculation methodology
the fair values of derivatives and financial instruments have been determined by reference to observable market prices where the
instruments are traded, where available. where market prices are not available, the fair value has been estimated by discounting
expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.

notes to the accounts continued




21. financial instruments continued
the hedged foreign exchange and jet fuel transactions are expected to occur on various dates within the next 24 months.
the foreign exchange and jet fuel contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and the accumulated gains or losses deferred
in the hedging reserve will be recognised in the income statement in the periods that the hedged transaction affects the income
statement. this will be within 24 months of the end of the reporting period, except where the gain or loss is included in the initial
amount recognised for the purchase of an aircraft in which case recognition will be over a period of up to 23 years in the form of
depreciation of the purchased asset.
the group maintains cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed
rate debt issued by the group. the cross-currency interest rate swap contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and
changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged liability.

22. financial risk and capital management
easyjet is exposed to financial risks including fluctuations in exchange rates, jet fuel prices and interest rates. financial risk
management aims to limit these market risks with selected derivative hedging instruments being used for this purpose. easyjet’s
policy is not to trade in derivatives but to use the instruments to hedge anticipated exposure. as such, easyjet is not exposed to
market risk by using derivatives as any gains and losses arising are offset by the outcome of the underlying exposure being hedged.
in addition to market risks, easyjet is exposed to credit and liquidity risk.
the board is responsible for setting financial risk and capital management policies and objectives which are implemented by the
treasury function on a day-to-day basis. the policy outlines the approach to risk management and also states the instruments and
time periods which the treasury function is authorised to use in managing financial risks. the policy is regularly reviewed to ensure
best practice, however there have been no significant changes during the current year.
capital employed
capital employed comprises shareholders’ equity, borrowings, cash and money market deposits (excluding restricted cash) and an
adjustment for the capital implicit in aircraft operating lease arrangements. the adjustment is calculated by multiplying the annual
charge for aircraft dry leasing by a factor of seven, in line with accepted practice for the airline industry.
normalised operating profit is adjusted for the implied interest incorporated in the charge for aircraft dry leasing.

return on capital employed is calculated by dividing the adjusted operating profit after tax by the average of the opening and
closing capital employed, including the operating leases adjustment.
the percentage of operating leased aircraft at 30 september 2016 was 25% (2015: 28%).
capital management
the objective of capital management is to ensure that easyjet is able to continue as a going concern whilst delivering shareholder
expectations of a strong capital base as well as returning benefits for other stakeholders.
easyjet manages its capital structure in response to changes in both economic conditions and strategic objectives. the cash
and net debt position, together with the maturity profile of existing debt, is monitored to ensure the continuity of funding.
on 7 january 2016, easyjet was assigned long-term corporate credit ratings from both standard & poor's (bbb+ stable)
and moody's (baa1 stable). at the same time easyjet plc established a £3,000 million euro medium term note programme
guaranteed by easyjet airline company limited. under this programme, on 9 february 2016, easyjet plc issued notes amounting
to €500 million for a seven year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of 1.750%. at the same time easyjet airline company limited
entered into a cross-currency interest rate swap converting the €500 million notes issued at a fixed rate of 1.750% to £379 million
at a floating rate of 3 month libor plus a margin, with principal exchanges of €500 million and £379 million at inception and
maturity of the bond.
liquidity risk management
the objective of easyjet's liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet future liabilities as they fall due
and ensure access to cost effective funding in various markets.
easyjet continues to hold significant cash and liquid funds to mitigate the impact of potential business disruption events as well as a
$500 million revolving credit facility. the revolving credit facility was agreed on 10 february 2015 and was undrawn at 30 september
2016. easyjet has a target minimum liquidity requirement to cover peak unearned revenue with a minimum of £2.6 million per 100
seats in the fleet. this requires the revolving credit facility to be taken into consideration in assessing this liquidity metric. total cash
(excluding restricted cash) and money market deposits at 30 september 2016 was £969 million (2015: £939 million). surplus funds
are invested in high quality short-term liquid instruments, mainly money market funds, bank deposits and tri-party repos.

the maturity profile has been calculated based on spot rates for the us dollar, euro, swiss franc, south african rand and jet fuel at
close of business on 30 september each year.
credit risk management
easyjet is exposed to credit risk arising from cash and money market deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other
receivables. credit risk management aims to reduce the risk of default by setting limits on credit exposure to counterparties based
on their respective credit ratings. credit ratings also determine the maximum period of investment when placing funds on deposit.
credit risk is limited to the carrying amount in the statement of financial position at each year end.
counterparties for cash investments, currency forward contracts, cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency swap
contracts and jet fuel forward contracts are required to have a long-term credit rating of a- or better at contract inception.
exposures to these counterparties are regularly reviewed and, if the long term credit rating falls below a- management will make a
decision on remedial action to be taken.
disclosure relating to the credit quality of trade and other receivables is given in note 11.
foreign currency risk management
the majority of easyjet's exposure to currency arises from fluctuations in the us dollar, euro and swiss franc exchange rates which
can significantly impact easyjet's financial results and cash flows. the aim of the foreign currency risk management is to reduce the
impact of these exchange rate fluctuations.
significant currency exposures in the income statement are managed through the use of currency forward contracts, in line with the
board approved policy. the policy states that easyjet hedges between 65% – 85% of the next 12 months forecast surplus cash
flows on a rolling basis, and 45% – 65% of the following 12 months forecast surplus cash flows on a rolling basis.
significant currency exposures relating to the acquisition cost of aircraft is also managed through the use of currency forward
contracts and foreign exchange swap contracts where up to 90% of the next 24 months forecast requirement is hedged. in
addition, easyjet has substantial borrowings and other liabilities denominated in us dollars and euros, which are largely offset by
holding us dollar and euro cash and money market deposits.
significant currency exposures relating to foreign currency denominated debt issuances are managed through the use of
cross-currency interest rate swap contracts, where deemed appropriate. these hedges are designated as fair value hedges
where possible. where hedge accounting has been elected, changes in the fair value of derivatives including changes in the fair
value of the hedged liabilities are recorded in the income statement.
management may take action to hedge other currency exposures as deemed appropriate.
financing and interest rate risk management
interest rate cash flow risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash investments.
interest rate risk management policy aims to provide certainty in a proportion of financing while retaining the opportunity to benefit
from interest rate reductions. all borrowings are at floating interest rates repricing every three to six months. a significant proportion
of us dollar loans by value are matched with us dollar cash. operating leases are a mix of fixed and floating rates. of the 63
operating leases in place at 30 september 2016 (2015: 67), 73% were based on fixed interest rates and 27% were based on floating
interest rates (2015: 75% fixed, 25% floating).
in addition, on 7 january 2016 easyjet plc issued a £3,000 million european medium term note programme. under this programme,
on 9 february 2016 easyjet plc issued notes amounting to €500 million for a seven-year term with a fixed annual coupon rate of
1.750%. the proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes.

easyjet is exposed to fuel price risk. the objective of the fuel price risk management policy is to provide protection against sudden
and significant increases in jet fuel prices, thus mitigating volatility in the income statement in the short-term. in order to manage
the risk exposure, forward contracts are used in line with board approved policy to hedge between 65% and 85% of estimated
exposures up to 12 months in advance which is hedged on a rolling basis, and to hedge between 45% and 65% of estimated
exposures from 13 up to 24 months in advance which is hedged on a rolling basis. specific decisions may require consideration
of a longer term approach. treasury strategies and actions will be driven by the need to meet treasury, financial and
corporate objectives.

market risk sensitivity analysis
financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade and other receivables, trade and other
payables and derivative financial instruments. the following analysis illustrates the sensitivity of changes in relevant foreign exchange
rates, interest rates and fuel prices. it should be noted that the analysis reflects the impact on profit or loss after tax for the year and
other comprehensive income on financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship held at the reporting date. the sensitivities
are calculated based on all other variables remaining constant. the analysis is considered representative of easyjet's exposure over
the next 12 month period.




                                                                                                                                                     accounts

24. contingent liabilities
easyjet is involved in a number of disputes and litigation which arose in the normal course of business. the likely outcome of these
disputes and litigation cannot be predicted, and in complex cases reliable estimates of any potential obligation may not be possible.
having reviewed the information currently available, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes and
litigation is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on easyjet’s results, cash flows or financial position.
at 30 september 2016 easyjet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling £49 million (2015: £44 million),
of which £38 million (2015: £33 million) expires within one year. the fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible.
no amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable
that there will be an outflow of resources.

southern europe comprises countries lying wholly or mainly south of the border between italy and switzerland, plus france.
easyjet’s non-current assets principally comprise its fleet of 189 owned and 5 finance leased aircraft. a further 63 aircraft are held
under operating leases, giving a total fleet of 257 at 30 september 2016. all of these aircraft are registered in the united kingdom
except for 23 (2015: 24) registered in switzerland. these assets are used flexibly across the entire route network, and accordingly
there is no suitable basis for allocating them to geographic segments.

notes to the company accounts

a) significant accounting policies




                                                                                                                                                               strategic report
the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these company accounts are the same as those set out in note 1
to the consolidated accounts with the addition of the following.
investments

share-based payments in respect of share options and awards granted by the company, a capital contribution in the same amount
is recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to shareholders’ equity.

income statement and statement of comprehensive income. the company’s profit for the year was £307 million (2015: £221 million).
included in this amount are dividends received of £259 million (2015: £199 million), which are recognised when the right to receive
payment is established. the company recognised no other income or expenses in either the current or prior year, other than the
profit for each year.
the company has eight employees at 30 september 2016 (2015: eight), however one employee left the company’s employment
on 1 october 2016. these employees are the non-executive directors of easyjet plc; their remuneration is paid by easyjet airline
