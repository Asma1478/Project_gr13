                                      in order to continue implementing qisda’s csd vision of ”be an innovator
                                 in designing and manufacturing of electronic products, elevate the life quality of
                                 our fellow humans and being friendly to mother earth”, we have set 2010 as the
                                 beginning year of green product development. by 2012, each business unit must
                                 reach the target goal of “green design 555”: saving energy, reducing material
                                 use, and increasing the reuse, reduce, and recycling rate by 5%. in addition,
                                 qisda has fully embraced its corporate social responsibility in providing green
                                 products through incorporating the innovative life cycle thinking concept
                                 in design. it paves the way to create a green value chain in every stage of a
                                 product life: research and development, supply chain purchasing, manufacturing,
                                 distribution and marketing, as well as waste recycling.

                                 1. life cycle thinking
                                      the performance of a green product is determined at the early stage of
                                 its design. qisda requires its entire r&d staff to apply life cycle thinking
                                 at the preliminary stage of product design and development. we carefully
                                 analyze the environmental impacts and risks a product may generate

throughout the different stages of its life cycle, and hence to improve our
next-generation products.
      under the assumption that chemical substances that hold potential threats
to the environmental safety may be used in products or in the production
process, qisda has formulated a ‘hazardous material management checklist’ in
accordance with related international regulations and customer requirements
to address this concern. qisda also employs a systematic management system
to ensure that its products are complied with international regulations and
customer requests through strict control of components sample approval and
examination of final products. qisda has developed a hazardous chemical use
reduction plan to gradually reduce the use of hazardous chemical substances
each year.
      since the beginning of 2008, qisda’s manufacturing sites in taiwan, suzhou,
and mexico has met the standards and passed the iecq qc 080000 hazardous
substance process management system certification.
      in 2011, qisda obtained the iec 62430 (environmentally conscious
design for electrical and electronic products and systems) certification in its
major product lines: including tft-lcds, projectors, smart phones, scanners,
multimedia players, and lighting devices.

2. environmental labels
      first and foremost, qisda has carried out the green products concept
in full swing, from product research and development to manufacturing phase.
it makes environmentally-conscious choices in the efforts to bring these goals
into realization: extending a product’s life cycle, saving energy, use of recyclable
and low toxic materials, reducing the environment impact brought upon by
our products, and so on. meanwhile, to ensure each product complies with
environmental regulations and customer-specific requirements, qisda has
reinforced supplier environmental training and management in creating a green
supply chain. qisda has successfully assisted its customers in acquiring related
green product labels and environmental certification, including:
1.    china cecp certification                       2.   tco certification
3.    energy star                                    4.   china efficiency label

                                      3. life cycle assessment thinking
                                           since 2009, qisda has been conducting the assessment for eco-design
                                      of energy-related products (erp) directive and environmental product
                                      declaration (epd). it has been giving a great deal of consideration in evaluating
                                      the environmental impacts of our final products. of all the environmental
                                      impact indicators, we identified carbon as one of the key indicators. ever since
                                      the inception of carbon footprint inventory in 2009, qisda has received pas
                                      2050 certification for products including tft-lcd monitors, projectors, and
                                      e-books. the following figure presents the life cycle data reported to local
                                      environmental protection authorities. in 2011, our 24” lcd monitor won the
                                      first carbon-footprint certificate in china.
                                           at the same time, qisda has been constantly monitoring other
                                      environmental impact indicators beyond carbon. in 2011, from the result
                                      obtained in an iso 14025 epd analysis in one projector, we discovered a higher
                                      level of carbon consumption. as a result, qisda will still use carbon as one of
                                      the key indicators in improving the overall quality of its green product design.

                 after             for repair and recycle. as shown in figure 1.5, the previous model (before)
                                   used brass nail heat staking design in its lower case, while the latest model
                                   (after) was updated with joint latches and screws.
                                        a good product starts with a good design, which lies in well management
                                   of design in the early stage. in order to create products that are even more eco-
                                   friendly, our designers put life cycle thinking (lct) into practice, embedding
                                   it into every stage of the product’s life cycle. with the solid foundation qisda
                                   built in 2011, we look forward to stepping on top of it and enhancing our
                                   lct strategy, and thus making qisda a greener and stronger green products
                                   provider in 2012.

                                        qisda gives top priority to the satisfaction of our customers and business
                                   partners on quality, specification, cost and due date of delivery to continuously

                                   meet the various demands from our customers, qisda has integrated resources
                                   in customer service, and created a global customer service department (gcs)
                                   to fully understand “voice of customer”. gcs provides our customers with
                                   speedy and strong supports, assisting our customers in solving complex and
                                   professional problems.

                                   customer service
                                        to better serve our valued customers, qisda insists on our innovative
                                   spirits to offer products in diverse categories, as well as information
                                   and technology assistances to meet the needs of different customers.
                                   we continuously instill an entrepreneurial spirit “honesty, integrity, and
                                   commitment” in our employees, inspiring them to listen attentively to fulfill the
                                   priority needs of customers. moreover, in order to share our spirit of customer

     valuable feedbacks and comments from customers are the driving forces
that keep qisda improving and staying ahead. qisda regularly collects immediate
customer responses to ensure that their needs are met and satisfied. in addition
to the customer satisfaction rank given by major customers based on the
feedbacks collected from quarterly business review (qbr), qisda also conducts
the overall customer satisfaction survey with the remaining group of customers
in every june and december. the survey covers evaluations in the following four
key aspects: quality, service, technical support capability, delivery and price.
     gcs is responsible for delivering the survey to customers, who will
by request provide evaluations and suggestions concerning the product and
customer service. after collecting the answered surveys from our customers,
gcs will consolidate the results and convey the information to related
departments. this is to ensure that the departments involved, as well as its
high level managers, take time to review and reflect on the overall customer
requirement. after clarifying the issues among related departments, needed
adjustment shall be taken to improve the quality of our products and services.
for those customers who responded with low levels of satisfaction, we ask our
employees to get an in-depth review to define the problems, and later provide a
detailed analysis with improvement actions. figure 1.6 (page 36) shows the flow
chart of the customer satisfaction survey procedure:
     the bi-annual investigation of customer service not only reveals the overall
performance of qisda and that of its individual department in the previous
year, but also fosters a deeper understanding of the needs of our customers.
accordingly, qisda takes initiatives in communicating with our customers and
implementing action plans to fulfill their requirements. such a mechanism enables
qisda to sustain its advantages while examining thoroughly for possible room
for improvement. meanwhile, it also strengthens our priority in supporting our
customers as qisda is continuously engaged in incorporated improvements and
creating an even more efficient platform to provide better customer service.
qisda strives to assist customers solving their issues with timely and exact
solutions through a full and comprehensive communication channel.
     in 2011, customers that conduct quarterly business review (qbr)
have ranked qisda #1.45 on average among all suppliers based on the level
of satisfaction. for non-qbr customers, customer satisfaction survey was
separately conducted every half year. table 1.3 shows the results from the bi-




                                                                                                              35

                                annual customer satisfaction surveys in 2011: qisda scored an average of 89.8
                                during the first half year and 92.6 in the second half respectively; both were
                                an increase compared to the previous year. in fact qisda has shown a steady
                                improvement in the average score earned since 2009, marking its positive
                                performance in customer service and customer satisfaction.

                                1.2.2 customer privacy protection
                                    qisda has made a commitment to its customers to attach great
                                importance to information security. we conduct business in a manner that
                                fulfill our promise to protect customer privacy. with trainings received through
                                emails and the e-learning platform, every qisda employee is equipped with the
                                knowledge and practice of safeguarding information security. besides promoting
                                the necessity in information/communication security internally, qisda has
                                set strict rules in protecting confidential documents with restricted access.
                                aside from project-related employees, other staff members must acquire the

                      qisda has abided by its social responsibility and environmental safety and health
                      policy, working ceaselessly to improve its performance in pollution prevention,
                      wastes reduction, and energy conservation. as part of an ongoing effort of our
                      corporate sustainability development, qisda has also committed to compliance
                      with all the government regulations and customer requirements.
 policy/commitment


                      green operation management relies on a sound foundation in its
                      management system, including iso 14001 and ohsas 18001. in addition,
                      the corporate sustainability development committee defines the 3-year
                      performance indicators, and regularly conducts assessments in tracking the
                      overall performance.

chapter 2
green operation

                 green operation plays an essential part of qisda’s corporate sustainability
            development strategy - with environmental safety and health as the core of
            green operation management, it puts focus on five major areas in terms of raw
            material usage, energy and water management, ecological management, and
            waste management. in the meantime, we carefully monitor the operational
            impact on global warning through performing corporate-wide greenhouse gas
            inventory every year. since the second half of 2011, qisda has launched the
            iso 50001 management system in an effort to identify the opportunities that
            help to reduce ghg emissions and improve its green operation through the
            quantification process.
                 in addition, to raise the environmental awareness of our employees, qisda
            has implemented iso 14001 environmental management systems since 1997 to
            provide relevant training for all staff. to ensure that the entire staff considers
            possible impacts on the environment, new employees are required to receive
            the training for this environmental management system.

            2.1 environmental safety & health management
                 good environmental safety and health management forms the foundation
            of a green enterprise. every year, qisda invests significant labor resources
            in environmental protection programs. as a result, qisda has advanced its
            performance in environmental protection in 2011: the ratio of recyclable wastes
            from its global manufacturing sites, as well as the water reuse rate, both have
            increased over the years. in 2011, environmental protection-related investments
            totaled around us$151,000, or roughly 0.0065% of the annual revenue.
                 regarding the potential environmental impacts brought upon by our
            operations in the local community, we have carefully examined the coating
            procedure employed in suzhou, china. equipped with an activated carbon
            filtration system, qisda is able to lessen the potential environmental impacts
            from the waste gas generated in this procedure with low probability and
            seriousness.
                 to reduce the impacts from sudden and acute environmental incidents,
            qisda has established a standard procedure for environmental emergency
            response within its global manufacturing sites to manage the environmental
            impacts of its operations.

2.1.1 raw materials management
           positioned as a professional contract manufacturer of electronic products,
qisda procures all raw materials used in production from external sources.
to take initiatives in identifying future environmental impacts and rooms for
improvement, qisda has incorporated the life cycle inventory concept into the
data management of raw materials, energy consumption, waste disposal, and
wastewater discharge. the amount of raw materials procurement, resource
consumption during production and operation, and waste generated in 2011 is
provided in figure 2.1.

2.1.2 waste management
           qisda takes proactive approaches in managing wastes, continuously
engaging in energy saving and waste reduction activities. starting with the
earliest stage of production, qisda carries out substantial actions of waste
classification and recovery in order to greatly reduce the generation of waste
materials and increase the amount of recyclable materials.
           waste generated within qisda’s production facilities can be classified as
general industrial waste, medical waste, waste solvents, and non-classifiable

                                                         the performance of waste management of 2011 is shown in figure 2.2. the
                                                  overall manufacturing capacity has increased significantly in comparison to 2009;
                                                  as a result, the types and amount for recyclable waste have also increased.
                                                  since the implementation of energy conservation and waste reduction actions,
                                                  qisda has maintained its recyclable waste percentage above 88.48%, which is
                                                  estimated to reach over 90% by 2012. to sum up, the accumulated amount of
                                                  recyclable wastes has totaled 37,088 tons since 2009, of which 34,020 tons
                                                  were generated in the manufacturing site of suzhou, china.

2.1.3 water resource management
     qisda starts its water resource management at the very beginning stages
of product design by applying clean production and taking environmental
protection into consideration. of all products manufactured in its worldwide
facilities, only domestic sewage with zero waste water is generated. qisda
global water consumption has totaled 402,000 tons in 2011, with 2010 total
water usage to be around 453,000 tons. site-specific water consumption
information of 2011 is provided in figure 2.3.
     in order to realize the full benefits of water management , each
manufacturing site started to monitor its tap water usage from 2011, particularly
in the aspect of leak prevention. this effort proved successful with the total
water consumption in 2011 dropped 11.2%, as compared to 2010. in addition,
qisda does not pump underground water in any of its global operations.
     each manufacturing site around the globe is equipped with wastewater
recycling and reuse systems to control its domestic sewage. recycled domestic
sewage is reused to irrigate green areas on manufacturing site grounds. take
the manufacturing site in taiwan for instance, the amount of reused water for
landscape irrigation is 101 tons/day, about 52% of its total water consumption.
     for domestic sewage control, qisda has hired specialized personnel
to operate and maintain installed wastewater treatment system in taiwan.
domestic sewage generated in this site all discharges into municipal sewage
system. the wastewater generated in the manufacturing site in suzhou, china
discharges to the municipal drainage system for treatment, which does not
adversely affect the surrounding water source or land. qisda also surpasses the
effluent water quality standards established by governments.

                                              2.1.4 ecological management
                                                    qisda’s manufacturing sites, including those in taiwan, suzhou, and mexico,
                                              are all located in industrial parks with mainly assembly operations. thus, the
                                              manufacturing processes do not use diesel or heavy fuels as indirect materials
                                              used in production, only the emergency power generators and forklifts in suzhou
                                              manufacturing site are powered by diesel. as the amount of sox generated when
                                              burning diesel is slight and does not have significant impacts on the environment,
                                              qisda does not conduct further analysis on tracing sox and nox.
                                                    with all of qisda’s manufacturing sites located within industrial parks, the
                                              company does not own, lease, or manage any manufacturing facility located
                                              within ecological conservation areas or water conservation areas. it does
                                              not engage in any kind of activity that creates a negative influence toward
                                              biodiversity. it is qisda’s commitment to ensure that during its product
                                              manufacturing and service process, it does not present a negative influence on
                                              the ecology.

safety, hygiene, and health requirements. up until now, qisda’s manufacturing
sites around the world have not reported an incident of occupational disease
resulting from work. in work-related injuries, most are cuts or lacerations
caused by the use of manual tools. these injuries are typically temporary in
nature and do not require time off. however, a few incidents of work-related
injuries do result in time off from work. work-related injuries that require
more than one-day time off fall within the calculation scope of disabling
frequency rate (fr), disabling severity rate (sr), and absence rate (ar).
     after calculation, in 2011, qisda’s average disabling severity rate was 3.4;
the rate of occurrence of occupational disease was 0; the rate of occurrence of
fire hazards was 0; the disabling severity rate was 0.166.
     statistics demonstrates a decrease of 62% in disabling severity rate of
2011, in comparison with 2009. the disabling frequency rate of 2011 also
dropped 59%, as compared to 2009. there has been no occurrence of fire
hazards and occupational disease. table 2.2 compares the safety and health
management performance among qisda’s global manufacturing sites in the
period of 2009-2011.
     qisda puts great importance on effective chemical products management,




                                                                                                                 45

                                as the use of chemicals in the production process has always been the focus of
                                environmental safety and health management. in the incidents of chemical leaks
                                and spills, they may have drastic effects on the safety and health of the employees
                                and the surrounding environment. in 2011, none of qisda’s global manufacturing
                                facilities experienced incidents of chemical leaks or spills. the manufacturing
                                site in suzhou, china implemented a safety competition in 2011, which assisted
                                the advance in safety performance through team competitions. along with the
                                company’s aforementioned record of disabling frequency rate and disabling
                                severity rate, it affirms qisda’s positive role in assuring the safety and health of
                                its employees, as well as its extensive efforts in protecting our environment.

                                2.2 climate change
                                     ever since the industrial revolution, human industr y has relied
                                tremendously on the use of fossil fuel, such as coal and petroleum, resulting
                                in a large amount of carbon dioxide and an increased greenhouse effect.
                                consequently, the global average temperature has risen and thus affected the
                                ecological and social aspects of human activities. evidence of climate change
                                includes rising sea levels, changing patterns in precipitation and regional climate.
                                projections in climate change suggest dramatic changes in the entire ecosystem,
                                potentially threatening the livelihood of all living beings.
                                     with the ever-increasing threat posed by further global warming; to
                                take its responsibility as a global citizen, qisda has taken actions in preserving
                                our environment. in 2007, qisda established a comprehensive greenhouse
                                gas emission inventory in accordance with the iso 14064-1 and ghg
                                protocols for its global manufacturing sites. since then, an annual greenhouse
                                inventory check is performed and passed to an independent third party for
                                verification. the 2011 result of greenhouse gas emission inventory from its
                                global manufacturing sites has passed iso 14064-1 third-party verification. see

                  figure 2.4.   credentials in figure 2.4.
 2011 iso 14064-1 certificate        according to 2011 ghg emissions inventory results, the primary
                                source of qisda’s greenhouse gas was carbon dioxide generated in the use of
                                externally purchased electricity during its production process, in addition to
                                the greenhouse gas generated in the use of gas and petroleum from its in-house
                                business operations. in particular, the electricity purchased by the company
                                accounted for over 90% of qisda’s total greenhouse emissions.
                                     to mitigate our impacts on global warming, qisda has established relevant
                                plans of greenhouse gas reduction in two tracks: engineering improvement and
                                administrative management.

                                i.engineering improvement
                                1.   chiller equipment to improve and increase performance

5.   fixed and controlled exhaust for dormitory and underground parking facilities
6.   independent, area-specific air conditioning management
7.   energy use monitoring to control or shut down electricity
8.   energy saving activities in the office
9.   night-time energy management
10. concentrated manufacturing to reduce overtime
11. air conditioning synchronized with production start and end times
     through various energy saving measures, the global per-capita per-hour
co2 emission was 2.06 kg-co2 in 2011, in comparison with 2009’s 2.86 kg-
co2 , there has been a 28% reduction.

                      regulations, social standards, and environmental plans of their native country
                      with integrity. at the same time, qisda seeks opportunities to inspire its
                      suppliers to create innovative techniques and green components needed in
                      production, even facing the depletion of natural resources.
 policy/commitment


                      qisda’s supplier selection employs a survey with a wide range of screening
                      criteria, including the supplier’s company and product information, major
                      customers, financial performance, procurement contracts of responsibilities
                      and obligations with qisda, the supplier’s green management procedures,
                      commitment to qisda’s green product policies, and investigations of the
                      supplier’s social responsibility and environmental safety and health management.

green supply chain

                                               as a cross-industry, comprehensive odm/oem leader in electronics, qisda
                                         partners with over 900 suppliers around the globe. qisda takes it as a serious
                                         responsibility to actively involve all suppliers in building a safe, healthy, and
                                         sustainable supply chain that protects the environment and values human rights.

                                         3.1 supplier management
                                         3.1.1 supplier selection and qualification procedures
                                               supplier selection is accomplished in accordance with qisda’s future
                                         product trends and purchasing strategies that assist our company to choose the
                                         right supplier based on its capacity, technical innovation ability, quality, services,
                                         and its management system. when evaluating a new supplier, an assessment
                                         team is created and comprised of members from procurement, quality
                                         assurance, r&d, and component sample approval teams. the team creates
                                         a survey that inquires about all potential suppliers’ capabilities, and finally
                                         evaluates the results from the survey. only if a supplier passed qisda’s strict
                                         qualification procedure, it can become a qualified vendor and proceed with its
                                         new product verification.

    the supplier selection employs a survey with a wide range of screening
criteria, including the supplier’s company and product information, major
customers, financial performance, procurement contracts of responsibilities
and obligations with qisda, the supplier’s green management procedures,
commitment to qisda’s green product policies, and investigations of the
supplier’s social responsibility and environmental safety and health management.

3.1.2 supplier assessment
    qualified suppliers that passed the supplier selection procedure must
continue to be assessed on a regular basis. the iqsdc evaluation module
examines a supplier from five aspects: innovation/technology, quality, delivery,
cost leadership and speed/response. the outcome of these evaluations will be
considered in procurement strategies by sourcers, who consult with relevant
departments to establish a strategic suppliers list of key components and
update it every half-year. for suppliers who do not make the list, they will stay
as qualified vendors. qisda gives higher priority to its strategic suppliers in
business selections or high volume of procurement opportunities.

3.1.3 supplier risk management
    for qualified suppliers, qisda also cautiously perform risk assessments
periodically or at nonscheduled times to investigate the financial status of
suppliers and pay close attention to suppliers with high financial risk to avoid
disputes such as discontinuity of product delivery due to bankruptcy. qisda also
performed major risk investigations on suppliers during crucial times such as
311 japanese earthquake and tsunami, thai flood crisis, the peak period of the


                                                                                    51

                                         new influenza season, and the labor shortage in china. suppliers located in
                                         the affected areas underwent thorough investigations for relevant contingency
                                         plans, or were advised to make appropriate adaptations. those are examples
                                         of qisda’s precautionary measures to maintaining a stable supply chain to
                                         prevent damages to its business operations and protect the rights and benefits
                                         of its stakeholders.

by the end of 2011, suppliers that have completed qisda supplier social
responsibility investigation accounted for 81% of the total purchasing expense.
    on the aspect of supplier environmental responsibility, qisda has gathered
some of its major suppliers in 2008 to join eup directive training on product
life cycle inventory, including direct/indirect materials, resources usage, waste
disposal and transportation energy consumption all those efforts were
aimed to help our suppliers understand the calculation of a product life cycle
environmental impacts and possible impacts on other ecological indicators.
to continuously increase awareness on environmental impacts and carbon
emission management, qisda has also provided several vendors with guidance
and training on product carbon footprint inventory in the period 2009-2011.

3.2.2 conflict minerals policy and supply chain
      conflict minerals survey
    in 2010, qisda for the first time required specific material (tantalum and
tim) suppliers to sign a conflict-free mineral supply agreement, or provide a
declaration statement as alternative, to prohibit the purchase of conflict metals
from eastern drc or central africa. all related purchasing policies have been
posted on the section corporate social responsibility in qisda official website
(http://www.qisda.com.tw/) to ensure that the metal purchasing policies are in
accordance with our corporate social and environmental responsibility.
    in response to the requirement of our customers, all suppliers were
asked to respond to conflict minerals reporting template developed by the
electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc) and the global e-sustainability
initiative (gesi) in 2011. the response rate was 76%.

     3.3 green supply chain
         to build up qisda’s green supply chain is a vital and enduring task in our
     sustainability development. qisda remains vigilant regarding environmental
     protection issues and the revision or updates of regulations.
         in 2006, qisda hosted supplier-training events to share the rohs
     regulations. in 2008, it offered consecutive supplier training sessions for
     the upcoming erp directives. in 2009 and 2010, qisda held several supplier
     workshops to advise suppliers on carrying out life cycle inventory for carbon
     footprint. in response to the international trend of using conflict-free minerals
     in 2011, qisda conducted its supply chain ghg survey, and required all
     component suppliers of all business units to respond to conflict minerals
     reporting template developed by eicc and gesi, in addition to the required
     supplier agreement of prohibition on metals from the conflict areas.
         future management methods include targeting tier-one suppliers to receive
     training and to provide data for qisda’s verification. besides strengthening
     suppliers’ environmental awareness and corporate social responsibility, qisda
     continues to offer promotions and guidance to our suppliers in the hope to
     jointly stay ahead of the demands in environmental protection tasks in the
     manufacturing industry. through the support from our first-tier suppliers, as
     well as the management and monitoring in further upstream suppliers, namely,
     the second and third-tier suppliers, qisda is capable of creating a strong green
     supply chain.
         qisda’s major implementations in building a green supply chain are as follows:
     i. local procurement
         qisda manages nearly 900 direct material suppliers in 2011 due to different
     product strategies and key component specifications varied in business units.
     qisda is committed to implementing local procurement. most suppliers
     have factories within close proximity to qisda production sites, including
     suzhou, china, taiwan and mexico. although our customers may make partial
     arrangements with appointed procurement, qisda has managed to negotiate
     with them to increase local purchase of consigned materials, in order to save
     transportation energy, time, and to reduce environmental pollution. based
     on the 2011 procurement data, qisda purchased 87.1% of its materials from
     china, 12.5% from taiwan and other locations in asia, while nearly 0.4% of its
     materials were purchased from america.
     ii increasing material commonality, decreasing material scrap rate
         in order to reduce unnecessary scrap materials, the procurement
     department actively works with the r&d department as well as the related
     product department in the beginning of product development to select materials
     and parts that share high commonality. the production and manufacturing
     department then sets targets for the material scrap rate according to product
     types, so as to cut down the cost of purchasing and replacing different product
     materials and components.

iii. energy conservation in logistics
     in logistics, many practical and efficient ways can be implemented to
reduce the environmental impacts. for instance, qisda created minimum
order agreements with many suppliers to achieve maximum loads during
transportation. since 2008, qisda has kept up expediting the in-house
production of mechanical components in suzhou, china, as its efforts to
reduce considerable fuel consumption and pollution generated during the
transportation of bulky packages. packaging materials such as cushions and
cartons are recycled according to a minimum recycling rate defined together
with local suppliers, who are also required to cooperate fully in recycling
packaging materials. for the time being, qisda has obtained great results over
the years.




                                                                                 55

                                    social responsibility
                      guided by the environmental safety and health policies defined in its corporate
                      sustainability development, qisda is committed to giving back to the society,
                      promoting labor rights, and improving the quality of our living environment.
 policy/commitment



                      qisda continues to perform sa 8000 evaluation every year to verify that
                      the labor condition in qisda is compliant with international requirements. in
                      addition, csd has defined key performance indicators in the aspect of social
                      responsibility. regular assessments have been conducted to track the progress.

                                                    4.1.1 recruiting principles
                                                          qisda publicly recruits employees based on corporate business strategies
                                                    and operational needs. the selection consideration gives priority to qualified
                                                    internal candidates over external candidates. qisda does not discriminate based
                                                    on race, religion, color, nationality and gender; it strictly prohibits the use of
                                                    child labor.

4.3 human rights management
4.3.1 labor rights protection
    qisda pledges to protect the labor rights of its employees. all labor
rights managements must be in compliance with local laws and regulations,
international conventions formulated by labor organizations, and stakeholder
requirements. examples of the company’s efforts in this aspect are: qisda
prohibits any use of child labor; strives for equal and fair treatment to its
employees; and bans forced labor, particularly labors gained through slavery and
human smuggling, under any circumstances. qisda strictly abides by the newly
enacted california transparency act.
    ever since the inception of qisda, the company has always maintained a
harmonious relationship with its employees. it develops multiple communication
channels available to employees to report sexual harassment and/or case of
improper treatment. qisda has established “employee complaint and reporting
handling procedure” and “sexual harassment prevention and investigation
procedure” to protect its employees. the company guarantees the anonymity
of employees who report a violation. so far, there have been no employee
disputes, neither cases of discrimination or unfair treatment.

                           ethics management system since 2007. educational trainings on eicc have been
                           offered on a regular basis – 92.22% of qisda’s employees have received trainings
                           in 2011. qisda has incorporated ethics management system into our corporate
                           social responsibility and environmental safety and health management system.
                           integrity handbook was published based on relevant international regulations of

                           progressively required suppliers to sign the social responsibility and
                           commercial ethics agreement, seeking their full commitment to abide by eicc
                           and sa 8000 standards.
                               moreover, qisda launched its investigations on supplier social responsibility
                           and environmental safety and health management in five dimensions:
                           management system, social responsibility, environmental protection, safety and
                           health, and ethics. in 2010, qisda further included eicc and ghg emissions
                           inventory in the survey.
                               in response to the international trend and customer requirements of using
                           conflict-free minerals, in 2011, qisda requested all component suppliers to take
                           the conflict minerals survey developed by eicc & gesi. as of the end of 2011, 4%
                           of suppliers had obtained sa 8000 certificate. additionally, qisda started on-
                           site audits on high-risk suppliers in 2011, extending its supports and guidance to
                           those suppliers who have not yet applied for relevant certificates.

established various communication channels, such as town meeting, employee
welfare committee, labor-management meetings, for employees to learn
about the latest management decision in person. qisda welcomes employees’
questions and suggestions on its business operation and development. these
comments and concerns from employees are sent to relevant departments for
further considerations. qisda believes that a healthy, two-way communication
not only benefits the labor-management relationship but also helps to identify
the needs and concerns of its employees. in turn, qisda is capable of providing
immediate and efficient responses to its employees and thus creating a desirable
working environment.

                                                                                                                            65

     in various functions. the employee representatives attend regular employee
     welfare committee and labor-management meetings to engage in two-way
     communications with the management representatives to address the issues
     regulated by sa 8000 standards. specifically, quarterly labor-management
     meetings allow employee representatives to communicate with managers in
     labor-related issues, such as labor-management relationship, labor conditions,
     welfare and benefits, and further reach amicable agreements between two sides.

     ii. multiple communication channels

     compensation, the company works hard to constantly improve working

                                   4.5 goodwill for the earth, love for the society
                                        ever since its establishment, the corporate has embraced the belief “what
                                   is taken from the society is used in the interests of the society” in its mission. in
                                   november 2003, the benq group founded the benq foundation in the hope
                                   to realize the corporate vision of “bring enjoyment and quality to life” among
                                   the general public in taiwan. the benq group fully supports the work of benq
                                   foundation in its team efforts of fulfilling the corporate value “good will for the
                                   earth, love for the society.”
                                        the benq group has always believed that the goals of its business
                                   operation must go beyond profits; instead, they embody a corporate promise
                                   to its surrounding land and people, which presents the founding responsibility
                                   and mission of the benq foundation. based on its corporate core value of
                                   social responsibility, the benq foundation seeks its role as the key to happiness
                                   and the driving force of delivering empathy in the society. it all starts with the
                                   realization that each individual is part of a larger social system which shapes our
                                   ways of being, doing and feeling. the benq foundation takes great efforts in
                                   helping people discover the genuine beauty and affection within our society.

     the benq foundation defines people and land as its primary subject
of services, with caring for the society and being friendly to the earth as the
guidelines in developing programs. it sets the following four major objectives in
providing community service: “reducing the digital divide”, “fostering honest
and smart people”, “promoting the value of original culture”, and “caring for
the earth”. through working in these areas, the foundation demonstrates its
desire to ignite people’s attention and compassion toward the society.

4.5.1 the development of digital opportunity centers
      in hsinchu and miaoli
     the benq foundation has been making joint efforts with the ministry of
education in the project “creating digital opportunities in remote areas”.
in 2008, it assisted in the establishment of nine digital opportunity centers
(doc), and with the four-year period, the project has expanded and now it
oversees twenty-one docs in hsinchu and miaoli counties. the foundation
incorporates digital learning, distinguished cultural features and tourism industry
into its digital curriculum design. through empowering local community with
the ability of using digital applications and online resources, it hopes to launch a
trend of digital marking in local farm products and tourism. ultimately, the goal
is to create self-managed communities with sustainable capabilities to improve
economic and living status, as well as preserve the valuable cultural assets using
digital technologies.




4.5.2 “88 green light campus reconstruction program”
      for schools in disaster areas
     the benq foundation gathered benq group resources to assist two
elementary schools located in the flooded areas in eastern and southern
taiwan in reconstructing their campus. the two schools were rebuilt with
green building design and energy conservation in mind, presenting the harmony
between man and nature. through these efforts, we see the hope and power
restored on the wounded mother earth, where children are given a chance to
learn and grow on a green campus.




                                                                                       73

     reconstruction of taiwu elementary school,
     wanruan township, pintung county
     permanent campus reconstruction completed and opened
     (2010. 12. 23 – 2011. 9. 28 )
          taiwu elementary school, originally located near the entrance of northern
     da-wu mountain, was heavily damaged in landslides and surface faulting caused
     by typhoon morakot 88 flood. the school and residents of the taiwu tribe
     in the area were forced to abandon their homeland sitting 800 meters above
     sea levels, and since then they had located in eight different times before finally
     settling down in the xinchi farm of the wanrun towanship. through “88
     green light campus reconstruction program”, the benq foundation was
     committed to build a new school in the foothills for the children.
          in the end of 2010, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the
     “taiwu permanent campus reconstruction program”. the ceremony was
     carried out by adhering to paiwan tradition in honoring the taiwu tribe. the
     benq foundation gathered resources from the benq group, including auo
     expansion and solar power technology team, fu tsu construction company
     and hsuyuan kuo architect & associates, working relentlessly for nine
     months to complete the reconstruction. on september 28, 2011, teacher’s
     day, a permanent campus for taiwu elementary school was dedicated to the
     community.
          leaving its mountain-surrounded homeland, the culture of paiwan was
     migrated to the foothills along with the tribe and the school. blended with
     paiwan traditional culture and spirit, the campus design tells the story of paiwan
     tribe: in the north and west side of the campus, a 5-meter and 4.5-meter
     wall was constructed respectively to present northern and southern da-
     wu mountain; the huge mosaic totem in the east campus depicts the origin
     of paiwan tribe; the three-color mosaic totem in south campus represents
     the tribe’s longing for peace and blessings; the long, arch-shaped wall of the
     school buildings as well as the earthenware pots square, both are symbolic
     presentations of paiwan icons of hundred-pace snakes and earthenware pots;

the traditional stone slab houses, barns, grills and swings are created for social
gatherings on campus. all these designs provide paiwan kids a new taiwu
campus enriched by its aboriginal culture to grow and learn. principal li-hua wu
commented, “the new taiwu campus shows benq group’s respect to paiwan
culture and ideas, which makes it such a great company!”
    in addition to the traditional paiwan style campus, the solar energy power
system also introduces kids in taiwu to the new energy in environmental
technology, learning about power saving and green energy through their
educational experience. with the latest solar energy technology from benq
group, 270 high-efficiency building-integrated photovoltaics (bipv) were
installed on the roof of the campus buildings, capable of producing electricity
amounted to 88,500 kwh each year. it also generates a monthly income of
ntd$60,000 for the school by selling its electricity. this solar power system is
not only eco-friendly but also contributing to the development of the school.
    the governor of pintung county, chi-hung cao complimented, “the
reconstruction of taiwu elementary school is a role model in taiwan, for it
shows respect to the culture of a minority tribe. the world would be delighted
to learn about this great endeavor.” chairman of the benq foundation, k.y.
lee further elaborated, “it is indeed that the reconstruction is a tremendous
joint effort of many resources within the corporate, requiring a great deal
of monetary support. however, we consider the collaboration between
reconstruction work and local culture as the highest priority – a successful
reconstruction must meet the needs of its target occupants.” during the
dedication ceremony, president ma ying-jeou called to congratulate, “taiwu
elementary school is the first migrated reconstruction project completed after
the disaster. the innovative self-sufficient solar power system, as well as the
campus design full of paiwan architectural meanings and symbols, making it a
remarkable creation for aboriginal tribes. it is only possible with the relentless
efforts from the benq foundation to finish this campus reconstruction in such
a short period of time.”

                                    adopted rice paddies in northern, central, southern part of the island, and in the
                                    east below the mountains. island-wide, a total of 8 hectares of farming land in ten
                                    towns have been adopted, following the schedule of august planting and december
                                    harvesting. employees from qisda participated enthusiastically with their friends and
                                    families, experiencing together “plowing in spring and harvesting in fall” – a laboring

            reading for hopes –          beginning with a rice seed to harvesting full grown ears of rice, and tasting the
     ruiping elementary school,
                          linkou    light fragrance of steamed rice, qisda employees, their family and friends learned to

                                    yet delicate hospitable culture in northern, central, southern, and eastern taiwan also
                                    humbled us and created delightful memories for our trips.

                                    4.5.4 reading for hopes
                                         the benq foundation adopted elementary schools in remote areas. it
                                    recruited employees as “q-seed volunteers”, and trained them to be great
                                    storytellers. through their vivid, active tones and body languages, the employee
                                    volunteers were able to stimulate the interest of reading among those children.
                                    the foundation believes in the power of stories – simple in telling, but profound
                                    in lessons learned. with the guided reading provided by our employees, we hope
                                    to show our care and willingness to share love and laughter with these children,
                                    strengthening the power of growth in their gentle souls.

4.5.5 one small rice paddy, three-acres wheat farming,
      and one million trees
one small rice paddy: to feel the land through planting; to cherish
the land through harvesting
     for the consecutive four years starting in 2008, the benq foundation has
adopted rice paddies in northern, central, southern part of the island, and in
the east below the mountains. island-wide, a total of 7 hectares of farming land
in 8 towns have been adopted, following the schedule of august planting and
december harvesting.
     employees from qisda participated enthusiastically with their friends and
families, experiencing together “plowing in spring and harvesting in fall” – a
laboring process that farmers endure from planting the green seeds into the
rice paddy to carefully tending to the rice seedlings until they grown into golden
ears of rice.
three-acres wheat farming: to know the land through wheat planting
     during the fallow period after the second rice harvesting, the benq
foundation adopted the wheat fields in xizhou, zhanghua for winter planting.
the locally cultivated “fine wheat grown in taichung no. 2” seeds were
sown, and tendered in the different stages: tillering, booting, shooting,
flowering and grain filling, and ripening, until they were ready to be harvested
in march. the golden-beamed wheat fields have been tendered with farmers’
lifelong affection toward the land, in the most delicate way of giving and
returning to the roots of civilization.
one million trees: to give back to the land by tree-planting
     “it takes ten years to grow trees” – we all feel the anticipation of seeing
the seedlings grow into trees, then forests when planting trees. the benq
foundation is devoted to promoting a greenish environment, as an example, in
2011, more than 800,000 trees have been planted in its global manufacturing
sites. the green promise starts in the land of our mind. every year, the benq
group holds “green party” tree-planting event for its employees, their family
and friends, to help carbon reduction through this physical experience, while
at the same time to experience the compelling power of mother earth through
the process of plowing, planting and watering.

5.1.2 corporate governance status
        qisda’s board of directors considers company and shareholder interests as top
priorities in performing operational evaluations and passing significant resolutions.
the audit committee fulfills an overseeing role through prudent and meticulous
supervision over the operations of the company and the board of directors. in
addition, qisda’s corporate sustainability development (csd) activities are
promoted through the csd committee under the supervision of its chairman, mr.
hui hsiung.
        in accordance with the regulations in article 208, item 3 of the
company act, the chairman of the board of directors, mr. k. y. lee, shall
not concurrently serve in any position at qisda. on september 1, 2007, after

   the three members of the board of directors of the company’s 100% controlled subsidiary qisda
   (suzhou) co.ltd. (qcs) were appointed by qisda. the board of directors strives to maximize the
   benefits for the shareholders and operates in accordance with local relevant laws and regulations.


                                                                                                        81

     or vote on any matter in which he or she has potential conflict of interest or
     such participation is likely to prejudice the interest of the company. when
     such a situation presents itself, according to company act, article 206, item
     2, and article 178, the director should be excused from the meeting until the
     discussion and voting is over on the matter involved. when deemed necessary,
     the chairman shall appoint someone else to act on the director’s behalf.
          according to current qisda regulations and procedures, the compensation
     for directors must not surpass 1% of distributable annual earnings, which
     demonstrates the relationship between operational performance and the
     compensation of the board of directors. however, the board of directors’
     devotion and commitment to performing various responsibilities and duties
     will not decrease due to company’s losses or profits. therefore, considering
     the company’s industry risk, the responsibilities of the chairman, directors and
     independent directors, the scope of its operations and so on, under the principle
     of uniformity of treatment as to fair compensation for those performing tasks
     that bear heavy responsibilities, the company shall issue director compensation
     on a regular basis governed by company regulations and upon the approval of the
     salary and compensation committee and board of directors.
          the board of directors shall submit the annual financial statement, business
     report, profit surplus distribution and all related documentation and proposals
     to shareholders’ meeting for approval. such a measure allows shareholders
     to verify the operational results of the board of directors and to determine
     the performance of the top management entity of the corporate. it is also
     expected that the information regarding the compensation of the directors
     and high-level executives shall be reasonably disclosed in the company’s annual
     report, providing all stakeholders with needed information to understand the
     relationship between top executives’ compensation and corporate performance.

     other compliance requirements of the board shall be proceeded in accordance
     with the rules of procedure. the board meeting shall be convened at least once
     each quarter. the board of directors strives to maximize the benefits of the
     shareholders, and each director is expected to fulfill his or her supervisory role
     faithfully with the highest degree of self-discipline and integrity.

     ii. audit committee operation
          in 2008, qisda installed independent directors and an audit committee in
     accordance with the securities and exchange act and shareholder resolutions.
     through the “audit committee chapter” as enacted by the board of
     directors, qisda maintains sound strategic and executive organizations to
     continuously increase operational efficiency by implementing practical and

82

exact measures in corporate governance. the audit committee must convene
at least once each quarter, requesting the attendance of accountants, internal
auditors, risk management, legal and finance department representatives. the
audit committee then receives reports and makes inquiries into the audit status
concerning the latest financial report, internal audit results, significant litigation,
and financial operation status. this implementation is aimed to assure that the
audit committee can assist investors to ensure the credibility with regard to
corporate governance and transparent information, and further safeguard the
rights and interests of the shareholders.

taiwan parent company recorded revenues of nt$69.7 billion; an after-tax loss
of nt$3.4 billion, and a loss of nt$1.74 per share was recorded. the year 2011
proved to be a tumultuous period with various intricate challenges: the sluggish
recovery from global recession, europe’s debt crisis, the japanese earthquake
and tsunami, the increased cost of materials, as well as other adverse factors,
all contributed to the hardships in business operations. although the external
environment remained unfavorable, qisda managed to turn profit in core
business through development of new products and customer base, improved
cost and efficiency. however, due to qisda’s investee companies’ loss, the
company recorded a drop in revenue and negative earnings in 2011.

5.3 anti-corruption
     qisda def ined that to treat all customers, suppliers, creditors,
shareholders, employees and the general public with honesty as one of its
corporate missions, and has instilled such a sense of shared responsibility
among employees. the company strictly prohibits any form of corruption,
bribery, blackmailing, and etc. to enhance employee integrity, qisda demands
each of its members to clarify and improve daily conducts proactively. the
company’s integrity handbook was drawn up to govern the code of conduct
in the following areas: “conflict of interest”, “regulatory compliance”, “business
confidentiality and company asset” as well as other related regulations. the
integrity handbook sets forth the highest standards of conduct and ethical
behaviors for all employees in the performance of their business activities.
for every new hire, the company stresses the regulations laid out in integrity
handbook through educational trainings. particularly before the three major
traditional festivals, the company reinforces employee awareness of integrity
by emphasizing its zero tolerance towards bribery. each and every qisda
employee must abide by the code of conduct outlined in integrity handbook.
as illustrated in qisda “disciplinary procedures” – the most severe punishment
for any forms of corruption could be expulsion. transgressions such as fraud
or embezzlement; inappropriate engagement in outside business that would
jeopardize the interest of the company, faking signature and seal stealing, are all
punished with expulsion.
     for daily procedures in business operations, qisda has designed and
implemented appropriate internal control mechanisms to take preventive
measures against potential corruption risks. the company’s internal audit unit
administers periodic evaluations to examine the effectiveness of the internal
control mechanism, and collects suggestions regarding potential risks of
corruption and fraud from heads of the departments. based on the findings, the
internal audit unit further develops and implements appropriate auditing plans.
both the audit committee and the board of directors receive audit reports on
a regular basis, which helps the top management to understand the status of
corporate governance in achieving the objectives of its administration.
     from time to time, management and human resources center (hr)
communicate the company’s commitment to integrity through various
educational trainings to ensure a complete understanding of relative rules
and regulations among employees. to fully promote the integrity handbook,
in 2010 qisda published it in simplified chinese and spanish for its overseas
manufacturing sites, in addition to the existing traditional chinese and english
versions. since then, the company has also conducted relevant educational
trainings to advocate the value addressed.
     after publishing the integrity handbook in five languages, hr implements
a company-wide online training course titled “integrity and anti-corruption”.
the content includes a guided reading of integrity handbook, summary and

                                                                                      85

                                      key points, and actual case studies, accompanied with a test to examine the
                                      learning outcome. with all these approaches, there has been no incidence
                                      of corruptions in 2011. qisda includes the awareness training percentage for
                                      the integrity handbook as one of its key performance indicators; in 2011 the
                                      percentage of employees trained in anti-corruption policies and procedures has
                                      reached 92.2%. table 5.3 shows the key performance indicator in this aspect
                                      since 2010.

                                            operation site held its own rmc meetings) to track the performance of
                                            risk management. the agenda was as follows: the implementation result of
                                            the risk improvement plan, case studies, updates of regulatory changes and
                                            their impacts, and etc. in addition, rmc also examines significant domestic/
                                            international events and unusual risks on a regular basis, providing needed
                                            action plans to address the risks.

                                            committee, qisda takes a proactive approach in response to the risk by
                                            creating a business continuity plan. it helps to identify and control the risk in
                                            advance; reduce the potential loss in the midst of the risk; and rapidly resume
                                            the production and service after the risk event. through the structural
                                            implementations of qisda corporate risk management and bcms, the company
                                            is equipped with the ability to continue its business operations during the event
                                            of major accidents or natural disasters, minimizing the impact from the event
                                            and shorten the time of production halt.

                                    british standard institute (bsi) in november 2007. in response to the challenges
                                    posed by the reorganization of the company and its product lines, growing
                                    customer demands for bcm auditing and ever increasingly complicated risks,
                                    since 2010, qisda has started updating or creating new bcm plans to ensure
                                    the bcm system is incompliance with bs 25999 international requirements
                                         in addition to the establishment of bcm plans, qisda conducts regular
                                    bcm restoration drills in suzhou, china, in order to achieve the goal of
                                    production recovery through scenario-based practices and tests. through
                                    constant revisiting the flow in the restoration plans, scheduled updates of
                                    the documentation, as well as field tests and drills, qisda is able to envision
                                    and resume the operations of business continuity management (bcm) when
                                    confronted by a risk.

                                        qisda follows the benq group policy and established emergency
                                    response joint defense mechanism to incorporate damage control procedures
                                    and educational trainings to enhance its organizational ability in responding to
                                    emergent situations. through administering corporate-wide emergency drills,
                                    employees learn to master the steps of the emergency response process,
                                    and perform emergency management tasks, such as checking the manpower,
                                    equipments, and transportation arrangements, and releasing/receiving
                                    equipments during the emergency. in 2011, qisda conducted a fire drill in the
                                    fuel storage area of its suzhou manufacturing site.
                                        this implementation allowed qisda to examine and analyze the strength
                                    and weakness of both hardware and software utilized in the process, so as to
                                    make improvement plans based on the findings. meanwhile, to achieve the goal
                                    of risk prevention, each subsidiary also shares experience and best practices
                                    through the platform of emergency response joint defense.
