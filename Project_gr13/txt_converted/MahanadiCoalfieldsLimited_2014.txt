    statement from the chairman
              cum managing director




               dear stakeholder,

               it is a great pleasure to present to you the sustainability report of
               mahanadi coalfields ltd (mcl) for the reporting period 2013-14.
               it is our third consecutive sustainability report.

               from our first sustainability report published in 2012 to this third
               sustainability report, we have learnt and benefitted from the
               process of reporting thereby establishing an evolved and
               transparent mcl. each year our endeavour has been to improve
               our measurement processes and to increase the levels of our
               disclosures. we are happy that with this report of 2013-14, we
               have managed to achieve the highest level of disclosure by
               adhering to the global reporting initiative’s (gri) g3.1
               application level a. along with the gri mining and metals sector
               supplement (mmss); we have attempted to report fully on our
               performance in economic, environment and social parameters.



                 unearthing growth

               though we fell short of our target production for the reporting
               period 2013-14, we maintained a strong growth momentum for
               the year. for the fifth consecutive year, we have entered the 100
               million club in terms of coal production. mcl has the lowest
               manpower contingent among cil's subsidiaries in the 100
               million club. we are proud to have achieved the highest total
               production of 110.44 mt in the last five years, with a 2.36%
               growth against the previous year. our total coal off-take was
               114.34 mt, an increase of 2.13% over the previous year. we
               increased our growth in ob removal by 6.27% over the previous
               year. however, we were affected by the economic slowdown in
               the country, resulting in a decline in gross revenue of `13165.61
               crores as against `13190.42 crores in the previous year.

statement from the chairman cum managing director

  unearthing green

progressing on our journey towards sustainable mining, we adopted new technologies and made
capital investments to develop our logistical infrastructure. with the objective of mitigating climate
change and in our quest for dust and blast free mining, we have increased the use of surface miners
in all our mines. 78.29% of our total coal production has been achieved through the use of surface
miners, translating into 100082.54 tonnes of co2 emission reduction annually. to ease the logistical
hindrance of coal dispatch along with reduction of dust pollution and mitigation of carbon emission,
we have undertaken big projects to increase transport of coal through railways and use new
technology in coal dispatch. we have planned and approved a capital investment of `469.68 crores in
the construction of the gopalpur tract - a 52 km long railway track from basundhara area (ib valley
coalfield) to jharsuguda railway station together with the se railways. two mous were signed
between mcl and se railways for land acquisition and construction of the railway line. with the
expectation of increasing the rake movement capacity of talcher coalfield, we initiated the
construction of kalinga-angul link railway line. this apart, 10 rapid loading systems (silo) will be
constructed across 10 different projects, which will significantly increase the rate of coal dispatch.

we took a strategic approach to reducing our carbon footprint by focussing on the use of technology
in mining and harnessing energy efficient resources. the total energy saved over the last reporting
period was 68260.78 gj of which the energy saved due to reduction in fuel consumption was
15811.73 gj and the energy saved due to reduction in electricity consumption was 52449.05 gj. we
also achieved savings of 501 gj of energy with monetary savings of `774951/- through installation of
led lamps in the mining areas and installation of capacitor banks in the substations. we also applied
for the energy management system (enms) of iso 50001 in the subsequent reporting period of
2014-15, to help us in rationalizing our consumption of energy.

aligning ourselves to the renewable energy policy, of both the government of india and coal india
ltd, we initiated the commissioning of a 2mw photo voltaic solar power plant at mcl hq, anand
vihar, sambalpur. this is the first mega watt scale solar project among all subsidiaries of coal india
limited.



  unearthing smiles

we believe it is our duty to build relationships and spread smiles amongst the communities
surrounding our operations. as a socially responsible company, mcl invests its resources towards
the socio-economic upliftment of the society, as per its csr policy. for the reporting period, mcl
spent `111.48 crores, which is almost 3.08% of its pat (`3624.30 crores) in csr activities, focussing
on key areas of education, drinking water supply, sports, infrastructure development amongst other
activities. some of the major csr initiatives undertaken were widening the road from two lanes to
four lanes from bankibahal in bg area to kanika railways siding through district authority; widening
and strengthening of balinga taparia road in three phases; providing power supply of 11 kva/415
volts to 5 villages in sundergarh etc. in addition to the medical facilities provided through our existing
central hospitals, medical clinics and health camps, we are also investing in developing healthcare
professionals in the region by establishing a medical college at talcher, mahanadi institute of medical
science and research. this college will have an annual intake of 100 students. we also established
the general nursing midwifery training school, in the premises of central hospital, ib valley, which
will take in 20 students annually.
                                                                        csr and sustainability report 2013-14 pg 06

statement from the chairman cum managing director
we are also committed to strengthen the sports culture in odisha through sports infrastructure
development and have enabled the construction of the stadium in jharsuguda through the district
authority. we continued our efforts to enable land oustees to have a better standard of living and
provided employment to 773 project affected people (paps) during fy 2013-14 as per the r&r
policy. we have also introduced new schemes to encourage paps to form co-operative societies and
develop them as our ancillary vendors.

we are emphasising on a safe and enriching environment for our workforce. for this, we organised
various training and safety programmes. all the six underground mines of mcl are fatal free during
fy 2013-14. zero fatality in underground mines is achieved in succession since last six years. no
fatal and serious injuries have occurred in 12 ocps of mcl out of its 16 ocps during fy 2013-14.
this is due to our sustained efforts towards achieving zero accident rates. this includes adopting
multi pronged strategies like preparation and implementation of safety management plan in each of
the mine, critical and in depth analysis of each and every accident, regular safety audit, regular
organization of safety drives like monthly safety day, annual mines safety fortnight, involvement of
workers representatives in various safety forums like pit safety committee meetings, annual bipartite
& tripartite meeting. and yet, despite all our efforts and strong resolve to achieve a zero-accident
mcl, we were saddened with the loss of a precious human life during the reporting period. we have
therefore renewed our efforts to provide a zero accident environment through training, r&d and
monitoring of our operational practices. we introduced few technological interventions to enhance
the safety and work standards like use of ripper dozer for ob removal and surface miners for coal
extraction and use of sdls and lhds in ug mines. we also plan to install man riding systems in all
the underground mines to help reduce the strenuous ‘walking’ and transit time of our workers.

this journey towards unearthing growth and smiles will be long and arduous. and we need the
support of our stakeholders to reach our goals. i therefore request you, to read this report and give
your valuable feedback, which will help us improve the quality of reporting and further our
sustainability journey to unearthing progress for our country.

  unearthing stakeholder value
              at mcl, we consider stakeholder engagement as an essential
              aspect of ‘corporate governance’. we not only value the
              opinions and insights of our stakeholders but also rely on them
              to help shape our sustainability programme. hence, while
              developing this report too, we continued to proactively engage
              with stakeholders.

              it is in our interest that we engage with various stakeholders
              periodically to navigate and address the critical issues and
              concerns through various channels. the needs and concerns of
              our diverse stakeholder group is analysed to create effective
              communication channels accordingly. during the reporting
              period, 27 meetings were held with consumers, vendors and
              villagers to get their feedback in the context of social,
              economical and environmental sustainability of mcl.

              the details of engagement mode, frequency and key issues
              with each of the stakeholder groups are provided in the following
              table.

           our philosophy
           at mcl, we recognise that true sustainability cannot succeed in
           isolation and therefore the sustainability strategy has been
           integrated in our business strategy. it is our understanding that a
           sound corporate governance practice enhances stakeholder
           value and by conducting the company's affairs with integrity, the
           long-term sustainability of the business is ensured. we believe
           that the crux of sound corporate governance is in 'performance
           with integrity'- a critical component in enhancing and retaining
           stakeholder trust.

           as india revamps its policies and legislation, we at mcl, strive
           to be in-line or a step ahead of the times. we are proactively
           addressing emerging challenges across issues related to
           environment, society and corporate governance.

           keeping with the current times we have integrated corporate
           governance as a business philosophy to ensure transparency
           and enhanced corporate sustainability.

risk management
enterprises face a growing range of risks - environmental, social and political. an effective risk
management process is ensured by giving due importance to risk identification, assessment and its
control across our different functional areas. we regularly undertake necessary control measures
because of risks, both- external and internal.

acquisition of land, forest clearance, land oustee problems are some of the critical factors which we
monitor continuously. due importance is also given to the internal factors such as preventive
maintenance of machinery, security, industrial relations, etc., for ensuring smooth operations. we
have a separate sub-committee of the board at an apex level for reviewing the functioning of the risk
management mechanism.

key risks
   delay in obtaining forestry clearance and environmental clearance

   land acquisition and consequent social displacement
   demand of employment beyond the prescribed norms resulting in frequent law and order
    problem and obstruction of mining and coal transportation operation
   long lead time to procure hemms and other e&m items
   proneness of open cast mining to environmental pollution
   inadequacy of railways in coal transportation
   majority of consumers are far away from coalfield, i.e. increase in rail freight, leading to high
    cost to the consumers
   moef stipulation for use of 34% ash content coal (mostly available in mcl) by power houses
    beyond 500 km
   the thermal based power plants (tpps) located at coasts have option to use imported coal

  whistle blower policy


as a conscious and vigilant organization, we at mcl believe in the conduct of the affairs of its
constituents in a fair and transparent manner, by adopting the highest standards of professionalism,
honesty, integrity and ethical behaviour. in its endeavour to provide its employee a secure and a
fearless working environment, we will soon be establishing an adaptable version of coal india ltd's
whistle blower policy.

personnel, a copy of which is available on our website www.mcl.gov.in.




  communication with the stakeholders


investors are increasingly aware that environmental, social and governance factors can have an
impact on long-term stakeholder value. we are not only committed to a high level of sustainable
performance, but also to engaging with stakeholders to identify and address potential risks to the
company’s long-term sustainability.

our annual general meeting creates an environment for in-depth interaction with our stakeholders.
the details of our operational and financial performance are published in leading english newspapers
and also in local dailies. in addition, we post regular updates about the company and our annual

                       achieved highest total production of 110.44 mt in
                       the last five years
                       (open-cast mines - 109.01 mt; underground mines -
                       1.43 mt)
                       2.36% increase as against last financial year

                       coal off-take
                       total coal off-take of 114.34 mt

                       successful inclusion in 100 million club for the
                       fifth time in terms of coal production. mcl has the
                       lowest manpower contingent among cil's
                       subsidiaries in the 100 million club.

            production performance
            we understand that the growth of the nation is directly
            proportional to the growth of the company. as an organization
            we are only as strong as the areas we serve. our employees
            and the management work in collaboration to improve the
            performance of the company each year, which has been on an
            increasing trend.



                         production of coal though open-cast mines:
                         109.01 mt
                         total production achieved – 110 mt
                         2.36% growth as against 2012-13




             production of coal though underground mines:
             1.43 mt
             profit before tax (pbt): `5429.08 crore



            the revenue generated shows a negative trend due to decrease
            in price of e-auction sale of coal, idle cost of resources for delay
            in land acquisition, r&r issues and delay in environment/
            forestry clearances. also due to increase in contractors wages,
            hike in diesel price and higher compensation packages added
            to the cost.

                    systemic improvements in vigilance practices




               ethics
               and transparency


              at mcl, the foundation of our strategy is our unwavering
              commitment to values and integrity. all employees are expected
              to behave ethically and in compliance with the mcl code of
              conduct and policies. we believe, ethics and compliance
              training is an important part of creating a strong culture at mcl.
              we are determined to be known for our high ethical standards
              and our commitment to transparency and openness. we have
              zero tolerance for corruption in our operations. at mcl, how we
              deliver is as important as what we deliver. our commitment to
              ethics and transparency is integral to how we conduct our
              business and vital to ensuring that the wealth derived from the
              energy we produce is put to effective and equitable use. our
              value statement, together with the ethics and code of conduct,
              constitutes the basis and framework for our performance
              culture.

              protecting and respecting human rights is central to our
              everyday business operations. we respect the human rights of
              all our stakeholders and hence, consider human rights across
              all aspects of our operations which would eventually reflect in
              the sustainability of our organization. we are committed to
              achieve the highest standards of business integrity, ethical
              values and professionalism in all our activities. we adhere to the
              mines act, 1952, for preventing child labour. as per this act,
              employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine is
              prohibited. we follow proper checks and audits as per the act, to
              ensure no child is employed in the mines, including medical
              examinations for age proof. a clause has also been introduced
              in all our contracts as per child labour prohibition and
              regulation act, 1986, to prevent child labour in contractual
              assignments. we continually sensitize our employees about
              their rights by conducting workshops and seminars covering
              these topics, however, we do not have any formal training for our
              employees or security personnel on human rights. we also
              discourage forced and compulsory labour in all our operations
              as well as discourage our suppliers and contractors to adopt
              forced or compulsory labour.

unearthing transparency
although, we do not have an exclusive human rights policy, we respect ilo and other international
charters on social and labour issues in-line with our corporate governance policy. currently, our
parent company, coal india ltd, is evaluating a comprehensive and robust human rights policy,
which will also be followed by us, when implemented. as a public sector undertaking (psu), mcl falls
under the right to information act (rti) and our activities including our supplier contracts are open to
audit by c&ag, cvc, cbi etc. all major contracts are awarded through the e-tender system.

we abide by the labour law act to uphold the dignity of our workers. few of our operations are
adjacent to indigenous people communities, however, there has been no incident or violation related
to human rights of the indigenous people during the reporting period.

attempts to combat corruption and ensure ethical practices become possible through effective
vigilance. during the period, 31 inspections, including routine and surprise inspections, have been
made by the vigilance team in various establishments/projects of mcl including diesel consumption,
coal quality, security deployment, coal transportation, local purchase/ emergency purchase and
public procurements. necessary disciplinary actions were initiated /proposed against 29 officials of
mcl.

our major thrust during reporting period of 2013-14 has been to inculcate technology in our vigilance
administration. our successful attempts at ensuring transparency in our endeavours included:
   installation of rfid assisted in-motion road weighbridges to keep track of internal colliery
    transport
   auto-refund of earnest money deposit (emd) to unsuccessful bidders by e-mode
   on-line bill payment status on coal net
   implementation of fully operational gps based oitds (operator independent truck despatch
    system) for ob removal
   installation of geo-fencing to keep track of vehicles transporting coal
   installation of “gps based vehicle tracking system” in contractual water tankers engaged for
    supply of drinking water to peripheral villages as part of csr programme
                                                                       csr and sustainability report 2013-14 pg 26

unearthing transparency
we also attempted systemic improvements in our existing practices to prevent corruption and further
assist the company to achieve our goals and objectives in an ethical manner. few initiatives
encompassing technology interventions onsite and towards streamlining official transactions were:
     introduction of timely completion of procurement process within the original bid validity period
     amendment in dop (delegation of power) of the project officers for timely closure of petty
     contracts
     introduction of uniform selection criteria for recruitment of clerical grade employees
     appropriate measures taken for procurement of 3d laser system/surpac total station for
     coal stock measurement
     amendment in e-procurement module of mcl for online withdrawal of bids at any point of time
     implementation of pis (personal information system) module

most of these initiatives have resulted in expediting official transactions and proved to be effective for
grievance redressal of our stakeholders. the “gps based vehicle tracking system” have also
fetched us monetary savings of `78.69 lakhs in contractual payments within one year of
implementation.

we continuously spread the concept of anti-corruption and encourage ethical practices throughout
our company. we observed vigilance awareness week-2013 from 28th october to 2nd november as
per directives received from the central vigilance commission, new delhi. the theme for this year
was “promoting good governance – positive contribution of vigilance”, a seminar was conducted on
this topic. the seminar was successful with one of the delegates who attended the programme being
a representative of transparency international india, new delhi. following this, an interactive one
day workshop on integrity pact was conducted including the major stakeholders of the business, viz,
employees (all levels), contractors, suppliers and bidders. the workshop served as a good platform
for identifying problems encountered by these stakeholders at the grass root level and corresponding
mitigative measures were also discussed. we also extended our campaigns to the local community
by mode of displaying banners on anti-corruption in strategic public areas. messages were also
circulated through bsnl to promote awareness against corruption. two debate competitions were
conducted for 6 schools at sambalpur on “ethics and moral education – a tool to fight corruption”
(for class-vii & viii) and “value based education is a need for the country to curb corruption” (for
class-ix & x). this was followed by prize distribution to students to encourage their participation and
involvement. during the reporting period 2013-14, 13% of employees were trained on anti-corruption
policies and procedures.

  diversity and
  equal opportunity


we do not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, religion, caste. we believe in the principle of
participative management of employees and encourage our employees to participate in all major
discussions about the company. we recognise the importance of gender sensitivity and take special
care for protecting the interests of our women employees and addressing issues/ grievances raised
by them. we provide our women employees with the best opportunities at work and encourage
networking and information exchange. various trainings and seminars are organised that focus on
promoting the development and growth of women and empower them to take confident business
decisions. our women employees also participate in the women in public sector forum (wips).

for salary/ wages we follow the national coal wage agreement (ncwa) for non-executives and
specified pay scales for executive employees. there is no discrimination in remuneration amongst
employees based on gender and the ratio of basic salary of men to women is 1:1. there were no
cases of discrimination based on race/colour, gender, religion, political opinion or social origin
reported at mcl during the reporting period.




  learning
  and development

our commitment to employee development is built on our strong, inclusive culture of collaboration,
experiential learning and meritocracy. we believe that when one person grows and improves, we all
grow and improve and together, we all rise. it has always been our endeavour to encourage our
employees to realise and develop their full potential through a continuous learning environment. we
believe that effective training and development benefits the individual and organization as a whole,
and contributes to the achievement of the objectives of the company. our hrd plans an umbrella of
strategic training programmes which are imparted through our three in-house training centres
namely, management training institute (mti), burla; belpahar training institute (bti), belpahar and
mining, engineering and excavation training institute (meeti), talcher and 5 vocational training
centres. we train our personnel in-house as well as encourage them to seek training from reputed
institutes. training is imparted at all levels from workers to board members. we also impart
specialised trainings on project management, contract management, risk management,
environmental management etc. these training programmes undertaken by the employees prepare
them for post mine closure scenario.

the training module
at mcl, we follow 3 different types of training modules designed to cater to specific needs as per
requirement.


                       technical: to develop technical skills of employees and train them
                            in use of latest technology related to mining and future




three programmes have been specially designed and implemented:
    executive programme: developing management skills and functional skills
    supervisors’ programme: enabling skill up-gradation of supervisors & educating supervisors
     on safety management
    workers’ programme: enabling skill up-gradation of workers (e.g.hemm) and safety
     awareness

computer awareness programme is integrated in each of these programmes. apart from this, we
have also decided to set up a state-of-the-art centre for management development in bhubaneswar,
to create a platform for executives to get trained and be prepared for future leadership positions, on a
continual basis. during the year 2013-14, 1082 employees were sent to various external training
programmes.

we also send few of our retiring employees to specific training programmes before their retirement
which would help them balance their non-working life post retirement. during the reporting period
2013-14, three executives were nominated to attend such programmes.

business year, managers and employees agree on their key performance indicators. at the end of the
business year a performance appraisal is conducted. individual development plans form part of the
performance management system. during the reporting period, performance appraisals were
received by 99.93% of the employees.

employees can enjoy maximum benefits of their work with our organization- whilst and after. we
provide life insurance scheme to all wage board employees covered under ncwa. we also provide
health care benefits to both permanent and temporary employees at all regions. the full-time
employees enjoy benefit plans such as provident fund, family pension fund, annuity fund,
parental leave, retirement provision and stock ownership. during the year 2013-14, four female
executives and four female non-executives availed parental leave and the return to work and
retention rates after availing parental leave was 100%.

  employee
  representation

we enjoy a harmonious relation with the labour unions. we strongly believe that harmony between
management and employees is pivotal in achieving higher growth and maintaining good industrial
relations (ir). the efforts of all our four operating trade unions has been remarkable for maintaining
high standards of industrial relations with the management. 91.57% of our employees are covered
under collective bargaining agreement. any significant change in the operations which would affect
the employees including the minimum number of weeks is discussed in jcc meetings held
periodically.

trade union representatives are nominated by operating trade unions (covered under ir system) to
the jcc, safety and welfare board. we meet and brainstorm with the operating trade union
representatives to discuss and resolve burning issues as well as to focus on our future course of
action. in the reporting period of 2013-14, more than 300 meetings were held with the union
representatives. these meetings covered ir, welfare, safety, jcc etc. at company level/ area
level/ project level. the participatory involvement of the union members has accounted for no strikes
or lockouts during the reporting period.




  grievance
  redressal

we try and ensure a fair, expedient and equitable treatment of all employees and provide a
mechanism for the acceptable solution for their problems by minimizing potential causes of employee
dissatisfaction. this is our major strategy adopted for sorting out employee grievances in the joint
meetings with the union representatives and the employees. in addition, grievances of employees
belonging to sc/st communities are resolved in meetings with coal india schedule
caste/scheduled tribe employees’ association (cistea) held at area/ head quarters.
                                                                     csr and sustainability report 2013-14 pg 36

  unearthing safety and health
              our operations are built upon a culture of healthy and safe work
              environment. we believe that the safe delivery of projects and
              operational facilities is critical for our success. we have a goal of
              delivering our business with zero harm to our people. we seek
              continuously to improve our safety performance. this is an
              integral part of our business philosophy and is in-line with our
              health and safety policies, standards and working procedures.
              we have a well-established and comprehensive safety, health,
              environment and quality standards that underline our
              commitment to create a healthy, hygienic and injury-free
              workplace. we have an integrated management system (ims)
              accredited with ohsas 18001:2007 - occupational health and
              safety management; iso 9001:2008 – quality management
              system; iso 14001:2004 – environmental management
              system.

              safety is a collectively achieved state of well-being and we
              encourage participation of every individual employee in
              contributing to ideation, implementation and monitoring of safe
              and healthy practices at the workplace. safety is a priority at mcl
              and safety training is a primary and integral part of our
              operations. emphasis on safe production processes is laid down
              in our formal agreements with employee unions. to ensure
              higher standard of safety for our employees we have
              implemented relevant statutory rules encompassing health and
              safety included in the provisions of mines act, 1952; mine rule,
              1955 and coal mines regulations, 1957.

all the employees are provided and insisted to use safety gadgets, such as, helmets, safety foot
wears, fluorescent jackets, ear muffs, goggles, gloves etc. to provide protection against conditions in
the mining areas. dgms approved make safety equipments are procured from reputed companies
based on requirements set to the highest standards. we have also appointed sufficient statutory
personnel for supervision of workmen so as to ensure their safety. regular safety audits are
conducted both by the internal safety audit team as well as by external agencies. we also review the
safety management plans of our units. during 2013-14, the safety management plan of lingaraj
ocp, bharatpur ocp, kaniha ocp, talcher ug and nandira ug have been prepared and reviewed.
we believe in creating a trained workforce. hence, during 2013-14, 12 dumper operators have been
trained on the simulator at ncl. based on requirement, sometimes training is also imparted in
external organizations. we explore safety components throughout our operations and identify areas
of improvement. by systematic r&d studies, we try to establish scientific facts which guide us to plan
and execute processes considering safety measures. awareness programmes on safety in mining

unearthing safety and health
safety committees
we have a well defined structure and mechanism to keep track of safety aspects in our operations.
the structure comprises of several committees which operate at all levels.

the safety committees operate at different levels:

at national level or parliamentary level:

   § standing committee on safety in coal mines
   § national safety conference
   § various parliamentary committee on safety

at cil hq level:

   § cil safety board
   § national dust prevention committee

at subsidiary hq level:

   § bipartite/ tripartite safety committee: inspection and advising on corrective measures by
        safety board constituted at subsidiary level

at area level:

   §  bipartite/ tripartite safety committee: inspection and advising on corrective measures by
        safety board constituted at area level

at mine level:

   § workman inspectors as per mine rule, 1955
   § pit safety committee constituted as per mine rule, 1955
   § statutory supervisory personnel

these committees monitor the safety events and also provide advice on occupational health and
safety. the above-mentioned bipartite and tripartite committees are actively involved in assisting
the management to take certain decisions and resolve problems. they also conduct health and
safety programmes involving all employees including union representatives. health and safety
aspects are also covered in formal agreement with unions based on national coal wage agreement
ix. 4.89% of total workforce is represented in formal joint management-worker health & safety
committee.

    technological interventions as safety measures
    we continuously upgrade our technology to meet the required safety standard for our employees.
    few technological interventions which have helped to secure the life of our employees include:

        use of surface miners for coal extraction (blast free and pollution free technology)
        
        use of ripper dozer for ob removal (blast free and pollution free technology)
        
        establishment of environmental telemonitoring system in ug mines (real-time monitoring of
        
        noxious gases)
        installation of oitds (operator independent truck dispatch system) has helped in keeping
        
        track of movement of tippers and dumpers
        installation of man riding systems in ug mines (reduce transit time of workers)
        
        use of sdls and lhds in ug mines (eliminates manual loading of coal)
        
        introduction of udms in ug mines (eliminates manual drilling)
        

    mine rescue stations
    we have fully equipped all our rescue stations and have deployed sufficient rescue trained workforce
    to further overcome any un-anticipated happening during mining operations. during the reporting
    period, sophisticated safety instruments, such as, closed circuit positive pressure self contained
    breathing apparatus (78 nos.), testing machines (4 nos.) and self contained oxygen type self
    rescuer for ug mines (1202 nos.) were procured at our mines rescue stations at orient area &
    talcher area. we firmly believe that safety and productivity cannot be separated and we try to strike a
    fine balance between production as well as safety at the work place.

unearthing safety and health


  occupational
  health

extensive risk management to identify and assess the potential risks and shape a healthy working
environment is the key element of our activities in the area of occupational health and safety. for us,
sustainability implies ensuring employees follow sustainable practices in their personal lives too. this
means taking care of their health, practicing safety, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. at
mcl, we have introduced several initiatives that help employees achieve this balance.


medical checkups
regular medical checkups are conducted for all our employees.
 initial medical examination (ime): this is conducted for every person seeking employment in a
  mine, unless such a person has already undergone this examination within the preceding five
  years, while in employment at another mine.

periodic medical examination (pme): this is also conducted for every person employed in the

  mine at intervals of not more than five years. the frequency of pme has been brought down from
  existing 5 years to 3 years for the mining employees above 45 years of age, as decided in the 10th
  safety conference.


preventive health programmes
the health centres at talcher, ib valley and hq conduct several health camps/ programmes as a
precautionary measure. these camps definitely help in alleviating severe health conditions. they
also act as an indirect route for creating awareness about the dreadful diseases, such as, cancer and
aids. during 2013-14, a total of 260 such medical camps were conducted and about 23240
beneficiaries participated in these camps. the various camps conducted include general health
awareness camps (50), diagnostic camps (14), cancer detection camp (1), aids awareness camps
(13), eye camps (8), family welfare programmes (5) and routine health camps (169).

unearthing green
throughout the life cycle of our mining operations, we aim to manage environmental impacts and
address any related impacts on the planet and local communities. mcl values its role in sustainable
development and will manage all aspects of its activities to consider environmental, economic and
social benefits. the values of the company steer us towards a long-term growth that is sustainable,
contributing to the development of the nation and minimising the impact of our operations on the
planet. our directors and the management are committed to follow a triple-bottom line approach
aiming at continual improvement in the environmental management of the company’s operations.

all our mining operations are certified for iso 14001:2004 (as mentioned in chapter- unearthing
safety and health) for managing the environmental concerns. with robust systems and a full-fledged
environment management team to plan, implement and monitor environment management
programmes, we at mcl have entrusted the laboratories of central mine planning and design
institute (cmpdi), to carry out routine environmental monitoring of air, water and noise periodically.
the methodology and frequency of monitoring are strictly maintained as per the guidelines laid down
by the central pollution control board (cpcb). results of monitoring are submitted to state pollution
control board (spcb) and ministry of environment and forests (moef) as per the statute and
uploaded on monthly basis on the company website: www.mcl.gov.in/environment/env_year.php

our focus areas for mitigation of environmental impacts of our activities are:
  • energy conservation
  • pollution control measures
  • water management
  • carbon mitigation
  • biodiversity

energy and water consumption play an important part in the cost of production as well as our moral
responsibility of conserving natural resources for the future. energy and water targets are always
part of our business plan exercises and we aim to reduce our consumption on continual basis.
climate change is a significant challenge to us as the mining sector and climate change have a close
dependency. we recognise that we have a responsibility to constructively engage on climate change
issues and play an important role in contributing towards global greenhouse reduction.

during the reporting period, no significant fines were levied on us due to environmental impacts of
our activities.

   raw materials


the major raw materials utilised for mining out coal are explosives and detonators etc. during the
reporting period, 37275.73 tonnes of explosives and 1328819.12 lakh nos. of detonators were used.
apart from this, 44414508 l of high speed diesel (hsd) was used in our departmental heavy earth
moving machinery (hemms) for coal production. the departmental hemms deployed during
extraction process were draglines (4), shovels (87), surface miners (14), dumpers (363), dozers
(116), drills (94), loading machines (28), graders (31), water sprinklers (60) and cranes (46) .the
overburden material excavated during opencast mining of coal is backfilled into the decoaled mine
voids. ob removal, coal production and backfilling of mine voids are carried out concurrently. more
details on overburden management are provided in the section -waste management.

as we are not manufacturing any product which requires raw materials for production, we have
limited scope for use of recycled input materials.

energy saving initiatives
during the reporting period 2013-14, we attempted to reduce consumption of both our direct and
indirect energy. our focus was to evaluate our existing systems and improve them leading to overall
reduction of energy consumption.

reduction in fuel and lubricant consumption
we attempted to reduce our annual fuel and lubricant consumption by streamlining our regular
maintenance procedures, such as, periodic overhauling of engines, regular checking of filters, hoses
& tyre pressure; regular checking of self-starters; introduction of maintenance free batteries and
regular maintenance of haul roads. we also abided by the norms fixed by cmpdi for specific diesel
consumption and implemented guidelines issued by ied for minimum hsd consumption.

reduction in electricity consumption
few electricity saving initiatives were implemented in the reporting period through installation of led
lamps in the mining areas and installation of capacitor banks in the substations to improve power
factors which led to energy savings to the amount of 501.55 gj, and monetary savings of `774951.

a total of 513 led street lights and 6456 led tubelights were installed during the reporting period
2013-14 in different areas of mcl hq, jagannath area and orient area. furthermore, capacitor
banks were installed at the 132/33 kv jorabaga and nandira substations, and a 2x300 kvar power
capacitor supplied at orient area. a bigger energy saver soft starter project for the installation of 10
vfd drives for motors at chp of balaram ocp has been approved and the tendering process has
been initiated.

our approach towards reducing carbon footprint involves:
    creating a more energy efficient mcl (please refer to above energy saving initiatives for details)
    mitigating the impact of blasting and drilling through use of surface miner technology
     (eliminating carbon footprint at source)
    mitigating the overall impact of emissions of our operations through afforestation


surface miner technology
conventional coal mining technology, involves tedious blasting, drilling and crushing operations
which lead to ghg emissions. hence, we have adopted a more modern and sustainable mining
technology- surface miners (sms), which are an eco-friendly replacement for the abovementioned
operations involved in coal production in open cast mines. the sms reduce the overall carbon
footprint of the process by eliminating these operational stages during production of coal. this
technology also enables selective mining of coal and stone layers which reduces the ash content in
the coal produced. as a result, the volume of coal transported is reduced and there is reduction of co2
emission due to transportation. during the reporting period, 78.29% of coal production (86.46 mt)
has been through surface miner technology, translating to reduction of co2 emission by 100082.54
tonnes.


green belt development
we have successfully implemented plantation drives across all our operations and have planted 47.9
lakhs saplings since inception. plantations have been done on ob dumps; along the roads; in the
residential townships and even in our office premises. total reduction in co2 emission due to
plantation activities, on an average has been estimated to be 20 kg/tree/year, which translates to total
co2 emission reduction of 95800 tonnes/year.

air pollution, especially dust, is a major environmental
issue in the coal mining areas.

a list of potential activities responsible for generation of
particulate matter includes:
     loading operations of ob at face
     transportation on haul roads                                                       active

     cutting and loading operations of coal at face
     heavy vehicles plying on coal transportation road
                                                                                       sources
     unloading & loading operations of coal at railway               coal handling       of                coal
                                                                                                       transportation

non-mining related activities also cause generation of
particulate matter, like, agriculture and agricultural waste
burning; activities in the residential areas, like, coal
                                                                                         railway

road – two wheeler vehicles and multi utility vehicles
(muvs); natural sources such as wind-blown dust.

the amount of dust formation and emission is dependent on several site-specific variables, like, the
type and size of equipment in use, topography, vegetation cover, characteristics of the rock or soil
material, wind speed in the region, the size of the machinery or transport equipment speed of the
vehicle, frequency of vehicle movement, etc.

the quality of air in and around the mines is monitored every fortnight as per environment
(protection) amendment rule. the total estimation of tpm at our operations for the year 2013-14 is
7823.31 tonnes at talcher coalfield and 8503.64 tonnes at ib valley coalfield. during the reporting
period, monitoring, analysis and source apportionment study (receptor modelling using cmb 8.2) of
particulate matter (pm10) was conducted around bhubaneswari ocp of talcher coalfield. the study
confirmed that the average pm10 mass concentration ranged from 140- 184 g/m3. other air pollutants
like so2, nox, co2, etc, are recorded far below the statutory norms in mcl.

however, we continuously focus on mitigation measures for reducing air emissions, as listed below:
 use of surface miners to eliminate dust generated due to drilling and blasting operations
 use of railways for 85-90% of coal transportation to prevent dust generation associated with truck
  transport
 establishment of silo loading system for coal despatch to reduce dust emission at loading sites
 installation of covered belt conveyors at bharatpur chp and jagannath chp to prevent dust
  emission during transportation
 covering of all road sale trucks leaving the mine premises in all areas
 construction of black top/ metal top/concrete coal transport roads and haul roads with provision for
  dozer, wheeled dozer and graders for maintenance of roads and control of dust pollution
 installation of water sprinkling facilities
     § water sprinklers at 18 sidings
     § water sprinklers at all chps
     § mobile water tankers of capacity 28 kl,20 kl, 12 kl and 10 kl operating on coal/ob
       transportation roads
 installation of dust extractors in all drilling machines and practice of wet drilling encouraged in all
  mines
 regular sweeping of roads accomplished by
     § use of truck mounted-mechanical road sweepers at talcher coalfield
     § manual sweeping in all mines
 ban on coal supply as domestic fuel and all employees provided with lpg

apart from the above mentioned mitigation measures adopted, we are also constructing exclusive
coal transport corridors at several sites to eliminate the impact of dust pollution on the nearby
communities.

  noise pollution
  and ground vibration

controlling noise pollution and ground vibration generated during mining is a key challenge and
concern to mcl. mining activities, such as, drilling and blasting, operation and maintenance of
hemms, loading and unloading, transportation, crushing at chp and loading at sidings are the major
sources of high noise levels. hence, we are keen on adopting adequate measures to cope with high
noise levels.

we are one of the pioneers in india in introduction of blastless, modern mining technology, such as,
surface miner technology and ripper dozers. controlled blasting system and use of non-electric
detonators have also been effective in curbing the noise pollution and ground vibration. further, we
also ensure that all hemms are provided with adequate noise level reduction technologies. as
already mentioned in the safety section, we provide all our workers working at high noise-level areas
with ear muffs and ear plugs. more initiatives like green belt development between residential areas
and the mines have also helped in reducing the impact of noise on the surrounding areas. few more
initiatives for curbing noise are:
     • provision of sound proof enclosures of chp and crusher where operator seat is located
     • proper maintenance of equipment by oiling and greasing

in the wake of global water availability challenges due to climate change, we constantly strive for
sustainable usage of water and mitigate the impacts of our mining activities on the water regime.
since past few years, we have ventured into innovative water management practices to meet our
water demand. our approach to water management embarks on innovation of our processes for
reduced usage of fresh water, efficient water storage and maximising water recycling.

during the reporting period, 26182.28 million litres of fresh water were withdrawn from surface water
sources for our mining operations. the amount of underground mine water recycled at our facilities is
64198.67 million litres (71.03 % of total mine water used). by employing these practices, we try to
maintain a balance between what is needed for our business and what is good for the environment.

the major sources of water include river water and pumped out mine water. there has been only a
marginal reduction in the consumption of water for domestic and industrial purposes as seen from
previous years. water recycled after being pumped from underground sources is used for mining
operations, such as, dust suppression or fire fighting and also supplied as drinking water to
surrounding villages. the water is adequately treated before supply in the water treatment plants
(wtps) operational in talcher, ib valley, belpahar and basundhara, under integrated water supply
scheme (iwss). surface water sources are not affected due to the withdrawal of water for our
operations.

water conservation initiatives
we try to conserve water by transforming the mine voids as natural water harvesting structures and
by recycling the underground mine water.

mine voids as natural water harvesting & sedimentation ponds: decoaled mine voids are

  structures created on a continual basis after excavation. since we have a low stripping ratio,
  about 40 to 50% of the quarry used for mining purpose results in mine voids. we, at mcl, make
  complete utilization of these voids for water conservation and preventing water pollution.

     §water storage: these voids act as a collection point for strata seepage water. rain water is
        also collected in these huge voids during rainy season. water from ob dumps, coal stock
        yards and other catchment areas are also channelized through garland drains and catch
        drains to these natural mine voids.

     §groundwater recharge: the underground water table gets recharged due to accumulation
        of rain water in these huge voids and control of surface run off.

     §pollution control: these mine voids act as sedimentation ponds for settling the tss, which
        is usually the only impurity in the collected water.

recycling of underground mine water: water pumped out from underground mines is recycled

  for domestic supply after adequate treatment. small scale water filtration units for the recycled
  underground mine water are operational at talcher and orient areas for domestic supply.

green water management rainwater harvesting
rainwater harvesting is a technique of collection and storage of rain water in surface (storage
tanks) or sub surface aquifer before it is lost as surface runoff. the tapped rainwater can be
effectively utilized for recirculation and usage or for recharging the ground water.

we have initiated three rainwater harvesting projects, one each at orient area, ib valley
area and cws(x), talcher area. in our projects at ib valley and orient area, rainwater is
collected on the roof tops which is then directed to gravity head recharge wells through pvc
pipes. the water from these recharge wells eventually percolates to the subsurface aquifers
through natural infiltration. at cws(x), talcher area, the rainwater is collected from roof tops
and other catchment areas and channelized to drains. through the drains the water flows to
open wells via pvc pipes (8” diameter). the collected water eventually seeps to the
subsurface aquifers from these wells.

on successful implementation of these projects we plan to multiply the effort to all our areas
for effective green water management.

effluent discharge
wastewater is discharged as per regulatory requirements. the run-
off water/ effluents are monitored regularly and are well within the
prescribed limits as per statutory conditions. the water pollution
control measures adopted at mcl are:
     oil and grease traps (ogt): ogts are in place at the hemm
      workshops of opencast mines in order to remove oil and grease
      as well as oily sludge from the wastewater generated from the
      washing ramps after cleaning of the hemms.
     sewage treatment plants (stp): stps have been provided at
      7 townships for treatment of domestic effluent. other colonies
      have provision of settling tank and soak pit. the treated water
      from these stps is re-used for irrigation purposes. the sludge
      generated is used as manure for plantation and gardening in               effluent treatment plant at
      the townships.                                                            bharatpur area,
     garland drains and catch drains: garland drains and catch                 talcher coalfield
      drains are provided around quarry boundary and ob dumps to
      arrest sediments and prevent silting of natural drainage.




  biodiversity


mcl recognises that protecting the environment and maintaining the biological diversity of our planet
is of vital importance to human life. coal mining being site specific, expansion to new regions with
deposits of coal seams is a regular activity. expansion of our activities poses a great challenge to the
biodiversity and hence, we effectively engage with all the stakeholders to arrive at solutions which
have long-lasting benefits to the surrounding biodiversity and as well as the communities.

after removal of ob, once the area is decoaled, the mine voids created are backfilled. due to low
stripping ratio even after backfilling, terminal voids remain in the mines which serve as huge water
reservoirs. these water reservoirs attract the birds and the fauna, besides maintaining the water
table. concurrent biological reclamation by grassing and massive plantation is undertaken by
levelling the backfilled area. within few years of plantation, the area develops into a forest thereby
creating a safe home for wild species. hence, the forest area that was already interfered prior to
mining either, due to illegal settlements or illicit tree felling, poaching, etc., which would have disturbed
the natural habitat, is restored to its previous natural state. besides, other pre-mining non-forest land
like homestead, agricultural, wasteland etc. are also converted to forests and water bodies after the
completion of mining activity in the area.

implementation of conservation plan for protection of flora and fauna are carried out as per ec/fc.
taxonomical enumeration of flora and fauna in the core and buffer zone is made through a recognised
institute. remote sensing satellite data are generated by cmpdil on annual basis (for more than 5
mm3 mines) and once in three years (for less than 5 mm mines of composite production) to help in
                                                             3


assessing the progressive status of mined land reclamation and to take up remedial measures, if any,
required for environmental protection and sustainable development. these studies indicate that there
is no significant impact on biodiversity due to mining activities of the company.

there is no biosphere reserve, national park, wildlife sanctuary and iucn red list species in core
and buffer areas of working mines. some reserve forests are present in core and buffer zones. these
forests are diverted for mining purposes as per the provisions in the forest conservation act 1980.
during the year 2013-14, we acquired 598.77 hectares including forest, non-forest and tenancy
lands.

we do not have a specific biodiversity policy, but the environment policy of cil that we have adopted,
specifically stresses on conservation of biodiversity. we put in sincere efforts to restrict actual mining
to an optimal area which gradually advances and as the de-coaled/mined areas become available,
the backfilling and reclamation activities commence. we acquire land for expansion of mining
activities by providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the affected villagers.

biodiversity protection strategy
mcl has identified two strategic aims to protect the biodiversity:
   land reclamation: to identify methods and create an appropriate framework for reclamation of
    the excavated land
   plantation: to identify opportunities for the creation of new biodiversity that has been lost from
    the mine locality during recent years


land reclamation
during the reporting period, de-coaled voids were backfilled with the overburden material followed by
plantation for biological reclamation. regular monitoring of land use pattern by remote sensing was
conducted for 15 opencast projects, i.e., 11 ocps (production capacity >5 mm3/yr) and 4 ocps
(production capacity <5 mm3/yr). the monitoring studies were executed through cmpdil in both
talcher coalfield and ib valley coalfield. the 11 ocps of production capacity >5 mm3/yr, included, 7
projects in talcher coalfield (ananta, balaram, lingaraj, bharatpur, bhubaneswari, jagannath and
hingula) and 4 projects in ib valley coalfield (belpahar, lakhanpur, samaleswari and lajkura).
during the reporting period, the total excavated area in these 11 ocps was 44.43 km2 and the total
area reclaimed was 28.84 km2. bharatpur ocp topped the list for land reclamation with 78.99%
followed by balaram ocp with 75.56%. the report on land restoration/ reclamation of these ocps
was prepared by cmpdil using data generated by national remote sensing agency. the report has
also been uploaded on the company website.


plantation
plantation has been implemented on external dumps, backfilled internal dumps after adequate
physical reclamation and any other available vacant space including road sides, office premises as
well as residential colonies. as previously mentioned (in sub-section-green belt development), we
have planted approximately 47.90 lakhs saplings since inception (talcher coalfield- 18.61 lakhs, ib
valley coalfield – 28.52 lakhs & hq – 0.77 lakhs). fruit-bearing, timber yielding, flowering, dust
capturing and medicinal species of indigenous origin were selected for plantation in all areas. the
plantation and subsequent maintenance works were executed through through expert govt.
agencies like m/s odisha forest development corporation (ofdc) and m/s chhattisgarh rajya van
vikas nigam limited.

   waste management




waste generation is an unavoidable part of mining operations and we endeavour to minimise its
impact on our surroundings. as part of our regular operations, we produce hazardous wastes (mainly
burnt oil and batteries) and non-hazardous wastes (mainly drill bits, tyres, iron and steel, empty
drums and old vehicles). wastes are collected, stored and disposed off appropriately. none of the
hazardous wastes falling under the terms of the basel convention annex i, ii, iii and viii are
transported, imported, exported or treated at any of mcl’s operations. as part of our focus on
sustainable mining, we attempt to extract maximum resources whilst reducing waste.

bio-medical waste management
at mcl, we adopt the bio-medical waste (management & handling) rules, for all our hospitals and
dispensaries. all the bio-medical waste from these hospitals are collected, treated and disposed
suitably through authorised bio-medical waste operators in compliance with the norms.

overburden management
overburden (ob) is one of the major ‘wastes’ that is generated during the surface mining of coal in
open cast mines. the overburden removed is effectively managed at mcl, by backfilling the same
into the decoaled voids and thereafter following a systematic technical and biological reclamation
process. similar process is also followed for the external overburden dumps. we have embarked on
a systematic scientific study to determine the stability of the high walls of coal, overburden benches
and the overburden dumps for all our open cast mines.

during the reporting period of 2013-14, 96.03 mm3 of overburden was removed as compared to
90.42 mm3 removed in the previous year.

                   (one).
            for us, product responsibility requires a combination of three
            things: the greatest possible customer benefit, the highest safety
            standards, and maximum environmental and climate compatibility.
            to achieve this goal, we focus on environmentally compatible
            mining operations and innovative concepts. we have tried to
            improve the quality of our product by modifying our existing
            practices in conjunction with feedback & complaints received from
            our customers.

            to maintain health and safety standards of our products and
            processes, we conduct quarterly internal audit, bi-annual
            surveillance audit by a certifying agency - ms certification,
            kolkata. the audit process includes physical inspection of the
            location and as well as documentation requirements for the
            compliance covering hazard identification; risk assessment and
            determining controls; legal and other requirements, objectives and
            iso 9001 programme(s); resources, roles, responsibility,
            accountability and authority; competence, training and awareness;
            communication, participation and consultation; operational
            control; emergency preparedness and response; performance
            measuring, monitoring and improvement. all these criteria help us
            in maintaining our coal quality standards. during the year 2013-14,
            no incidents of non-compliance with regard to iso 9001 were
            reported.

                                                      underway.




coal transportation and logistics
coal transportation & logistics is a very important function of coal mining business. movement of
coal from production points to consuming end via different modes of transportation mostly depends
on the established transportation and logistics systems at the mining area and also at the consumers.
technological interventions in transport logistics has been our thrust area for developing a robust
coal market and ensuring energy security of the country. coal dispatch through railways is the
preferred option and we are focussing on investing in developing both rail transport systems as well
as railways siding for safe and easy transport of coal. two such projects are currently underway:

    gopalpur tract: construction of a 52 km long railway track from basundhara area (ib valley
    
    coalfield) to jharsuguda railway station will not only benefit hassle-free transportation of coal,
    but also indirectly benefit the jharsuguda district, as this will establish a long-needed
    passenger transport railway track for the community.
    kalinga-angul link: the construction of kalinga-angul link railway line near the talcher
    
    coalfield is expected to increase the rake movement.

this apart, rapid loading system (silo) would be constructed in 10 different projects which would
significantly increase the rate of coal dispatch. the areas where the rapid loading systems would be
installed include, ananta (15 mt), lingaraj (16 mt), bharatpur (15 mt), bhubaneswari (20 mt),
hingula (15 mt), kaniha (10 mt), balaram (8 mt), kulda (10 mt), mjsj-gopal prasad (15 mt) and
mnh sakti-talabira (20 mt).

coal beneficiation
the indian coal matrix consists of significant ash content interwoven throughout the matrix. hence,
coal beneficiation, to remove the ash and impurities from the coal, is essential to produce good quality
coal. coal washeries are units that wash off the ash, soil and other impurities from coal. the washed
coal is a value addition of coal which reduces the ash percentage and logistic bottleneck as the same
wagon would carry improved quality coal thereby reducing ash generation at power plants. in this way
moef’s stipulation for use and transport of coal with less than 34% ash is complied. the washed coal
also fetches better price in the market. we have initiated the planning for establishing 4 washeries at
talcher coalfield (two), ib valley coalfield (one) and basundhara (one). the feasibility of these
projects has been evaluated and the washeries are likely to function on a bom (built, operate,
maintain) model. once the washeries are operational, mcl would be able to produce coal with low
ash content to the power sector industries, which will enable them to meet the moef norm of using
low ash non-coking coal.




  customer
  satisfaction




we have taken utmost care to improve the quality of coal being supplied to different power houses
and to meet the satisfaction level of our customers. during the reporting period, various measures for
ensuring proper quality of coal dispatched were intensified and we achieved a record despatch of
114.34 mt against 111.96 mt as compared to the previous year. however, the quality complaints
increased to 53 as compared to 17 in the previous year. we are working on improving product quality
and customer satisfaction.

we deal with our consumers/ buyers following the directives of ministry of coal/ cil. we sell coal to all
our customers through fuel supply agreement (fsa)/ e-auction. during the reporting period, we
have signed 24 fsas with various customers. the fsa has guidelines for ensuring customer
satisfaction. it has an incentive and compensation clause, which is an effective management
intervention to retain satisfaction level of our consumers. also by mode of frequent interactions with
different customers we try to improve customer satisfaction. a customer feedback form is also
available on our website which can be downloaded by the customers and submitted to us for
improvement.
                                                                       csr and sustainability report 2013-14 pg 66

our service quality – our pride
we believe in delivering the best quality coal to our customers. to meet this
vision of ours, we identified the areas of improvement in enhancing the coal
quality and coal dispatch. our attempt has been to improve our technology as
well as our processes to enhance the quality of our product and meet the
expectation of our customers. supply of coal of uniform grade and invoking
transparency during coal dispatch were our key approaches to achieve
customer satisfaction and enhance service quality. we also observed
“quality week” to develop awareness on quality at the grass root level.


our approach
uniform coal grade
our objective was to produce coal of uniform size (100 mm) by deployment of
surface miners. we enforced a stricter quality control process by stringent
sampling procedures from seam, stock, siding & tipper samples. an
               rd
independent 3 party agency was also deployed for sampling at all loading
points to ensure coal quality before dispatch. coal samples were also
analysed in the coal analysis laboratories using sophisticated
instrumentation including electronic auto bomb calorimeter for
determination of gross calorific value of coal. ten such coal analysis
laboratories were established in different areas including, ib valley,
lakhanpur, orient, basundhara, garjanbahal, jagannath, lingaraj,
bharatpur, hingula, talcher and kaniha. during the reporting period 2013-14,
the annual coal grade was declared of utmost satisfaction.



transparency in coal dispatch
we developed procedures to encourage involvement of consumers during
coal dispatch by introducing registers at the coal loading points/sidings for
recording the comments/suggestions of the consumer representatives. all
our sidings are equipped with electronic weighbridges with print out facility for
ensuring 100% weighment of coal dispatched. apart from this, we also
interacted frequently with the consumers to get their perspective to improve
our methods and meet their expectations. all our dispatches at the railway
sidings were under the direct supervision of the nodal officers of the qc. we
took suggestions from the consumers to develop a feedback format to record
complaints. our qc department attended to these complaints and the
findings were communicated to the consumers by the spot officers of
department.

our success
our combined efforts have resulted in off-take of 114.34 mt during 2013-14.
this accounted for an absolute growth of 2.383 mt over last year despatch.

  brand management and marketing communication


as a mining company, unlike any consumer good, our product does not require extensive advertising.
coal being a mineral ore, does not require any packaging or labelling. the only strategy we adopt for
our branding is to improve the quality of our product. we continually focus on replacing conventional
mining methodologies with new sustainable technologies to meet customer satisfaction. we have
built our reputation over years of catering to the customer base with our effective supply chain
management. we adhere to all standard laws as per the directives of ministry of coal (moc) and coal
india ltd. our public relations (pr) department is also involved in stakeholder engagement and
keeps the external as well as internal stakeholders informed about the latest happenings of mcl.
through our pr department, we maintain a very healthy professional relationship with the print and
electronic media and regularly update the media representatives on our performance.

during the reporting period, a new and vibrant mcl company logo was launched in-line with our
vision of becoming the green champion. we also launched a special ‘coffee table book’ titled
‘behind the black’, another first in coal india depicting the journey of coal from ancient mining to
modern days and modern mcl. amongst the various other firsts of mcl, as a modern and new
technology adopting company, we are also making use of social media through “facebook” and other
social media engines.

brand visibility and promotion was maintained by the company through time to time release of press
notes from the company and regular interaction with media representatives for coverage of our
activities; pamphlets and advertisements of our csr and environment initiatives; show-casing our
achievements by participation in exhibitions in cuttack, bhubaneswar and bangalore; and a short
film on ‘quality’.

make any political contributions, in-cash or in-kind, or participate directly in the activities of any
political party.

the core objectives of our csr programmes are:
    to build strong relations and strengthen stakeholder networks through constant engagements
     with communities, institutions and individuals at all sites
    to undertake community investment programmes aimed at improving the welfare of
     surrounding communities

community capacity building
we at mcl understand that local populace around our operations depend
on the mining economically as it is the major source of income for them.
since, mining has a finite life span; we believe that we need to create
competence in other forms of livelihood over a period of time. we have
therefore initiated several community initiatives targeted towards
sustainable livelihood. we have innovatively created self-employment
opportunities for locally residing skilled and un-skilled unemployed paps
by providing a sustainable business to them.

mcl's new initiatives started since 2010-11 such as scheme of coal
transportation, enables the paps (who were not absorbed as employees
in mcl) to form co-operative society and apply as vendors for loading and
transportation contracts with mcl. as per this scheme, each society is
registered in mcl for a period of five years to undertake work of value of
`10 crores. unlike other civilian contractors, these co-operative societies
are waived off security deposit and also no penalty is imposed for any
shortfall in their work. the work is mostly confined to providing
transportation facilities, such as, vehicles (tippers) and drivers. mcl
verifies the required eligibility criteria for providing services, such as,
safety features of vehicles; license verification of drivers. a pre-medical
examination is also conducted for drivers to ensure their physical fitness.
following this the vendors are selected for the work and the drivers are
provided the required training. subsequently, routine monitoring of the
vehicles are done by the safety officers.

total no. of beneficiaries is 739 out of 58 registered co-operative societies
as on 28.04.2015. on an average 330 tippers per day operate for coal
transportation works entrusted to different co-operative societies for the
period 2013-14. the coal loading and transportation works through these
societies accounted for 11.81% of the total coal transportation work of mcl
during 2013-14. during the said period, 42.10 mt of coal loading/
transportation of value `148.54 crores was accomplished which was
almost double than the previous year. one such society, sairam society
(talcher coalfield), expressed their satisfaction on this scheme during the
stakeholder engagement interaction. they find the scheme not just as an
option for alternative occupation but very challenging and motivating.

  csr strategy


we strategise to be a proactive enabler and partner, to map the needs of the community and act upon
it in collaboration with the community, government and local ngos, towards the overall
empowerment of the community. we engage by participatory methods to effectively communicate
with the local community as well as provide feedback. the community is engaged continuously on
various issues that affect and interest both the company and the community.


monitoring and evaluation
during the previous reporting period, we engaged tata institute of social sciences (tiss), mumbai,
to conduct a baseline survey in the peripheral villages of four districts of mcl’s operation areas to
assess socio-economic aspects of the project affected people (pafs). tiss has submitted the final
survey report. it has also been decided to establish a continuous monitoring and evaluation process
in project affected areas by conducting comprehensive studies. these studies would be conducted
by the programme manager of tiss deputed by cil.




  csr focus areas


we focus on 5 thematic areas for implementation of our csr projects, namely, drinking water,
education, infrastructure, healthcare and sports. our csr activities are not limited to these
aforementioned broad areas. all projects which relate to the overall perspective of social
development make their way to the csr funds. mcl generously executes these projects as and
when needed.

drinking water
water scarcity is a severe problem in most of the areas around our operations. supplying potable
water to our communities has been a major thrust area of our csr activities. we facilitate supply of
potable water by the following modes: by mobile tankers, by establishing pipelines from nearest
natural water source, by renovating ponds and by digging bore wells.

water supply through mobile tankers is a regular activity in some of our villages. this requirement
escalates during summer. during the year 2013-14, 291 peripheral villages and 18 municipal wards
were provided with drinking water through mobile tankers. during the reporting period, pipelines for
drinking water supply were established at orient area (nuapada, gwalapara and lamtibahal).
improvement of water supply system of brajraj nagar town, jharsuguda, through district authority
was also accomplished.

deep bore-wells were constructed in the peripheral villages of our operations. during the year 2013-
14, 12 bore-wells were dug in different areas including bg area, village barpali; jagannath area
(sahar sahi, school sahi, mandir sahi, ekdal and naraharipur); bharatpur area (sc/st girls school
ashram); orient area (kalimandir, sanjob, madhuban nagar); hingula area (gopal prasad hilltop
near hocp). additionally, financial assistance was also provided to sc/st farmers to dig bore-wells,
under the deep bore-well scheme of odisha lift irrigation corporation.

education
we believe that for meaningful development to take place, education has to be continuous and
effective. we therefore, establish schools in the local and peripheral villages in the vicinity of our
operations. we aid the infrastructural requirements such as class room building; hostel buildings;
boundary walls of school premises etc. during the reporting period, infrastructure for schools and
colleges were established at ib valley, jharsuguda, basundhara, jagannath, hingula, bharatpur,
lingaraj, talcher and sambalpur hq. few of our projects included: construction of additional class
rooms at saraswati sishu mandir, bandhabahal, jharsuguda, and govt. hindi high school,
sambalpur; construction of examination hall at brajrajnagar college, jharsuguda; construction of
hostel building for tribal students in lady darwin college, kudmulguma, malkangiri; completed the
second floor of ladies hostel at vssut, burla, sambalpur; construction of science laboratory for
govt. hindi high school, sambalpur; construction of toilet at manikeswari high school and
chhatenpali high school in basundhara area; water supply arrangement at manikeswari high

infrastructure
we have proactively participated in infrastructural development of areas in and around our
operations. we are actively involved in establishing infrastructural requirements of our local
community including roads, rails, community centres, recreational facilities, temples etc.

road connectivity
our operations, being spread across the rural regions of odisha, establishing a road linkage with the
highways and nearby establishments is of prime necessity. due to the expanse of our mining zones,
there is continuous need for construction and maintenance of roads and railway infrastructure.
during 2013-14, road construction as part of csr programme was prevalent in ib valley, lakhanpur,
basundhara, sundergarh, jagannath, hingula, bharatpur, lingaraj and talcher.

some of the major road projects were:
   widening of two lane road to four lane road from bankibahal bg area to kanika railways siding
    through state govt. authority
   widening and strengthening of balinga taparia road (phase i- chainage 2.24 km to 7 km;
    phase ii- chainage 7 km to 15.70 km and phase iii - chainage 15.70 km to 24.20 km)
   repairing and strengthening of sundergarh bye pass coal transportation road from govt.
    college junction to kerai check gate junction, bg area

medical education
there is always an urgent need for medical professionals to work in the rural areas of india. since
most of our mines are located amongst rural populated areas, we realise the need for investing in
medical education in the local community area. we have started nursing schools in talcher as well as
ib valley.




                                                                     csr and sustainability report 2013-14 pg 76

nursing school at ib valley
with an insight to empower the locals and serve the
community, we established the general nursing midwifery
training school, in the premises of central hospital, ib
valley, in january, 2014. the school offers a three and a half
years professional course on general nursing and
midwifery training, recognized by the odisha nursing
council. the annual intake of the school is 20 students. the
nursing school has excellent infrastructure facilities with
state-of-art laboratories and library. the students also have
access to computer lab with internet access. enrolled
students get practical training in the central hospital, ib
valley. this acquaints them to the work culture of a hospital
and establishes competency to handle medical
emergencies. the overall exposure makes them confident
and proficient before they begin their career. the students
are provided financial assistance as a monthly stipend as

  mahila mandal -
  the csr arm of mcl
mahila mandal is our ladies congregate of wives of mcl’s senior executives. initially, it took birth as
“jagriti mahila mandal”, a social club at the headquarter. gradually, it has expanded to other unit
areas of mcl and the other prominent mahila mandals are ananya mahila mandal, talcher and ekta
mahila mandal, ib valley. these mahila mandals have transformed from just a “social club” to “a club
for the society”. today, they represent the csr arm of mcl. they actively participate in our csr
activities and play a very significant role in the implementation of various csr projects. aligning to the
focus areas of mcl in csr, the mahila mandal works in four domain areas:


                               jigyasa             sanjeevani     samarpan          swabalambam
                             (education)            (health)       (charity)     (social empowerment)

the mahila mandals adopt a unique strategy of participation and involvement for execution of csr
projects which makes them very popular amongst the rural masses. during the reporting period, they
undertook an initiative "laadli pariyojna" which focuses on providing medical facilities, organizing
skill development programs, and empowering women. other activities undertaken by them was to
provide adequate vocational training to underprivileged women from surrounding communities, on
tailoring/ embroidery, computer literacy, retailing of grocery items, etc. to make them self-reliant and
fetch a sustainable livelihood for themselves.

expansion is an integral aspect of coal mining. this requires acquisition of new lands before initiating
mining activity in that area. hence, while acquiring any new land we take complete responsibility of the
affected villagers and the project affected families (pafs). we follow the resettlement &
rehabilitation (r&r) policy of government of odisha. we are committed to providing the best of
rehabilitation and resettlement facilities to the pafs and land oustees and also make efforts to
improve their socio-economic status.

biodiversity) and resettled 504 pafs. each displaced family is provided with either a plot of land (10
dec.) or cash compensation (`3 lakhs) in lieu of a plot. additionally, building assistance and other
resettlement benefits of `2.78 lakhs also provided to each displaced family. a cash incentive of `1-0.5
lakhs is provisioned for shifting within one to three months of notice period.
