                                               during 2009, we identified the need for a better solution for managing our sustainability data in support of
                                               continued accurate reporting and informed decisionmaking toward improved performance. late in the year
                                               we purchased an automated sustainability data management system that, once fully implemented, will provide
                                               significant support to our sustainability program and free up valuable time that was previously focused on
                                               data management so that we may focus on improving our performance. we are rolling out the solution across
                                               genentech during 2010 and anticipate that this will assist each site and genentech overall to better track,
                                               forecast and manage energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainability metrics.

only 20% of our total waste, and only a small fraction of our total
regulated waste is considered hazardous under u.s. federal legisla-
tion, reflecting the relatively low use of harmful chemical compounds
in biotherapeutics manufacturing when compared with other forms of
pharmaceutical manufacturing. however, any reductions made should
be considered in the context of the more hazardous properties of regu-
lated waste when compared with non-regulated wastes.

by far, the majority of our regulated waste (over 80%) is comprised
of a waste stream produced from our use of tetramethylammonium
chloride (tmac) as a buffer in our purification process. the waste
stream is considered hazardous in the state of california and is shipped
offsite for specialized wastewater treatment. during 2009, we reduced
the amount of tmac waste generated when compared with previous
years. we continue to work towards further reducing and, in the longer
term, potentially eliminating the bulk production of this waste stream
altogether.
