steel is the fabric of life, a key element of the high technologies and
solutions satisfying the daily needs of the society that will remain important
in future as well. none of the other materials has such a unique
combination of strength, usability, flexibility and multifunctionality of
utilization. we aimed to make our steel the main material for public
authorities, commissions in the selection and approval of construction
projects as well as for companies that design and build, because they
know that the steel is an integral part of circular "green" economy, rather
than part of the problem.

using steelmaking slag
as a fertilizer
 in 2015, the company started implementation of
the project to use steelmaking slag in agriculture as
fertilizer (ameliorant) for soil deoxidation and to
increase the yield of different crops.

research regarding this method of land
stabilization confirms that this technique is
efficient, unique and provides good economic
benefit: for agrarians – soils fertilizer and increase
in crops yield; for the company – steelmaking slag
utilization and environmental situation
improvement.

the company obtained the documents from the
ministry of environment and natural resources of
ukraine confirming this method to be safe, that
allows production and sale of this product. this
project was also approved by the ministry of
health of ukraine.

besides, pjsc arcelormittal kryvyi rih obtained
patent of ukraine for developed method of
steelmaking by-products application in agriculture.
there is a copyright protection of steelmaking slag

responsibility of the auditor
our responsibility is to conduct a limited assurance engagement on the company's report and draw
conclusions on the subject matters based on the work we performed.

we carried out our procedures on the subject matters in accordance with the international standard on
assurance engagements 3000 (revised) "assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical
financial information" ("isae 3000 revised"). to achieve limited assurance the isae 3000 revised requires
that we review the processes, systems and competencies used to compile the subject matters on which we
provide limited assurance. this is designed to give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of
interim financial information. it does not include detailed testing of source data or the operating effectiveness
of processes and internal controls.

in order to draw our conclusion on the report, we undertook the following procedures:

     •   interviewed a selection of arcelormittal kryvyi rih senior management who have operational
         responsibility for corporate responsibility matters, including the corporate responsibility team, data
         owners and those with operational responsibility for performance in the subject matters to understand
         the governance structures used for managing corporate responsibility, engagement with stakeholders on
         corporate responsibility matters, as well as implementation of corporate responsibility related policies
         and initiatives in 2016 and the monitoring of these activities;

     •   visited the site to review the systems to capture, collate and process source data for the indicators
         listed above;

     •   read and analysed selected relevant public information relating to the company and industry
         sustainability practices and performance during the year;

     •   obtained an understanding through inquiries, analytical reviews, observation and other applicable
         evidence gathering procedures on a sample basis on the key structures, systems, processes, procedures
         and internal controls relating to:

     - the development and approval of the report, including selection of material sustainability matters to
     be reported on in line with gri guidelines, related key performance indicators and other matters
     to be reported on; and

     - collation, aggregation, validation and reporting of sustainability performance data and disclosures,
     for the selected indicators.

     •   verified that the gri g4 content index contains the relevant general and specific disclosures required
         by the core option criteria;

     •   assessed if the report meets the gri requirements on report content principles and quality principles;

     •   read the content of the report against the findings resulting from our work.

for the 2016 limited assurance, we have not completed any analysis, testing or review of prior year
performance information included within the report.

appendix 2: independent verification report



limitations
the process an organisation adopts to define, gather and report data on its non-financial performance is not
subject to the formal processes adopted for financial reporting. therefore, data of this nature is subject to
variations in definitions, collection and reporting methodology with no consistent, accepted standard. this may
result in non-comparable information between organisations and from year to year within an organisation as
methodologies develop.

the accuracy and completeness of the information disclosed in the report are subject to inherent limitations
given their nature and the methods for determining, calculating or estimating such information. our
independent assurance report should therefore be read in connection with the gri guidelines.

a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

conclusion
based on our work conducted as above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that:

 • the report of arcelormittal kryvyi rih for the year ended 31 december 2016, does not adhere to gri
   guidelines with respect to the principles of materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context
   and completeness;

 • the disclosures in the report do not adhere to gri g4, option “core” criteria and that the gri content
   index as included on pages 40-44 of the report is not appropriate;

 • the selected indicators marked with a "**" on page 37 of the report and enumerated above are
   not presented fairly, in all material aspects, in accordance with gri guidelines.
