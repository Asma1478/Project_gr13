          decisions which directly or indirectly have a positive impact on
          our ability to preserve environment and create social values for
          stake holders & for the society at large.




we use materiality assessment to determine the priority of

    production of electricity from fossil fuels emits more co2 emissions and has more global warming potential. this
    results in increase in carbon footprint of the organization. to minimize the impact caused to environment through
    energy consumption, tml has explored onsite solar power generation possibilities. pvbu san and plant utilized 0.8
    crores kwh wind energy purchased through tptcl (tata power trading company limited). roof top solar pv power
    plant of 1.8mwp capacity has been installed & commissioned on oﬃce blocks at pune plant (cvbu& pvbu). this has
    resulted in generation of 21.29 lakh kwh electricity. in addition to this, roof top solar pv power plant of 2.0mwp
    capacity was installed & commissioned on oﬃce blocks at san and on approximately 20,000 sq meters area. this has

                                   education and employability are the key areas of intervention for 3 years. based on the
                                   baseline data a development index was devised and the initiatives were so designed so as to
                                   achieve a threshold of 8/10 index value at the time of withdrawal after 3 years. during the
                                   baseline study the cumulative index value of these 7 villages was 3.1 which have gone up to 5.9
                                   after two and half years of intervention.
