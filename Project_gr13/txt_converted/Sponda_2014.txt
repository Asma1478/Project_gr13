sponda
sponda plc is a real estate investment company that specializes in leasing business premises and developing and owning properties. sponda’s
properties are located in the largest cities in finland. by developing business premises into attractive, tailored business environments, sponda
promotes its customers’ success.


the company’s operations are organized into four business units: investment properties, property development, russia and real estate funds.




strategy
profitable growth through focused property ownership

sponda is a property investment company that owns, leases and develops office and shopping centre properties in helsinki and tampere.
sponda’s strategic goal is to achieve growth and profitability through customer-focused operations, active property development and property
acquisitions in finland.


sponda revised its strategy in autumn 2013. the main goals of the strategy are simplification of the business structure, more focused property
ownership and profitable growth. going forward, the company’s operations will focus on office properties, shopping centres and property
development serving these segments. sponda’s geographical focus will be on prime areas in the helsinki metropolitan area, particularly in the
central business district and ruoholahti, as well as tampere.


sponda is planning to exit both the russian market and the real estate funds business in the next three to five years. the terms of existing real
estate funds will not be extended, and no new funds will be established. the company is also planning to sell its entire logistics property portfolio
as well as its property ownership in turku.


with the new strategy, sponda will improve the efficiency of its operations and increase its expertise in the key areas of its operations in which it
already holds a strong position. focusing property ownership in strategically important areas gives the company a better capacity to develop its
market intelligence and achieve profitable growth.


in addition to the new strategic focus, the criteria applied in selecting properties for acquisition and ownership include energy efficiency, flexibility,
central location and access to public transport.



strategic focus

sponda’s strategic focal points are the customer experience and environmental responsibility. the energy consumption of the properties included
in sponda’s energy efficiency programme has decreased in line with previously set targets. at the same time, a growing percentage of the waste
generated at the properties is being recovered. sponda’s customer relationships are based on interactive partnership. with the help of a process
to support the development of the customer experience, sponda aims to identify the best ways of working from the customer’s perspective.


environmental responsibility is an integral part of sponda’s operations. the company’s long-term goal is to develop its environmental expertise
and to share this expertise with customers and partners.

responsibility as part of sponda's strategy
responsibility is an integral part of sponda's day-to-day operations and business expertise, supporting the company's
profitability and long-term viability.


responsibility and strategy

sponda's goals include increasing shareholder value, ensuring the sustainability of operations and continuously developing the company.
responsibility is an integral part of sponda's strategy and day-to-day operations. spondability communicates the holistic approach to
responsibility.


sponda's vision, which guides the implementation and development of its responsible operations, is to be the most reliable, profitable and
responsible player in the real estate sector, implementing sustainable development. in fact, the company has highlighted the development of the
customer experience and environmental responsibility as strategic focal points in its business development.



increasing environmental requirements

the property sector plays a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency. sponda supports the efforts against climate
change in its own operations by improving the energy efficiency of its properties and reducing their environmental impact. the united nations
environmental programme estimates that buildings make up as much as 40 per cent of global energy consumption, with the majority of that
consumption happening during use. as efforts to reduce emissions are ramped up, finnish and eu requirements on corporate environmental
responsibility will become tighter.


sponda believes that, in the future, client companies will increasingly focus on the life cycle environmental impact of their business premises.
sponda is preparing for these future challenges already today by investing in improving its environmental expertise and developing solutions that
promote the well-being of the environment.


environmental requirements are highlighted in sponda's property development operations as well as property maintenance. in addition, sponda
supports its customers in more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable use of premises.


the well-being of the environment is included among the criteria the company applies in deciding on property investments. in accordance with its
investment strategy, the focus of sponda's property portfolio is on central urban locations with good public transport links.



developing the customer experience

sponda aims to achieve competitive advantage and identify the best ways of working from the customer's perspective through its customer
experience management (cem) process. the company aims to be a trustworthy property partner that offers each customer premises that are
precisely tailored to their needs and an effective customer relationship. in customer relationships, the goal is to achieve a long-term interactive
partnerships.


sponda actively monitors changes in how client companies work and what new requirements they have regarding their business premises in
order to develop its own operations and services in accordance with the changing needs of its customer base.



managing responsibility

environmental responsibility and managing the customer experience are strategic priorities for sponda and the company has set annual targets
and defined key actions for them. the executive board and the board of directors regularly monitor the achievement of targets and
implementation of actions. the major challenges in achieving the targets set for environmental responsibility are related to the reduction of
environmental impacts during the use of buildings. co-operation with customers in order to mimimize energy consumption is vital, as the
company's properties are used by over 30,000 individuals.




                                                                                                                                                      6

 sponda promotes best practices in the real estate industry by participating in the projects and organisational activities of the finnish association of building
 owners and construction clients (rakli) and epra, the umbrella organisation for listed european property investment companies, among others.




                                                                                                                                                                    10

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013



improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon
footprint
construction and completed buildings are responsible for more than 40 per cent of finland’s total energy consumption.
sponda recognises this and pays particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint
caused by energy consumption.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   the consumption of heat, electricity and water in buildings
•   property development
•   increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees


why is this a priority?

the european union has made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020. the eu has a
further target of reducing emissions by 80–95 per cent by 2050. in 2021, all new buildings must meet near zero energy standards.


improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions therefore plays a key role in achieving these aims. sponda strives to reach
the eu targets through its own operations and through co-operation with clients. energy efficiency is an important consideration in all of the
company’s property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations.


every day approximately 30,000 people work in premises owned by sponda. as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy
consumption of a building, co-operation between the landlord and tenant is of crucial importance in reducing energy consumption. sponda
encourages its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties. the company also
provides guidance to its clients on energy efficiency and environmentally friendly building use.


for sponda’s properties located in finland, environmental monitoring includes the collection of information on energy and water consumption, as
well as waste management volumes1). for office properties in russia, the consumption of electricity and water are monitored. there is a certain
degree of annual variability in sponda’s property holdings due to sales and purchases, which affects the comparability of the annual environment
figures.


environmentally responsible property development

at sponda, new construction, property renovation and the design of low-energy office buildings are all subject to the company’s design
guidelines, which in many ways are more extensive than generally applied standards and regulations. the design guidelines are reviewed and
updated annually. they help the company develop adaptable and energy efficient properties that offer functional working environments.


sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations. sponda applies for international
environmental classification, an environmental certificate, for all new buildings and major renovation projects.


sponda’s energy efficiency programme is aimed at conserving energy

the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through sponda’s energy efficiency programme, which is aimed at achieving
energy savings in co-operation with clients. the properties included in the programme carry out an energy review to determine the energy
consumption of each property and to examine the technical systems relating to energy consumption. based on these reviews, adjustments and
repairs are made at the properties in line with their use requirements.




                                                                                                                                                 11

                                                                                                            corporate responsibility report 2013

energy-saving goals and measures for achieving them are set individually for each property in cooperation with the users. developments are
then monitored in regular meetings with clients. sponda’s partners ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance
operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data.


the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency programme are reinvested in the property. the programme initially aims at energy
savings of 10 per cent by 2016. the long-term goal is to achieve a 20 per cent saving in energy consumption by 2020. sponda’s progress with
respect to the programme and its targets has thus far been on schedule.


environmental information for employees

the environmental expertise of employees is improved with the help of wwf’s green office programme. environmental awareness is increased
through an annual green day event, internal training events as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet and
sponda’s facebook page.


sponda’s employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports low-emission options. employees
are also provided with company bicycles. as part of sponda’s green office environmental programme, employees are also trained in economical
driving.


1) energy consumption monitoring extends to all properties for which sponda is responsible for energy purchasing. this applies to 85 per cent of all properties. cooling is

monitored separately for those properties that use district cooling. if cooling is performed locally by compressors, it is included in electricity consumption.

measures taken in 2013

new properties covered by sponda’s energy efficiency programme

at the end of 2013, sponda’s energy efficiency programme covered 109 (2012: 107) properties. five properties divested during the year were
omitted from sponda’s energy efficiency programme. a total of 24 real estate funds' properties managed by sponda joined in their own energy
efficiency programme in 2013, and at the end of the year the programme covered 34 properties in total.




                                                                                                                                                                              12

                                                                                          corporate responsibility report 2013

the properties covered by sponda’s energy efficiency programme continued to carry out reviews, implement energy saving measures and
monitor consumption in accordance with property-specific action plans.


in 2013, a metrics strategy was developed for sponda’s properties to support the monitoring of consumption. the company aims to apply the
metrics specified by the strategy to its new construction projects and significant renovation projects.


in 2013, sponda carried out the renewable energy sources research project with the aim of using geothermal heat exclusively for the energy
generation at one sponda property. the plan is to start the demo project in 2014.


energy consumption of sponda’s properties decreased

the energy consumption of the finnish properties owned by sponda decreased in 2013 by 2.6 per cent. the measured heating energy
consumption of comparable properties was down by 7.9 per cent from the previous year. however, weather-adjusted heating energy
consumption was 2.2 per cent lower than the year before. the total electricity consumption of comparable properties decreased by 3.4 per cent,
water consumption declined by 4.7 per cent and cooling energy consumption increased by 17.1 per cent compared to the year 2012.


in 2013, the carbon footprint caused by the total energy consumption of all of sponda’s properties in finland was 5.5 per cent lower than in the
previous year.


sponda aims to reduce the energy consumption of its properties also in russia. in 2013, the electricity consumption of sponda’s office properties
in russia decreased by 3.6 per cent and heating consumption decreased by 9.8 per cent. from the year 2014 sponda monitors electricity and
water consumption of its office properties in russia.


sponda also aims to actively reduce the energy consumption and other environmental loads of its head office in helsinki. in 2013, head office's
electricity consumption increased by 0.8 per cent, (standardised) heating consumption declined by 3.2 per cent and district cooling increased by
8.4 per cent. the water consumption of the head office decreased by 19.8 per cent compared to the year 2011. the year 2012 water
consumption figure of the property is not comparable.


sponda signed its first green lease agreement

sponda and nordea bank’s branch at kaivokatu 12 in helsinki signed a green lease agreement in 2013. under the new lease model, sponda
agrees with the client on joint objectives and a compensation model to encourage the use of environmentally friendly solutions and the reduction
of energy consumption at the premises used by nordea’s branch. a further goal is to reduce the amount of waste generated at the property and
to increase the recovery rate of waste to 90 per cent.


sponda encourages its customers to conserve energy also in its environmental partnership programme, which aims to reduce the environmental
load caused by the use of buildings through joint efforts. at the end of 2013, sponda had 20 environmental partnership agreements (15 at the
end of 2012). the number of agreements was thus increased in line with the objectives in 2013.


the extranet service for customers provides guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting, and also includes news on the progress
of the energy efficiency programme. customers can also use the service to monitor the energy consumption of their property on a monthly basis.


leed® certification granted to the ruoholahden ankkuri office building

sponda obtained leed® gold environmental certification for its ruoholahden ankkuri office building, which was completed in spring 2013. the
building received an especially good score for its efficient use of energy. talentum plc is the main tenant of the office building located at
itämerenkatu 23 in the ruoholahti district of helsinki.


in addition, three environmental certificates for existing buildings were updated in 2013:


•   breeam® in-use certificate for the ducat ii office building in moscow
•   breeam® in-use certificate for the ruoholahden tähti office building in helsinki
•   breeam® in-use certificate for the portgate office building in the port of vuosaari




                                                                                                                                                13

     green lease
     •   the new green lease model involves
         sponda and the customer agreeing on
         joint objectives and a compensation
         model to encourage the use of
         environmentally friendly solutions and the
         reduction of energy consumption.

     •   the objectives can include, for example,
         reducing the building’s energy
         consumption, water consumption and
         waste volume, as well as increasing the
         waste recovery rate.

     •   under the green lease agreement,
         savings and excesses in energy costs,
         for instance, are divided annually
         between the tenant and the landlord.

     •   the eco-efficiency requirements written
         into the lease also provide guidelines for
         changes and investments in the
         premises.




material efficiency
sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its properties and provide instructions on recycling to the users of
properties. material efficiency is also pursued by reducing the amount of waste generated in construction and renovation
work.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   the sorting and recovery of property waste
•   improving efficiency in material use, also in purchasing
•   producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects



why is this a priority?

the finnish waste act, which was amended in 2012, is aimed at reducing waste generation, improving material efficiency and increasing waste
recovery. the national waste plan sets an objective of recycling 50 per cent by weight of municipal waste by 2016. a further target is to reuse or
recycle at least 70 per cent of all construction and demolition waste by 2020. sponda complies with the waste act in the waste management of
its properties and aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the national waste plan through its own operations. in addition
sponda's target is to increase the waste recovery rate at its properties.



effective waste management and reducing the volume of waste

while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties, sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its
properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place. the company is responsible for
post-sorting waste management, unless otherwise agreed with tenants. sponda encourages and guides the users of properties to recycle and
sort waste and to reduce the total volume of waste. sponda facilitates waste handling by ensuring that waste management rooms are set up as
effectively as possible.


reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency. sponda’s construction and renovation projects take this
aspect into account by investing in flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design. this reduces construction waste-generating
alteration work during the use of the building.




                                                                                                                                                    16

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013

in the construction phase of new buildings and major renovation projects, the company has adopted on-site waste management guidelines
according to the international leed® and breeam® certification systems. in all construction and renovation projects and the day-to-day
maintenance of the company's properties, the aim is to minimise the volume of waste ending up at landfill sites.




objectives and measures
objectives for 2013

•   the waste recovery rate at sponda’s properties in finland will increase to ≥ 86%.
•   more environmental partnerships will be formed and action plans will be actively implemented.
•   the volume of office waste at sponda’s head office will be reduced.



measures taken in 2013

sponda has continued to improve waste recycling at its properties within the framework of its co-operation agreement with lassila & tikanoja.
due to the co-operation, the waste recovery rate at properties owned by sponda in finland exceeded 87 per cent at the end of the year 2013
(2012 average: 82 per cent). sponda’s total waste volume in 2013 was 6,796 tonnes (2012: 5,898 tonnes), of which 955 tonnes (2012: 1,059
tonnes) was mixed waste. the volume of mixed waste will be further reduced by improving waste sorting.



environmental partnership strengthens co-operation

in order to increase environmental awareness among its customers and strengthen its customer co-operation, sponda has established an
environmental partnership programme with 20 customers. the aim of these partnerships is to increase the energy efficiency of premises and the
waste recovery rate as well as to pay attention to the environmental effects of customers’ operations. the content and objectives of the
cooperation are always agreed upon with the customer.


in 2013, sponda signed five new environmental partnership agreements with its customers. the aim is to increase the number of partners further
in 2014.


wwf finland has been one of sponda’s key partners in promoting environmental responsibility since 2010. the aim of the co-operation is to
pursue environmentally friendly practices in sponda’s operations and promote environmental responsibility among the company’s customers and
the entire real estate industry.


sponda’s head office was granted a three-year extension of its wwf green office certification in 2013 in recognition of the high extent to which
environmental aspects are taken into consideration in office work. as a wwf partner, sponda also encourages its customers to join the green
office network. sponda supports its customers’ green office processes by helping their green office teams set their consumption goals and
reporting consumption data.


in 2013, the amount of office waste generated at sponda’s head office increased to 12.1 tonnes (2012: 11.54). the increase is partly attributable
to paper waste generated by the disposal of archived materials in conjunction with internal relocations.



climate covenant to mitigate climate change

sponda is a member of the climate partners network of businesses and the city of helsinki. the aim of the network is to develop new practices
for reducing climate emissions and strengthening the competitiveness of companies.


all companies in the network have signed a climate covenant, setting themselves goals, such as reducing co2 emissions, improving energy
efficiency and developing new services that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.




                                                                                                                                                17

•   the recycling rate in sponda’s properties will be increased to over 70 per cent by the end of 2014.



objectives for 2014

•   the waste recovery rate at sponda’s properties in finland will remain at the year end 2013 level, at 87 per cent.
•   more environmental partnerships will be formed.
•   the volume of office waste at sponda’s head office will be reduced.

property locations
sponda takes environmental considerations into account in deciding on the locations for its property investments. the
company’s properties are in key areas in major cities and in locations accessible by public transportation, which helps
reduce the environmental impacts of the properties during their use.

the key aspects of the priority are:

•   taking environmental aspects into account in making decisions on property investments
•   focusing on properties located in cities, accessible by public transportation
•   concentrating on prime areas



why is this a priority?

for sponda, the central location of its properties is a key strategic choice: the company’s properties are in key areas in helsinki metropolitan
area and tampere within the existing urban structure, and in locations with good public transport links. this strategy supports sponda’s
commitment to environmental responsibility.


location is also one of the criteria applied in the environmental certification of business properties. the breeam® and leed® certification
processes take into account not only the energy consumption of the building, but also factors such as public transport links and bicycle parking
facilities.


sponda's investment strategy is also financially sustainable and responsible. the demand and rental levels for properties located in the central
areas of cities are more stable, even in economically uncertain times. approximately 80 per cent of sponda’s properties are located in these
areas. the investment strategy also supports the comprehensive sustainability of sponda's operations.

objectives and measures
measures taken in 2013

the ruoholahden ankkuri office building developed by sponda for talentum plc’s use was completed in 2013, and the building was granted
leed® gold environmental certification. the new four-storey building, with a total floor area of nearly 6,000 square metres, is located in
helsinki’s ruoholahti district and has excellent public transport links.


the final phase of construction on the citycenter shopping centre in helsinki’s central business district was completed in spring 2013. this added
some 7,000 square metres of new or renovated retail space in the complex. the shopping centre’s location across from railway station,
accessible by all modes of public transport, is excellent for both those who work in the citycenter building and its customers. the multi-year
project carried out over several phases made the traditional retail block significantly more comfortable, improved pedestrian access and boosted
the appeal of the surrounding area.


sponda is prepared to commence the ratina shopping centre project in tampere’s central business district in 2014 if the required pre-leasing
rate is achieved.



long-term objectives

•   increasing the share of shopping centres and office properties in the company’s property portfolio




                                                                                                                                                 20

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013

•   developing the property portfolio by concentrating on prime areas and locations with good public transport links




enhancing the customer experience
sponda aims to develop interactive long-term partnerships with its customers. sponda’s expertise allows it to offer
customers business premises that are precisely tailored to their needs.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   identifying customer needs and responding to them
•   taking a more proactive approach to customer relationships
•   creating the conditions for long-term partnerships



why is this a priority?

in the property sector, customer relationships are typically long term: the process of finding the right business premises takes time, and leases
are signed for periods of several years. in customer relationships, sponda’s goal is to achieve a long-term interactive partnership rather than a
unilateral lessor-tenant relationship. this allows the customer to receive the maximum benefit from the expertise of sponda’s personnel and its
comprehensive portfolio of business premises.


at the end of 2013, sponda had a total of 1,984 customers and 3,037 lease agreements. the largest client sectors were the public sector, retail
and banking.



enhancing the customer experience in sponda

the key building blocks of the customer experience are functional and high-quality business premises as well as skilled personnel who
understand customers’ needs. customers expect the lessor to have comprehensive and in-depth expertise in both the industry in general and the
property being leased. good customer service provided via multiple channels is also essential.


the customer experience often begins even before the actual customer relationship is established. with this in mind, sponda’s aim is to be easily
approachable via a variety of channels. the customer experience does not end when the right business premises are found. instead, it develops
and strengthens throughout the customer relationship. sponda’s process supporting the development of the customer experience is aimed at
identifying the best ways of working from the customer’s perspective.


during the lessor-tenant relationship, the emphasis is on property services, the continuous development of the customer relationship, and
maintaining active contact with the customer. the aim of customer service operations is to allow the customer to focus on their own business
while sponda handles all property-related services in cooperation with its property management partners.



customers value sponda’s professional competence

sponda regularly surveys customer satisfaction through the different stages of the customer relationship. in addition to carrying out in-house
surveys, sponda participates in customer satisfaction surveys conducted by kti property information ltd. the kti survey is an annual
benchmark study involving a large number of industry participants. in 2013, a total of 511 sponda customers participated in the benchmark
study. their responses identified sponda’s strengths as professional competence, expertise and image as a lessor. sponda will use the results
of the study to further develop its ability to identify customer needs and improve the effectiveness of customer service.


sponda will engage in further discussions on the issues highlighted in the study in customer meetings and strive to improve its operations based
on the survey results.

objectives for 2013

•   developing and measuring operations in line with the customer relations strategy

                                                                                                                          22

measures taken in 2013

the goals of sponda’s strategy, which was updated in autumn 2013, include profitable growth, simplification of the business structure and
growing the company’s property portfolio in its main markets. for customers, this will mean a broader and more diverse range of business
premises to choose from. in addition, the company will be able to respond quickly to customer needs by having clear processes and effective
flow of information within the organisation.


sponda’s customer relationships work and development is based on the company’s customer experience management strategy. the strategy
defines the customer relations management models and processes for making customer relationships deeper and longer.



new online services for customers

in 2013, the customer relations strategy focused on developing the customer experience in all stages of the customer relationship, from signing
the customer agreement to renewing it. the methods used to achieve this include developing processes and service channels as well as creating
new service innovations.


one example of an innovation that improves the customer experience is the information screen system for office properties that is currently being
piloted. the system is used to distribute information on current affairs at the property as well as sponda’s services. in addition, sponda
developed a property presentation application for tablet devices to support sales and expanded the content on the company’s mobile website.
from early 2014, the property search function will also be available to mobile users.


in late 2013, sponda adopted new research tools to collect information on customer encounters through the various stages of the customer
relationship. these tools will also be used to analyse and make more effective use of the results of feedback surveys in 2014. sponda also made
a further investment in customer data management by launching a crm system development project in connection with its erp project. the new
system will be deployed in 2014.


the use of sponda’s live chat customer service channel increased steadily throughout 2013, and the feedback from users has been very
positive. the contents of the extranet service for customers were also developed during the year.



objectives for 2014

•   developing customer data management and, in particular, securing the success of the adoption of the crm solution
•   developing customer feedback collection and utilisation as part of customer data management
•   developing of electronic customer service environment
•   the evaluation and utilisation of new service innovations




                                                                                                                                              23

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013



sponda's customer process




building the customer experience begins from the very first meeting between the client and sponda. sponda’s expertise helps customers find
business premises that are tailored to their unique needs. as business premises solutions are long-term decisions, the analysis of the client’s
needs takes into account the client organisation’s future prospects and objectives.


business premises are tailored to these needs in close cooperation with the client. flexible solutions can be easily adapted as the client’s
operations develop and change.


the customer experience does not end when the right business premises are found. instead, it develops and strengthens throughout the
customer relationship. sponda maintains regular contact with its customers and analyses customer satisfaction annually. the aim is to create
interactive long-term customer relationships.




purchasing and quality
developments in monitoring the quality of property services

sponda’s purchasing and quality process continued to improve property management and maintenance services in 2013. the effective operation
of property maintenance services, cleaning, waste management and housing solutions has a direct impact on the level of satisfaction
experienced by the users of business premises.




                                                                                                                                                  24

                                                                                       corporate responsibility report 2013

sponda’s properties are looked after by a partner network comprising tens of suppliers, with whom the company works to develop the best
operating models for maintenance services in the market. by harmonising property service processes, sponda achieves more consistent service
quality and reliability.


the quality requirements for property services were reviewed on a property-specific basis during the year. sponda has defined quality criteria for
its suppliers, and the achievement of these criteria is monitored continuously. focus areas in 2013 included improvements in communication by
developing reporting and correspondence models, and increasing awareness of the quality targets sponda sets for its service providers.


in addition to customer feedback and monthly reporting data, the quality of property services is monitored by means of twice-yearly property
audits. the audits and their reporting have been systematically developed, which helped the company achieve an improvement in the quality of
property maintenance in 2013.




investing in employees
sponda’s employees are characterised by their professional and motivated approach and good team spirit. since employee
wellbeing and expertise are key success factors for sponda, the company wants to invest in the high-quality training of
personnel and good leadership.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   occupational wellbeing and job satisfaction
•   improving professional expertise
•   internal communications



why is this a priority?

appropriate training and good management enable sponda to achieve its strategic goals. for an expert organisation like sponda, ensuring
employee qualifications and a high level of professional expertise are particularly important. occupational wellbeing creates a foundation for
excellent work performance and work fitness.



monitoring job satisfaction

sponda monitors job satisfaction and organisational effectiveness with the help of an annual employee survey. the objective of the employee
survey is to analyse employees’ perceptions about their own work, their closest work environment as well as management and leadership.
respondents are also provided with an opportunity to give feedback, talk about their development wishes and participate in the finding of
development solutions.



personnel development

sponda’s goal in all operations is continuous improvement and learning. employees are encouraged to adopt an independent and active
approach to their work and self-development. the personnel’s training is developed on the basis of sponda's strategy, customer and stakeholder
feedback as well as appraisal discussions. sponda organises common training programmes for the personnel and offers the opportunity to
participate in training outside the company.


personnel development is guided by customer-orientation. everyone’s understanding of the connection between their own work and sponda’s
strategy and goals is ensured in appraisal discussions. the progress and achievement of each employee’s personal goals is assessed with the
help of appraisal discussions, customer feedback and employee surveys.




                                                                                                                                                 25

                                                                                         corporate responsibility report 2013

healthcare and support for physical fitness and exercise

sponda also wants to look after the health of its employees. sponda's investment in the wellbeing and job satisfaction of its employees includes
the provision of extensive and versatile occupational healthcare services, the objective of which is to prevent illnesses and problems resulting
from stress and other work-related psychological factors and to support work fitness. the goals also include the prevention and early detection of
lifestyle diseases and support for self-care. in addition, sponda has a special wellbeing programme to support the work fitness of employees who
have been in working life for a long time.


sponda also looks after occupational health and wellbeing by supporting its employees' physical exercise and cultural activities. employees are
also encouraged to adopt environmentally-friendly and sporty commuting habits by offering them the possibility of company bicycles.



remuneration

sponda uses an annual remuneration scheme that covers the entire personnel and is based on both the company's common goals and on
personal targets set specifically for each employee.


sponda implemented an employee share programme in the beginning of 2014. employees have the opportunity to use remuneration earned
pursuant to the incentive scheme for the purpose of acquiring merit pay shares and, in addition, receive funds from sponda to acquire additional
shares. the programme is applied for the first time in respect of remuneration earned for the year 2013.



equal opportunities

the realisation of equal opportunities is important at sponda. sponda's key objective is to ensure that employees do not experience any unequal
treatment on the basis of gender, age, religion, health or other such factors. fair and non-discriminatory treatment applies to the entire
employment relationship, from recruitment to termination.




objectives and measures
objectives for 2013

•   tools are developed to better support the work of the personnel and the achievement of goals.
•   the working environment is developed together with the personnel in such a way that it will better support the performance of work and the
    achievement of the company’s goals.



measures taken in 2013

•   to increase the efficiency of mobile work, sponda introduced a property presentation application that works on tablets and facilitates the ability
    to serve customers, particularly in terms of employees who work at the customer interface.
•   a development project focused on the working environment was begun in cooperation with aalto university students. sponda organised a
    design competition on its head office's new spatial concepts for students of spatial design. sponda’s employees selected the entries best
    suited to function as the starting point for the final implementation.
•   sponda also continued the development and specification work of its new erp system in 2013.



overall results of the personnel survey were good

the annual employee survey in which respondents' assess their level of satisfaction with their own work, their workplace, managerial supervision
and leadership and the operation of the organisation was carried out in the autumn 2013. in line with previous years, the summarised results
involved the entire group. employees also had the chance to evaluate sponda’s internal services in the context of the survey. the survey’s
response rate declined in comparison to the year before but, at 91 per cent, remained high nevertheless.




                                                                                                                                                   26

                                                                                       corporate responsibility report 2013

just as in previous years, the overall results with regard to the personnel satisfaction survey and internal customer relationships were extremely
positive compared to the comparative standards of the survey. the results of the personnel survey go through an extensive comparison with
other comparable surveys, such as the finnish working life research (suomalainen työelämätutkimus). however, the results this year were
slightly lower than in 2012.


according to the survey, sponda’s strengths include its management and operative culture, the communication of strategy and outlooks and well
implemented changes. positive changes had taken place in the reduction of work-related stress and in the perception concerning the quality of
the services sponda produces for its customers. the fairness of remuneration also gained prominence as one of sponda’s strengths.


the operations of units were perceived as efficient. according to the employees, sponda’s work is well organised, operations are flexible and the
operative flow of information is smooth. trust in the company’s management is solid and the employees’ awareness of the goals is high.


the possibility to take a more active role in the development of the operations of one’s own unit was raised as a target for development. the
experience of equal opportunity was slightly lower than in the year before.


according to an analysis of the survey’s results, each unit determines its own development plan. active development work within units will allow
to continue improving sponda’s good atmosphere and operations.



customer work was supported with sales training

in 2013, sponda’s personnel had the opportunity to participate in a variety of training sessions which searched for support and development
opportunities through means of, for instance, improvisation and a sales simulation.


sponda organised sales coaching for the employees who work at the customer interface. the goal was to become better at listening to
customers and finding solutions for the customer’s needs. the practical coaching included exercises in sales simulations corresponding to real-
life situations.


sponda also organised language training and supported the employees’ personal development projects in 2013. there were 2.2 training days
per person in 2013. training costs accounted for 2.9 per cent of fixed salaries.



goals for 2014

•   develop internal operating models to increase the sharing of best practices and know-how.
•   continue the development of tools and systems to support employees’ work and the achievement of goals.
•   continue to develop the working environment in cooperation with personnel in such a way that it better supports the performance of work and
    the achievement of the company’s goals.

transparency in operations
the transparency and accuracy of information regarding the company's operations is of utmost importance to sponda.
openness and transparency are promoted through developing the company's operating models and by engaging in open
dialogue with stakeholders.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   financial reporting
•   reporting on responsibility
•   communication



why is this a priority?

sponda believes that transparent communications and operations increase stakeholder trust in the company. for sponda, transparency means,
above all, reliable communications and reporting.



promoting transparency at sponda

sponda’s financial reporting complies with existing legislation and standards. the company also serves investors by providing information on its
operating environment and development in line with epra (european public real estate association) recommendations, among others.
reporting is continuously developed on the basis of interaction with investors and other stakeholders.


more detailed information on sponda’s key stakeholder groups and the company’s interaction with them can be found in sponda’s stakeholder
groups in this annual report and on the company website. the cash flows by stakeholder group chart evaluates the importance of stakeholders
based on whether or not they are able to have a significant impact on the company’s operations.


sponda's customer relationships are based on interactive partnership. this is supported by a commitment to develop the company's operating
models and make customer communications increasingly interactive. a key focus in sponda's internal communications has been the
development of dialogue between the management and employees through arranging regular events to improve the dissemination of information
and provide opportunities for discussion. the company’s intranet service supports interaction between employees and management.


sponda also promotes responsible ways of working in the property sector in co-operation with its subcontractors. the company requires
transparent operations and up-to-date communications from its subcontractors. to prevent the grey economy, sponda has set strict contractual
conditions for its subcontractors and requires that they are officially registered pursuant to the finnish act on the contractor’s obligations and
liability when work is contracted out.


sponda has defined key priorities with respect to the responsibility of its operations. the objectives and measures related to these priorities are
described in sponda’s annual responsibility reporting.

objectives and measures
objectives for 2013

•   capital markets day for investors in 2013
•   activating customer dialogue in customer meetings and all customer service channels



measures taken in 2013

in 2013, sponda reported for the first time on the most significant taxes and tax-like payments associated with its operations. the aim is to
provide more transparency regarding overall taxation and its economic impact on society.


in may 2013, sponda organised a capital markets day for investors. at the event, the company’s financial situation and future prospects were
reviewed along with the impacts of economic development on changes in the operating environment.




                                                                                                                                                31

new finnish legislation pertaining to monthly reporting on construction contracts and workers will enter into force in july 2014. the new
legislation will require clients that contract construction work to report more detailed information on contracts and invoicing to the tax
administration. sponda has already begun to prepare for these changes by means of system development measures taken in 2013.


sponda developed its customer communication in 2013 through measures including the development of processes and service channels as well
as new service innovations. sponda promoted more active use of its extranet services, and the live chat service on the company website was
found to be a very useful customer service channel.


sponda reported for the fist time the epra cost ratio key figure and specified the epra earnings calculation method in the financial statements
of the year 2013.




objectives for 2014

•   increasing customer dialogue in customer meetings and all customer service channels




taxation
taxes and tax-like payments resulting from sponda’s operations

in 2013, sponda reported for the first time on the economic effect on society created by its operations through taxes and tax-like payments. more
transparent reporting of the taxes and tax-like payments resulting from its operations is one element of sponda’s responsibility.


each year, sponda’s business operations result in the accrual and payment of taxes to the tax authorities in the form of many different taxes and
tax-like payments. sponda’s taxes resulting from business operations in finland include income tax collected on the company’s taxable income,
property taxes collected on the basis of property ownership, and excise taxes collected as part of electricity prices. in addition, a proportion of the
value added taxes paid for goods and services remains as a balance payable by the company. as an employer, sponda pays contributions
related to pension and social security as well as deducts withholding taxes from wages and salaries and pays them to the tax authorities.


in 2013, the taxes arising from sponda’s business operations amounted to eur 43.2 million. in addition, sponda paid withholding taxes
deducted from wages and salaries at a total amount of eur 4.1 million. difference between remitted and deducted value added tax was eur
24.6 million. the chart below illustrates the most significant taxes arising from sponda’s operations and the withheld taxes. sponda has not
received substantial financial support for its operations from the public sector.


sponda group’s result calculated in accordance with ifrs deviates from the group subsidiaries' total combined taxable result. the ifrs does
not permit annual depreciation of investment properties, instead requiring that properties are recorded at their current fair value. the annual
changes in fair value are then recorded in the company’s result.


in taxation, the company applies normal depreciation on the purchase price of properties pursuant to tax law. these factors constitute a
significant difference between the result recorded in the consolidated financial statements according to ifrs and the taxable result. the effects of
the differences between the requirements of tax law and ifrs are taken into account in sponda’s deferred taxes.




                                                                                                                                                   32

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013




taking the industry forward
sponda develops methods and practices in the real estate sector through active participation in collective industry projects
and through its activities in different organisations. in addition to work in the organisations, the company aims to take the
industry forward through its own development activities.


the key aspects of the priority are:

•   active participation in development work in real estate and construction industry organisations
•   sponda’s own research and development work
•   sharing expertise and professional competencies



why is this a priority?

through organisational activities and its own research and development, sponda develops its own operations and those of the real estate
industry from the perspectives of environmental, social and economic responsibility. the company also aims to share expertise and increase the
level of professional competence in the industry.


in finland, buildings are responsible for around one third of the country’s carbon dioxide emissions. for this reason, sponda’s development work
takes the energy efficiency of properties and controlling climate change into particular consideration.




                                                                                                                                             33

                                                                                        corporate responsibility report 2013

as a responsible property company, sponda also participates in the development of cities in co-operation with cities, other property owners and
various partners. the vitality of the city environment is also an important factor for the appeal and rental demand of sponda’s own properties.


companies, organisations and authorities in the construction and real estate industry have an important role in protecting against the grey
economy and commercial crime. sponda promotes responsible ways of working in the industry also in co-operation with its partners. the
company requires for example its subcontractors to operate in a responsible manner and has set quality requirements for them.



sponda promotes best practices in the industry

in addition to its own development work, sponda promotes best practices in the real estate industry by participating in projects and organisational
activities with organisations and companies in the industry.


sponda is involved for example with the following organisations:

•   wwf finland, main partner in cooperation
•   green building council finland (figbc), founding member
•   russian green building council (rugbc), member
•   rakli (the finnish association of building owners and construction clients), member
•   elävä kaupunkikeskusta (living city centre) ry, member
•   finnish business and society ry (fibs ry), member
•   finnish council of shopping centres, member
•   european real estate association (epra), member
•   helsinki city markkinointi (helsinki city marketing) ry, member
•   design district helsinki, supporting member
•   european association for investors in non-listed real estate vehicles (inrev), member



developing the real estate industry

sponda participates actively in the finnish association of building owners and construction clients (rakli). the association is an opinion
leader in the real estate and construction industry, which strives to actively develop the industry, promote networking of experts and communicate
information about the economic situation.


rakli working groups aim among other things to prevent the grey economy and determine the actual tax base of properties, as the increase in
energy tax also results in higher taxes for the real estate industry. rakli promotes healthy and safe construction by ensuring that, despite strict
energy regulations and energy conservation measures, buildings remain healthy working and living environments.


the company is also an active member of the finnish council of shopping centres, which develops shopping centre activities and whose
practical activities are overseen by rakli.


sponda aims to reduce the environmental load caused by the real estate industry by cooperating with wwf finland and by participating actively
in the activities of green building council finland (figbc). the goal of green building council finland (figbc) is to promote practices for
sustainable development in the real estate and construction industry along with environmental classification of properties, to communicate
information and expertise and to activate discussion.



participation in the development of cities

sponda participates in the development of cities through several different organisations. the company is a member of elävä kaupunkikeskusta
(living city centre) ry, whose goal is continuous development of city and municipal centres into more vital, comfortable and competitive
environments.




                                                                                                                                                  34

                                                                                          corporate responsibility report 2013

sponda is also involved in helsinki city markkinointi ry, a cooperative association of centrally located property owners, entrepreneurs and city
authorities. the goal of the association is to increase the comfort and appeal of the city centre. the company also promotes the activation of the
city centre as a supporting member of the design district helsinki city district association.


sponda promotes responsibility in corporate activities as a member of fibs ry (finnish business and society). the company develops
consistency and transparency in financial reporting for the real estate sector through its activities in epra, the umbrella organisation for listed
european property investment companies.




objectives and measures
measures taken in 2013

sponda was an active participant in the operations of green building council finland (figbc) in 2013. this included involvement in the
commercial classification working group to promote the certification of properties, increase awareness of environmental classification and
promote the leed® and breeam® certification of finnish buildings.


sponda was also a participant in the responsibility in the property business project co-ordinated by kti property information. the project’s final
report was published in spring 2013. the aim was to survey the position of responsibility and management systems in finnish property
companies and create new indicators for their use.


sponda’s own development activities in 2013 were mainly focused on creating electronic service innovations and the all-round development of
the customer experience; for example, by reviewing the quality requirements for property services.



energy-efficient co-operation

sponda is a partner in the finnish ministry of employment and the economy’s voluntary business premises energy efficiency action plan (tets),
which is part of the real estate sector’s energy efficiency agreement. the goal of the framework agreement is to decrease energy consumption in
the properties included in the agreement by 6 per cent by 2016, and to prove at the eu level that finland can achieve the targeted energy
savings voluntarily.


in spring 2013, sponda participated already for the fifth time in the global earth hour environmental awareness initiative organised by wwf,
involving organisations and private individuals around the world switching off their lights for one hour. sponda switched off the lights at all of its
shopping centres in finland, as well as the fennia block, arkadiankatu 4–6 and kaivokatu 12 properties. turning off the lights symbolises a
common concern for climate change.


sponda’s elo shopping centre won an honourable mention from the finnish council of shopping centres at the 2013 finnish shopping centre
awards. the reasons for the award included the establishment of parempi elo, a charitable organisation that promotes social wellbeing and
operates in connection with the shopping centre, as well as the charitable work carried out by the organisation. parempi elo arranged a charity
gala in 2013 to raise money to help socially excluded young people in the local community. the charitable organisation strengthens the shopping
centre’s role in the community and promotes co-operation between the shopping centre and the public sector.

the scope of the report
description of the report

the annual report and the spondability section on corporate responsibility contain general information about sponda’s financial, social and
environmental operations between 1 january and 31 december 2013, unless otherwise indicated.



scope of reporting

sponda reports on its corporate responsibility according to the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri). the gri 3.1 reporting
framework is used in reporting. additionally, the real estate and construction industry-oriented construction and real estate sector supplement
(cress) reporting guideline, which was published in autumn of 2011, has been applied in reporting. for the part of the cress directive, the
cre indicators related to the real estate sector in particular were reported on where applicable.


in addition to the gri framework, certain portions of the report also comply with the european public real estate association’s epra criteria,
which are taken into account separately in connection with the gri index. sponda’s consolidated financial statements are compiled according
to the ifrs (international financial reporting standards). in some respects, the report also complies with the oecd's guidelines for
multinational enterprises.


the corporate responsibility report has not been assured by an external assurance provider. sponda has self-declared its reporting to be
application level c.



structure of the report

sponda’s report is divided into three sections:


•   the responsible property investment section discusses the strategic significance of responsibility for sponda.
•   sponda’s approach to corporate responsibility and the company’s responsibility-related priorities are described in the sponda’s responsibility
    priorities section.
•   a chart showing the correspondence between the gri guidelines and sponda’s reporting can be found in the gri index.



scope of the report and data collection

the figures which appear in the report are based on the figures of sponda’s finland operations, unless otherwise indicated. figures for the
company’s subsidiaries are mentioned separately. unless otherwise indicated, there have been no changes in the scope or method of calculation
of the reporting principles.


there is a certain degree of annual variability in sponda’s property holdings due to sales and purchases, which affects the comparability of the
annual environment figures.


approaches to managing financial, social or environmental responsibility are not discussed separately in the report.



earlier reports

the previous spondability report was published as a part of sponda’s annual report in february 2013. sponda reports on its progress in terms of
responsibility each year.


in the 2013 report, sponda has expanded the reporting of waste management and carbon footprint from the previous year.
