turn for the better
in 2011, onninen’s result turned clearly for the better
after a historically weak year. a favorable market
situation helped the positive development in some
operational areas, but the most significant input has
come from our customers, partners and personnel.

our new organization creates a foundation for us
to improve our performance. the aim is that our
organization will be internally cohesive and externally
strong in order to meet the needs of customers
increasingly well. we want to offer our customers
better service and suitable solutions as well as to
deepen our cooperation with our suppliers.

the positive development of profitability gives us at
onninen confidence for the future. we will continue
to build a strong foundation for profitable growth
together with our partners. even though the economic
outlook remains uncertain, we expect the positive
trend in profitability to continue in 2012.
