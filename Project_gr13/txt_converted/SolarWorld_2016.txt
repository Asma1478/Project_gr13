 2. medium: falling costs of primary sources of energy are hardly being passed on to electricity consumers, with the result that declining oil
     prices have little impact on the domestic electricity price. furthermore, energy prices should rise in the medium term on the basis that
     energy demand will continue to grow.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 1. medium, short-term to long-term: a decline in the general wilingness to invest might have a medium effect on our group revenue and
     earnings. large-scale projects would be affected the most by a tougher financing environment, since in the short term, credit bottlenecks
     could occur for large-scale investment projects and especially for project financing. a weak economy in emerging countries such as china
     may reduce the price level of solar products because of exchange rate effects.
 2. medium, medium-term: domestic electricity prices have a medium impact on our business since end customers may choose between
     self-produced solar power or power from a utility company, i.e. the electricity generation costs of a solar power system are compared with
     domestic electricity prices.
 counter-measures
 • trade: our internationalization helps us spread the risk of a decline in consumption among various regional markets. (reduce)
    by offering a diversified range of products, we appeal to various customer groups to spread the financing risk and compensate for shifts in
    demand. (reduce) > future sales markets – p. 083
 • all segments: due to ongoing cost reductions and efficiency enhancements along the entire value chain, we are able to offer solar systems at
    competitive prices. thus, the levelized cost of electricity of solar plants undercuts domestic electricity prices in a number of markets already
    and continues to get closer elsewhere. (assume)

political and regulatory risks ↓
 risks
 1. changes in laws promoting solar power: slower market growth due to a reduction in or even abolition of financial incentives in individual
     countries
 2. discontinuation of countervailing duties in the u.s. and in the eu: unfair trade practices would no longer be monitored and sanctioned;
     rapid price decline due to dumping
 probability
 1. low: economic incentives for new solar technology installations are regularly reviewed by policymakers and in many cases reduced
     in important sales markets for the solarworld group such as the united states, germany, france, the united kingdom and japan. in
     solarworld’s most important sales regions, new legislations were passed by the end of 2015 so that there is a low probability of further
     changes in 2016. > the future market 2016+ – p. 081
 2. low: on february 1, 2015, new anti-dumping and countervailing duties came into force in the united states, which complement the existing
     duties on solar products imported from china. these determinations will be effective for the next five years. the level of the u.s. duties is
     revised every 18 months. in the european union, the eu commission also opened an investigation regarding an extension of the anti-
     dumping and countervailing duties imposed in europe. this procedure may take up to 15 months, so that a decision is not to be expected
     before early 2017. until then, existing anti-dumping and countervailing measures remain in force.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 1. high, short-term to medium-term: a reduction of incentives for new installations of solar power technology may have a negative impact on
     the willingness of customers to invest. such declines in demand may lower our revenue in individual regions and have a negative impact on
     our earnings. as long as grid parity has not been achieved in individual markets, solarworld will be exposed to this risk.
 2. medium, medium-term to long-term: massive price decline due to dumping could significantly diminish our sales volumes or make it
     impossible for us to sell our products at a cost-covering price level. this would negatively impact our revenue and result.

risks arising from alternative solar power technologies →
 risks
 technological breakthrough or sharp cost reductions in alternative solar power technologies: risk of substitution for crystalline technologies
 probability
 low: due to continuing low prices for crystalline solar products, few manufacturers of alternative solar power technologies have cost benefits
 versus crystalline manufacturers. this particularly applies to the roof-mounted systems market as alternative solar power technologies only
 have low module efficiency, making optimum use of limited roof space more difficult.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 medium, long-term: successful competitors might reduce our market share, increase price competition, and thus place stronger pressure on
 margins. this might adversely affect our revenues and earnings.

risks from tougher competition →
 risks
 intensification of competitive pressure: continuation of consolidation at all stages of the value chain in the solar industry; increased competi-
 tion from state-sponsored manufacturers; unfair pricing practices; excess capacities; dumping
 probability
 high: due to rising capacities in the solar industry, competitive pressure persists, which could lead anew to a strong decrease of sales prices.
 in spite of legal measures (anti-dumping and countervailing duties and undertaking concerning minimum prices) in the u.s. and eu against
 violations of international trade law, the danger of unfair competition still exists as some market players sell below production costs
 on a long-term basis to drive competitors out of the market. a lot of competitors have a higher investment power thanks to state support.
 some have announced that they will significantly expand their capacities mainly for high efficiency technologies such as perc. therefore, we
 presume the probability that competitive pressure will increase to be high.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 high, medium-term to long-term: loss of market share, failing profitability and increased negative margin trends due to stronger international
 price competition may weigh down revenue and earnings. if competitive pressure in the solar industry increased anew, the implementation of
 measures to enhance business profitability would become much more difficult.

procurement risks →
risks
1. insufficient silicon supply: limitations on production volume due to insufficient silicon supply; compulsion to buy on unfavorable terms and/
    or poor quality
2. costs of purchasing other raw materials (silver, copper, aluminum, etc.) on the rise: higher procurement costs;
    strong speculative fluctuations – particularly for silver, aluminum and copper; inaccurate hedging
3. deterioration of procurement conditions: suppliers could reduce their payment terms/credit limits for solarworld, or only deliver after
    advance payment.
probability
1. low: we maintain supplier agreements with a silicon supplier that secure our supply at competitive conditions in the medium term. in
    addition, procurement on the spot market at good condition is possible currently. in the medium term, our joint venture will make an
    additional contribution to our silicon supply.
2. low: the kiel institute for the world economy expects that raw material prices will remain low in 2016 because of the weak economy in
    emerging countries.
3. medium: since the operating turnaround has not been completed yet, some suppliers could reduce their credit limits and payment terms for
    solarworld, or only make deliveries subject to advance payments.
effect (strength, time horizon)
1. high, short-term to medium-term: silicon is the main raw material used to manufacture crystalline technology. supply bottlenecks, delayed
    deliveries or quality defects could halt production, which would have a negative impact on revenue and earnings.
2. medium, short-term: higher prices for other raw materials might negatively impact earnings and margins.
3. medium, short-term: liquid funds would be temporarily tied up. deliveries subject to advance payment could mean that the solarworld
    group has to bear the corresponding supplier’s risk of default, defective performance or non-performance.
counter-measures
• production; trade: expansion of our supplier networks and maintenance of our good, long-term supplier relationships;
  renegotiations with suppliers; flexibilization of purchase terms (assume, reduce)

corporate strategy risks →
 risks
 misjudgments concerning future developments: bad strategic decisions with regard to investments, disinvestments, technology development,
 location decisions, acquisitions and joint ventures, financing, organizational structure and business model
 probability
 medium: the solar power industry is subject to frequently changing economic, political, regulatory and technical influences, to which the
 companies have to adapt flexibly and quickly. in the meantime, technical entry barriers are comparatively low so that the solar industry is a
 narrow market with a lot of competitors, which often act in an unpredictable way. in this environment, it is hard to measure the impacts of
 long-term strategies and corresponding business models reliably.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 high, short-term to long-term: due to the fact that the solar industry is capital-intensive, the economic consequences of possible wrong
 strategic decisions are to be measured as high. lack of acceptance or profitability of new products might affect revenues and earnings of the
 company. loss of market shares, image and capital resulting from this might worsen the economic position of the group.
 counter-measures

default risks →
 risks
 insolvency of individual customers: loss of receivables outstanding
 probability
 low: our customers consist mainly of a large number of wholesalers and installers, who essentially are not affected negatively by the high
 competitive pressure in the solar industry. moreover, they are benefitting from the dynamic growth of the solar market. therefore, we assess
 the general risk of loss of receivables outstanding to be low.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 low, short-term: the loss of receivables from individual customers would only have a small impact on our business as we have a very broad
 customer base and none of our customers accounts for more than 10 percent of our revenue.
 counter-measures
 • trade: ongoing monitoring and analysis of receivables (reduce)
 • trade: selective conclusion of credit insurance policies (transfer)

sales and price risks →
 risks
 continuing or increasing price pressure and supply surplus: lower demand for our products
 probability
 medium: price pressure in the market may intensify as a result of competition and changes in the legal framework in core markets. less
 favorable incentives and financing conditions for purchasing solar power systems could lead to drops in demand on the market. anti-dumping
 measures could be relaxed or circumvented. customers could decide to buy products from competitors. overall, demand for solar products
 is rising dynamically throughout the world, which implies that the relationship between supply and demand might normalize. however, the
 devaluation of the yuan in early 2016 may have a negative effect on the international average selling prices for solar products because most
 solar manufacturers are located in china. overall, we consider that the probability of this risk occurring is medium.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 high, short-term to long-term: if less than the agreed volumes of our products are purchased or if prices drop, this could mean that we are
 unable to sell our products at a cost-covering price. furthermore, impairments on inventories may be necessary, which would adversely affect
 earnings. not only could a steep drop in demand diminish revenue, it could also result in a lower utilization of our production and negatively
 impact unit costs as well as margins and affect the intrinsic value of the production facilities. it could also increase our storage costs. any
 unexpected shift in demand (regionally or to another customer segment) could negatively affect achievable sales revenues and margins and
 produce deviations from expected earnings.
 counter-measures
 • trade: identify changing customer needs at an early stage and target them specifically with new products (assume)
 • trade: enhance the value added of the solarworld brand; increase customers’ loyalty to the company and affirm their decision to buy
   from solarworld (assume)

 shortage of highly-skilled technical and executive staff: difficulties in filling key positions; high attrition rate
 probability
 high: the availability of highly qualified technical and executive staff in the labor market is declining, while competition for talent is growing.
 the consolidation that took place in the solar industry negatively affects the appeal of solar companies as employers.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 medium, medium-term: a high fluctuation can be an obstacle to the implementation of optimization measures. a shortage of skilled technical
 staff can lead to a potential erosion of our technological edge and slowdown in corporate growth. this may adversely affect revenue and
 earnings. in 2015 the fluctuation rate stood at 8 (2014: 10) percent.

     resulting from this on all business processes of solarworld
 2. hacker attacks: risks from data loss and industrial espionage
 probability
 1. medium: by the implementation of a groupwide erp system and a global platform for the network infrastructure, the availability of our it
     services has been improved. furthermore, our it systems undergo regular maintenance and are adapted so that they meet professional,
     organizational and safety-related demands.

liquidity risks ↑
 risks
 1. longer-term negative earnings position: increased outflow of funds; negative operating cash flow; high inventories
 2. breach of covenants: termination of loans
 probability
 1. medium: falling revenue due to increasing price and competitive pressure as well as a failure to meet cost targets may have a negative
 impact on our operating cash flow and diminish our liquid funds. too high inventories can tie up liquidity, too.
 2. medium: since december 31, 2015, additional covenants apply to solarworld’s loans that have to be met at the end of each quarter. based
 on the company’s current business planning, the management board expects to be able to meet these covenants for the full year 2016. in the
 first and second quarter of 2016, headroom for deviations is more limited than in the second half of the year, increasing the risk of breaching
 covenants during this period. concerning the methods for determining covenants, individual creditors of borrowed funds have a different
 opinion with regard to the interpretation. we refer to > legal risks/infringement of loan agreements – p. 076
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 1. medium, short-term to medium-term: ongoing negative operating cash flow could have a negative impact on the group’s liquidity position,
 limiting our ability to act and to pay. if the company is exposed to this situation in the longer term, refinancing with borrowed capital would
 become even more difficult.
 2. high, short-term to medium-term: if this risk occurred, creditors of borrowed funds would have an extraordinary right to terminate
 loans. this would require renegotiation of the loan agreements or its terms and conditions. since the amount of loans affected exceeds the
 company’s liquid funds, an exercise of the creditors’ extraordinary termination right would threaten the continued existence of the company as
 a going concern due to a then insufficient cash position.

legal risks ↑
 risks
 1. litigation between a silicon supplier and our subsidiary solarworld industries sachsen gmbh: solarworld industries sachsen gmbh is
     currently the defendant in court proceedings with the silicon supplier hemlock semiconductor corp., which asserts claims resulting from the
     non-fulfillment of long-term silicon supply contracts.
 2. infringement of loan agreements: the contracts regulating the company’s borrowed funds contain extensive obligations and conditions as
     well as partly imprecise legal terms that are open to interpretations. individual creditors of borrowed funds have a different opinion with
     regard to the group's interpretations of some contract points.
     ther pending litigation and proceedings: individual court or administrative proceedings in which third parties claim rights against
 3. o
    solarworld, especially regarding our u.s. subsidiaries
 4. other legal risks: there is a wide range of tax, competition, patent, anti-trust, labor law, trade mark, and environmental regulations within the
     scope of our international business operations, infringement of which may cause costs.
 probability
 1. low: according to external legal opinions, there are anti-trust concerns under european law regarding the effectiveness of the underlying
     supply contracts, which could mean that the purchasing obligations of solarworld industries sachsen gmbh are null and void. from
     solarworld's perspective, the supplier is therefore not entitled to claim damages. in addition, solarworld industries sachsen gmbh has
     further substantial lines of defenses against the validity of the claims. however, the district court for the eastern district of michigan, in
     which the case is unfolding at first instance, ordered on october 28, 2015, to deny a motion to allow illegality under european antitrust
     law as a line of defense in the proceedings. the partial decision of the court is of technical nature and is no assessment that the underlying
     agreements do not violate eu antitrust law. all other lines of defense remain allowed. however, the order lowers our chances to win the
     lawsuit in the first instance.

        in case of a negative ruling in the first instance, there will still be the possibility of appeal in the united states, and the defense of illegality
        under eu antitrust law can be reconsidered at that stage. in addition, a potential u.s. ruling has to comply with the essential principles of
        the german law in order to be recognized and enforced in germany. thus, a german court would have to reassess a potential ruling, if it
        were to be enforced in germany. at the latest at this stage, the illegality of the underlying agreements due to infringement of eu antitrust
        law would become relevant again. therefore, even in case of a negative ruling in the u.s., solarworld continues to assess the probability for
        hemlock to actually enforce any claims against solarworld as low.
 2. low: solarworld believes that its interpretations are in accordance with the contractual basis and all contractual obligations and conditions
     have been complied with. therefore, it has not infringed any loan agreements. however, one group of creditors has expressed doubts regarding
     the company’s interpretations of specific contract points, especially regarding the calculation of covenants as well as possible transactions
     requiring approval.
 3. medium: based on the respective states of proceedings, currently, it is to be expected that financial costs will be incurred as a result.
 4. low: solarworld is not currently aware of any further material risks from litigation, patent infringement or other legal risks that might
     significantly impact the business situation of the company. as a result of our global sales presence, however, risks could in principle arise in
     connection with legal disputes relating to trademark usage.
 effect (strength, time horizon)
 1. high, medium-term to long-term: if u.s. courts legally ruled that hemlock semiconductor corp. is entitled to claim for damages against our
     subsidiary solarworld industries sachsen gmbh and if this decision could be enforced, this would have a considerable negative impact on the
     company’s liquid funds, possibly even threatening the continued existence of the company as a going concern.
    > note 42 contingent liabilities – p. 168
 2. high, short-term: if this risk occurred, creditors of borrowed funds would have an extraordinary right to terminate loans. this would require
     renegotiation of the loan agreements or its terms and conditions. since the amount of loans affected exceeds the company’s liquid funds, an
     exercise of the creditors’ extraordinary termination right would threaten the continued existence of the company as a going concern due to a
     then insufficient cash position.
 3. medium, short-term: a ruling sentencing to pay damage claims or an out-of-court settlement could have adverse impact on the earnings,
     financial and asset position of solarworld. in the consolidated financial statements as at december 31, 2015, provisions in the amount of
     us-dollar 3 million were made to account for these circumstances. however, it cannot be ruled out that depending on the further course and
     outcome of the proceedings higher financial charges might be imposed.
 4. medium, long-term: litigation might impact the result of our business operations since it would tie up financial resources, jeopardize the
     company’s reputation and brand and cause losses of tangible and intangible corporate property.

     not affect us more strongly than other companies.
 2. medium, short-term: if pollutant emissions occur, employees may be in danger. further possible consequences are damages to the

increasing the share of women in management positions.
solarworld has set itself a target of achieving a 25 percent
share of women in management positions by june 30,
2017 (2015: 16,7 percent). we will tackle this subject on a
global level in 2016 and implement measures to encourage
women.

in fiscal year 2016, the solarworld group will continue to
invest in the increase of its production capacities and in
upgrades to perc technology. it will also further develop
its measures to boost efficiency and reduce costs. earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(ebitda) will increase significantly in 2016.

earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) should be positive
in fiscal year 2016. due to typical seasonal effects in the
solar business, however, a negative ebit for q1 2016 cannot
be ruled out. over the course of the whole year, solarworld
expects its ebit to be in the lower double-digit million range.

at initial recognition and in subsequent measurement, derivative
financial instruments are recognized at fair value. the recognized
fair values of traded derivative financial instruments equal the
market prices. derivative financial instruments that are not subject
to trade are calculated using accepted measurement methods
based on discounted-cash-flow-analyses and by taking recourse
to current market parameters. we refer to note 40.

ecotoxicity
terrestrial toxicity describes the harmful impact of poison-
ous substances on flora (plants), fauna (from micro-organ-
isms to animals), and fungi, in and on land. aquatic toxicity
indicates the threat to organisms in oceans and fresh water
from toxic substances. human toxicity specifically indicates
the threat to people. many poisonous substances exist, for
example heavy metals, salts and organic compounds. the
potential toxicities of the various substances are considered
in relation to the reference substance 1,4-dichlorobenzene
(1,4-dbeq).
