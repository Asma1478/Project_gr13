                   message from the co-ceos




                                                         madam, sir, dear shareholders,


                                                         in 2015, the solid revenue growth in asia, europe, north america

                                                         premium digital portfolio enabled jcdecaux to reach another year
                                                         of record revenue and profitability. all key financial metrics including

                                                         double-digits.


                              we are very pleased with many contracts wins and renewals, including street furniture in
                              copenhagen, urban transport in helsinki, buses in hong kong island, the metro in guangzhou,
                              as well as airports in rio de janeiro, brasilia and natal in brazil, and medina in saudi arabia –
                              reflecting our strong track record of organic growth.


                              we are also delighted to have successfully implemented our external growth policy. the
                              acquisition in june 2015 of continental outdoor media ranked our group the number one in
                              outdoor advertising in africa, providing us with a presence in 13 new countries. with our 70%
                              stake in eye catcher media, we are speeding up our growth in peru. furthermore, we increased
                              our stake from 32.35 % to 60% in igpdecaux, the leading outdoor advertising company in
                              italy. and with the acquisition of cemusa, we have enhanced our market positions in brazil,
                              spain, italy and the united states with iconic cities such as rio de janeiro, brasilia, madrid,
                              barcelona and, of course, new york city.


                              jcdecaux remains the natural consolidator in the outdoor advertising industry. in 2015, we
                              demonstrated that our financial strength is a major advantage that will allow us to continue to
                              seize targeted growth opportunities as they arise in 2016 and beyond.


                              our digital transformation is also gathering pace. we now have over 50,600 screens in 32
                              countries, accounting for more than 10% of our revenue, with a presence in railway stations,
                              metros, shopping malls, billboards and street furniture. we were awarded the world’s largest
                              bus shelter advertising contract in london which will become our global digital showcase,
                              with 1,000 84-inch screens offering unrivalled display quality, and optimum big data solutions
                              to benefit advertisers and their brands. advertisers will be able to get the right message, at the
                              right place, at the right time for the right audience.

this revolution is only just beginning, and is attracting interest from cities wanting to provide
connected urban services in order to become smart cities. be it through small cells that relay
4g networks, wi-fi and connectivity more generally, or eco-friendly mobility with bike-sharing
scheme, jcdecaux is a driving force for new ideas and is integrating into its products and
services connected objects, big data and all the innovations that are making cities smart, both
now and in the future. this is the mission of jcdecaux link, which was established in 2015 and
has already received recognition, at the small cell world summit.


digital is no longer just a sector – it represents a profound change in our world, with infinite
prospects and stimulating opportunities opening up to us. previously a silo, digital has now
become a real state of mind, and there is no doubt that the cornerstone of this transformation has
been the talent of our teams and their ability to integrate all aspects of the new digital culture. it
is, above all, a human challenge – one that jcdecaux has given a lot of consideration, and which
is fully integrated into our approach to social responsibility and the environment. by adopting an
ambitious sustainable development strategy in 2014 and signing up to the un global compact in
2015, we have demonstrated our intention to pursue growth in a way that is respectful to people
and the environment.


the outlook for 2016 is very promising, even though the global economic environment remains
uncertain. together we are the masters of our destiny and of our ability to deliver creative growth.
we will put our talent, determination and creativity to work to strengthen our business and social
model, by listening so we can embrace change, being constantly alert so we stay one step
ahead, adopting a “test and learn” approach to allow for continuous innovation, and by adapting
and anticipating.


in an increasingly fragmented media landscape we are convinced that out-of-home retains
its strength and attractiveness. moreover, we believe we are well positioned to outperform the
advertising market and increase our leadership position in the outdoor industry. we remain
focused on organic growth and selective value accretive acquisitions.


finally, we would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders for the trust you have
placed in us since our ipo in june 2001.

    •• jcdecaux has announced the launch of self-service electric
        bikes with a lightweight portable battery (where users will
        rent their own personal battery). with its various self-service
        bike programmes around the world, jcdecaux will soon have
        reached 650,000 users, with the bikes combined travelling
        over one billion kilometres. in its twelve years of international
        experience, jcdecaux has installed 52,000 self-service bikes
        and 4,700 docking stations across 70 cities in 13 different
        countries around the world. jcdecaux pioneered this eco-
        friendly, individual but shared form of transport when it
        launched its first bikes in vienna (austria) in 2003. since then,
        it has constantly updated its self-service bike rental schemes
        in order to meet users’ expectations and it now boasts record

        the vodafone partnership (signed in december 2014) as well
        as with other operators, for the development of any type of

     unlike advertising on street furniture, discounts may be granted
     on the group’s catalogue price, in accordance with market
     practices. this practice led jcdecaux to develop a sales aid tool

     format billboard networks. thanks to a “yield management”
     software, the sales teams can monitor, in real time, how the
     supply and demand for billboard networks is evolving and, in this
     way, to adjust any discounts granted to advertisers so as to get
     the best price for each billboard network sold.

operates. this centralisation makes the purchasing of advertising
campaigns simpler for customers seeking to develop a media
strategy on a european or worldwide scale. this also enabled
jcdecaux to prove its leadership in the development, for its
customers, of tools to improve and assess the effectiveness of
the outdoor advertising campaigns.

recently, jcdecaux oneworld carried out international
campaigns for customers such as p&g prestige, calzedonia,
nissan, dolce & gabbana, unilever, hauwei and a number of
film industry customers. centralising resources also enabled
the group to improve international collaborations with l’oreal,
estee lauder and lvmh, particularly in airports where travel
retail customers seek consistent, high quality media delivery
internationally. in 2015, jcdecaux oneworld, with the benefit of
the jcdecaux international network, also collaborated closely
with a number of companies in the film industry to make it simpler
to launch products in a large number of countries at the same
time.

capitalising on the continued successes over seven years
by simplifying the worldwide coordination of relations with
its international customers, the group benefited from new
resources on a geographic basis in 2015 with the first full year
of sales representation in miami. even though they are part of
the jcdecaux oneworld teams, this team also works in close
collaboration with the marketing teams in the united states and
latin america, to simplify interactions with the group’s customers
established in this area. jcdecaux feels that this has enabled
international customers to have better access to the worldwide
range of its products, and that this will also encourage smaller
customers to user jcdecaux services when expanding in new
markets.

once the strategic challenges were identified by the materiality matrix, jcdecaux was able to define its sustainable development
strategy in line with the company’s business strategy, the business activities of its subsidiaries and the expectations of its stakeholders.

this strategy, which defines the priorities actions for the group and its subsidiaries, is deliberately focused on six operational priorities,
with associated action plans and qualitative and quantitative targets.

     environment, social and stakeholder.
     the aim of this strategy is to structure the sustainable development priorities for the whole group, on a shared and cross-disciplinary
     basis.

the topics identified in the materiality matrix that were not included in the sustainable development strategy were not thought
to be without importance to the group. these “other” topics are also monitored by the relevant operational departments and reported
on in the following chapters: “our environmental commitment”, “our social commitment” and “our stakeholder commitment”.

     this application enables the capture, control and consolidation of
     the indicators, the publishing of reports and, finally, the provision
     of the necessary documentation for data collection and for the
     control of information feedback.

     the feedback of data from group subsidiaries is based on the
     network of reporting correspondents charged with collecting,
     monitoring and validating extra-financial data at the subsidiary
     level.

     the extra-financial data collection campaigns are conducted
     quarterly for “flow” indicators (e.g.: energy consumption,
     generated waste, etc.) and annually for “stock” indicators
     (e.g.: breakdown of employees). quarterly data collection makes
     the information communicated by the subsidiaries more reliable.
     data is prepared as at 31 december each year.

     absenteeism is broken down by cause in order to report results related to the deployment of the health & safety and social priorities
     of the sustainable development strategy.

     the breakdown of absenteeism for illnesses and accidents and for other causes was down slightly in 2015, from 4.5% to 4.2%
     and from 2.2% to 2.0% respectively, due in particular to the implementation of an absence management policy in the rest of the world,
     and an increase in the reliability of the information on other causes in north america.

     our social commitment


     in 2015, the average length of service within the group was 9.3 years and ranged from 5.2 to 12.7 years depending on regions. france,
     the group’s country of origin, has the longest average length of service, 12.7 years. the differences in length of service are explained
     mainly by the more recent presence of the group in certain high-growth geographic regions, such as asia-pacific where the average
     length of service is 5.2 years.


     state of collective agreements

     jcdecaux attempts to reach formal agreements that are fair to all, in all circumstances. free expression and constant dialogue with staff
     representatives are encouraged within the group. this contributes to the smooth running of the company and promotes compliance
     with regulations on employee rights.

for jcdecaux’s commitment towards sustainable development
to be a success, it is vital that all its employees support it. in their
occupations, through their actions and their daily behaviour,
they give meaning to the commitment and values conveyed by
the group. giving employees the keys to become sustainable
development ambassadors is a major challenge.

           ❱❱ focus on business ethics

                                          in a context of substantial internationalisation, jcdecaux is confronted with a large number
                                          of ethical challenges. the group has been committed for a long time to behaving ethically.
                                          jcdecaux's anti-corruption principles were formalised in the code of ethics published for
                                          the first time in 2001 and updated in 2005 and 2009. in 2014, the code of ethics was
                                          republished to fit the operational issues that may be faced by the group’s employees and
                                          to integrate the evolution of the legislation, especially the uk bribery act. in 2014, the code
                                          of ethics was complemented by the group internal procedure for appointment and
                                          management of advisers.

                                          jcdecaux is aware that the portion of its business located in countries considered
                                          sensitive, from the corruption point of view, is increasing both due to its organic growth and
                                          its external growth. jcdecaux pays particular attention to potential corruption risks during
                la charte ethique         the checks carried out during external growth operations. guaranteeing business ethics is
                   édition 2014           therefore a crucial and strategic issue for the group.

                                         to head off the risk of corruption, the group created a number of specific internal documents
                                         and procedures. the 2014 edition of the group's code of ethics, setting out all the rules
                                         and principles of ethical behaviour to follow in the conduct of business, ensures the
                                         group works in a responsible and sustainable manner towards its employees, customers,
                                         suppliers, local and regional communities and competitors. all the themes addressed by
  the code are subject to internal audit and incorporated within the risk management process. there is a practical guide, in the
  company’s internal version of this code, to go with each rule and principle to help the employee understand it.

  the group's internal procedure for appointment and management of advisers, created in 2014, defines internally the measures
  to avoid corruption acts committed by them.

  this code and the group's internal procedure for appointment and management of advisers were translated in 15 languages
  and are available for employees on the group's intranet. a public version of the code is available in the sustainable development
  section of the group’s website.

  an alert procedure was set up and is managed by the group’s ethics committee. this committee is comprised of the chairman
  of the audit committee, who is an independent member of the supervisory board, the chairman of the compensation and
  nominating committee and the director of internal audit. the committee’s task is to ensure the compliance with the fundamental
  ethical rules, set out in the code of ethics, crucial for the existence and development of the group.

  that the code simply exists is not enough. each employee must be provided with the means to act in compliance with the
  provisions of the ethical rules of the group. in 2015, each of the 3,900 employees identified as those whose functions can commit
  the group, with public administrations, customers and suppliers, signed the code of ethics and the group's internal procedure for
  appointment and management of advisers.

  this distribution and individual acceptance is complemented with specific training on the fight against corruption, to be deployed
  in 2016. this training is part of our continuous effort to have our values fully understood by training new employees and maintaining
  those already in the company up to standard. our ambition is to measure ourselves against the highest standards.

where group companies are active in several business segments, they are grouped according to their dominant segment. where
minority operations are significant, the revenues, operating margin and ebit of the companies involved are allocated to the various

segments.

      the group’s defined employee benefit obligations mainly consist
      of retirement benefits (contractual termination benefits, pensions
      and other retirement benefits for senior executives of certain
      group subsidiaries) and other long-term benefits paid throughout
      the employee’s career, such as long service awards or jubilees.
      the group’s retirement benefits mainly involve france, the united
      kingdom and austria.
      in france, termination benefits paid at retirement are calculated
      in accordance with the “convention nationale de la publicité”
      (collective bargaining agreement for advertising). a portion of
      the obligation is covered by contributions made to an external
      fund by the french companies of jcdecaux group.
      in the united kingdom, retirement obligations mainly consist
      of a pension plan previously opened to some employees of
      jcdecaux uk ltd. in december 2002, the vesting rights for this
      plan were frozen.
      in austria, the obligations mainly comprise mandatory termination
      benefits.

the debt on commitments to purchase non-controlling interests is recorded separately and therefore is not included in the financial
debt. they are described in note 4.14 “debt on commitments to purchase non-controlling interests”.

hedging financial instruments are described in note 4.15 “financial instruments”.

the reconciliation of the cash flow variance with the change in financial debt is detailed in note 6.4 “reconciliation between the cash
flows and the change in the net financial debt”.

the debt analysis presented hereafter are based on the economic financial debt, which is equal to the gross financial debt on the

       following the simplified public tender offer (opas) launched by jcdecaux sa in june 2015 at a unit price of 40, 12,500,000 shares were repurchased on
       17 july 2015, and then subsequently cancelled. as a result, the number of options previously granted and still outstanding at the date of the opas was adjusted
       by an adjustment coefficient of 1.0056. the exercise price of the options was also adjusted to ensure that the effects of the opas on the rights of option holders
       would be neutral.
        the adjustment related to the opas had no impact on the ifrs 2 “share-based payment” charge.

 for fixed-rate assets and liabilities, the maturity indicated is that of the asset and the liability.
 the interest rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities are adjusted every one, three or six months. the maturity indicated is therefore less than one year regardless

foreign exchange risk

in 2015, net income generated in currencies other than the euro accounted for 71% of the group’s consolidated net income.

despite its presence in more than 75 countries, the jcdecaux group is relatively immune to currency fluctuations in terms of cash flows,
as the subsidiaries in each country do business solely in their own country and inter-company services and purchases are relatively
insignificant.

however, as the presentation currency of the group is the euro, the group’s consolidated financial statements are affected by the
conversion of financial statements denominated in local currencies into euros.

based on the 2015 actual data, the table below details the group’s consolidated net income and reserves exposure to a (10)% change

      business guarantees correspond to guarantees issued whereby
      the company guarantees, either directly or through counter-
      guarantees, the performance of agreements by its subsidiaries.

      the “other guarantees” line item consists of the guarantees
      issued in respect of settlement of lease payments, financial debt,
      for certain subsidiaries or counter-guarantees to banks within
      the scope of collateral security granted to certain subsidiaries. it
      should be noted that the amount of the guarantees with regard to
      financial debt (credit facilities and bank overdrafts) and collateral
      security corresponds to the actual amount used as of the closing
      date.

      commitments on securities are mainly granted and received in
      the context of external growth transactions.

      as part of the shareholders agreements, jcdecaux sa may grant
      or be granted purchase agreements (calls) should contractual
      clauses not be respected. the group and its partners benefit
      from pre-emptive rights under certain partnership agreements,
      and can provide for emptive or option rights, which the group
      does not consider as commitments given or received. moreover,
      the group does not record commitments subject to exercise
      conditions that limit the likelihood of their occurrence.

      subsidiaries conduct most of their business locally (sales to local
      advertisers, local operating expenses, etc.). thus, there exists

      does business. the group’s principal subsidiaries are located in
      france (19.1% of revenue in 2015), the united kingdom (11.5%

      to the subsidiaries in proportion to the gross margin of revenue
      that they represent, when they involve general assistance, and

        statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements


           to the shareholders,

           in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year
           ended december 31, 2015, on:

           • the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of jcdecaux s.a.;

           • the justification of our assessments;

           • the specific verification required by law.

           these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the executive board. our role is to express an opinion
           on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.




      1. opinion on the consolidated financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.
      an audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the
      amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
      policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
      statements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

      in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of
      the group as at december 31, 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with international financial
      reporting standards as adopted by the european union.



      2. justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (“code de commerce”) relating to the justification
      of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:

      •• 	items of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investments accounted for under the equity method
         are subject to impairment tests based on the prospects of future profitability according to the method described in notes
         1.10 “impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and goodwill” and 1.11 “investments under equity method”
         to the consolidated financial statements, which results are described in notes 4.3 “goodwill, property, plant and equipment (pp&e),
         and intangible assets impairment tests” and 4.4 “investments under the equity method and impairment tests” to the consolidated
         financial statements. we have assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied and of the data and assumptions used by
         your group to perform these valuations. on these bases, we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of these estimates.

      •• 	note 1.19 “commitments to purchase non-controlling interests” to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting
         treatment of purchase commitments for non-controlling interests, which is not specifically described in ifrs as adopted
         by the european union. we have assessed that this note gives the relevant information as to the method applied by your group.

        statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements


           to the shareholders, 		

           in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your shareholders’ general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the
           year ended 31 december 2015, on:

           • the audit of the accompanying financial statements of jcdecaux sa;

           • the justification of our assessments;

           • the specific verifications and information required by law.

           these financial statements have been approved by the executive board. our role is to express an opinion on these financial
           statements based on our audit.




      1. opinion on the financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
      involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
      and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
      reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that the audit
      evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

      in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the company
      as at 31 december 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with french accounting principles.



      2. justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (“code de commerce”), we bring to your
      attention the following matter:

      investments in subsidiaries are subject to impairment tests based on the prospects of future profitability according to the method
      described in note 2.2.1.3 “long-term investments” (“2.2.1.3 immobilisations financières”) to the financial statements.

      we have assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied as well as the data and assumptions used by the company
      to perform these valuations. based on this information, we assessed the reasonableness of these estimates.

      these assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed
      to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

3. specific verifications and information
we have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in france, the specific verifications required
by french law.

we have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the
management report of the executive board, and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position
and the financial statements.

concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article l. 225-102-1 of the french commercial code

favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial
statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company
or controlled by it. based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.
