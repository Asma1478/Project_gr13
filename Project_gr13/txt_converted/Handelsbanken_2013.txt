sustainability at handelsbanken
one of handelsbanken’s most important assets is the confidence of customers, public authorities
and the general public. a condition for this confidence is that the bank’s operations are subject to
high ethical standards and responsible actions, and that employees of the bank conduct them-
selves in a manner that upholds confidence.

solid growth

culture and method of working.
   in addition to our internal steering documents and guidelines that govern handelsbanken’s
actions, the bank is also a member of the voluntary initiatives global compact and principles for
responsible investment (pri), which are both un initiatives aimed at companies. these principles
are in keeping with the values and principles that already apply at handelsbanken. handelsbanken
will also continue to support the un global compact and pri principles in the year ahead.

our concept and organisation
handelsbanken is a full-service bank with a decentralised working method, a strong local presence due
to nationwide branch networks and a long-term approach to customer relations. handelsbanken primarily
grows by opening new branches in locations where the bank has not previously had operations.

    handelsbanken’s way of working can best be depicted by an arrow where all the operations focus on the customer. the branches are closest to the customer and are
    responsible for the bank’s customers on their local market. each home market has its own national organisation with responsibility for the proﬁts of the branch operations.
    for our customer offering to be of the highest quality, we have a number of central business areas where product owners design and develop our products and solutions.
    the central head ofﬁce also has administrative functions and specialist departments with overarching responsibility for various functions at the bank.

  corporate governance structure
  the shareholders ultimately make the decisions about handelsbanken’s governance. at the annual
  general meeting (agm), the shareholders appoint the board, the chairman of the board and auditors,
  and decide how the nomination committee will be appointed. the board is responsible to the
  owners for the bank’s organisation and management of the bank’s affairs, and it appoints a group
  chief executive (ceo) to run the bank’s operating activities. on behalf of the shareholders, the
  auditors examine the financial reporting, etc., and report to the agm on their findings. the diagram
  below summarises how governance and control are organised at handelsbanken.

ethical matters related to lending
an important matter in terms of ethics and
principles is the extent to which the bank should
bear the responsibility for what its customers do.
this could, for example, apply to a borrower who
runs a company that manufactures products
that are dangerous to health, with an adverse
environmental impact, or that does not permit
its employees to exercise their union rights.
    handelsbanken’s view is based on the princi-
ple that it is the customer that is fully responsible
for its operation and how they are run. however, a
fundamental condition for handelsbanken’s lend-

ing is that the operation is legally compliant and
fulﬁls all requirements from public authorities in
terms of environmental questions and other sus-
tainability matters. in the bank’s home markets,
which are countries with advanced legislation
regarding health protection, the environment
and union rights, there are public authorities that
monitor compliance with laws and directives.

    ethical matters are manifested, among other

fundamental principles of working conditions and
environmental considerations, regardless of where
in the world the operations are pursued.
