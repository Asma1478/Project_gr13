chairman’s message

dear stakeholders,
as we continue our relentless march towards sustainable development
practices, it is my privilege to present our third sustainability report
prepared in accordance with global reporting initiative (gri) guidelines.
sustainability development in sail continues to gain increasing
prominence and strategic importance in our quest for an improved triple
bottom line. we wholeheartedly imbibe mantra of ‘doing well by doing
good’.
this year was another challenging one for sail as well as for the entire
steel industry, due to a slow-down in demand, lowering of steel prices and
consequent impact on profitability. sail is overcoming these pressures by augmenting production of value
added products, improving capacity utilization and operational efficiency. our plants have taken various
initiatives to enhance production, by improving operational discipline and optimizing equipment utilization.
this has led to a significant improvement in operating efficiencies, leading to best ever techno-economic
parameters.
our sustainability initiatives cover the entire spectrum and include water & energy management, bio-diversity
conservation, carbon footprint assessment and reduction initiatives, to name a few. we have also heavily
invested in sustainability training initiatives and compliance with global reporting initiative (gri) norms on
compliance reporting. sail has entered into an mou with government of india to take up sustainable
development (sd) projects such as carbon & water foot printing at plants, bio-diversity conservation at iron ore
mine, rain water harvesting and training on sustainability for employees.
to enhance our domestic market share and to meet future challenges, we are working on a long term strategic
plan ‘vision 2025’ which is to steer the company towards the target of 50 million tonnes of hot metal output.
through our ongoing modernization & expansion programme, sail is addressing the vital issues of elimination
of technological obsolescence, installation of energy efficient & environment friendly technologies, value
addition/ product-mix improvement/ sustenance of existing assets of the plants and introduction of customer
centric processes along with capacity building.
towards its march for sustainable development, sail has always encouraged research and development
initiatives. an r&d master plan is being implemented which consists high impact projects and technology
mission projects, is aimed at integrating r&d activities towards business and operational goals. implementation
of this master plan will enable sail to improve efficiencies, reduce cost, meet market demand, upgrade current
steel technologies and improve solid waste management.
sail has always been at the fore-front of adopting emerging and innovative technologies. in this direction a jv
has been formed with the kobe steel japan for adopting itmk3 technology, which shall gainfully utilize low-
grade iron ore fines generated during mining and production processes, for iron making.
a number of proactive environmental initiatives were taken during the year, yielding noteworthy improvement
with respect to vital environmental parameters. this has resulted in improvement of 45% in particulate matter
emissions, 16% in utilization of bf slag, 13% in specific effluent discharge and 5% in specific water consumption
in the last five years. along with the same, a reduction of around 4% has been achieved in specific energy
consumption during this period.
most of our units, including mines, plants and warehouses are operating in conformance with iso 14001:2004
standards for maintaining environment management system, while several more are in the process of
implementing ems. initiatives like eco-restoration of mined-out areas, plantation of trees in and around units,
greening of warehouses and other environmental projects have been undertaken. also, most of our units are
certified to iso 9000 standards for quality management system, sa 8000 for social accountability and ohsas

18001 for occupational health and safety. in addition some of our production processes are certified confirming
to relevant international standards for manufacturing of specific products.
sail believes that employees are the backbone of an organization and the company has achieved present level of
operational efficiency through investing in the human resource. we provide an environment conducive for
learning, encourage adoption of best practices and nurture creativity and innovativeness among employees. hr
initiatives are focused on developing team spirit, employee empowerment and their involvement in various
improvement activities. as a result of these initiatives, this year also, sail employees have secured highest
number of vishwakarma awards and prime minister’s shram awards.
our focus on social responsibility remains unwavering. our community outreach initiatives have been
significant and have extensively benefitted the communities that we operate within. our societal initiatives have
focused around improved basic & specialized healthcare, provision of modern education, rural infrastructure
development and improved access to drinking water. some of the notable initiatives that sail took in 2012-13
include, operating 7 health centres at plants exclusively for providing free medical care to poor and needy
families; organizing more than 3500 health camps in various villages across the country; supplying around
25000 meals on daily basis to school children in bhilai region; running 7 special schools for underprivileged
children at integrated steel plants locations which provide free education, mid-day meals, transport, text books
and other required items. in order to bridge the disparity between rural and urban areas as well as to provide
comprehensive development of both physical and social infrastructure, 79 villages have been identified and
developed as “model steel villages” across the country (in 8 states). the developmental activities undertaken in
these villages include medical and health services, education, roads and connectivity, sanitation, community
centres, livelihood generation, sports facilities etc.
our enduring focus on three-pronged strategy of economic development, environmental stewardship and social
responsibility has resulted in the coveted cii-itc sustainability award being conferred upon sail in january
2013.
in conclusion, i quote kofi annan, seventh secretary-general of united nations, ‘we thrive and survive on
planet earth as a single human family and one of our main responsibilities is to leave to successor generations a
sustainable future’. we echo the same sentiment and firmly believe that we have not inherited the world from
our forefathers but rather borrowed it from our children and we owe it to them to bequeath it in a better shape.
with best compliments.

these initiatives to operational levels in our quest for being a good corporate citizen. sail being a cpse,
 the performance of the sail board is evaluated by mos, goi.
our board comprises of both full time executive and non-executive directors. the board appointees are selected
through the public enterprises selection board and provide an eclectic combination of elite skills and work
experience to drive our corporate governance agenda forward. as on 31st march, 2013, the board of directors
comprised a full time chairman, 6 whole time directors and 9 non-executive directors (including
7 independent directors). during the year, 11 board meetings and one annual general meeting were held.

accountability and transparency in our operations. they also help to ensure that the enterprise level initiatives
have been well translated and drilled down to the unit and individual level.

focuses on the finalization of the performance related pay (prp) for the company executives. this is done with an
objective of ensuring a fair and transparent pay structure aligned with performance and is in conformance with

diversity conservation at bolani iron ore mine, rain water harvesting and sustainability training exceeding
10000 man-hours across the company, including exclusive interaction for sail board of directors with global
reporting initiative (gri) sustainability experts.

bio-diversity conservation
in the present scenario of climate change and global warming eco-restoration is an important element that can
reap immediate sustainability benefits. there are several suitable locations at sail units where afforestation
technique has been used to mitigate the effects of global warming and climate change. a distinctive project has
been taken up to restore 75 acres of degraded area at bolani iron ore mine for ecological restoration and
rehabilitation as a model for sustainable development, bio-diversity conservation and co2 mitigation strategy.
the central objective of this project is restoring ecosystem functions and services in the selected area, with a
larger view of directly enhancing the livelihood sustainability of the local people using the expertise of center for
environmental managment of degraded ecosystem (cemde), university of delhi and ambedkar university,
delhi.


global reporting initiative (gri) and sail
during the year, sail became the first founding member of the gri focal point india consortium to steer
sustainability activities in india. gri and sail, together with other institutions, are establishing a core network
of sustainability partners to create and implement best practice sustainability models across various sectors. the
first meeting of the consortium was held at the sail corporate office in new delhi.

sustainability model
business sustainability is often defined as managing the triple bottom line - a process by which companies
manage their financial, social and environmental risks, obligations and opportunities. these three impacts are
sometimes referred to as profits, people and planet.

however, this approach relies on an accounting based perspective and does not fully capture the time element
that is inherent within business sustainability. a more robust definition is that business sustainability represents
resiliency over time – businesses that can survive shocks because they are intimately connected to healthy
economic, social and environmental systems. these businesses create economic value and contribute to healthy
ecosystems and strong communities.
business sustainability requires firms to adhere to the principles of sustainable development. according to the
world council for economic development (wced), sustainable development is development that “meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” so, for

industrial development to be sustainable, it must address important issues at the macro level, such as: economic
efficiency (innovation, prosperity, productivity), social equity (poverty, community, health and wellness,
human rights) and environmental accountability (climate change, land use, bio-diversity).

some of the management tools and concepts at sail
•   ensuring citizen-centric focus across all its processes by adopting total quality management (tqm)
    principles for improvement of products and services.
    most of our plants and units are certified to iso 9001:2008, ems iso 14001:2004, ohsas 18001:2008 and sa
    8000:2008 management systems. during the financial year 2012-13, rsp was certified to social
    accountability standard (sa 8000:2008) and dsp was certified to information security management system
    (isms) iso 27001:2005. under the umbrella project of “greening of warehouse”, hyderabad warehouse
    and export stockyard, btso, vizag were taken up for implementation of ems: iso 14001:2004 during the
    financial year 2012-13 and both the sites have been certified.
•   enterprise scorecard (esc)
    enterprise scorecard (esc) not only brought integration with memorandum of understanding (mou) with
    government of india and annual business plan (abp) of the company but also facilitated deployment of
    these across various leadership levels. it facilitated deployment of organisational strategy through strategic
    objectives and key initiatives. esc 2012-13 was aligned upwards with abp & mou; deployed downwards
    through unit scorecards, functional scorecards and departmental scorecards and addressed the long term
    and short term issues.
•   introduction of customer centric processes such as enterprise resource planning (erp) and
    manufacturing execution system (mes)
    sail has been moving ahead in innovative usage of information technology (it). as a step towards this,
    enterprise resource planning (erp) has been implemented stage wise at bsp, dsp, bsl, cmo and rsp
    during 2009-2012.
    manufacturing execution system (mes) has been implemented at bsp. mes implementation has enabled
    detailed planning, scheduling and status monitoring of orders at the relevant shops.
•   developing skills and capabilities of employees to improve manpower utilization and labour productivity
    is the key thrust area of human resource management (hrm)
in addition, quality circles, suggestion schemes, shop improvement workshops also offer multiple avenues for

supported mainly by emerging markets and developing economies, while growth in advanced economies
would remain flat.
world crude steel production grew at 0.7% reaching 1547 million tonnes (mt) in 2012, as per world steel
association (wsa). the growth in production, coming mainly from asia and north america, was considerably
subdued as compared to 7.3% growth in 2011. japan, the second largest steel producer in the world, after china,
recorded negative 0.4% growth in crude steel production in 2012 over 2011. us produced 88.7 mt of crude steel
in 2012, growing at 2.7% over 2011. of the bric nations, only brazil recorded a decline in crude steel production
in 2012 at (-) 2%; russian and indian crude steel production grew by 2.2% and 5.6%respectively. china accounted

energy and climate change
energy security can only come about by sincerely addressing the efficient consumption of fuel. in the steel
industry, energy cost constitutes almost 40% of the total cost of production. in view of the high cost of energy,
sail has undertaken various measures like optimisation and improvement of existing technologies,
introduction of new technologies, etc, resulting in the decrease of specific energy consumption from 6.806
gcal/tcs to 6.678 gcal/tcs during the last 3 years. the lowest ever coke rate at 512 kg/thm was achieved this
year, with an improvement of 1% over last year. this is possible primarily because of higher usage of coal dust
injection at 54 kg/thm as compared to 51 kg/thm achieved last year.

greenhouse gas emissions have to be curtailed to ensure a sustainable planet. towards this objective, the prime
minister’s national action plan for climate change (napcc), calls for india to reduce its ghg intensity by
20-25% by the year 2020. napcc envisages a sustainable future for the country through multi-pronged actions
ranging from energy efficiency to forest conservation to greater share of energy from renewable sources. a
concerted transition to alternative cleaner energy sources is essential to address the issues of climate change.
sail has taken up the following projects involving renewable energy:
    • solar power system of 2 x 100 kwp capacity installed at bhilai niwas in bsp.
    • continued use of bio-diesel in locomotives within the plant premises at bsl & bsp.
    • use of coal bed methane as fuel at bsl and sgw, kulti.

remote villages in the vicinity of many sail
units have been provided with solar street
lighting. most of the sail guest houses have
been fitted with solar energy panels for heating
of domestic water and steel plant townships
have several lanes fitted with solar lights.
the response to climate change is a critical factor
in the performance of business, as it provides an
opportunity to strengthen the organisation for
future growth. climate change regulations have
the potential to affect the competitive sectors of
any organisation impacting the trade flows and
profits. hence the need for a structured

approach to mitigate the impact of climate
change, the key drivers of which include regulation, stakeholder expectations, revenue generation and cost
reduction.
the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, furnace oil and other petroleum and coal based products at various
process units results in emission of green house gases, mainly carbon dioxide. various functional units of sail
which contribute to the emission of co2 are coke ovens, sinter plant, blast furnace, steel melting shop, mills,
power plant and other auxiliary shops. the other indirect relevant greenhouse gas emissions are:
     • emissions during transportation of raw materials from captive mines and other sources
     • emissions during transportation of products to customers
     • emissions due to movement of employees by two wheelers / four wheelers
sail is participating in the world steel association (wsa) initiated new climate change policy for co2
reduction in steel companies through global sector approach. co2 intensity data for the last three financial years
is given below:
                                                                     co2 intensity for last three

for maintaining and enhancing increased production capacity. sail plants have adopted suitable water
management strategies to preserve this important resource. assessment of the discharged water from various
units is carried out to identify areas that need improvement to reduce consumption of fresh make-up water. the
maximum amount of water at production sites is used in process cooling, scrubbing flue gases and downstream
rolling mills. the main sources for industrial and domestic purposes at sail steel plants are regional surface
waters and units are strategically located near to perennial water sources. the withdrawal of water does not
affect the sources.

various measures like increased recycling, installation of recirculation systems, maximizing reuse of treated
water, up-gradation of water systems and control of leakages have resulted in making sail steel plants more
water efficient. the specific water consumption decreased from 4.06 m3/tcs to 3.73 m3/tcs over the last three
years, a reduction of 8.1%


initiatives taken during the year to reduce fresh water consumption include:
•    the recycling of effluent from 30 mld sewage recycling plant started from may 2012 at bsp.
•    water foot print studies at bsp.
•    implementation of system for recirculation of rim spray water at wheel & axle plant at dsp.
•    renovation of gas seal water line at new sinter plant at dsp.
•    renovation of makeup water line at 1.6 mt cooling tower at coke ovens at dsp.
•    plugging of leakages of various pipelines at rsp.
•    action initiated for installation of rain water harvesting system at crm-ii complex at bsl.
•    rain water harvesting schemes in various units at ssp.
•    re-circulation of blast furnace etp clarified water back in the system at visl.


sail plants have planned and initiated various water conservation activities with an ultimate objective to
achieve zero water discharge. during the period 2012-13, out of approximately 213 million cubic meters of
industrial make-up water withdrawn, approximately 58 % was re-cycled back to the process.

also contributed to the reduction of particulate
matter emission. the specific emission of
particulate matter has reduced from 1.11 kg/tcs in 2010-11 to 0.88 kg/tcs this year; a reduction of 21% over three
years. emissions of so2 are reduced by the exclusive use of coal with low sulphur content, while for nox control,
special burners are installed and process related changes have been incorporated.
to preserve the water quality, plants meticulously maintain effluent treatment facilities, thus improving water
recirculation efficiency and the quality of the discharged effluent. bsp and bsl are provided with centralised
water recirculation systems while dsp and rsp have localised water recirculation systems. the quality of
recirculation water is maintained by dosing with conditioning chemicals for controlling corrosion, scale deposits
and bacterial growth. no-dig technology is adopted in some of the units to remove hard deposits in
underground return water trunk lines.

there have been no cases of significant fines and sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and
regulations against sail during the year 2012-13. a few sail plants submitted time-bound action plans along
with bank guarantee in response to the directives issued by regulatory authorities for occasional non-
compliance with the applicable environmental laws.

by implementing an undp project, sail plants have stopped using ozone depleting substances (ods) in their
respective electrical repairing shops and oxygen plants. sail plants have also reduced use of ods in
refrigeration with an aim to achieve to replace the same with non-ods.

hazardous waste management

hazardous waste management at sail is being followed as per guidelines of central pollution control board.
hazardous waste generated in plants are recycled; sold to authorised agencies; disposed of in secured land fills;
or sent for disposal to state pollution control board authorised common hazardous waste storage treatment &
disposal facility, depending on the type of waste generated. no hazardous wastes were shipped
internationally.

to reduce the pollution due to vehicular movement, the company uses rail transportation for movement of raw
materials from mines, collieries and other manufacturing units, thereby reducing roads transportation and its
carbon footprint. conveyors are used for the movement of raw materials inside manufacturing facilities.
wherever road transportation is employed, particularly for movement to railheads, the use of covered vehicles
reduces dust pollution.



environmental protection & conservation

sail considers clean environment practice a must for its every industrial activity. the major initiatives taken
towards environment management and pollution control during 2012-13 are portrayed below:

green belt development: extensive afforestation programme has been followed in all plants and mines of sail
in the past; this has been continued in the current year with plantation of more than 2.36 lakhs saplings in and
around sail plants and mines. since the initiation of such programmes, a total of more than 181 lakhs saplings
have been planted.

human resource management (hrm) to business priorities and objectives facilitated steps for ensuring a
smooth transition for upcoming new facilities in the modernization and expansion programme. hr initiatives
also aided in building competent teams with cross functional expertise leading to further enriching of the
repositories of competencies in the company. sail achieved the highest ever labour productivity (lp) of 258
tcs/man/year in the financial year 2012-13.

the hr policy of sail is based on the business thrust areas in tune with the vision statement and corporate plan.
competence mapping is used to impart training to the employees and allows assessing the competence gap of
individual employees which give the input for determining the overall training needs. the effectiveness of the
training plan is evaluated at the reaction, learning and application levels. the training functions are validated by
the apex referral body known as tab (training advisory board), which is headed by chairman, sail, and has as
its members all the directors of the company. the directors take their respective agenda points from the tac
(training advisory committee), which is chaired by ceos and its meeting is attended by zonal and
departmental heads. these bodies generate several organizational learning needs and trust areas which are
included in the annual plans. the training department is also covered under qms and ems. every shop has its
own training coordinator who is responsible for imparting training in various areas along with the identified
trainers.

pre-employment and post operative training is given by the plant-level training institute for training operatives,
trade apprentices and graduate engineers. different steel plant visits are organized by training department also.
this exercise has resulted in broadening of outlook of the employees, learning good practices, better awareness
and a sense of pride. "system of mentoring" has been introduced in all sail units to train the management
trainees. main objective of such system is to stimulate and manage the individual growth necessary for mt's to
deliver a business performance beyond the boundaries of the present levels and beliefs.

the process of monitoring aims to help management trainees in:

    • developing confidence and leadership qualities

    • building strong personal foundation and determining appropriate goals, strategies, tactics & action plans

    • imbibing shared vision, mission and values

responsible corporate citizenship

since its inception in 1973, sail has been playing a pioneer role in the area of corporate social responsibility
(csr). the concept of socio-economic development of the neighbourhoods and communities has been
introduced in sail much before ‘corporate social responsibility’ became a buzzword with an objective to
plough prosperity back into the environment from where strengths emanate, primarily to minimize inequalities,
by providing quality education, healthcare, infrastructure and employment avenues to all, to ensure that man
and nature live in harmony, to preserve the originality and beauty of indian culture while simultaneously
promoting scientific temperament and modern technology. the company’s business philosophy encompasses a
triple bottom line approach.

sail’s social objective is synonymous with csr. apart from the core business, company aims to conduct
business in ways that produce social, environmental and economic benefits to the communities in which it
operates and with this underlying philosophy and a credo to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives,
sail has been structuring and implementing csr initiatives right from the inception. these efforts have seen the
obscure villages of past, where sail plants are located, turn into modern town presently.

initially, csr initiatives were carried out in and around steel township and mines and gradually extended to far
flung locations across the country in the area of village development, including development of model steel
villages (msvs), providing medical and health care, immunisation, ante and post natal care, education,
access to water facilities, construction and repair of roads, road side drains & street lights, environmental
initiatives, women empowerment, assistance to people with disabilities, sustainable income generation
through self help groups, promotion of sports, art, culture & recreational activities, preservation of national
heritage etc.

for carrying out social responsibilities, a portion of annual profit after tax (pat) is earmarked every year in line
with dpe guidelines on csr & sustainability. additionally, expenditure to the tune of rs. 2 billion annually is
also incurred on non-sail people living in and around the plant/unit location/townships on account of health,
education, etc. the facilities created in the steel townships at plants/units locations are being used by the local
non – sail population either free of cost or at a very nominal cost. a brief of csr initiatives are summarised
hereunder:

healthcare: this initiative is crucial for generating a positive atmosphere amongst the community which in turn,
maintains the overall performance of the organization. sail has taken cognizance of this and has been closely
involved in ensuring the well-being of community members by establishing primary health centers, hospitals/
super-specialty hospitals and reproductive & child health centers to provide specialized and basic healthcare
to more than 34 million (so far) people living in the vicinity of its plants and units.

to help the poor and downtrodden, 90 numbers of mobile medical units (mmus)/ambulances have been
provided to various ngos since 2007-08, out of these 18 mmus have been provided to various ngos in 2012-13.

opened schools in the steel townships and is providing assistance to run schools. further, seven special schools
(kalyan vidyalaya) has been established at five steel plants for underprivileged students. in these schools free
education, mid-day meals, uniform including shoes, text books, stationary items, school bag, etc. are being
provided to more than 1500 students currently. schemes for scholarships to deserving undergraduate &
postgraduate engineering students, adoption of tribal children for education, sponsoring youths for industrial
training & nursing course are in place for uplifting poor, obc, sc, st and backward communities.

•   gyan jyoti yojana for birhor tribe: a tribe on the verge of extinction

birhor is one of the primitive tribal groups in jharkhand. they belong to the proto-australoid stock and
originated from the austro-asiatic group. it is interesting to note that the birhor tribe of jharkhand consider
themselves as the descendants of the sun and their settlement is known as tanda which consists of at least half a
dozen huts.

due to stark poverty, illiteracy and lack of socio – political awareness they are not aware of their rights and feel
secluded and forced to live in pathetic conditions. to remove the darkness from their life and to bring them into
the mainstream of life, sail’s bokaro steel plant is running a project named “gyan jyoti yojana”.

under this yojna, bokaro steel makes sure that the children of the primitive birhor tribe are provided with the
basic necessities of life. therefore, 15 children of the birhor tribe, a community on the verge of extinction, were
adopted during 2001 to provide them free education under csr initiative and arrangements were made for free
boarding, lodging along with other educational facilities. subsequently in 2010, 6 birhor boys passed out the
matriculation examination, first in their community. the remaining 4 passed in 2011. the year 2012 saw 4 more
birhor students scripting their success story by passing the 12th standard. fresh batch of 15 birhor students had
joined and begins their life in new surroundings. these students are being provided with nourishing and
wholesome food, accommodation in the trainees’ hostel, clothing, free medical treatment along with facilities for
sports and cultural activities.

product responsibility


at sail, product development and product
improvement are constantly undertaken with a
view to improve product performance and
customer satisfaction. sail pioneered in
developing tmt re bars of earth quake resistant
quality and tmt re bars of high corrosion
resistance in addition to development of high
strength rock bolts and other varieties of steel for
safe structures. sail has been in the forefront in
indigenisation effort in warship building by
indian navy. it developed and ensured large scale
commercial production and supply of dmr-249
gr-a and gr-b plates used in production of ins
vikrant, built by cochin shipyard at kochi. sail
is also regularly meeting the requirement of steel
plates in dmr 249 grade a quality, required for
refits of warships.
                                                                             hot metal pouring

stainless steel is one of the proven environment-friendly, recyclable raw materials that strongly support factors
like hygiene, freedom from maintenance, long life in terms of usage and resistance to fire, rust etc.


customer health and safety
sail material is produced as per bi standards and full material is supplied along with test certificates (tc). steel
products are generally environment-friendly and do not pose any health or safety hazard during their use.
therefore, specific procedures for preserving customer health and safety during the use of its products are not
required. the process by-products like slag and some hazardous wastes are also generated during steel making
process. use of safety appliances like safety helmets, boots, gloves etc. is mandatory at all sail units. hazardous
waste handling is done as per the hazardous waste (management and handling) amended rules 2003. sail
plants and units have received authorisation for the same. there has been no incidence of non-compliance with
respect to regulations and voluntary codes concerning health and safety impacts of products and services during
their life cycle.


all sail warehouses are equipped with modern material handling equipment and follow prescribed safety
norms during delivery of material to customers. use of safety appliances like boots, gloves and helmets is
mandatory for labour employed in handling of material.


product stewardship
products made of steel can be fully recycled after reaching the end of their useful lives. recycling reduces the
consumption of raw materials and energy. life cycle study as per world steel association had been carried out
at bhilai steel plant. major recommendations of lca study have already been implemented. technically feasible
recommendations have been envisaged in technology plan for expansion / modernisation of sail plants and
remaining are in the process of implementation. the company’s r&d efforts also aim to develop light- weight,
high- strength, corrosion-resistant steel products which create value for customers during the usage.

most of the sail products are dispatched with minimum or no packaging materials. at bsp the material used in
packaging of steel products are mainly steel straps & wires. similarly, rsp uses galvanised sheets for packaging
material. visl uses mild steel bundling coils for packaging of materials, whereas sru uses packing wood for
refractory items. this packaging material is fully reused at the customer end. at ssp, 15% of the packaging wood
of slabs, received during transportation, is used in packaging of coils.


product and service labelling
all material manufactured at sail steel plants is marked with batch/heat/coil/packet number and can be
tracked to its origin. test certificates are issued along with the deliveries to the customers so that the material can
be identified and there is no mix up and the correct quality gets supplied to the customer. there is no incidence of
non-compliance with respect to regulations and voluntary codes concerning product and service information
and labeling. the stamping and embossing on prime steel products ensures proper product identification. all
norms for physical dimensions, chemical composition and technical delivery conditions for the associated
specifications are strictly adhered to during production and dispatch of various products manufactured by
sail.

total sales. total 31684 tons material was returned on quality
complaints against the total sales of 11.4 million tons. the bench marking score for csi is pegged at 85% for
domestic sales. during 2012-13 average of customer satisfaction index in respect of five integrated steel plants
of sail was 93.6 on a scale of 100. average rating of asp was 4.36 and for visp 4.39 on the 5 point index scale.
