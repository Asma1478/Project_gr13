                                        interview with the stakeholders




                                          as a socially responsible business, incheon airport regards as one of its most important indices its ability to
                                          listen to and reflect the opinions of a diverse range of stakeholders. this includes gathering opinions on how
                                          best to balance work and life issues and improve the work place environment for its employees, and on how to
                                          develop mutually beneficial, win-win relationships with its business partners. at the same time, incheon air-
                                          port listens to and reflects the voices of its customers, as well as constantly monitoring the opinions expressed
                                          by residents surrounding the airport on ways to enhance the development of the local community. this report,
                                          along with information passed on through the communication channels of each of incheon airport’s stakehold-
                                          er groups, gives an account of how incheon airport has listened to and responded to the many valuable and di-
                                          verse opinions expressed by a range of stakeholders.




q1 which service provided by incheon airport impressed you the most?
i think incheon airport’s service is improving every year. the free internet access is very convenient. also, i found it
very thoughtful to extend business hours of the duty free shops near the operating gate for late flyers.

q2 is there anything you would like incheon airport to do?
as has been covered in the media, it is unpleasant for a lot of people to see many smokers right outside the airport
gate. maybe the airport needs to promote the use of the smoking rooms more actively in case the smokers are not
properly informed. also, in order for incheon airport to become a more globally acclaimed airport, it should also cater
to the diverse needs of people, for example, by specifying restaurant menus for the those with religious food choices.

                                                                                                               na bora                customer

                                          q3 as a business partner of incheon airport, which program have you found to be effective for
                                          collaborative activities?
                                          programs like visiting overseas airports and hanmaeum workshop have been good because we are able to
                                          work with other partners. being a giant organization, all subsidiary organizations of incheon airport need to
                                          work in sync and it’s important for us to become part of one incheon airport family through active communication.

                                          q4 is there anything you would like incheon airport to do?
                                          i’d like incheon airport to play the central role in fostering unity and communication among the many subsid-
                                          iary organizations working for the airport.

                                          q3 as a business partner of incheon airport, which program have you found to be effective for
                                          collaborative activities?
                                          recognizing that an airport depends on the organic operation of diverse consultative bodies and organizations,
                                          incheon airport has implemented planning and taken the lead to integrate these involved parties, and this has
                                          been effective in creating many positive results. 6 consecutive wins of asq is a good example of the collective
                                          achievement that comes not just from the airport company’s effort but from all our members doing their best
                                          in their own fields. sharing the excitement of such outcomes unites everyone working at the airport and moti-
                                          vates us to feel part of one big family. the annual sky festival with its high quality performances and variety of
                                          events also functions as a way to strengthen this family-like relationship.

                q6 what is the biggest event related to the last 10 years of incheon airport?
                after the 2nd phase of grand opening, the airport ran without any problem and i was convinced again that in-
                cheon airport was the world’s best airport. nevertheless, i wasn’t sure if it would make the 6th consecutive win-
                ning of asq. however, when it won the world airport service quality evaluation again, i was really proud to be
                working for incheon airport.

                q7 what is your expectation of incheon airport?
                aeropolitics and airport operation infrastructure software may not be very noticeable but they are the most im-
                portant factors in making the best customer service possible. in order to build a favorable reputation among air-
                lines as an airport without any delays in flight, we need to provide: the shortest transition between aircrafts’
                landing point and their respective passenger boarding area, with resultant reduction of fuel use for taxiing; tech-
                nical support for safe take off and landing of aircrafts; and speedy and accurate service at the customs and quar-
                antine. to maintain and further develop its current status incheon airport has to keep continuous communication
                with government organizations and collaboration with the resident businesses at the airport.

                q8 which of the benefits provided by incheon airport serves as practical help?
                among many benefits we receive from the company, i particularly appreciate the provision of general health
                check-ups for each employee and one family member; the support for infertile couples and the availability of pa-
                ternity leave for fathers wishing to care for their young babies at home; the change over plan for parental leave,
                which lessens problems in exchanging positions; and the provision of the yeong jong island company housing
                complex, all of which are great systems that build loyalty and affection towards incheon airport.

                q9 is there anything you would like incheon airport to do?
                besides its quality service, i would also like to see incheon airport become a world leader in all aspects including
                business operation and management system. i hope that incheon airport will soon be able to participate in run-
                ning other airports abroad as a reputable global corporation. that will bring great pride to not only the employ-
                ees but also the people of korea.

                                                      q10 incheon airport is carrying out a joint project for community specialization. what kind of changes

                                                      with the support from incheon airport, our school has set up an education platform that is distinct from urban
                                                      schools and which enabled us become an outstanding school in the airport district. the education program provid-

                                                      having local newspapers or regular promotional materials for the local community would provide easier access to

the area of yeongjong island that incheon airport occupies was once known as ja-yeon island, meaning a
“swallow flying among claret colors”. the current name of yeongjong island takes its meaning from “be-

                               plex into a value generating logistics cluster capable of multimodal transport. in particular, the semiconduc-
                               tor industry has been selected as the main target for this, creating 8,000 tons of additional transport volume
                               and krw 30 billion in added value. in addition, as part of its business model diversification activities, incheon
                               airport is developing the free trade zone into a global transport base as well as an assembly & manufactur-
                               ing base, and has developed a custom-tailored logistics model for which it is actively inviting investments. in-
                               cheon airport is implementing a localized management policy to maximize the growth of aviation logistics.
                               through joint marketing with logistics companies, incheon airport has concluded agreements with 4 new air
                               freight companies including air bridge cargo and qantas, and expanded flights of 5 existing airlines includ-
                               ing polar air, creating 252,000 tons of additional cargo volume, while also securing cargo volume in japan and
                               southeast asia through joint ir with flag carriers.

                               logistics hub. incheon airport integrated information through aircis, a web-based aviation logistics informa-
                               tion system, and is developing related services. to realize the iata e-freight initiative in korea, incheon airport
                               entered into an agreement with the ministry of land, transport and maritime affairs and iata, expanding its
                               information system infrastructure. the phase-2 airport logistics complex plan was revised to secure the basis
                               to grow as the logistics center of northeast asia.

                               expanding connecting passengers
                               in 2010, incheon airport promoted active overseas marketing by presenting its strengths as a transit airport
                               and jointly advertising its connecting flights at 17 cities abroad, including beijing, tokyo and manila, and dis-
                               cussed response to climate change in the changing business environment with related institutions at a coop-
                               erative meeting. as a result, a connecting flight incentive system and 29 transit tour programs, such as the
                               kimchi tour, were developed to attract transfer passengers. in addition, connecting flight guides fluent in for-
                               eign languages were deployed and ease of transit was improved such as by simplifying immigration proce-
                               dures and expanding amenities. the minimum connection time at the airport is 45 minutes, one of the shortest
                               in the world, compared to the world standard of 60~70 minutes. in recognition of such efforts, incheon airport
                               was awarded the best international transit airport award in march 2010, and despite a decrease in connect-
                               ing seats and unfavorable domestic and international unfavorable conditions, successfully secured 5.2 million

                                    more buildings. in spite of this, the overall use of energy throughout the airport increased only by 1.6% to
                                    104,190toe, from which the actual amount of energy used by incheon airport remained at the level of approxi-
                                    mately 60%, which recorded around 1% increase to 61,200toe.

                                    the ratio between electricity consumption by incheon airport and by occupying companies remained at 6 to 4.
                                    the amount of electricity consumed by occupying companies increased by 2.4% due to new sources of con-
                                    sumption by occupying company’s facilities, such as the airport medical center and the construction of the

                            a building energy management standard to enhance its building energy efficiency and is currently developing guide-
                            lines for increasing energy efficiency of buildings. also, in response to national countermeasures to avoid the threat
                            of electricity shortage and for energy saving in general, the temperatures of the airport offices were adjusted to
                            28℃ for air conditioning and 18℃ for heating. in the case of passenger terminals and check-in areas, the heating
                            and air-conditioning are operated at 25℃ and 20℃ respectively, and through regular inspection, coolers that show
                            decreased efficiency are replaced (4 absorption coolers were removed and 2 turbo coolers were replaced in 2010).
                            incheon airport will establish a standard for energy saving construction for the phase 3 airport construction as well,
                            laying the foundation for an eco-friendly green airport.

environmental impact surveys
                                 er businesses, incheon airport carries out environmental impact surveys on ocean and reservoir water qual-
                                 ity, foul smells, radio interference and land pollution. also, environmental impact evaluations are carried out
                                 before construction as a means of prevention, resulting in the establishment and pursuance of environmental
                                 protection measures to prevent destruction of nature or pollution of areas surrounding the airport.

                                 in observance of the soil environment protection act, incheon airport carries out regular inspections to manage
soil pollution control
                                 and preserve soil. according to legal requirements, contamination and leakage inspections were carried out on
                                 the underground oil reserve facilities of central power plant a which became legally subject to inspection from
                                 2010. results of the contamination and leakage inspections of the oil reserve facility showed optimal results
                                 in all criteria.

                                 water quality inspections are carried out four times each year at the running basin at the north south and east
water bodies quality control
                                 of the airport and in 9 locations of the ocean surrounding the airport. the water quality of the running basin
                                 is measured according to 20 criteria including effects of bod, cod, t-n, t-p etc, on the species composition
                                 and existing rates of blue-green algae. ocean water quality is measured by 6 criteria regarding general water
                                 quality and 4 criteria regarding heavy metals. in 2010, results of the ocean water quality inspection in general
                                 showed an average of ph i~ii level in general criteria and level ii in cod, while heavy metals concentration was
                                 within lower than accepted standards.

                                 incheon airport carries out inspections of the ocean and land ecosystems four times each year, to understand

                           first, i would like to congratulate incheon international corporation on the publishing of their 4th social re-
                           sponsibility report. as a truly global and innovative airport, incheon airport has been awarded the title of
                           world’s best airport for the sixth consecutive time in its tenth year since opening. it is notable that this year’s
                           report focuses on both the promotion of sustained accomplishment as the world’s leading airport by the ceo
                           and its commitment to continued efforts in fulfilling its corporate social responsibility and realizing a fair so-
                           ciety through social contribution, win-win cooperation and future oriented labor relations culture. the great-
                           est moving force in the continuation of a company’s social responsibility is the determined willpower of its ceo
                           and board of directors. the joint promotion of the company’s management strategy with its corporate social
                           responsibility strategy, joined together with the activation of the sr operations committee, have built on this
                           foundation, and can be seen as an overall reinforcement of the csr system throughout the corporation. in the
                           report, the main issues have been aptly selected according to global standards to report on its continuation of
                           corporate social responsibility, and important issues such as evaluations of influences on the company and the
                           interests of shareholders have been appropriately selected. the report is specific in setting a csr accomplish-
                           ment index and goals in order to analyze performance.

                           i also highly value incheon airport’s efforts to expand its ethical culture through regular monitoring via a self
                           regulated ethical management index, including the sr operation committee, the incheon airport clean com-
                           pact pledge and the initiation of education, and particularly strict official reporting of corporate management
                           and the results of the transparency diagnosis. as a service industry, incheon airport displays a systematic cs
                           monitoring system and enhanced customer satisfaction through service, while actively enhancing its unique
                           functions as an airport specializing in transfers.

                           in terms of its relationships with partner companies, it is developing a win-win cooperation structure through
                           the conclusion of integrity agreements and the utilization of an online bidding system. support for the foster-
                           ing of local talent and the cultivation of the world peace forest and support for promoting a social corpora-
                           tion in the fields of culture and arts all contribute greatly in developing its social contribution activities. while
                           it pursues the happiness of its employees and ably realizes equal employment and respect of human rights, im-
                           provement could be sought in reinforcing the integration of human rights management throughout the com-
                           pany. incheon airport has followed in the footsteps of the un by proceeding to enhance the abilities of wom-
                           en as one of its central goals of social responsibility, while its additional efforts of gender-equal employment
                           and fostering of talent and setting goals for expansion for the advancement of women into higher-tier manage-
                           ment, show great potential.

                           in the field of environmental management, the establishment of the green growth promotion committee, the
                           pursuing of efficiency through an energy management system for the goal of becoming a green hub airport, the
                           mid term plan for green growth by 2015, and the greenhouse gas emission reduction plan by 2020 are main-
                           tained well. nevertheless, greater exertion could be placed on increasing the utilization of renewable resourc-
                           es by pulling forward the set date for its goal of 10% energy self-reliance, in its target to become the greatest
                           capacity green airport. through consistent increase in passenger and cargo volume, the 7th consecutive year
                           of profitability in financial performance has been accomplished, while in this age of global financial instability,
                           the establishment of a financial risk response system is imperative, making risk prevention in each unit a nec-
                           essary and anticipative measure.

                           finally, as can be seen from its profitability in being a world leading company in its field, incheon airport must
                           integrate its sustainable development plans with the pending financial requirements of continuing to open-
                           ly analyze and respond to matters such as its shares and its role as the world’s best airport. i sincerely hope for
                           the sustained growth of incheon airport as a global expert airport corporation.

                           thank you.
                                                                  secretary general of un global compact
