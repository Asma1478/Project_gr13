     earnings risks
     underwriting risk can be defined in general as a change in value caused by ultimate costs for full
     contractual obligations varying from those assumed when these obligations were estimated. hence,
     underwriting risk realizes as a loss or adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities due to pricing
     and provisioning assumptions on claims payments being different than the actual ones.

             e insurance               risks
                        e underwriting risk s

     in non-life insurance underwriting risk is often divided in premium and reserve risk in order to
     distinguish between the risks related to unexpired and expired contracts.

     premium risk relates to future claims and originates from claim sizes being greater than expected,
     differences in timing of claims payments from expected, and differences in claims frequency from those
     expected. as a result the claims cost for future claims exceeds the expected level and there is a loss or
     adverse changes in the value of insurance liabilities.

     catastrophe risk can be seen as an extreme case of premium risk. it is the risk of low frequency, high
     severity events, such as natural catastrophes. these events lead to significant deviations in actual claims
     from the total expected claims.

     reserve risk only relates to incurred claims, i.e. existing claims, and originates from claim sizes being
     greater than expected, differences in timing of claims payments from expected, and differences in
     claims frequency from those expected. as a result technical provisions are not sufficient to cover the
     cost for already incurred claims and there is a loss or adverse changes in the value of insurance
     liabilities.

     biometric risks refer to the risk that the company has to pay more mortality, disability or morbidity
     benefits than expected, or the company has to keep paying pension payments to the pension policy
     holders for a longer time (longevity risk) than expected when pricing the policies. when a low
     frequency, high severity event leads to a significant deviation in actual benefits and payments from the
     total expected payments, catastrophe risk has realized.

     policyholder behaviour risks arise from the uncertainty related to behaviour of the policyholders. the
     policyholders have the right to cease paying premiums (lapse risk) and may have a possibility to
     interrupt their policies (surrender risk).

    expense risk arises from the fact that the timing and/or the amount of expenses incurred differs from
    those expected at the timing of pricing. as a result expense charges originally assumed may not be
    enough to cover the realized expenses.

                           market riskss

    market risks refer to fluctuations in the financial results and capital base caused by changes in market
    values of financial assets and liabilities as well as by changes in the economic value of insurance
    liabilities. the changes in market values and economic values are caused by movements in underlying
    market variables such as interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and share prices.
    furthermore, market risks include also risk of worsening market liquidity in terms of widening bid-ask
    spreads and the risk of unexpected changes in repayment schedules of assets. in both cases the market
    values of financial instruments in investment portfolios may change.

    risks and returns in different markets are considered when sampo group companies enter into
    investments or sell investments from investment portfolios. the fundamental distinction between market
    risks and underwriting risks is that relating to market risks sampo group is in most cases a price taker
    and not a price giver.

     counterparty risk is part of credit risk. in general credit risk refers to losses arising from occurred
     defaults of debtors (issuer risk) or other counterparties (counterparty risk) or from increases in assumed
     probability of defaults.

     in the case of issuer risk the final loss depends on the investor’s holding of the security at the time of
     default, mitigated by the recovery rate. in most cases issuer risk has already been fully priced as a lower
     market value before the event of default has occurred. in essence credit spread is the market price of
     credit risk. similarly as other earnings risks, spread risk can be actively managed. therefore, it is
     categorized in sampo group under investment portfolio market risks.

     in the case of counterparty risk, the final loss depends on the positive mark-to-market value of
     derivatives or reinsurance recoverables at the time of default and on the recovery rate. counterparty
     credit risk is mitigated by careful selection of counterparties, by diversification of counterparties to
     prevent risk concentrations and by using collateral techniques, e.g. isda master agreements backed by
     credit support annexes.

     opera
     oper        risks
         ational risk s

     operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, from
     personnel or from external events. this definition includes legal risk but excludes risks resulting from
     strategic decisions. the risks may realize for instance as a consequence of:

    •   internal misconduct;
    •   external misconduct;
    •   insufficient human resources management;
    •   insufficiencies in operating policies as far as customers, products or business activities are concerned;
    •   damage to physical property;
    •   interruption of activities and system failures; and
    •   defects in the operating process.

     materialized operational risks can cause immediate negative impact on financial results due to additional
     costs or loss of earnings. in longer term materialized operational risks can lead to loss of reputation and,
     eventually, loss of customers which endangers the company’s ability to conduct business activities in
     accordance with the strategy.

     compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial losses or loss of reputation
     resulting from a company’s failure to comply with laws, regulations and administrative orders as
     applicable to its activities. a compliance risk is usually the consequence of internal misconduct and
     hence it can be seen as a part of operational risk.

cash flows and the market consistent values of assets




     alm risks
     when changes in different market risk variables (interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates) cause a
     change in the fair values of investment assets and derivatives that is of different size than the respective
     change in the economic value of insurance liabilities, the company is exposed to alm risk. it is crucial to
     remember that the cash flows of insurance liabilities are modelled estimates and therefore uncertain in
     relation to both their timing and amount. this uncertainty is a central component of alm risk as well.

     on balance sheet level, alm risks contribute considerably to economic values, risks and capital need.
     sampo group companies analyse alm risks and monitor alm exposures actively and the risks are taken
     into account when managing investments and developing insurance products.

     in addition to the risks relating to fluctuations in market values and economic values, alm risks include
     liquidity risk. liquidity risk is the risk that group companies are, due to lack of available liquid funds
     and/or access to relevant markets, unable to conduct their regular business activities in accordance
     with the strategy, or in extreme cases, are unable to settle their financial obligations when they fall due.
     liquidity risk includes potential illiquidity of investments and unexpected non-renewal of insurance
     policies. moreover, the availability and cost of refinancing and prices of financial derivatives affect the
     group companies’ ability to carry out normal business activities.

     the sources of liquidity risk are either internal or external. if the company’s rating declines or if the
     company’s solvency otherwise appears jeopardised, its ability to raise funding, sign reinsurance
     contracts or enter into financial derivatives at a reasonable price is endangered. moreover, policyholders
     may also not be willing to renew their policies. these effects may realize in a general market turmoil
     situation simultaneously with difficulties to sell investment assets.

     sampo group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining both parent company’s and the subsidiaries’
     creditworthiness and reputation on appropriate level. also, diversification within business operations
     exposed to liquidity risks is sought. in particular the maturity diversification of expected cash flows
     generated from different business activities is under constant scrutiny. since there is no unambiguous
     technique to quantify the capital need for liquidity risk, it is not directly taken into account in capital
     need estimates. thus only the interest rate risk part of alm risks is accounted for in the economic
     capital framework.

     direct concentrations can evolve within separate activities – large single name or industry specific
     insurance or investment exposures – or across the activities when a single name or an industry is
     contributing widely on profitability and risks of the company through both insurance and investment
     activities.

     concentration risk may materialize also when profitability and capital position react similarly to general
     economic development or to structural changes in institutional environment in different areas of
     business. in that case concentration risk can be seen as part of strategic risk.




     reputational risk
     reputational risk refers to the risk that adverse publicity regarding the company’s business practices or
     associations, whether accurate or not, causes a loss of confidence in the integrity of the institution.
     reputational risk is often a consequence of a materialized operational or compliance risk and realizes
     often as a deterioration of reputation amongst customers and other stakeholders.

portfolios are mostly straightforward to analyze. the




     principles of investment portfolio management
     investments (excluding mandatum life’s investments covering unit-linked policies) are managed
     according to the subsidiaries’ investment policies that are based on the features of insurance liabilities
     and solvency.

     the investment portfolios are reported on fair value basis. these fair values are determined either on the
     basis of direct market quotes or by using various valuation models. more information on the valuation
     methods of the investment assets is presented in note 17 in the sampo group financial statements.

     sampo group’s chief investment officer is responsible for managing investments within the limitations
     of the investment policies prepared by the group companies and approved by the group companies’
     boards of directors. the insurance subsidiaries and the parent company have a common group wide
     infrastructure for investment management as well as for performance and risk reporting which facilitates
     simultaneous company level and group level reporting.

     sampo group considers that it has a thorough understanding of the nordic markets and issuers and
     consequently sampo group’s direct investments are mainly made in nordic securities. when investing in
     non-nordic securities, funds or other assets, third party managed investments are mainly used. these
     investments are primarily used as a tool in tactical asset allocation when seeking return and secondarily
     in order to increase diversification.

     market risk control is separated from portfolio management activities in two ways. firstly, the persons
     independent from investment unit prepare investment policies for the board approval. secondly, middle
     office units that are independent from investment unit as well, measure risks and performance and
     control limits set in investment policies on a daily basis. market risks and limits are also controlled by the

     decision making, limit system and monitoring
     1.   potential investments are analyzed thoroughly. the creditworthiness and future prospects of the
          issuer are assessed together with collaterals and structural details of the instruments. although
          external credit ratings by rating agencies and opinions of analysts are used to support the internal
          assessment, sampo group’s own internal assessment is always the most important factor in decision
          making.

          structured to ensure that investment opportunities are assessed prudently, taking into account the
          specific features and risks of all investment types and (iii) able to restrict the maximum exposure of
          a single name risk to the level that is in balance with the company’s risk appetite.
     3.   accumulated credit exposures over single names and products are monitored regularly at the
          subsidiary level and at group level to identify unwanted concentrations. credit exposures are
          reported, for instance, by sectors and asset classes and within fixed income by ratings.

     principles of asset and liability management
     in sampo group, insurance liabilities are the starting point for investment management. insurance
     liabilities are modeled and analyzed to form an understanding of their expected future cash flows and
     their sensitivities to changes in factors such as inflation, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.

     solvency position and risk appetite are defining general capacity and willingness for risk taking. the
     stronger the solvency position and the higher the risk appetite, the more the investment portfolio can
     potentially differentiate from a portfolio replicating cash flows of insurance liabilities.

     rating targets and regulatory requirements are major external factors affecting market and liquidity risk
     taking in general at the balance sheet level, and specifically at the investment portfolio level.

     investments are managed according to the investment policies which are approved by the boards of
     directors of respective companies. asset class allocations, risk limits by risk types, the risk governance
     of investment activities and the decision making authorizations are set in the companies’ investment
     policies in a way that maintains the balance between earnings potential, risks and capitalization also at
     the balance sheet level.

     if p&c and mandatum life are following the above mentioned principles, but they apply it by taking also
     into account the specific characteristics of their own businesses.

market illiquidity risk of investments, and refinancing risk of debt. also the availability and price of refinancing,
financial derivatives and reinsurance can be identified as potential liquidity risks affecting the company’s ability to

in the table, financial assets and liabilities are divided into contracts that have an exact contractual maturity profile, and other contracts.
only the carrying amount is shown for the other contracts. in addition, the table shows expected cash flows for net technical provisions,
which by nature, are associated with a certain degree of uncertainty. in the investment assets of mandatum life, the investments of the

                               operational risks
in sampo group, operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or
systems, from personnel or from external events.

operational risks can realize as an immediate negative impact on financial results arising from additional costs or
loss of earnings. in a longer term, operational risks can materialize for instance as a loss of reputation and
customers which endangers the company’s ability to conduct business activities in accordance with the strategy.
these immediate and longer term effects of operational risk have their general causes in external and internal
drivers. the group companies have their own specific risk sources which are causes of events that may have
negative impacts on different processes, personnel or fixed assets.

     •   the external asset managers and funds managed by them are selected for both companies by the
         same members of sampo group’s investment unit. the funds are mostly allocated to areas outside
         the nordic countries. consequently, the risk of unidentified or unwanted concentrations is relatively
         low.
     •   furthermore, concentrations at group level are actively monitored and, if deemed necessary, further
         managed by deploying group level exposure restrictions, for instance by industries or by individual
         issuers.

requirements are assessed internally as well as                   balance between risks and capital.
according to the methods defined by the regulators.
capitalization is a central subject of discussion also in         in the internal capitalization assessment, the economic
sampo group’s continuous dialogue with the rating                 capital (“ec”) is the starting point for assessing the
agencies. capitalization assessments are conducted                amount of adjusted solvency capital (“asc”).




     economic capital and adjusted solvency capital in sampo group
    •   ec is used as an internal measure of capital required for measurable risks the group is exposed to. ec
        is defined as the amount of capital required to protect the solvency over a one year time horizon with
        a probability of 99.5 per cent that is the calculation basis in solvency ii as well.
    •   ec accounts for market, credit, insurance and operational risks, as well as the diversification effect
        between them. ec is calculated using a set of calculation methods seen suitable for the specific
        needs of each business area.
    •   when assessing the ec need arising from nordea, sampo plc uses the ec calculated and publicly
        reported by nordea multiplied by the proportion of sampo plc’s share in nordea (21.25 per cent at
        the end of 2013). this figure is converted from confidence level 99.97 per cent used by nordea to 99.5
        per cent.
    •   ec is considered to be a good estimate of the capital required to cover risks that can be measured in
        a reliable way and within a normal business environment. however, some of the risks are not
        measurable and there is uncertainty in business environment. hence, when assessing the need of total
        capital, a buffer will be added over the ec reflecting the uncertainty in the business environment as
        well as the effects of low probability and less measurable risks.
    •   as an internal measure of available capital, sampo group uses asc. the basis for asc is capital items
        included in the regulatory solvency capital. on top of those, other risk absorbing items such as the
        difference between the book value and market value (including a risk margin) of technical provisions
        are added.




in the regulatory capitalization assessment, the                  the available capital measured by respective rating
regulatory solvency capital is compared to the                    agency criteria with the capital amount needed to

     risk management process outlook
sampo group companies continuously develop their              if p&c aims to have a partial internal model approved
risk management processes. this work is based on              when solvency ii regulation enters into force.
internal needs and regulatory requirements, of which          mandatum life will use most likely the regulatory
solvency ii has been the most important driver during         standard model for external solvency calculations
the latest years.                                             although it has an internal approach for assessment of
                                                              risks and capital as well.
a separate program was introduced within if p&c in
2007 to ensure that if p&c is well prepared when the          while awaiting the postponed implementation of the
solvency ii regulation enters into force. the program         solvency ii regulation in the eu, common guidelines
has encompassed a thorough review of if p&c’s                 have been issued to the local supervisory authorities.
corporate governance and internal control structure,          the guidelines concern supervision of how the
the risk management system, data capturing as well as         insurance companies prepare for solvency ii regarding
development of the internal capital model. the                the governance system, the forward looking risk
program was finalized in 2012 and                             assessment, supervisory reporting and pre-application
responsibilities were transferred to the line                 of internal models. although if p&c and mandatum
organization. also mandatum life has developed its            life are well prepared in these areas, companies are
processes similarly over the years.                           refining their processes to be fully compliant when
                                                              solvency ii comes into force.

the effect of discounting annuities in p&c insurance is disclosed separately. the provision for annuities is calculated in
accordance with actuarial principles taking anticipated inflation and mortality into consideration, and discounted to take the
anticipated future return on investments into account. to cover the costs for upward adjustment of annuity provisions required for
the gradual reversal of such discounting, an anticipated return on investments is added to annuity results.

the provision for annuities is valued in accordance with normal actuarial principles taking anticipated inflation and mortality into
consideration, and discounted to take the anticipated future investment return into account. to cover costs for the upward
adjustment of annuity provisions required for the gradual reversal of such discounting, an anticipated return is added to the
annuity results. provisions for incurred but not reported losses pertaining to annuities in finland are discounted. the provisions in
2013 amounted to eurm 282 (289). the non-discounted value was eurm 453 (513). the exchange effect on the discounted
provisions was an increase of eurm 9. the acquired businesses increased the the provision by some eurm 9. the real decrease
eurm 15 is partly explained by the model adjustment for motor third party liability and workers' compensation insurances.

fair values for the group's investment property are entirely determined by the group, based on the market evidence. the
determination and hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value are disclosed in note 17. based on the principles of this
determination, the investment property falls under level 2.


the premises in investment property for different segments are leased on market-based, irrevocable contracts. the lengths of the
contracts vary from those for the time being to those for several years.

testing goodwill for impairment

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets. no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests.

for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units, to
which goodwill has been allocated, on the basis of value in use. sampo has defined these cash-generating units as if group and
mandatum life.

the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model. the model is based on sampo’s
management’s best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumes,interest rates, margins,
capital structure and income and cost development. the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long-
term development of insurance liabilities, affecting e.g. the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount. that is
why the forecast period is longer for mandatum life, 10 years. the derived cash flows were discounted at the pre-tax rates of the
weighted average cost of capital which for if was 9.4 per cent and for mandatum life 9.7 per cent. these are somewhat higher
than last year due to the increase in nordic government bonds.

forecasts for if, approved by the management, cover years 2014 – 2016. the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated
using a 2 per cent growth rate. a 2 per cent growth rate for years beyond 2023 has been used for the for mandatum life as well,
as it is believed to be close to the anticipated inflation.

in mandatum life, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 180. with the calculation method used,
e.g. an increase of about 1.4 per cent in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable
amount of the entity would equal its carrying amount.

as for the if group, the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount.

in the table above are presented fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities. the detailed measurement
bases of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in group accounting policies.


the fair value of investment securities is assessed using quoted prices in active markets. if published price quotations are not
available, the fair value is assessed using discounting method. values for the discount rates are taken from the market’s yield
curve.


the fair value of the derivative instruments is assessed using quoted market prices in active markets, discounting method or
option pricing models.


the fair value of loans and other financial instruments which have no quoted price in active markets is based on discounted cash
flows, using quoted market rates. the market’s yield curve is adjusted by other components of the instrument, e.g. by credit risk.


the fair value for short-term non-interest-bearing receivables and payables is their carrying amount.


disclosed fair values are "clean" fair values, i.e. less interest accruals.




                                                                   214

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo group's financial assets are valued at fair value. the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs, where available. for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques.


the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three hierarchy levels in the notes, depending on e.g. if
the market for the instrument is active, or if the inputs used in the valuation technique are observable.


on level 1, the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.


on level 2, inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques.


in level 3, the measurement is based on other inputs rather than observable market data.

sensitivity analysis of fair values

the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilites to changes in exchange rates is assessed on business area level due to differenct
base currencies. in p&c insurance, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against sek would result in an
increase recognised in profit/loss of eurm 12 (15) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 11 (11). in life
insurance, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against eur would result in an increase recognised in profit/
loss of eurm 14 (52) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 68 (64). in holding, 10 percentage point
depreciation of all other currencies against eur would have no impact in profit/loss, but a decrease recognised in equity of
eurm 15 (3).


the sensitivity analysis of the group's fair values of financial assets and liabilities in differenct market risk scenarios is presented
below. the effects represent the instantaneous effects of a one-off change in the underlying market variable on the fair values on
31 dec. 2013.


the sensitivity analysis includes the effects of derivative positions. all sensitivities are calculated before taxes.


the debt issued by sampo plc is not included.

the value of financial assets regarding the debt security instruments has been tested by assuming a rise of 1 per cent unit in
interest rate level in all maturities. for other financial assets, the prices were assumed to go down by 20 per cent. the sampo
group bears no investment risks relatted to unit-linked insurance, so a change in assumptions regarding these assets does not
affect profit or loss. on the basis of the these alternative assumptions, a possible change in interest levels would cause descend
of eurm 2 (3) for the debt instruments, and eurm 161 (177) valuation loss for other instruments in the group's other
comprehensive income. the reasonably possible effect, proportionate to the group's equity, would thus be 1.5 per cent (1.8).

as the p&c insurance is exposed to various exchange rates, comparing the balance sheet data from year to year can be
misleading.

since january 1, 2008, the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1, 2007 regardless of age. the pension
benefits referred to are old-age pension and survivors’ pension in sweden and old-age pension, survivors’ pension and disability
pension in norway. a common feature of all of the pension plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed by the plans
are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the employees’ service period and pensionable salary at the time of
retirement. the dominating benefit is the old-age pension, which refers in part to temporary pension before the anticipated
retirement age and in part to a life-long pension after the anticipated retirement age.


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway. in sweden,
premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65 per cent of the
pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sector’s collective
bargaining agreement of 2006. in norway, premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 per cent of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were employed
by if in 2013.


the anticipated retirement age in connection with life-long pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway. in sweden,
life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10 per cent of the pensionable
salary between 0 and 7.5 income base amounts, 65 per cent of salary between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and 32.5 per cent
between 20 and 30 income base amounts. in norway, life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at
a rate of approximately 70 per cent of the pensionable salary up to 12 norwegian base amounts, together with the estimated
statutory old-age pension. paid-up policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an
amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index. however, there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and
future supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall. pension payments from the norwegian
plans are indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index.


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits. if’s
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums. should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits, if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way. in addition to insured pension plans, there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment.


to cover the insured pension benefits, the related capital is managed as part of the insurers’ management portfolios. in such
management, the characteristics of the investment assets are analysed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations, in a
process known as asset liability management. new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimising the anticipated risk-adjusted return. any surplus that arises from management of
the assets normally accrues to if and/or the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective.


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans, including investment decisions and contributions. the
pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits, the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements.


when applying ias 19, the pension obligations are calculated, as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period, using
actuarial methods. pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period. the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality, employee
turnover and salary growth. the nominally calculated debt is discounted to the present value using an interest rate based on
current market interest rates adjusted to take into account the duration of the company’s pension obligations. as a basis for
determining the discount interest rate for the swedish obligation, if uses liquid covered mortgage bonds issued by a mortgage
institution. covered mortgage bonds are also used for the norwegian obligation. after a deduction for the plan assets, a net asset
or net liability is recognised in the balance sheet.


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions, specifications of pension costs, assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of
the fiscal year. the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden (24.26 per cent) and a
corresponding fee in norway (14.1 per cent).

36 incentive schemes

long-term incentive schemes 2009 i - 2011 i

the board of directors of sampo plc has decided on the long-term incentive schemes 2009 i - 2011 i for the management and key
employees of sampo group. the board has authorised the ceo to decide who will be included in the scheme, as well as the
number of calculated incentive units granted for each individual used in determining the amount of the incentive reward. in the
schemes, the number of calculated incentive units granted for the members of the group executive committee is decided by the
board of directors. over 110 persons were included in the schemes at the end of year 2013.


the amount of the performance-related bonus is based on the value performance of sampo's a share and on the insurance
margin (im) and, regarding the 2011 i scheme, also on sampo's return on the risk adjusted capital (rorac). the value of one
calculated incentive unit is the trade-weighted average price of sampo's a-share at the time period specified in the terms of the
scheme, and reduced by the starting price adjusted with the dividends per share distributed up to the payment date. the pre-
dividend starting prices vary between eur 16.49 - 24.07. the maximum value of one incentive unit varies between eur 28.49 -
39.07, reduced by the dividend-adjusted starting price. in the 2011 i scheme, the incentive reward depends on two benchmarks.
the payout is 70 per cent, if the im is 6 per cent or more, and 35 per cent, if the im is between 4 - 5.99 per cent. no im-related
reward will be paid out, if the im stays below these. in addition, the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account so
that an incentive reward of 30 per cent is paid out, if the return is at least risk free return + 4 per cent. if the return is risk free
return + 2 per cent, but less than risk free return + 4 per cent, the payout is 15 per cent. if the return stays below these
benchmarks, no rorac-based reward will be paid out.


each plan has three performance periods and incentive rewards are settled in cash in three installments. in the scheme 2009 i
when the reward is paid, the employee shall buy sampo's a-shares at the first possible opportunity, taking into account the
provisions on insiders, with 30 per cent of the amount of the reward after taxes and other comparable charges, and to keep the
shares in his/her possession for 2 years. in the 2011 i scheme, the employee shall buy sampo a shares with 60 per cent of the net
amount of reward received. the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout. a premature
payment of the reward may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on
specifically determined bases. the fair value of the incentive schemes is estimated by using the black-scholes princing model.


the longe-term incentive scheme 2009 i ended in september 2013, when the last reward was paid out.
