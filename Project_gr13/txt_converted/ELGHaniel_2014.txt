keynote by
detlef drafz, ceo ­


          dear reader,


          not long ago, elg celebrated its 50th anniversary. as we
     deemed appropriate, we held the celebrations near our corporate
     roots in the heart of the ruhr area in duisburg, germany. we wel-
     comed as participants not only our employees but also representa-
     tives of several of our valued customers and suppliers, colleagues
     from our shareholder haniel, and delegates from many of our
     other trusted business partners.
          when i initiated the compilation of this sustainability report
     and learned of the methods the report was going to be designed by,
     i was pleased to note that at the core of it stands the stakeholder
     dialogue. as our understanding of success is based on continuity
     and relationship building, we are constantly engaged in a dialogue
     with the partners we have achieved success with and may do in the
     future. this is not only because many of them have recently been
     our guests at the anniversary celebrations. instead, it is our experi-
     ence that long-term business success can only grow further with
     solid relationships on the one hand and communication channels
     that are as lively and open as possible on the other.

     in the course of the development of this report, we added to
this principle and conducted a formalized dialogue on sustainability
to learn more about the expectations of our stakeholders in this
regard. it provided great insight into how congruent our own focus
in this respect is with the perception of elg by our shareholder, our
customers, our suppliers, and our financial partners. in particular, the
views and input of our employees served as a valuable indicator as
to where we stand and what issues we may put even more focus on.
     we at elg have always strived to improve constantly in many
aspects of our business. in this endeavor, the following report marks
the beginning of an intensified exchange on how sustainability at
elg is being practiced. it has already proven to be a reminder for
us to regularly question, explain, and discuss what we sometimes
take for granted in order to continuously evolve further.
     i invite you to read and comprehend our view on sustain-
ability and to feed back to us what you have to add to this
­understanding.
