            2013 supplement to hospira global citizenship report 4

environmental, health and safety (ehs) systems
since becoming a public company in 2004, hospira has been committed to nurturing a
culture of social and environmental responsibility across our organization. from the start,
we’ve focused on creating environmental, health and safety (ehs) systems to ensure that risk,
reputation and liability are adequately addressed. our ehs priorities include:
l   positioning hospira for robust corporate citizenship in environmental sustainability.
l   driving excellence in integrated ehs management systems and external ehs certifications
    such as international organization for standardization (iso) and voluntary protection pro-
    gram (vpp) certifications.

to help drive our priorities, our key metrics include:
l percent of vpp and iso certified sites, and
l annual ehs performance including safety incidents, ehs certification reviews, natural
  resource use and waste data.

throughout our history, ehs matters have served as important drivers of hospira’s business
decisions. we focus on employing an ehs management system that incorporates measurable
goals, stakeholder input and continuous improvement. we use the “plan, do, check, act” model,
which encompasses standards for environmental, health and safety. the ehs performance metrics
discussed herein are driven by the ehs management system framework.

internal ehs management system audits are used to assess sites’ capabilities to comply with the
system requirements as well as regulatory requirements. audits are performed under a defined
governance audit program which incorporates iso19011 guidelines for auditing management
systems. internal auditors are required to possess formal training in systems auditing including
training as lead auditors under recognized standards incorporating both iso14001 environmental
management system and ohsas18001 for occupational health and safety management systems.
audit teams typically consist of one to two internal auditors and may include external regulatory
auditors or consultants. the results of audits, along with tracking of all associated corrective and
preventive action plans, are presented monthly to corporate leaders.

2013–2015 safety and environmental targets
hospira successfully completed its 2005-2010 ehs targets, and has set targets for 2011-2015.
these targets include:
l an injury/illness incident rate and lost-day/restricted-day/transferred-day rate of less than
  50 percent of the average industry standard based on u.s. published injury and illness rates
  (by industry classification codes, from the u.s. bureau of labor statistics (bls);
l 20 percent reduction in total waste disposed from the 2005 baseline;
l 20 percent reduction in water used from the 2005 baseline; and
l 20 percent reduction in energy used from the 2005 baseline.

in addition to the u.s. vpp (and equivalent) program, there are two iso relevant ehs certifications that can be pursued
by any global organization. the iso 18001 (safety) and iso 14001 (environmental) certifications are recognized globally,
and require external certifications by iso-certified inspectors. the osha vpp program is subject to external verification.
the hospira ehs star program is subject to internal verification, using the same criteria as the osha vpp program.
of the 24 hospira locations, the great majority have ehs externally recognized programs (including the hospira star
program). all iso certified facilities are located outside of the united states.
all hospira operations are subject to hospira’s ehs management system requirements, including periodic audits to verify
the system is in place and functioning. the hospira ehs management system focuses on five key areas: management
commitment, employee involvement, worksite analysis, hazard prevention and control, and training.

environmental metrics
each year, hospira collects data from our global manufacturing locations for a number of environmental
parameters. these environmental metrics are then normalized to the annual hospira sales figures and
compared to environmental targets. normalizing environmental metrics by annual sales is a common
method to ensure that the data account for changes in a company’s business over time.
during 2013, special waste rose compared to the 2005 baseline due primarily to reclassification of
hazardous waste to special waste.
the environmental metrics and targets hospira proposed in 2005 have been restated to include all
hospira manufacturing operations acquired since 2005. the results of this restatement are reflected
in the environmental data graphs and in table 1.
2011 - 2015 environmental targets
continuing with the environmental metrics baseline established by hospira in 2005, our 2011-
2015 goals are as follows. these actuals are then normalized by revenue and form the basis for
hospira’s environmental targets.

recycling
hospira facilities recycled 15.2 million pounds of materials in 2013. each facility establishes its own recycling
program based on local capabilities. materials that are recycled include: aluminum metal, ferrous metals,
rubber, plastics, glass, toner cartridges, batteries, circuit boards, plastic foam, wood pallets, cardboard and
paper. computers are returned to the leasing firm for recycling when they become obsolete.
                                                                       2013 supplement to hospira global citizenship report 8

hybrid vehicles for u.s. sales force
hospira has been incorporating hybrids into its u.s. sales fleet for nearly a decade. at the close of
2013 there were 555 hybrids out of 646 total vehicles in service in the commercial operations fleet.

carbon emissions/green house gases (ghg)
hospira began contributing to the carbon disclosure project (cdp) voluntary carbon emission
reporting database in 2005. the cdp system is used by more than 3,000 of the world’s largest
companies, becoming the standard for carbon disclosure methodology and process.

table 2: cdp-reported ghg data for hospira
the differences in year-to-year ghg emissions values are primarily due to the acquisition and
divestitures of manufacturing plants. hospira began collecting ghg emission data for non-
manufacturing activities in 2006. in 2009, the reporting scope was expanded to include the
u.s.-based transportation fleets.

    direct ghg/co2 emissions are for fuel combustion carbon content only (not the other 5 main ghg), and are based on factors of 161.4 lbs. co2/million btu for fuel oil
    and 117 lbs. co2/million btu for natural gas.

    indirect ghg/co2 emissions for electrical use are calculated using a conversion factor of 1.37 lbs./kw, the typical value given by the u.s. environmental protection
    agency.
*increasing direct carbon emissions are primarily the result of increased fuel oil usage at international locations.
**the rise in indirect carbon emissions in 2013 is the result of using location-specific emissions factors compared to previous years which used one common factor for all
  locations.



regulatory requirements for ghg emissions and reporting
several geographies where hospira operates have regulatory requirements for ghg reporting
and/or reductions, including the european union (eu), australia and the united states.

current reporting and cap thresholds do not require the company to report or reduce emissions
in the eu. hospira does report carbon emissions in australia as required by the national
greenhouse and energy reporting system (ngers). in the united states, no hospira facility
exceeds the environmental protection agency (epa) threshold to report site-specific carbon
emissions (see table 2 for hospira carbon emission data).




                                                                                              2013 supplement to hospira global citizenship report 9

product stewardship trends
assessment of product stewardship topics and trends is a continuous focus at hospira. each year,
hospira evaluates its products sold in the eu against the registration, evaluation, authorization
and restriction of chemical substances (reach) requirements that were in effect. no significant
impacts were revealed in 2013.
reinforcing our commitment to product stewardship, during 2013 hospira was a partnering
sponsor of cleanmed, an annual conference on environmental sustainability for the healthcare
sector, and a sponsor of green health’s “greening the or” initiative. as part of its commitment
to non-dehp products, the company continued transitioning customers to its portfolio of non-
dehp intravenous (i.v.) administration sets.


supply chain sourcing reporting trends
conflict minerals are minerals mined in conditions of armed conflict and human rights abuses,
notably in the democratic republic of the congo or in adjoining countries. the minerals are
cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite and their derivatives tin, tantalum, tungsten
and gold, referred to as “3tg.”
we analyzed our products and determined that
3tg is contained in certain raw material
used in the assembly of our infusion
pump products. we were unable to
determine whether 3tg used in
those pumps were or were not
from the democratic republic of
the congo or adjoining countries.
we will continue our due
diligence efforts to determine
the origins in 2014.
