we generate round 85% of our sales revenue from
validated processes in which replacing products during
the production cycle is very expensive, so we receive a
high proportion of follow-up and repeat business.
the particular strength of sartorius stedim biotech
lies in its integrated process solutions: from the
investigation and development of substances in the
lab to the production of the end product, we offer the
broadest range in the industry. our strategic focus
on single-use products gives us another edge over
the competition. sartorius stedim biotech occupies a
strong position in the market worldwide in the
fields of bioprocess filtration, fermentation, fluid
management and membrane chromatography.

most of our competitors are multinationals based in
the usa. merck millipore, pall and general electric
healthcare are among our main rivals in the process
area, thermo fisher and merck millipore are key
players in the laboratory field. we also face
competition from smaller companies such as applikon
and atmi in individual segments.

at the sartorius stedim biotech group, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
(ebitda) are used as the key profitability measure. in
addition, we report ebita as a profit figure. in this
context, amortization refers exclusively to purchase
price allocation (ppa) to intangible assets acquired, as
specified by ifrs 3. to provide a complete and
transparent presentation of the group's profitability,
we report earnings adjusted for extraordinary items
(underlying ebitda, underlying ebita). for more
information about definitions, please refer to the
glossary on page 195. the underlying presentation is
reconciled with the ebitda key indicator (see glossary)
on the following page.

production and supply chain management

sartorius stedim biotech operates a well developed
global production network. our largest sites are the
plants at goettingen in germany and aubagne in
france, followed by the production facilities at
bangalore in india, yauco in puerto rico and
guxhagen in germany. our advanced production
facilities support the efficient manufacturing
processes and short lead and order processing times
we need to maintain our competitive edge around the
world.

after we completed a number of significant capacity
expansion projects in goettingen, guxhagen and in
yauco in the previous year, we implemented a series of
small- and medium-scale projects in the reporting year
to extend our manufacturing capacity. at the
goettingen site in april 2013, we opened a new
building for manufacturing the plastic parts we use in
products like single-use filters and bags. the
substantially expanded production area provides ample
space for the installation of additional injection
molding machines, the first of which were
commissioned during the reporting year. we also
hired more employees to expand production capacity
significantly at the new plant in puerto rico in
response to persistently high demand for single-use
bags from the pharmaceutical industry. elsewhere, we
acquired a building directly adjacent to our aubagne
facility in order to increase the space available at the
site for producing single-use bags and plan to move
additional machinery there in mid-2014. moreover, at
our chinese site in beijing, we installed a cleanroom in
which we intend to manufacture fluid management
products for the local market.

initial preparatory steps have been taken for the
installation of a further casting machine at the
goettingen site to provide greater capacity and
flexibility in our filter membrane manufacturing
operations. work to install the machine is scheduled to
commence in 2014.

     sartorius stedim biotech does not supply its products
     directly to end consumers, but rather to manufacturers
     of pharmaceuticals, foods and chemicals, and also to
     research and development laboratories. to ensure that
     our products satisfy the most stringent quality
     requirements, we employ rigorous quality checks and
     advanced manufacturing methods and processes, such
     as cleanroom technology. these manufacturing
     methods and processes are subject to constant review
     under our continuous improvement processes, moreover,
     and are refined appropriately as requirements evolve.
     our successful completion of a host of annual audits by
     customers and our accreditation under iso 9001 and

     supporting students and graduates

     sartorius stedim biotech ensures that it gains young
     talent through dedicated programs and alliances. our
     international bioscience scholarship provides financial,
     technical and personal support to students and
     graduates in scientific and technical disciplines. the
     program is intended to attract appropriately qualified
     young people, particularly from the global growth
     markets, to our company and enhance international
     project activities at sartorius stedim biotech. at the
     group’s headquarters in aubagne, we collaborate with
     several schools and universities, including the école
     d'ingénieurs in marseille, to give recently qualified
     biotechnology engineers the opportunity to gain
     professional experience as application engineers in
     marketing. in 2013, we entered into a new partnership
     with the école nationale supérieure de technologie
     des biomolécules and will be providing a scholarship
     for a student of our choice. we also extended our
     collaboration with the école nationale supérieure des
     arts & métiers, students of which had the opportunity
     to attend company workshops, in the reporting year.

     helping young people from low-income families gain
     access to scientific and technical careers was another
     priority of our activities in the year under review.
     sartorius stedim biotech supported the california
     nonprofit organization biotech partners, which
     organizes internships and other opportunities for
     disadvantaged young people.

     we have made allowances on our balance sheet for
     any pending legal disputes and proceedings that have
     the potential to produce a substantial negative impact
     on group results.


     insurance

     we have taken out insurance policies to cover a wide
     range of risks where possible and economically
     advisable. these insurance policies include coverage
     against liability, business interruption, transport,
     material and pecuniary damages and other risks
     and provide comprehensive coverage for legal costs.

     risk outlook

     where expedient and feasible, we adopted counter-
     measures and | or arranged for balance sheet measures
     during the reporting year to cover all discernible risks
     within the sartorius stedim biotech group that had
     the potential to damage our net worth, financial
     situation and profitability.

     we judge the probability of occurrence of the risks
     presented here to be low, it being the case that
     their occurrence could be of material significance to
     the sartorius stedim biotech group as a whole or to
     individual group companies.

     after thorough analysis of the entire risk situation and
     according to our current review, there are no discernible
     risks that could jeopardize the existence of the group.

     squeeze on public-sector research to continue

     experts expect a further reduction in overall public-
     sector r&d spending as a result of widespread
     consolidation for national budgets. only in a handful
     of emerging countries with large markets, such as
     china and india, investment in science and education
     is likely to rise. government plans in china, for
     example, provide for massive investment in pharma-
     ceuticals research and the pharmaceutical industry.

     future business development

     the outlook for fiscal 2014 incorporates the risks and
     opportunities outlined in this report. as we supply the
     biopharmaceutical industry, our business development
     is generally driven by stable long-term trends.
     therefore, economic fluctuations play less of a role
     than, for example, decisions of regulatory agencies
     regarding drug approvals or the use medications.

     assuming that the trends toward biomanufacturing of
     pharmaceuticals and increasing utilization of single-
     use technologies will continue, we forecast that sales
     revenue will rise by about 11% to 14% in constant
     currencies in 2014. the cell culture media and small-
     scale fermentation businesses acquired are projected
     to contribute around six percentage points to this
     growth. management expects that the underlying
     ebitda margin will rise to around 23.5%, without
     any currency effects considered. (please refer to the
     definition for the operating earnings margin on page 25
     and | or the glossary.)

     moreover, in 2014 we plan to invest about 6% to 8%
     of sales revenue in the expansion of our production
     capacities, among other projects.

     with regard to our financial position, we forecast that
     by the end of 2014, the ratio of net debt to underlying
     ebitda will edge down slightly, without taking any
     potential portfolio changes into account.

   the phantom stock plan is used as the variable long-term incentive component that incorporates risk. this remuneration component
   depends on the development of the sartorius ag share price over a period of at least four (formerly three) years and is payable only if
   this price exceeds at least 7.5% (formerly 10%) per year relative to the time the phantom stock was assigned or if the share price
   outperformed the tecdax® as a comparative index. the amount to be paid is capped at a maximum of 2.5 times the share price at the
   time the phantom stock was assigned, based in each case on the actual annual tranche concerned. the use of a component that is
   designed to have a long-term incentive effect and incorporates risk corresponds to a suggestion from the french and german
   corporate governance code. to date no payment has been made to joachim kreuzburg or reinhard vogt according to this phantom
   stock plan.

     1)
          the performance shares are comprised of a phantom stock plan. the phantom stock plan is used as the variable
          incentive component that includes a risk portion. this remuneration component depends on the development of the
          sartorius ag share price over a period of at least four (formerly three) years and is payable only if this price exceeds
          at least 7.5% (formerly 10%) per year relative to the time the phantom stock was assigned or if the share price
          outperformed the tecdax® as a comparative index. the amount to be paid is capped at a maximum of 2.5 times the
          share price at the time the phantom stock was assigned, based in each case on the actual annual tranche concerned.
          the use of a component that is designed to have a long-term incentive effect and entails risk is recommended by the
          french and german corporate governance codes.

     scheme used to be extended by an externally financed

     securing a basic retirement amount, this commitment
     used to provide for the third-term executive board
     member to make his own contribution from his
     variable earnings and for the company to match this
     contribution by a bonus amount.

     this practice was modified by the resolution adopted
     by the supervisory board on august 24, 2011, in that
     upon being reappointed for the first time, an
     executive board member will receive an externally
     financed defined contribution plan commitment,
     which, in addition to securing a basic retirement
     amount, now provides for this second-term executive
     board member to make his own contribution from his
     variable earnings and for the company to match this
     contribution by a bonus amount.

     in the reporting year, the remuneration policy was
     amended to include a rule to authorize the
     supervisory board to grant special remuneration,
     according to equitable discretion, to an executive
     board member for the latter's extraordinary

      with this acquisition, sartorius stedim biotech extends
      its current portfolio in the fermentation business by
      multi-parallel, small scale bioreactors in the range of
      15 milliliters and 250 milliliters. the tap portfolio
      stands to gain substantial market penetration based
      on sartorius stedim biotech’s greater sales strength
      and global reach as well as to benefit from the
      synergies with the related products in the fluid
      management and cell culture media businesses.

16. earnings per share

according to ias 33, earnings per share, the earnings
per share for each class of shares must be determined
separately. the basic earnings per share (basic eps) are
calculated on the basis of the weighted average
number of ordinary shares during the period.

diluted earnings per share have to be measured by
taking into account share subscription options
outstanding at the end of the period. certain group
employees have acquired entitlements to subscribe to
a total of 23,642 shares (24,642 at december 31, 2012).
therefore, the diluted net earnings per share are
calculated on the basis of 2013 financial year items,
including the number of existing and potential future
shares (including optional shares).

treasury shares are not included in the calculation of
the earnings per share.
