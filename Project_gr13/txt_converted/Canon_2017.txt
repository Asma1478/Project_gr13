        canon group business operations (as of december 31, 2016)

        canon inc. got its start as a camera manufacturer in 1937. the company promoted globalization from early on, opening a new
        york branch in 1955. marking its 30th anniversary of establishment, in 1967 canon took up the challenge of diversification
        under the slogan, “cameras in the right hand, business machines in the left,” marking its foray into the field of copying
        machines.
            not only is canon currently a global leader in market share for such products as digital cameras with interchangeable
        lenses and inkjet printers but the company is also growing four new businesses in the b-to-b field, namely, commercial
        printing, network cameras, healthcare, and industrial equipment.

creating synergies with axis, a company
with superior image processing technologies
canon has deepened its collaboration with axis since the
company joined the group in 2015, including exchanges
in all areas of operations, from product development and
quality assurance to sales and marketing. the result of
this union was the merging of canon’s advanced optics
and imaging technologies with axis’ network image-
processing technologies in our first jointly developed
product, the axis q1659. with high-performance
sensors delivering 20 megapixels—nearly 10 times full-
hd resolution, this network camera system can be used
for a variety of purposes from wide-area to long-distance
surveillance thanks to a selection of seven interchangeable
lenses. we will promote the axis q1659 for use in city
surveillance systems as well as at such locations as airports                                       meeting with an axis employee on a business trip at canon

and stadiums.


pursuing further technological innovations—
strengthening solutions
the network camera market demands not only products
but also solutions that record and analyze video. for
example, canon’s software, capable of counting up to 1,500
people in an image can be used to determine crowding in
various facilities. this capability helps in allocating security
personnel and in arranging evacuation and other safety
measures. in addition, canon is developing technologies
that quickly search for a specific person from a video feed
and continuously track that person throughout a multiple                                            counting people using the people counter version 1.0 software

   applications for multi-purpose cameras
   canon’s me20f-sh multi-purpose camera features a proprietary 35mm,
   full-frame cmos sensor with high sensitivity, enabling crisp, clean full-
   color image capture even in challenging low light conditions where it
   is difficult to distinguish the subject with the naked eye. this capability
   makes the camera ideal for a variety of settings, from monitoring and
   preventing natural disasters, and law enforcement to filming wildlife
   in its natural habitat, which had previously been difficult to record.
   in cooperation with the tokyo metropolitan police
   department at the sumida river fireworks festival in

as signs of various diseases and medical conditions manifest
in changes that occur within blood vessels, it is becoming
extremely important to be able to visualize the blood vessel
interior. accordingly, canon is promoting the development
of groundbreaking photoacoustic tomography technology
that can produce 3-d images of blood vessels without using
radiation and in a non-invasive manner. by enabling high-
resolution imaging of the vascular network, this technology
is expected to be instrumental in testing for cancer, diabetes,

nanoimprint lithography — groundbreaking
technology in the semiconductor
manufacturing process
semiconductors are used in a wide range of products,
from cellular phones, smartphones, and televisions to air
conditioners, automobiles, refrigerators, and washing machines.
as such, they are an indispensable part of people’s daily lives.
    semiconductors are created using various technologies,
including exposure technology that employs light to expose
circuit patterns. advancements to semiconductors have been
realized by making these circuit patterns finer. through the
lengthening of short light waves that are used in the exposure
process, a semiconductor linewidth of 350 nm (nanometers)
was realized in the first half of the 1990s, followed by the
realization of a linewidth of 38 nm in the second half of 2000s.
however, this progression practically came to a halt due to          development progressing on nanoimprint lithography
                                                                     technology
the belief that the process of making finer circuit patterns
through the lengthening of short light waves had reached its
technological limit.
    following this conclusion, canon began focusing its
attention on nanoimprint lithography, a next-generation
technology. continuing our research since 2004, we
succeeded in realizing an extremely fine linewidth within
the 10 nm range. due to the fact that the finer the linewidth
becomes, the more difficult it is to create circuit patterns,
semiconductor fabrication devices have become more
complex and larger in size in order to create these circuit
patterns, giving rise to various issues. nanoimprint lithography
technology resolves these issues by employing a simple
method of stamping an etched circuit pattern (mask) on the
surface material, thereby allowing fine patterns to be cleanly
reproduced. furthermore, this technology shortens the overall
production process, leading to significant cost reductions.          mask etched with fine circuit patterns
    we are currently working with canon nanotechnologies,
inc., located in the united states, to promote the
development of next-generation semiconductor fabrication
equipment. we expect this equipment to support society
as an important technology in the iot generation, which
brings all types of things together.

compared with conventional lcd panels, oled panels
are thinner and produce more vibrant colors. in addition,
oled panels have high expectations in terms of application,
including the capability to be bent and, in the future,
folded. vacuum evaporation equipment developed and
manufactured by canon tokki plays an essential role in
the manufacture of oled panels, and we take pride in
its unsurpassed technological superiority. supported by
demand for various types of panel devices, including
smartphones and televisions, this equipment will
contribute to the creation of new value going forward.

expanding the canon bird branch project
from shimomaruko forest to other areas
the bird branch project was launched in 2015 at canon’s
shimomaruko headquarters in tokyo. in addition to
establishing a natural habitat for wild birds within the
“shimomaruko forest”—a large expanse of green space on
the headquarters site, including birdhouses and bird baths,
the bird branch project continuously examines wild birds
through fixed-point monitoring using network cameras as
well as through a route census, which investigates the types
of wild birds living along a predetermined route.
    in 2016, canon’s toride plant, susono plant, and kawasaki
office, as well as oita canon’s oita plant and canon research
centre france joined the project, expanding the circle of
                                                                    spotbill duck bathing in a birdbath in the shimomaruko forest
activity globally.


birds project of canon research centre france
canon research centre france s.a.s. is located in the suburbs
of rennes, a city in the western region of brittany. green
spaces account for 82% of the 45,000-square-metre site that
canon research centre france occupies. since 2011, canon
research centre france has been conducting regular surveys
of biodiversity within its operational site with the help of lpo,
an association for the preservation of wild birds. through these
surveys, canon research centre france has revised its policies
for setting up green spaces in order to preserve biodiversity and
increase the number of biological species inhabiting the area.
in addition, we are developing population ponds, installing
nest boxes and bait tables, etc. so that various creatures can
live. in addition, we attach colored film to the front of the
windowpane of the building to prevent bird strikes against          conducting regular biodiversity surveys

birds’ windows, and we also give consideration to creatures
living in the area.


canon forest at oita canon’s oita plant
the area surrounding oita canon’s oita plant is blessed with
an abundance of forestland that is filled with many kinds of
living creatures. a representative example of oita canon’s
environmental activities is breeding common pheasants
(green pheasants), which are often seen in the local area,
and releasing them into the wild. since 2012 oita canon
has succeeded in incubating over 120 pheasant eggs. every
year, from mid-april to late july, staff members, including
employee volunteers, work to hatch and carefully raise the
pheasants. from the end of october to late november,
these staff members hold environmental classes for local
elementary school students as well as for children of oita
canon employees to explain the purpose of raising the
pheasants. they also host an event for the children to take         breeding and releasing the green pheasant, japan’s national bird

part in releasing the birds into the wild. in addition, oita
canon works to create an attractive forest environment for
flora and fauna through various means, including setting up
birdhouses and pruning trees to allow more light and wind in.

  basic approach to co2 calculations
  canon compiles data for ghg designated under the kyoto protocol (revised version). past data may be revised due to improvements in the precision of data collection.
    we use co2 emission factors for electricity for each region and year.
    until 2014, figures used in japan were published by japan’s ministry of the environment and the federation of electric power companies of japan. outside japan, they
  were published by the international energy agency. from 2015, calculations use co2 emission factors provided by individual electricity suppliers; publicly disclosed region-
  specific figures are used where factors are not provided by electricity suppliers. (please refer to operational sites covered in the environmental section (page 74).)
    for figures on customer use, electricity consumption of products shipped in a given year is calculated based on the average lifespan and output capacity, and
  converted to the co2 equivalent using the same factors stipulated above. other co2 emission factors use coefficients from the carbon footprint communication
  program of the japan environmental management association for industry (jemai).

  third-party verification of ghg emissions (converted to co2)
  third-party verification has only been obtained for co2 emissions occurring in 2016 from quantitative data appearing in the above graphs “lifecycle ghg emissions (co2
  equivalent)” and “2016 material balance.”

    for inclusion in its “climate a list,” cdp’s highest rating.
         since 2003, cdp has sent questionnaires*2 to the world’s major companies requesting disclosure on
    business risks and opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, and it rates those
    companies’ response on climate change issues based on their responses to the questionnaires. in 2016, the
    questionnaires were sent to about 6,000 companies worldwide, about 500 of which were in japan.
         companies are given a rating of a to f, and canon was one of 193 companies worldwide to receive the
    highest rating of a.
