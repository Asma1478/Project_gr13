■ ceo message

                                                       i sincerely appreciate your continuing support for lgi.
                                                       i would like to take this chance to address our efforts
                                                       to become a more sustainable company.


                                                       we at lgi have been working diligently in various projects to lay the groundwork
                                                       for sustainable growth. in 2014, we completed the acquisition of shares of gs
                                                       e&r and secured the rights to supply coal. in turkmenistan, we ordered an ethane
                                                       cracker project worth three billion us dollars. we are also working on follow-up
                                                       projects to secure new growth engines.


                                                       in 2015, lgi will grow into a “global business challenger” while staying true
                                                       to our management philosophy. we have defined our goal with three major
                                                       concepts: “people first”, “principle centric” and “future-driven”.


lgi will walk together organically.
by sharing the same business mindset in a harmonious working environment, we can turn crises into opportunities
for success. we at lgi share a vision of progress, going                                           together. in these times of change,
our executives and employees will persistently strive to develop the capabilities to work “sincerely, persistently, and
uniquely.”


lgi will become a sound company with its own capability and passion in a fair and square way.
we will establish “jeong-do” management culture and fair practices of transaction environment through expanding “jeong-do”
management education in all business sites and reinforce business transaction standards.


lgi will become a company that fulfills its social responsibilities.
we believe that we still have a long way to go. we are focusing on building solidarity, fulfilling our social responsibilities, and improving
our communication with society. we also understand the importance of environmental and safety management for sustainable
business. that is why our company will continue to promote a culture of environment, safety, and health in compliance with the
stipulated standards and principles.


we at lgi are striving to hear our stakeholders’ opinions: by learning from each other and working together, i believe that we can
produce and share the very best value.


thank you.

    elements

  economic risk management
  lgi’s foreign exchange risk management group works to prevent potential foreign exchange risks
  in overseas transactions and fund management. this group is divided into a foreign exchange risk
  management committee, department for dealing with foreign exchange risk, and management
  department. we prepare for interest rate risk by using our system for sharing domestic and
  global funds and minimizing external funds. we also manage interest rate risk in advance by
  regularly monitoring interest rate trends regularly and responding appropriately when risks arise.

  prevention of errors and corruption
  lgi regularly conducts checks of company-wide processes and systems, which are carried
  out by business departments, relevant departments, and the management diagnosis team.
  through these checks, we minimize non-financial risks, such as ethical risks, and prevent errors
  and corruption.

  operating self-diagnosis system for risks
  we operate an “internal management system” in which employees conduct regular self-
  diagnosis twice a year to prevent risks in our daily work. our company also uses the r&r (risk
  & return) checklist for all transaction cases in advance to prevent any potential risks related
  to conducting business. lgi implements various activities to prevent long-term and large-
  scale incidents and autonomously implements improvements.

   lgi headquarters and overseas subsidiaries hold the r&r forum twice a year to
   continuously build our awareness of risk management. we comprehensively cultivate
   risk management capability by sharing on-site cases of success and failure for risk
   management and examining business risks.

                                                                                                                  16

                                          at lgi, we use a decision-making process for investment to identify and deal with
                                          potential risks when entering new projects and making investment decisions. this helps us
                                          reinforce risk checking when making investment decisions for new projects. our system
                                          also improves investment stability by making sure that projects are normally conducted
                                          after there are changes in investment and asset value.

                         interview



                          amano tomohiro, manager at lgi japan subsidiary
                          it’s been 12 years since i’ve joined the lgi japan subsidiary, pursuing my interest in trade business. for
                          me, lgi is a company making great efforts in narrowing the cultural gap by providing various “programs
                          for understating local culture.” among its various programs, the lg way education program for global
                          staff members was really helpful for me to understand our code of conduct as lgi employees. when
                          i participated in the program for skill reinforcement for overseas subsidiaries/branches in 2013, the
                          program gave me the opportunity to broaden my view of different cultures and gain a real sense
                          of pride as part of lgi. there is more proactive discussion, and information is actively shared during
                          exchange training between subsidiary workers and subsidiary/branch workshops. this creates new
                          business opportunities and solidifies relations between the subsidiaries. as a natural result, these
                          activities improve the competitiveness of all of lgi’s global staff members.


                                                                                                                                         20

3. ehss management of investment corporations

                          environmental, health/safety, and social sector.




                  1) reinforce the health/safety management system

                    lgi has reestablishing our reporting system for incidents to reinforce environment and
                    health/safety management. we subdivided the reporting system for hazardous chemical
                    substances and expanded the extent of inspection for potential impacts on internal and
                    external sectors. our company improved the level of health/safety by executing standards
                    that can be followed by all executives and employees.

                    international environment and health/safety management standards and legislations in
                    each country. we objectively assess the current status of ehss by conducting an on-site
                    check based on the ehss checklist with experts from the british standards institution (bsi).
                    we then ensure continuous improvement by making improvement measures, which are
                    optimized for each local area to follow up after these checks.

best practice       bridge repairs in indonesia

  in sekadau province near the lgi-operated palm plantation in indonesia, there were
  three old bridges in desperate need of renovation. about a hundred children cross
  these dangerous bridges on their way to school and home every day, and local
  residents cross by foot or motorcycle.
  lgi believes that repairing bridges is not just a social contribution activity, but a matter
  of necessity for the local residents. we’ve repaired all three bridges, upgrading them
  to concrete bridges in 2015. when the bridge reconstruction is completed, the local
  residents’ lives will be much safer.

                             accounting information. the committee is composed of three non-executive directors,
                             and it secures independency by appointing audit members who have no interest
                             relations. in 2014, the committee held meetings six times and approved and reported
                             12 bills.

                             executive director recommendation committee secures fairness and independency by
                             strictly appointing non-executive directors. in 2014, the committee held one meeting
                             to appoint one new non-executive director.

                               our company helps non-executive directors better understand our company by
                               encouraging them to visit overseas business sties. in december 2014, non-executive
                               directors went to indonesia to check relevant projects at our business sites.
                               lgi continues to send non-executive directors to overseas business sites to help
                               them to make more practical and reasonable decisions.

                 to build our awareness and understanding of laws and regulations, we’ve produced and
                 shared the law-abiding guideline for our company. lgi presents explanations and case
                 examples on relevant regulations in various sectors such as foreign exchange, customs,
                 fair trade, information protection, intellectual property, and product liability, to improve
                 our compliance with laws and regulations.

                 guideline for prevention of overseas corruption
                 by reflecting lgi’s characteristics with the large ratio of overseas projects, we produced
                 and distributed the guideline for overseas anti-corruption acts in each country to
                 prevent overseas corruption. the guideline provides detailed information on the
                 recently-amended fcpa (foreign corrupt practices act) to share stricter standards and
                 encourage compliance with the laws and regulations against corruption.

                 lgi operates a system for giving rewards to people who report corruption and
                 irregularities. this reinforces transparency and responsibility and prevents corruption
                 and irregularity practices that undermine customer value. we receive reports on
                 practices that violate the lg code of ethics and jeong-do management, such as giving
                 and receiving money and valuable/treats. we protect the identities of people who
                 report, as well as give them rewards.
