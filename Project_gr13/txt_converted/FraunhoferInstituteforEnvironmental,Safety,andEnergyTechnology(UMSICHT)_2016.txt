fraunhofer umsicht has existed in oberhausen for the past 26 years. we would like to pick
up on the rooting of the institute in the "cradle of the ruhr industry" in the heart of the ruhr
region and our connection to the city in the illustrations in our sustainability report. this is why
all of the photos used in this report – with the exception of the photos of our institute branch
in sulzbach-rosenberg – show scenes from oberhausen or the local ruhr region. they were
either taken by employees of the institute or by their friends and acquaintances.

dear readers,


we are delighted that you are currently reading the fifth sustainability report, which was once again created according to the
g4 standard from the global reporting initiative.


we strive to further strengthen our pioneering position in terms of sustainability – also because important milestones in over-
coming major global challenges were achieved in 2015: the un summit in new york resulted in the adoption of the "agenda
2030 for sustainable development", of which the 17 sustainable development goals link the principle of sustainability to
economic, ecological and social development. following on from the kyoto protocol, a global climate agreement was concluded
in paris. in the paris agreement, the countries set themselves the aim, among other things, of limiting the global temperature
increase to 1.5°c where possible and promoting climate resilience.


both initiatives are very ambitious – their realization can only succeed if everyone works on them together. as a research
institute, we consider ourselves particularly committed to this. this view is shared by the people who recommended in our
second stakeholder dialog that we should assume a position, be a pioneer for sustainable development, exhibit research
responsibility and academic excellence, and highlight the importance of the institute for the region. these recommendations are
prudent – just like our institute. we have been diverse and multifaceted ever since we were founded in 1990. as a trailblazer
in sustainable energy and raw materials management, we are convinced that above all the diverse nature of our knowledge
and our experiences are of benefit. this opens up numerous opportunities for researching and developing innovative products,
processes and services.


we invite you to better get to know the diversity of fraunhofer umsicht and some of our contributions to sustainable develop-
ment, and hope you find this report an interesting read.


best regards,




eckhard weidner				görge deerberg

umsicht is responsible for the largest proportion of primary
energy demand. when the institute switched to 100 percent
electricity from hydro-electric power at the beginning of 2014,
it was possible to reduce the overall primary energy demand
of fraunhofer umsicht from approx. 50,000 gj (gigajoules)
in 2012 to approx. 23,000 gj in 2015. by switching over to
green electricity, fraunhofer umsicht also contributes to the
energy transition and protects fossil resources.

    on the current ongoing projects; however, a minimization can
    be seen over the years.

also represents the greatest challenge for medium-term

highlights from 2016
2016 was a successful and very labor-intensive year for umsicht, meaning that the completion of the current sustainability
report was unfortunately postponed until 2017. in order to find a balance and bring our readers up to date, we present measures
here from 2016 that relate to our key topics but lie outside the actual report framework as highlights.
