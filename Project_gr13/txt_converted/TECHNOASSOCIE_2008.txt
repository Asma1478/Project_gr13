  relationship with our business partners

collaboration with our business partners
  for assuring the quality of our products
many of the company’s products are manufactured at the
suppliers’ factories. for this reason, the cooperation of
suppliers in such areas as furnishing reliable data is
indispensable for assuring the quality of our products.
     prior to starting business with any new supplier, the
company audits it in accordance with the requirements of
the iso9001 system. these audits examine 65 items,
including environment-related items. a supplier must score
above the standard-set minimum points in order to be
qualiﬁed. separately, the company audits its suppliers and
provides guidance to them as necessary, based on
environment and quality audit forms that are provided by its
customers. in particular, suppliers that are subject to many
complaints are regarded as “suppliers requiring intensive
management”, and have quality improvement staff assigned
exclusively to them, in an effort to carry out quality
improvement activities together with such suppliers.
     since ﬁscal 2006, we have held “quality study meetings”                                                         (japanese only)
aimed at raising suppliers’ awareness of quality
improvement. the study meetings primarily address the
fundamentals of quality control and real-life examples of         activities of ayumi club
improvements. in ﬁscal 2007, we held such meetings with         the company and its 89 suppliers with whom the company

  even have a dedicated printer for printing on the reverse side of copy paper,
  other than the printer for printing on new paper.
       we also make energy saving efforts. the book vault and the
  warehouse have a motion detector installed, which is set to automatically
  turn off the lights when no one is in there. we also make sure that lights in
  the kitchen and the hot-water service room are turned off when not in use.
       we are always looking for new, innovative ideas to make further
  improvements. we have started making efforts to use glasses instead of
  paper cups, which is our next goal. the possibilities of environmental
  preservation activities are inﬁnite. we will continue to promote such
  activities.

  in hokkaido, we use about ﬁve times more kerosene for heating purposes
  than in tokyo, resulting in higher co2 emissions. as the price of kerosene
  reached a twenty-year high this year, reduction of fuel expenses became an
  urgent issue at sapporo sales ofﬁce. in response, we have set the heater
  temperature 1 or 2 degrees lower and circulated the warm air with an
  electric fan to compensate for that, in an effort to decrease kerosene usage.
                                                                                                     small contributions to

  waste.
      we also sweep the area around the ofﬁce on a daily basis, as the wind
  blows ﬁne dirt in this direction everyday from the industrial-waste disposal
  plant nearby. another small contribution we make to the surrounding
  scenery is planting ﬂowers in plant pots every year.
