              comments on the project from government and industry officials


                                                    according to the results of a national education survey
                                                  conducted by the ministry in 2012, the proportion of students
                                                  responding that they enjoyed studying science was high, 82%,
                                                  in the sixth grade of elementary school, but this fell to 62% for
                                                  students in the third year of junior high. that is a drop of
                                                  about 20% over a three-year period. moreover, only 53% of
                                                  students in the third year of junior high agreed that what they
                                                  learned in science classes would be useful when they left
                                                  school. this means we are also seeing a drop in the proportion
                                                  of students who appreciate the significance of science.
                                                    to address this situation, we believe it is important to offer

        mr. yoshihide chijiiwa                    youngsters opportunities to experience the role and utility of

        deputy section chief and senior           science and technology in society at large. in this way, we
        specialist for school education           can stimulate their passion for science. given this background,

                                                  a valuable initiative. we hope to see this project growing
        ministry of education, culture,
        sports, science and technology            from strength to strength, continuing to help cultivate a love
                                                  of science among our students.




                                                    we began supporting this project four years ago as the
                                                  japan chemical innovation institute.
                                                    what is so special about this project is the way in which
                                                  the schools, the board of education and companies in fujieda
                                                  are all working together for the good of the community.
                                                  companies in other parts of japan invite children from local
                                                  schools to tour their factories, but the close organizational
                                                  cooperation we have seen in fujieda is inspiring.
                                                    the success of this project is attributable to the enthusiasm
                                                  of the teachers, the support of the board of education and

                                         co 2 emissions:
                                                    co2 emissions are calculated from energy consumed in all business activities (fuels, heat, electric power, etc.).
                                                    the emissions calculation method used is based on the manual for calculating/reporting greenhouse gas emissions (march 2009, ministry of the
                                                    environment and ministry of economy, trade and industry), and figures shown represent the sum of emissions calculated for each energy type (tons-co2).
                                                    for the calorific values of city gas and co2 emissions coefficients of electricity, figures published by the respective supplier companies were used.

                                         waste generated:
                                                    total of aggregate volume of industrial and general waste from business sites. definitions of each type of waste are as follows.
                                                      ① landfill: waste disposed of in landfills by the company or outsourced contractors
                                                      ② external intermediate processing: waste incinerated by outsourced contractors (incineration without energy recovery)
                                                      ③ internal intermediate processing: waste incinerated in-house (incineration without energy recovery)
                                                      ④ external recycling (expenses paid): waste recycled with payment made to cover processing costs (including thermal recycling)
                                                      note: w aste generated owing to the retirement of facilities, repairs, building demolition (in-house demolition work), etc., is not included in the scope of
                                                             waste, nor is dismantling scrap material of value sold, facilities resold, or construction material waste (for which a manifest is issued by the company).

                                         valuable materials:
                                                    the volume of valuable materials that are generated at business sites and sold and that are neither products nor raw materials.

                                         material loss:
                                                    total of the volume of waste generated and the volume of valuable materials.
