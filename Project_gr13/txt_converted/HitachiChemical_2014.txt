      hitachi chemical group identity

       company we aim to be.

a corporate group we have adopted the kepner-tregoe (kt)

training in fiscal year 2012, and around 400 each in fiscal
years 2013 and 2014. each in-house coach is in charge of
training of five employees. almost all of our administrative
personnel have experience with this program.

revisions to the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in corporate and other tax rates
the “act for partial amendment of the income tax act, etc.” (act no. 10 of 2014) was promulgated on march 31, 2014 and, as a result,
the company is no longer subject to the special reconstruction corporation tax effective for fiscal years beginning on or after april 1, 2014.
   the effective statutory tax rate used to measure the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was changed from 37.8% to 35.4% for
the temporary differences expected to be realized or settled from fiscal years beginning april 1, 2014.
   the effect of the announced reduction of the effective statutory tax rate was to decrease deferred tax assets after offsetting deferred tax
liabilities by ¥582 million ($5,650 thousand) and increase deferred income taxes by ¥582 million ($5,650 thousand) as of and for the year
ended march 31, 2014.
