2012, what impressions have you gathered so
far at enbw?

frank mastiaux: enbw is a company with
many strengths and competencies of a tra-
ditional major utility. particularly worthy
of mention in my opinion are the techni-
cal competences and experience in all areas.
enbw understands energy. furthermore, the
operation of technical facilities and planning
of activities are done “conservatively” in the
positive sense of the word and with a focus on
safety. the company also keeps clear focus on
forward-looking issues. employees’ identifica-
tion with their tasks is high, as is the mutual
loyalty of company and employees. the social
partnership in our company works tradition-
ally well. enbw’s regional roots and presence
are strong.

                                                 frank mastiaux: “enbw 2020” is divided into

                                                 a new forward-looking business model with

                                                  based on demanding performance criteria.
                                                  we will also adjust our processes, structures

corporate governance
the supervisory board once again scrutinised corporate governance issues in the fiscal year 2012. the corpo-
rate governance report is part of the declaration of compliance the company has published in accordance with
sec. 289a (1) sentence 2 german commercial code (hgb) on its website (> www.enbw.com/report2012).



audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements
following thorough examination by the audit committee, the supervisory board reviewed in depth the separate
and consolidated financial statements as of 31 december 2012 audited by kpmg ag wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft
and issued with an unqualified audit opinion, the combined management report for the fiscal year 2012 and the
board of management’s proposal for the appropriation of profits for the fiscal year 2012. the super­visory board did
not have any reservations following its own review. it agreed with the audit results presented by the independent­
auditor, approved the separate financial statements prepared by the board of management as of 31 december 2012
– which have thus been ratified – and the consolidated financial statements as of 31 december 2012 and the com-
bined management report for the fiscal year 2012 and agreed with the board of management’s proposal for the
appropriation of profits for the fiscal year 2012.

proactive and based on partnership:
our course for the future of energy
enbw has set itself clear targets of actively shaping the new energy concept and meeting the require-
ments arising from the market, politics and society. to this end, we are focusing on two key strategic
moves: we will secure our position as a low-carbon generator and expand the range of local energy
solutions for our customers.

low-carbon and climate-compatible energy

we are gradually converting our generation portfolio to maintain supply reliability. the objective is to
manage our company in both a viable and a sustainable manner. through the expansion of renewable
energies we want to further reinforce our leading position as low-carbon generator and thereby keep
emissions to a low level.


we are focusing on the expansion of wind
                                                01
and hydro-electric power, but we will also
continue to invest in photovoltaic gen­
eration and bioenergy. hydro-electric
power already accounts for over 10% of
our electricity generation today. we are
expanding capacity at existing power sta­
tions, as in iffezheim for example, and
plan to develop further sites for wind and
hydro-electric power in germany and
turkey, for instance.

we are continuously expanding our wind
energy capacities. baden-württemberg
in particular is set to become host to a
considerable number of the new onshore
wind turbines being built, which is why
more than 160 locations with potential for
500 turbines are currently being exam­
ined. we have already secured plots of
land for 18 new wind farms. offshore, our

the most recent example of how actual
energy efficiency can also increase the
overall efficiency of buildings is the
wenckebach hospital in berlin tempel­

work in 2012 to increase the building’s
energy efficiency. whether it was a new
combined heat and power unit, new cool­

heating systems – the savings potential
for this project was immense. “these
measures will have paid for themselves in
just a few years,” glunz says with convic­

in between halls with compressors and
other technical equipment – for the lay­
man, the state-of-the-art above-ground
plant at the new gas storage facility is a
gigantic maze. the plant acts as the cen­
tral hub transporting the gas into and out
of the storage caverns, controlling and
processing the natural gas for transpor­
tation to the transmission grid or into the
salt caverns. for the former, the above-
ground plant is connected to the dutch
gas trading point ttf via a 60-kilome­
tre pipeline – for the latter, the natural
gas is piped approximately one kilometre
further north to the subterranean cavi­
ties of the salt caverns, where it is ulti­
mately stored. the four salt caverns lie
at a depth of between 1,000 and 1,600
metres and can hold up to 400 million
standard cubic metres of natural gas.

targeted international activities
in order to reduce dependency on the energy policy
environment in germany and to make targeted use of
opportunities for growth and returns, we want to increase
the portion of value added generated outside of germany in
the long term. currently, around 10% of enbw’s income
is generated from business outside of germany. in this
context, our activities focus on the czech republic,
switzerland and turkey. in turkey, for example, the
objective of the joint venture with borusan is to have an
installed output of 2,000 mw as of 2020 comprising mainly
renewable energy sources. on the other hand, we are
preparing to divest our non-controlling interests in hungary
and austria.

in 2012, the price level of most primary energy sources was significantly lower than in the prior year.
by contrast, the price of electricity increased for end consumers on 2011 as a consequence of political
and regulatory influences. the new energy concept in germany continues to present major challenges
for enbw, which we counter with flexible and long-term concepts.

   328 g co2/kwh, these emissions increased in 2012 by some
   12% to 369 g co2/kwh. one reason for the increase is the
   lower share of nuclear energy in a year-on-year comparison
   due to the shutdown of the nuclear power plants gkn i and
   kkp 1, while conventional electricity generation remained
   roughly at the same level. nevertheless, the specific co2
   emissions were still considerably lower than the national
   average of 503 g co2/kwh for germany in 2011.

enbw’s research and innovation activities are geared towards reducing co2 emissions, increasing
the use of renewable energies and ensuring the necessary flexibility of the energy system. our aim
is thus to provide the basis for improvements at enbw and to develop new products for local
solutions with renewable energies. the enbw group spent € 36.9 million on r&d activities in 2012
(prior year: € 37.0 million).

risk and opportunities report

the enbw group’s risk situation intensified in 2012. enbw faces major challenges on account of the
new energy concept introduced in germany and the associated political and regulatory consequences.
this gives rise to considerable risks, but there are also opportunities for new business activities. we
use strategic and operating measures to minimise risks and seize opportunities. there are currently
no risks to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

                    eration capacity by increasing our use of onshore wind power – such as here
                    in berghülen on the swabian alb. in order to harness wind energy at greater
                    heights, we have erected three wind turbines with a hub height of 138 metres.
                    our cover photo shows the moment our team has been working towards for
                    months: the “star lift”, when the nacelle and rotor blades are put into position
                    on top of the tower. the wind turbines have been connected to the grid since
                    17 december 2012.
