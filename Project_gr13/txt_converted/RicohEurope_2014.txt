                   to our stakeholders


                    since its establishment in 1936, ricoh has helped raise office productivity with its innova-
                    tive technology. today, the ricoh group offers products—including a diverse line of office
                    imaging equipment—as well as related solutions and services in approximately 200 coun-
                    tries and regions around the world. in recent years, the group’s operating environment
                    has changed significantly. consequently, the imaging and solutions domains—ricoh’s
                    core businesses—are approaching a key turning point.


                    against this backdrop, ricoh worked to reform the business structure of the group itself.
                    during the 17th mid-term management plan, which ran from april 2011 through march
                    2014, we were able to shift to a new profit model that provides customers with greater
                    value by transforming a traditional product-based business into a new model composed of
                    both products and services. in addition, we were able to expand business in emerging
                    markets, grow our new production printing business, and create other new businesses,
                    with an emphasis on industrial products.


                    building on these results, the 18th mid-term management plan, which began in april
                    2014, looks toward 2020 and beyond and guides us toward our future ideal—a corporate
                    group making customers feel “confident, comfortable and convenient.” to reach this
                    goal, we will emphasize businesses in the office business domain and accelerate approaches
                    in growth fields, namely, the commercial printing business domain, industrial business
                    domain and consumer business domain. we will reinforce technological strengths and the
                    close relationship we have built with our customers, and anticipate market changes to
                    spur new value creation.


                    with today’s rapidly changing world, the ricoh group will implement reforms that deliver
                    a level of speed and dynamism to outlive and outlast the changes that characterize the
                    operating environment. we stride with confidence toward the future, encouraged by the
                    corporate tagline “imagine. change.”—an expression reflecting power, generated by
                    leveraging the collective imagination of individuals, to change the future. our vision
                    extends beyond prevailing customer needs; we seek to anticipate future requirements
                    that customers themselves may not yet be aware of and create new lifestyles. naturally,
                    the ricoh group will continue to emphasize profit creation. but ultimately, the goal is to
                    be well-trusted by customers and society as a whole, and we will articulate the type of
                    company we want to be in the future and constantly evolve to reach that status to ensure
                    corporate sustainability and growth.

    from among the issues that we deem important for the creation of a sustainable society in reference
    to the trends of the global society, we identified the issues for the ricoh group and its stakeholders.
    we evaluated them in terms of their importance for the ricoh group’s business and in consideration
    of our stakeholders’ expectations for the ricoh group. in making this evaluation for the purpose of
    mapping, we incorporated the opinions of the related in-house departments, and had the evaluation

     at ricoh, we were quick to recognize the
     role that companies should fulfill with re-
     gard to the environment, including climate
     change, natural resource depletion etc., and
     since the 1990s, we have embraced sustain-
     able environmental management, seeking
     to conserve resources while at the same
     time generating profits. taking a long-term
     perspective, we shaped a vision, set medium-
     and long-term targets along the way, and
     continue to draft three-year environmental
     action plans to get us steadily closer to our
     targets. in formulating specific approaches,
     we look not only at the impact on the envi-
     ronment but also at the impact on business,
     from several angles including the needs of
     customers who use our products, future
     business growth, trends in international en-
     vironmental standards, our reputation, and
     ratings for socially responsible investments.

    ricoh institute of sustainability and business
    the ricoh institute of sustainability and business has two think tank functions: to anticipate future socioeconomic trends and gauge their potential
    impact on corporate management; and to raise issues and offer advice, based on its research, to the top management of ricoh. the institute pinpoints
    structural transformations taking place in society with regard to ongoing changes in the business environment while conducting independent analyses
    highlighting business conditions specific to ricoh. in addition, the institute explores new growth models, addressing such issues as corporate objectives
    for contributing to the resolution of universal problems, such as global warming, and how the company should respond to global competition. results
    are reflected in medium- and long-term management strategies. through this cycle of research tied to corporate initiatives, we seek to sharpen our
    competitive edge while gaining further trust from the international community. ➤ web  1

     general meeting of shareholders, we hold a business briefing where the ceo describes the mid-term management plan as well as a social
     gathering where executives and shareholders can speak directly with each other.

human rights education workshop



   a message from hideki wakabayashi, executive director of amnesty international japan*
   workshops are an effective learning tool for discovering new perceptions
   the purpose of human rights education is to draw out latent ability within employees,
   help them acquire knowledge they might not necessarily get through daily work
   activities, as well as judgment skills and a deeper sense of morality, and finally, elicit
   an awareness of human rights so that they are able to apply it to corporate activities
   that do indeed respect human rights.
       however, listening to lectures and seminar presentations is a one-way process,
   and does not leave much of a lasting impression. the way to achieve results is by
   augmenting the human rights e-learning offered to date with workshops, which go a
   step further. the retention rate is extremely high when people are engaged because hideki wakabayashi
   the practical activities reinforce whatever has been said.                                 executive director
                                                                                              amnesty international japan
       this time around, the discussions about what kind of stakeholders exist on the
   corporate value chain and what kind of human rights issues are found there—this
   must certainly have fostered new perceptions about human rights. i look forward to seeing a wider group of people
   involved in the workshops, and human rights due diligence becoming more firmly entrenched within the ricoh
   group.

    establishes ricoh european production centre
    the ricoh european production centre (repc) was set up in january 2014 at the european distribution centre, our
    netherlands-based logistics hub for europe. the new production center is an mb&r-type facility.
        to date, ricoh industrie france s.a.s. and ricoh uk products ltd.—configuration centers in consuming
    regions—took basic modules produced at intensive production sites in thailand and china and turned out finished
    products matched to customer specifications. from there, the products were shipped to the european distribution
    centre for delivery to customers in europe. by connecting sales and production divisions, coupled with our new
    operation at the repc, we have centralized the function of configuration centers in consuming regions on the
    logistics grid while trimming transportation costs and shrinking lead times. p.60

    bringing a “global mobility” perspective from overseas points into japan

    helping to transform ricoh into a truly global entity
    i find that people at ricoh in japan are always willing to try new things, although one of the big challenges is for me
    to explain how changes fit into existing processes. i’ve noticed the younger engineers particularly embrace change and
    become incredibly agile. my job as a manager is to help engineers fulfill their potential in driving cutting-edge technol-
    ogy, and i find that rewarding.
         i’ve experienced a lot of differences in communication style between silicon valley, where people feel like they
    must express their opinions or disagree, and in japan, which seems much more polite.                                           max mcfarland

    focusing priorities to add value for the regions
    before coming to japan, i managed technology marketing at ricoh americas corporation, leveraging our technology
    to optimize c­ ustomer solutions. ricoh then wanted me to support marketing for operations in the asia pacific, europe,
    and the americas. a lot of my work in japan is about conveying regional needs, accelerating the time to market, and
    helping top management better understand regional requirements.
        in japan, i’ve been able to break through barriers and get quicker decisions, which are win-wins for everyone. i’ve
    found that headquarters has long been keen to support the regions but hasn’t always been able to focus its efforts.

    leveraging headquarters’ willingness to understand customers and improve
    i’m excited about my role at ricoh headquarters because it gives me a great opportunity to work with our global
    teams to redefine how we structure our global accounts business and to use the voice of the customer to help shape
    our strategic direction.
         we are seeing a shift towards global hr management which i believe will have a very positive impact across the

    communication with employees
    ricoh global employee survey
    we aspire to build the ricoh group into a truly global organization—one global company—with a framework built upon a common foundation, the ricoh way. each and every
    ­employee can demonstrate his or her capabilities to the fullest extent possible and work independently and enthusiastically at assigned tasks, in keeping with the ricoh way. to achieve
     this, we regularly implement employee engagement surveys to pinpoint employee awareness and promote more desirable reforms, from the perspective of the ricoh way. in fiscal
     2014, we conducted our first global employee survey at 69 companies within the ricoh group—20 companies in japan and 49 companies overseas—garnering responses from about
     90% of the roughly 85,000 people surveyed.
           the survey results, which were announced on our intranet and in-house publication, will be used to plan measures for improvement.

    employee council
    ricoh employee council meetings are manifestations of our belief that employees are collaborators in the growth of our business. the council’s central meetings serve as a forum
    for communication between senior executives and other employees, with top management sharing information concerning the current state of the company and their management
    policies with representatives from 14 offices.
          the information is subsequently conveyed to all employees through workplace meetings as well as through the council’s newsletters. in addition, issues requiring top
    management consultation, such as pay raises, bonus payments and the company’s annual plans, are discussed in special committees by members of the central meeting, and the
    results are passed along to top management.

                                business model for a sustainable society
                                global environmental issues, particularly climate change, depletion of natural resources and
                                degradation of ecosystems, are causing various changes to society and to the economy
                                and also to the business landscape of ricoh group customers. these changes can become
                                management risks but they simultaneously present new opportunities. with this in mind,
                                the ricoh group puts sustainable environmental management into practice, seeking to
                                protect the environment and conserve precious resources while at the same time generating
                                profits. during the 17th environmental action plan, launched in the fiscal year ended march
                                2012, we directed concerted efforts toward shrinking the environmental footprint of our
                                customers through the development of energy-saving products and proposals for alternate
                                workstyles that successfully address the need for enhanced operating efficiency while
                                saving energy. in addition, we aim to limit environmental impact and minimize business risks,
                                mainly by cutting costs through energy- and resource-saving measures and by trimming the

global policy on social contribution activities
the ricoh group has set fundamental principles on social contribution by which all group companies around the

                                     “my days are more rewarding since i opened the shop.”
                                     there are three reasons why i opened the shop. first, a shop in the village would mean that the women here would
                                     not have to go shopping at the store four kilometers away. second, i could do my own shopping right here. and
                                     third, i could bring in some money for my family.
                                          since the shop opened its doors for business, i’ve handled lots of products and i’ve been able to talk to a variety
                                     of people. i just love it. the village women say the shop is so convenient. they really appreciate having a shop right
                                     in the neighborhood where they can buy an item that they
                                     suddenly run out of or pick up a small gift to take if they
                                     suddenly have to pay a visit to someone.
                                          before i had the shop, i just whiled away my time
                                     at home, not doing anything of particular importance.
                                     but now, i spend time working, and i can chat with my
                                     customers. my days are much more rewarding. i’m now
                                     making profit of several thousand rupees a month. if i
                                     can boost sales higher, i’d like to expand the shop. then,
                                     when the kids are older, i’d like to get qualifications to
                                     be a beauty professional and that should bring in more

                    history of the ricoh group


                                ricoh began by marketing sensitized paper and cameras. ever since then, we
                                have continued to help people share information with innovations in image
                                processing technologies.


                                the early years
                                ricoh’s origins date back to a decision of the institute of physical and chemical research to commercialize the
                                fruits of its r&d by setting up rikagaku kogyo co., ltd. in 1936, the institute established riken kankoshi co., ltd.
                                (renamed riken optical co., ltd. in 1938, and ricoh company, ltd. in 1963) to manufacture and sell sensitized
