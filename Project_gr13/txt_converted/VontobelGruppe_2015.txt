sustainability on the move


sustainability remained a topic of discussion in the financial markets in 2014. although
progress has been made on a number of fronts, such as the increased integration of
sustainability themes in financial analysis, there is still a need for further action in
other areas.


the organization swiss sustainable finance was established in 2014 to highlight swiss
strengths in this field and to provide instruments to further intensify the focus on
sustainability criteria within the industry. vontobel played a key role in setting up swiss
sustainable finance and hosts the organization. we are convinced that promoting­
a sustainable approach within the financial industry will offer a means of harnessing
an important trend, thus opening up new and sustainable growth areas.


sustainability is also a topic of debate internationally. the most recent example is the
“montreal carbon pledge” launched at the “principles for responsible investment”
(pri) conference. major institutional investors that have taken the pledge are calling
for the improved measurement of the risks associated with climate change in invest-
ment strategies. the guiding principle for the financial sector worldwide must be to
create transparency and take appropriate action.


vontobel’s activities in the area of sustainability were geared towards achieving this
in 2014. as part of our transition to the latest version of the global reporting initiative
sustainability reporting guidelines (g4), we focused more intensively on the principle
of materiality when selecting our sustainability indicators. for the first time, the full
sustainability report is contained in this section of the annual report. we are also
endeavouring to ensure that sustainability is even more firmly integrated into our
everyday business activities than before. to this end, we further expanded our efforts
relating to citizenship in 2014 to enable us to strategically promote projects with
a thematic link to the financial sector in the future. in terms of employee development,
we took seriously and addressed the points raised in the 2013 employee survey. we
improved internal communications by holding regular town hall meetings, and the
processes for focused career development have been optimized.


it is our clients, in particular, who should benefit from our commitment to sustaina-
bility. our specialists at various international locations are constantly identifying and
analysing trends, using their findings to deliver innovative investment strategies and
products. the successes we have achieved, such as being named “best private bank
in switzerland” by the swiss business magazine bilanz and our performance in the
swiss derivative awards, are a source of further motivation in this context.

sustainability at vontobel




                                        sustainability – firmly rooted in our strategy
                                        the pursuit of a sustainable approach to business is an ongoing task – and one that
                                        vontobel seeks to implement across all areas of the bank through appropriate pro-
                                        cesses, targets and measures, as well as the assumption of responsibility. we also
                                        committed to achieving continuous improvement. responsibility at senior management
                                        level, strategic integration and transparent reporting form the basis for this approach.


                                        our sustainability strategy is reviewed annually by the sustainability committee,
                                        which is chaired by the ceo, and is underpinned by appropriate targets and meas-
                                        ures. the sustainability management unit coordinates the implementation of these
                                        targets and measures, directly involving line managers in the corresponding business
                                        areas. our fundamental values are enshrined in two key documents:
                                        – the code of conduct, which defines basic principles that employees must observe to
                                          ensure that we perform our business activities in a fair and forward-looking manner.
                                        – the sustainability guidelines, which define the areas in which we take action to
                                         implement our sustainability strategy.


                                        we regularly evaluate the achievement of objectives using selected criteria. our annual
                                        sustainability report provides comprehensive information about all the key data and
                                        changes. the scope of our reporting altered slightly in 2014 due to the transition to
                                        the gri g4 guidelines and the “core” option. no restatements or corrections were
                                        made versus 2013 (g4-22, 23). the process to identify material aspects and indicators
                                        that was introduced under g4 was carried out by vontobel at various workshops and
                                        in interviews. working together with our three business units – private banking, asset
                                        management and investment banking – and the human resources and investor
                                        ­relations departments, all of the gri aspects and the specific financial sector sup-
                                        plements were discussed and assessed with regard to their materiality for vontobel.
                                        in a final review by the sustainability management unit, the following aspects were
                                        included in the 2014 sustainability report and were accompanied by the correspond-
                                        ing criteria (g4-18, 19):

                                        –– indirect economic impacts

                                                                                                         sustainability at vontobel




unless stated otherwise, the report boundary encompasses the vontobel group with
all its locations and the subsidiaries listed in the consolidated annual financial statements.
as a provider of financial products, we also seek to incorporate sustainability aspects in
our products and services, as well as in our partnerships and relationships with suppliers.
more detailed information can be found in the following sections (g4-20, 21). infor-
mation on the scope of consolidation can be found on page 200-201 of the annual
­report (g4-17).


open dialogue is important to us in order to gain a better understanding of the needs
of our clients, employees, suppliers and cooperation partners, and to take account of
the concerns of local communities and non-governmental organizations. we want to
engage with our stakeholders by providing clear and comprehensible information on the
different challenges and opportunities relating to environmental, social and governance
(esg) issues. regular surveys among our employees and clients are key tools in this
context, as are specific discussions with our suppliers. in the year under review, we
­implemented measures based on the results of the 2013 employee and client survey.
­issues raised by employees included calls for enhanced internal communication and
targeted support in the area of career development. the majority of clients indicated
they were very satisfied with vontobel, but we nonetheless want to achieve improve-
ments in this area and further strengthen client trust in our company (g4-24, 25, 26, 27).


focusing on clients
our business philosophy is centred on achieving client satisfaction and on gaining and
maintaining client trust. this task has become more complex in view of the increasing
demands being placed on the financial sector and more stringent regulatory require-
ments (both in switzerland and worldwide). at the same time, clients have become
more discerning, and the demand for individually tailored solutions has increased. sus-
tainability aspects are playing a more significant role in this context, even purely in
terms of economic risk considerations.


offering each of our clients the right product or best possible service is therefore the
primary task of our three business units – private banking, asset management and
­investment banking. private banking offers a comprehensive range of services to
­address a wide variety of financial matters, from portfolio management, to investment
advice and inheritance planning. asset management has a multi-boutique approach
with five independent centres of competence, and focuses on active asset management.
investment banking ranks among the leading issuers of derivatives and structured
products in switzerland and europe. our range of services is rounded off with secu-
rities and f­orex trading, as well as the securities services provided by transaction
banking. compliance with the product naming requirements defined by regulators is
mandatory for all our business units. as well as being one of the leading issuers of
structured products in switzerland, we play a pioneering role in this business: since
1 october 2014, vontobel financial products has also been transparently disclosing
the issuer margin of its own structured products in addition to the distribution fees,
thus setting a new industry standard in terms of cost transparency.

sustainability at vontobel




                                        equally, vontobel assigns the highest importance to protecting client data and to com-
                                        plying with all the statutory provisions. the legal & compliance department is respon-
                                        sible for regulating and monitoring both of these aspects throughout vontobel. there
                                        were no cases involving the violation of client privacy in 2014.


                                        in private banking, the individual service offered by vontobel forms the cornerstone
                                        our good relationship with clients. our relationship managers take time to understand
                                        the wishes and needs of each client and make a structured assessment of their personal
                                        circumstances in order to offer them services that are tailored to their individual
                                        ­re-quirements. to ensure that our clients only purchase products that are suitable and
                                        appropriate for them in terms of their personal financial market experience and risk
                                        ­c a-pacity, the new risk profile that was developed in 2013 was further enhanced to
                                        take into account specific market requirements. this enables relationship managers to
                                        issue investment recommendations that are in line with the risk profile of the client in
                                        question, incorporating both their personal experience and the expected development
                                        of the market. this makes it possible to address our clients and their needs more specif-
                                        ically. we conduct a survey of our private clients every two years where possible. the
                                        2013 survey indicated that client satisfaction was already high at 84%, and our goal is
                                        to continue to achieve improvements in this area.


                                        vontobel began to introduce retrocession-free share classes in portfolio management
                                        in 2013, and systematically pursued these efforts in 2014. this measure is partly aimed
                                        at further enhancing cost transparency in portfolio management mandates, and is also
                                        a key factor with regard to client satisfaction. retrocession-free investment funds have
                                        been gradually phased in, taking into account the available investment opportunities.


                                        to ensure that our relationship managers are ideally prepared to meet the needs of our
                                        clients, we again invested in a range of training programmes in 2014. the focus here
                                        was primarily on specialist expertise and advisory skills. our e-learning platform has
                                        proved to be an effective tool that can be used across different countries. opportunities
                                        for learning are not restricted to our employees, however. our magazine for private
                                        ­clients, which is published three times per year, and our investor’s outlook publication
                                        cover a range of fascinating topics for a broad and interested audience. the three issues
                                        of the private clients magazine published in 2014 – “technology”, “trust is liberating”
                                        and “rising stars face change” – focused on these key areas affecting movements and
                                        trends in the financial market, while also highlighting the growing importance of sus-
                                        tainability.


                                        vontobel also held a range of client events to promote direct dialogue. for example, at
                                        the breakfast event organized in conjunction with the magazine “die stiftung”, we
                                        ­focused on the question of how foundations can operate professionally while imple-
                                        menting sustainability principles. vontobel has extensive experience in supporting
                                        foundations as well as in the field of sustainable investments, and the event provided
                                        an ideal platform to demonstrate how these two competences ideally complement one
                                        another. as part of a shareholder engagement initiative, we visited burckhardt com-
                                        pression ag in winterthur during the year under review. ethos, the swiss foundation

governance aspects, and works with fund management companies to promote dia-
logue between shareholders and the boards of directors and management teams.
“vontobel fund (ch) ii – ethos equities swiss mid & small”, a fund that was recently
also opened up to private individuals, was used as an example to offer an insight into
shareholder engagement, and give a more detailed view of the interplay between
companies, asset managers and investors.


our services and funds once again received various awards in 2014. in the private
banking test conducted by the investor magazine “€uro”, vontobel was assigned
the highest rating of “excellent” for its investment proposal. in conjunction with the
munich-­based institut für vermögensaufbau (iva), the magazine €uro conducted its
seventh annual private banking test of 20 banks in germany. the test was based on
“mystery shopping” research conducted with real test clients, and it assessed how
well the investment proposal put forward by the private banks corresponded to the
needs of the clients. the discussion with the test client was successful, with no ques-
tions left unanswered. vontobel also performed well in the mystery shopping test
carried out by the swiss business magazine “bilanz”, which named it the “best private
bank in switzerland 2014”.


sharper focus on opportunities and risks in the investment business
vontobel’s business model is based on an integrated approach that combines the key
competencies of the three business units private banking, asset management and
­investment banking. this approach is particularly beneficial when it comes to contin-
uously improving our products and services. the integration of sustainability aspects
into the product and services portfolio significantly leverages our efforts to promote
sustainable business practices, and is therefore part of our sustainability strategy.


each business unit performs tasks relating to product development, client communi-
cation and marketing to ensure continued developments in this area. the principles
of responsible investments (pri) provide guidance in this area, and we also comply
with the requirements of the european sri transparency code.


the global leaders funds select companies that deliver a high cash flow return on
­invested capital. we are convinced that in an increasingly globalized and dynamic
world, companies that actively address resource-related and social challenges have
better prospects of success, and gain a competitive advantage over other firms that
focus solely on the short-term generation of profits. to ensure that the selected com-
panies are attractive over the long term, the fundamental analysis also incorporates
sustainability criteria. this process was developed by financial analysts based on their
extensive knowledge of the industry and the companies in question and incorporates
esg criteria. the assessment of esg themes is one of the four main elements in the
investment approach of our global thematic boutique, the other three being profita-
bility, industry position, and intrinsic value. our analysts evaluate sector-specific esg
criteria in nine different thematic areas, based on information from external research
agencies (vigeo, gmi, bloomberg, inrate), reports from hermes, and publicly acces-
sible ngo opinions. the minimum standard framework (msf) uses a traffic light system,

                                        whenever voting rights are exercised, the decision-making authority always lies with
                                        vontobel, which checks the proposals put forward by heos on voting and engage-
                                        ment. these proposals may also be amended or rejected. the guidelines followed by
                                        heos have also been reviewed and approved by vontobel. in 2013, votes were cast
                                        on over 2,324 individual motions at more than 230 annual general meetings on behalf
                                        of our sustainable and global thematic trends equity funds. almost 58% of these
                                        votes were cast in favour of the items proposed on the agenda, with around 41%
                                        comprising votes against the proposals, and around 1% abstentions. we held discus-
                                        sions about critical issues with around 48 companies included in these funds, focusing
                                        primarily on governance issues. in addition to formal engagement processes, our

                                        by taking sustainability criteria into account, we enable our clients to invest in future-
                                        oriented themes and to thus achieve a financial return while contributing to sustainable

                                        chf 932 mn of assets under management at the end of 2014. regular discussions
                                        with portfolio managers in other areas ensure that the relevant recommendations are

supply of clean technologies. as at the end of 2014, these three funds had a total volume
of chf 407 mn.


vontobel asset management also manages sustainability and theme funds with a
volume of chf 3,243 mn for various cooperation partners. through its involvement
in responsability, an organization specializing in social investments and microfinance
investing, vontobel supports the provision of microfinance funds and other innova-
tive financial products.


in addition to its esg approach, vontobel consistently excludes investments in com-
panies that manufacture controversial weapons. appropriate processes are in place
to ensure that none of our investment funds or actively managed assets are invested
in manufacturers of cluster munitions or land mines, and that such companies are
­excluded on principle from investment recommendations to clients.

there was a marked increase in the volume of sustainable investments managed by
vontobel, which rose by 29% in 2014 compared to the previous year. this segment
grew more strongly than all other investments. measured as a proportion of total
­a ssets under management, sustainable investments increased by 0.7 of a percentage
point to 4.5%.


for more than a decade, clients have been able to lend their support to a variety of
projects focusing on social issues, culture, ecology, education or medicine through
vontobel’s charitable foundation.


for the second year in succession, the foundation is supporting the “making intelli-
gent use of biodiversity” project being conducted by the research institute of
­o rganic agriculture (fibl) in frick. this project aims to develop new cultivation pro-
cesses to find economically efficient means to support beneficial insects through the
use of flowering plants. increasing awareness of the new approach will also ensure its
more widespread use, thus contributing to more sustainable agriculture.


another foundation that received support in 2014 was “bildungswerkstatt ­b ergwald”
(bwbw), which promotes the development of a more active and holistic relation­
ship between the population – in particular young people – and nature and their
­s ocial e­ nvironment. practical project weeks outdoors give young people the opportu-
nity to perform work to protect the forest and cultural landscape in mountain re-

                                         support for employees
                                         the skills and expertise of vontobel’s 1,449 employees, who work at five locations in
                                         switzerland and 16 locations internationally, are vital to vontobel’s success today and
                                         in the future. the competition for skilled employees is especially evident in the finan-
                                         cial industry. as a medium-sized bank, vontobel has to compete with the major
                                         global players. individual career planning and suitable training and further education
                                         opportunities are therefore especially important in positioning vontobel as an attrac-
                                         tive employer. other key aspects include a pleasant and inclusive working environ-
                                         ment that is free from discrimination and provides equal opportunities.


                                         to ensure these requirements are addressed properly, employees have been assigned
                                         an increased role in determining their own professional development. annual perfor-
                                         mance evaluations and the definition of individual goals (business objectives), which
                                         are carried out using an online tool, also include the option of drawing up an individ-
                                         ual development plan that is agreed between employees and their line managers.
                                         vontobel expects employees to show initiative, and they can call on the support of
                                         the human resources department as well as the business partners at the individual
                                         business units responsible for career planning.


                                         attracting more women to the financial sector is challenging. as part of its efforts ­to
                                         plan the future development of its workforce, vontobel specifically wants to attract
                                         young female graduates, as well as female members of senior management. vontobel
                                         commissioned a study on diversity and inclusion at the end of 2014 to enable it to
                                         ­define specific measures based on the findings. this study takes account of addi-
                                         tional demographic factors such as age and nationality, in line with the bank’s
                                         ­requirements, and is to be incorporated in a specific plan of action in 2015.


                                         in addition to such aspects, equal opportunities are another key criterion determin-
                                         ing employee satisfaction. they not only comprise equal career opportunities, but
                                         also include equal pay. vontobel does not measure wage equality in specific cases or
                                         by gender, since salaries are set solely on the basis of the employee’s abilities and
                                         function. vontobel’s compensation system therefore focuses on promoting the
                                         group’s long-term success, and a proportion of the variable compensation awarded
                                         to employees is deferred to encourage and reward responsible and risk-conscious
                                         conduct that is in the best interests of the company. further information on this topic
                                         can be found in the compensation report (page 61ff.).


                                         of a total of 1,449 employees, 1,219 were employed in full-time positions. in addi-
                                         tion to employees with permanent contracts, a total of four temporary employees
                                         worked for vontobel as of the end of 2014. these individuals either have fixed-term
                                         contracts or are available on an “on call” basis to assist the company when needed.
                                         total headcount increased by around 3% year-on-year.

long-term succession planning that addresses the needs of the business units is an
essential part of vontobel’s long-term planning in the area of human resources.
­particular attention is paid here to promoting team diversity. the number of differ-
ent nationalities was largely stable in 2014 compared with the previous year. the age
structure shows that most employees are aged between 30 and 50 years old.
­targeted support is an important factor in aligning the potential of this age group
with the staffing needs of the business units.


in 2014, training and education measures therefore focused on redesigning the lead-
ership curriculum, the range of sales training programmes (negotiating skills) and
employee onboarding. the latter was further enhanced with the vontobel ambassa-
dor programme, a platform centred on e-learning that focuses on client benefits in
addition to key products and services. meanwhile, the vontobel academy once
again offered a wide range of internal and external courses in 2014, covering
­specialist subjects, personal development and leadership. expenditure on training
­increased year on year as a result, both in absolute terms and per employee.


in addition to structured employee development, vontobel is committed to offering
attractive working conditions. one example is the promotion of a healthy work/life
balance. the benefits granted to working parents go beyond the statutory minimum
in terms of both maternity and paternity leave. after completing six years of service,
female employees benefit from six months of maternity leave on full pay, while mem-
bers of staff who have been with the company for a shorter period of time are enti-
tled to four months of maternity leave. new fathers are granted five days of paternity
leave. vontobel is a long-standing member of childcare service, an organization that
advises parents on childcare issues and runs a group of nurseries. vontobel is also a

                                         executive board, some criticisms were also voiced about leadership skills within the
                                         company. other aspects highlighted included the further scope for improvement in
                                         internal communications and in the area of individual career planning.


                                         to strengthen internal communications, a total of 12 town hall meetings were held in
                                         2014. these dialogue platforms are aimed at enhancing the exchange of information
                                         and views between the executive board and employees. further progress was also
                                         made in the structured implementation of personal professional training goals in the
                                         online employee evaluation process. the new leadership curriculum ensures that
                                         line managers and the executive board are involved in the programmes. the first
                                         round of courses will be held in 2015, as will the next employee survey. this will then
                                         enable us to make an even better assessment of the success of the measures introduced.

                                         vontobel is committed to reducing the environmental and climate-related impacts of
                                         its activities through the use of appropriate processes. we gather comprehensive
                                         ­environmental data each year in order to measure our progress. when conducting our
                                         operations, we strive to use materials as sparingly as possible and place an emphasis
                                         on energy efficiency and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. we also specif-
                                         ically monitor environmental risks with a view to reducing our environmental f­ ootprint
                                         at product level. our findings are incorporated in the development of sustainable
                                         ­investment strategies.


                                         the sustainability committee is responsible for the strategic management of these
                                         aspects, with the related measures being coordinated by the sustainability manage-
                                         ment unit. the committee, which is chaired by the ceo, meets twice a year. repre-

                                         agement unit in conjunction with the ceo. line managers are directly responsible for

                                         with our partner southpole, we thus support projects that promote renewable e­ nergy.

                                         versary year of 2013, and the absence of this had a positive impact in 2014. to date,
                                         vontobel has not imposed any internal rules governing paper consumption. one ex-
                                         ception is its goal of ensuring that over 90% of the paper used bears the fsc label or
                                         has been produced using recycled paper. we are, nevertheless, seeking to achieve fur-
                                         ther reductions in paper usage, and have therefore launched the “vontobel squaremobile
                                         private banking” project. it is based on the concept of increasing usage of digital
                                         media, and of developing a multi-channel strategy for client communications. in

                                         the vontobel employee restaurant adopted the “one two we” programme in 2013,
                                         and the “one climate menu” that was subsequently introduced proved very popular
                                         in 2014. on average, our partner sv group served 633 meals per day. “one two we”
                                         is a sustainability programme launched in conjunction with wwf switzerland. the aim
                                         is to offer more meals that mainly use seasonal produce and include fewer products
                                         that are transported by air and less meat, while making increased use of different types
                                         of cereals as an alternative to rice – thus reducing the carbon footprint in the food
                                         chain. to make the offering more climate-friendly but also more attractive, the range
                                         of vegetarian options was extended in 2014. sv group now offers vegetarian meals at

participation in the «bike to work» programme was also a success once again, with
17 teams and 68 employees cycling to work despite the wet conditions in summer
2014. the small fleet of two «twizy» electric vehicles for commuting between office
locations proved so popular that a third vehicle was purchased. monthly travel statis-
tics should make it possible to examine the need for trips more closely in future and
help make savings in this regard. it is also intended that employees will increasingly use
video conferences as an alternative to business travel.


social responsibility generates added value
vontobel is part of the global economic system but nonetheless has strong local roots
in zurich. we therefore strive to assume our social responsibility on a number of differ-
ent levels. we believe we have an obligation to deal responsibly with our various stake-
holders in all the locations in which we operate. the fundamental structural changes in
the banking sector and society’s increasingly critical view of our industry present us
with new challenges. to assume our responsibilities, we as a bank must always stay
fully focused on the needs of our clients and take account of risks, while operating suc-
cessfully as a business in the long term. in doing so, and by complying with ethical
business standards, we make a contribution to the economy as a whole. the corporate
taxes that have to be paid every year form part of these social responsibilities, as are
the payment of salaries and the provision of financial services to private and institu-
tional clients. vontobel also makes a contribution in its role as a purchaser, awarding
contracts for products or services including catering, cleaning and the printing of pub-
lications to local suppliers. our focus here is on establishing long-term business rela-
tionships with our partners.


added value increased by 7% year-on-year, resulting in a 20% increase of taxes paid.
as a result of the improvement in net profit in 2013, vontobel holding ag once again
increased its dividend payout.

the bank regards compliance with applicable laws as an inherent part of its business
activities, and as an essential measure – especially to avoid reputation risks. all busi-
ness areas are monitored continuously as part of its group-wide risk analysis, using
appropriate compliance processes to detect any possible legal infringements. one of
the primary areas of focus on the client side is risks arising from money laundering
(including the financing of terrorism). in this regard, politically exposed persons are
subject to a special monitoring process.


to ensure our internal compliance guidelines are enforced, all employees receive ap-
propriate training upon joining vontobel, and are issued with an employee handbook
that contains specific regulations and instructions, as well as the code of conduct. it
                                                                                              vontobel group, annual report 2014   17

                                         also clearly sets out the principle of non-discrimination, in line with our commitment
                                         to ensuring a working environment that is free from discrimination. in the case of any
                                         incidents, the “whistleblowing hotline” is one of the points of contact available. no
                                         incidents or infringements were identified or reported in 2014.


                                         thanks to regular training, our employees remain informed of compliance aspects
                                         of both existing and new statutory and regulatory requirements, thus preventing
                                         infringements of internal and external rules and regulations. in 2014, training was
                                         provided throughout the group on fatca (foreign account tax compliance act),
                                         and courses were held on selected topics in specific areas. fatca is aimed at ensuring
                                         the taxation of accounts held abroad by persons who are us taxpayers. as an extra-
                                         territorial application of us tax law, it essentially requires all foreign financial institutions
                                         to regularly and automatically report to the us authorities the identity and assets of
                                         the us clients they serve. other key topics covered included the prevention of money
                                         laundering (clarifying transactions, know your customer, preventing the financing
                                         of terrorism) and compliance with cross-border regulations. vontobel also issued
                                         a group-wide policy on anti-corruption and gifts. private banking provided training
                                         on this issue, and more courses are planned for 2015.   


                                         we want to give some of the value we create back to society. vontobel supports cul-
                                         tural, environmental and educational activities through donations and sponsorship
                                         contributions. as a member of the swiss climate foundation, we donate a significant
                                         part of our re-distributed co2 levies to the foundation, which then uses these funds
                                         to support climate protection projects at small and medium-sized swiss enterprises.
                                         the modernization of facilities and improved infrastructure promote product innova-
                                         tion and efficient logistics, which in turn have a positive impact on economic growth
                                         and lead to efficiency gains for swiss businesses. many of these projects would not
                                         be implemented were it not for the swiss climate foundation. other sponsorship
                                         ­activities included the nzz podium and the lucerne festival. vontobel made dona-
                                         tions totalling chf 708,121 in 2014. for every christmas card sent by vontobel in
                                         2014, the bank made a donation to the biovision foundation, which supports people
                                            ­ eveloping regions. these donations support the valuable work of the foundation,

                                         while also meeting with a positive response from our clients and business partners.


                                         it is not only monetary contributions that are beneficial: society can also profit from
                                         the transfer of knowledge. a number of vontobel employees share their expertise
                                         with others by giving talks and presentations at training events that are held inter-
                                         nally or at external educational establishments. this makes it possible to ensure the
                                         transfer of knowledge within the company and to raise public awareness about the
                                         complex interrelationships within the financial markets and the importance of the
                                         ­f inance industry for the swiss economy.

vontobel purchases a large quantity of products and services from external providers
– ranging from facility management services and it infrastructure to the design and
production of printed materials. we consider it important to discuss environmental
and social issues with our suppliers and partners, and to make them aware of the

­employment standards, respecting human rights, preventing corruption, and making
careful use of natural resources. the corresponding requirements are set down in our
general purchasing guidelines.
