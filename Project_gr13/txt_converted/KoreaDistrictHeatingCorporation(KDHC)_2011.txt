ganization, budget, etc., are awarded to the agency head, who in
turn is responsible for the agency’s performance. kdhc was se-
lected as outstanding agency in this area. in 3 tasks and 5 mea-
surement indices such as profitability improvement, establish-
ment of low carbon, green growth business structure through
cost savings of krw 40 billion, and improvement in heating
service unit price that translated into about krw 14.7 billion of
saving effect, we achieved the best performance among four
agencies by garnering a general score of 96.4 points.

* lng (liquefied natural gas) :
  lng is the liquefied gas produced by cooling the methanol acquired
  by refining natural gas. specifically, lng is liquefied through about 600
  times more compression of natural gas at -162°c. thanks to the                     green
  refining process, lng has very high pure methanol content and zero moisture.

* lswr (low-sulfur waxy residue) :
                                                                                     kdhc
  lswr is low-sulfur waxy residue fuel oil (bunker c). sulfur content is generally
  0.3wt% or less. as the name suggests, lswr contains a large amount of low
  sulfur or waxy ingredient. at room temperature, lswr hardens and turns into
  solid; thus, a separate warming facility is required to store lswr.

● sustainability management system
kdhc makes all-out efforts for sustainability management by diversifying energy supply sources, securing energy resources’ long-term stabil-
ity, and pursuing the globalization of business areas. in particular, we spearhead the safe and smooth supply of energy, environmental protec-
tion, and minimization of global climate change impacts. kdhc executes an energy welfare policy to serve the people and fulfill its responsibility
as a corporate citizen. our policy team supervises each sector’s strategies such as the departments of environment, ethics, social contribution,
and safety, integrates them into sustainability strategies, and links them with kdhc’s business strategies. the establishment of all these strate-
gies and execution results are reviewed and decided through kdhc’s top decision-making organization.

risk management
risk management and responsiveness to efficient management of energy become the survival factors of companies given the
worsening environmental disasters and climate change that seriously damage our living base worldwide. kdhc has built an
enterprise risk management system by choosing the material risks in overall management in advance and systematically man-
aging them. this way, we overcome the negative impacts of the global economic downturn. in particular, we focus on predicting,
assessing, and preventing hazards in the risks in advance. such is aimed at taking action to prevent the risks from evolving into a
full-blown crisis. all these are designed to minimize damages in case risks actually occur and evolve into a crisis. risk manage-
ment consists of activities to cope with an emergency situation.

                                           to cope with a crisis and have illustrated the signs of crisis in advance in the manual by field. when a

nun, philippa (arium) _ social responsibility sector
i think kdhc’s district heating and cooling business is an energy business that is essential in communities. with high-quality energy supply, com-
munities seem to be happier. looking into various energy businesses and environmental management cases, i believe kdhc is a company with
potential for sustainable development, and this ranks high in my book. kdhc’s active social contribution activities are regarded as those required
for community development. i hope kdhc adequately collects various stakeholders’ opinions, contribute to community development, and grow
as a warm-hearted energy company through its long-term and sustainable activities.

● volunteering activities to ensure a warm winter
the happiness sharing corps of kdhc carries out volunteering activities to ensure a warm winter. with around 50 employees participating, the
corps carried out in 2010 the sharing of winter kimchi with love at arium (welfare homes for elderly living alone), delivery of heating goods and
living necessities to multicultural families and north koreans residing in south korea, improvement of residential environment targeting the low
income senior citizens, and provision of heating goods.


● regular volunteering activities of arium for elderly living alone
kdhc, seongnam city, and kumho asiana signed an agreement for social contribution and built arium, the welfare home for the elderly living
alone, for the purpose of looking for a fundamental measure that will allow the elderly to spend their old age comfortably as part of volunteering
activities to ensure a warm winter as carried out each year.
implemented in three-sector mode -- a new concept for social contribution activities by private sector, public sector, and government ? the
project was managed as a consortium type wherein seongnam city took care of design and supervision and paid construction expenses and
kumho asiana paid part of the construction expenses. in arium, there are 19 senior citizens living alone. the happiness sharing corps of the
head office visits arium every third wednesday of the month and continually carries out tailored volunteering activities reflecting the tenant
senior citizens’ needs.
* arium : this is the name adopted following a public naming contest in 2008 and is short for “our beautiful and happy nest.” arium in english means nest and space.




    interview with members of the happiness sharing corps
    members of the goyang branch visit the house of angels (welfare facilities for disabled people) every second thursday of the month and help in wash-
    ing and meal preparation. the branch invited 19 people from the house of angels to the branch at the end of 2010 and held christmas and birthday
    parties.
     “i feel sorry that some friends who are sick could not come over even though they were invited. still, i was so happy that many
    friends visited the branch and we had a good time together.”


    interviews with cheongju branch members of happiness sharing corps
    the cheongju branch has a tie-up with the sannam general social welfare center, which has been operating an
    after-school class for low income bracket children since 2005. the children are invited to the branch semiannually,
    and swimming lessons are offered by opening the swimming pool. the number of children who visited the cheongju
    branch was about 50 including elementary school students and mentally disabled adolescents.
    “i am happy to see children use and enjoy the facilities within our branch. their visit is truly good and worthy if the
    children make fond memories of kdhc.”

    i understand that kdhc is very interested in the reduction of co2 emissions and environment, and that it systematically copes with such. i have
    heard that kdhc’s activation of heating, cooling, and electric power businesses along with the new renewable energy business is very excellent
    because kdhc carries out management considering the environment. i think kdhc needs to cement its status and role as a general energy
    company more on the pr dimension through its dynamic businesses so that the company can be heard more by customers, communities, and
    citizens.

                             eco-energy r&d
kdhc has established 3-stage, mid- and long-term r&d plans pursuing field operation-centered r&d, securing independent research capabilities,
and seeking efficient research; we implement all these to acquire sustainable growth engines for the community energy system.




kdhc plans r&d for accumulating and securing in advance its own eco-energy core technologies to overcome the environment and energy
crises including measures to cope with climate change and high oil prices through the consolidation of linkage between the government’s low
carbon, green growth and kdhc’s mid- and long-term development direction. we select and implement 22 core technologies in 6 fields related
to the reflection of rapidly changing advanced technology trends and efficiency improvement technologies according to energy use volume in-
crease and environment, a hot issue domestically and internationally.

● economic strategy for sustainability managment
kdhc was chosen as an autonomous management pilot agency. therefore, we signed an autonomous management agreement with the
government, and broader management rights were guaranteed in human resources, organization, and budget. this greatly helped our active
engagement in the energy development business.
kdhc’s district heating business’ sales rose, thanks to an increase in domestic district heating service-adopting households. since the new
district energy system facilities are scheduled to be launched from the end of 2010 to 2014 in paju, pangyo, gwanggyo, goyang samsong, sejong
city, gwangju innovation city, and dongtan new town 2, we expect sales and operating profit in 2014 to be 3 times and 2.5 times those of 2010,
respectively.

     the active communication activities of kdhc, which collects various stakeholders’ opinions and develops by reflecting them on the corporation’s
     management, are evaluated very positively. i think kdhc’s supply of heat and electric energy at cheap prices to korean people is commendable.
     still, i believe kdhc needs to enhance its corporate image and credibility through the precise recognition of kdhc’s specific businesses and active
     social contribution activities by korean people through more strategic and overall pr activities. i expect kdhc to grow and develop further with
     mid- and long-term and sustainability management strategies considering the economy and environment of communities.

kdhc is a public corporation leading the adoption of the community energy supply system (ces), which involves supplying many consumers includ-
ing buildings with heat or electricity produced in large-scale energy production facilities such as combined heat and power (chp) plant. we mainly
produce and supply electricity and heat from the chp plant and supply community energy using waste incinerators and peak load boilers.

currently expanding its business area from heat and warm water
supply to cooling system.
our district cooling system uses a dehumidification cooling mode
supplying cold air using the existing heating pipes; thus, business
size is forecast to grow. we also develop a user system for high-
quality cooling system considering user needs such as multi-room
cooling.
we have adopted an economical cold water direct supply mode us-
ing residual heat from power generation and late-night electric ice
storage for sangam dmc, southeast region distribution complex,
and kintex. following the development of a 2-step absorption re-
frigerator that increases user efficiency, we plan to supply district
cooling service homes including apartments. we have a master plan
to increase district cooling service sales to 10% of district heating

                                          power business
kdhc expands the power business ratio by building its own chp plants to grow and develop into a general energy company beyond sales structure
that depends solely on the heating business. to carry out power production stably, we strive for stable operation, efficient enhancement of power
generation facilities, and power generation cost reduction.


● operation of power generation facilities
kdhc has power generation facilities in the hwaseong, pangyo, daegu, suwon, cheongju, and gangnam regions. for power business expan-
sion, power generation facilities rose 436% from 161mw in 2001 to 863mw in 2010, with the generated power volume increasing 1,121% from
334gwh in 2001 to 4,079gwh in 2010.
the timely operation and suspension of power plants in the seoul metropolitan area such as hwaseong, pangyo, suwon, and gangnam contrib-
ute greatly to stable power system operation in the seoul and gyeonggi regions.
