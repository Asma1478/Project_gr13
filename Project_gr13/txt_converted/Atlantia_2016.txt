gri/g4-1




dear stakeholders,
the group’s results in 2015 reinforced atlantia’s standing as a global player, leading in the management of motorway and airport
infrastructures in a context characterized by moderate recovery though still influenced by persisting uncertainties worldwide.

in 2015 the variante del valico was inaugurated, one of europe’s most important infrastructures of the last twenty years. this infra-
structure testifies to autostrade per l’italia’s investment plan and the country’s determination to recover from the economic crisis and
unblock one of the main bottlenecks of the italian infrastructure system.

as to airport activities, aeroporti di roma accelerated its capex plan, reaching euro 335 million (nearly doubled since 2014). with
over 46 million passengers combined, rome’s two airports, fiumicino and ciampino, reached a new record high in traffic, despite
the restricted operations at the fiumicino airport from 7th may to 18th july 2015 as a result of the fire at terminal 3.

2015 was characterized by a succession of events confirming the increasing attention paid worldwide to the topics relating to sus-
tainability: the publication of the pope’s encyclical on the environment, the world climate conference in paris and the definition of
the global objectives for sustainable development (cdgs), on which all the world players are focusing.
in this context, the group confirmed its commitment and engagement. for the seventh consecutive year atlantia was included in the
dow jones sustainability world indexes and in the ftse4good, the main indexes at the international level that require increasingly
higher sustainability performances in line with the global compact principles (to which the group has adhered since 2004). also in
2015, atlantia obtained the “top employers” certification, recognizing excellence in the management of human resources, an area
in which the group grew by over 800 people.

another area of excellence is reporting and communication to stakeholders. this is the fourth edition of this report drafted accord-
ing to the principles of the framework defined by the international integrated reporting council. this year’s edition shows the great
effort expended to make the document easier to read without affecting its completeness and content clarity. the standard and the
reporting system adopted enable us to anticipate the effects of eu directive 2014/95/ue that envisages that, starting from 2017,
non-financial data and information be provided in the annual reports.
positive results were also reached in safety: no fatal accidents were recorded in the workplace, and the accident rate on the mo-
torway network decreased, especially in the stretches with above average accident indexes. positive results were also recorded in
airports.

the customer satisfaction index in the motorway segment improved further, reaching excellent levels, and engagement and infor-
mation campaigns multiplied, including the “my way” tv channel, providing real time traffic updates in an innovative way.

increasing attention was dedicated to the enhancement of the artistic and cultural heritage of the territory with the extension of the
“sei in un paese meraviglioso” (you are in a wonderful country) project along the motorway network and the development of 10 ep-
isodes on the sky arte hd tv channel dedicated to the project. moreover, the “navigare il territorio” (discover the territory) project
was developed to draw attention to the archeological site of “portus”, close to the fiumicino airport.

as to environmental sustainability, the group continued the implementation of initiatives to mitigate noise and decrease energy con-
sumption; water consumption was also reduced, while segregated waste collection was increased.

these are the main results that characterized 2015. our challenge for the coming years is to continue to create value for all of our
stakeholders in accordance with the specific national and international contexts in which the group operates.

 5. risk management
 gri/g4-2



 atlantia believes it key to conduct preventive and ongoing surveys to monitor the nature and level of the risks correlated with the
 company’s strategic objectives of sustainable value creation to enable informed company decisions in relation to risk assumption,
 definition of the company targets and operating choices.

 the main steps
 2005: implementation of the enterprise risk management system that allows the identification, assessment and management of
 company risks.

 2013: introduction of the risk appetite, which represents the overall risk level that the company is willing to accept to attain its
 strategic objectives (updated annually). the risk appetite is developed and updated for the entire organization by the board
 of directors. the tool is updated to take into account possible external (regulatory, macroeconomic) and internal (acquisitions,
 mergers, changes in the organization) modifications ….

 2015: updating of the risk management process and of the criteria for the identification, valuation and management of the risks of
 the group’s companies (“atlantia group’s risk management guidelines”).

 abroad: the countries in which atlantia operates
 the group’s expansion abroad is oriented towards countries with high growth potential (brazil, chile and india), characterized by a
 positive trend in terms of demographics, level of traffic, concentration of natural resources and raw materials, political stability and
 reliability of the regulatory framework. these aspects are correlated to the possibility of strong gnp increases in the medium-long
 term and, consequently, increased mobility.

traffic trends
in 2015, traffic on the motorway networks managed by the group abroad rose by 1.9% versus 2014, with different performances in
the various countries (particularly high in chile with +6.7% and poland with +8.6%, while a 2.1% reduction was recorded in brazil
due to the slowing down of the economy). this performance generated an increase of euro 41 million in revenues from toll payments
versus 2014.

airport sector
aeroporti di roma ranks sixth in europe and first in italy for passenger traffic. the activities carried out by aeroporti di roma are
divided into two business units: aviation activities (core airport activity supporting passenger and cargo aviation) and non-aviation
activities (differentiated range of retail services dedicated to passengers, operators and visitors inside aeroporti di roma facilities,
real estate activities). in 2015, passenger traffic in the rome airport system totalled over 46 million passengers (+6.1% vs 2014,
above all thanks to the eu segment). this result is even more significant if we consider the period of restricted operations suffered
by the fiumicino airport following the fire at terminal 3 (7 may - 18 july) 1. in particular, passenger traffic at the fiumicino airport rose
by 4.8% and at ciampino airport by 16.1% (due also to the partial flight re-scheduling following the fire). capacity results were also
positive (+1.7% movements; +3.1% seats; +2.9% aircraft tonnage). as to passenger distribution by geographic area, in 2015 the
most significant growth referred to middle east (+16.5%) and europe (+9.7%), while africa was down (-16.6%) along with central
and latin america (-1.6%).

2016 charter
of sustainability
commitments
in september 2015 the un general assembly approved the 17 sustai-
nable development goals (sdgs), whose implementation requires that
governments, industries, enterprises and financial institutes orient
their plans towards these goals.

in drafting its charter of commitments for the next years, the group
decided to connect its actions with the sdgs closer to its core busi-
ness.

 • in 1997 autostrade and anas stipulated a new convention
     extending the motorway concession from 2018 to 2038 and
     the parties undertook - with no surcharge on tariffs - to carry
     out improvements on the a1 motorway section between
     florence and bologna, including a more modern and efficient
     section called variante di valico.                                      sparvo tunnel

• 3,005 km of operated network
• 20 arteries compose the motorway network, including the two main north-south motorways in italy, the a1 and a14
• the network extends over 15 regions and 60 provinces and connects the main industrial and metropolitan areas, where 75% of the
  population and gdp produced are concentrated.

the autostrade per l’italia group has a capex plan (see following table) to improve the network capacity on the main national motor-
ways in order to ensure better road safety and higher service levels.

 in 2015 autostrade per l’italia extended the safety walks to con-
 tractors in order to raise the awareness of their workers on safe
 behaviours and the importance of prevention. over 25 enter-
 prises participated in the meetings based on the bb-s (behav-
 iour-based safety) approach, leveraging on safety performance
 not as an imposed obligation but as an individual value.

 in the same year, autostrade per l’italia confirmed its participa-
 tion in the team work involving inail, consel and network enter-
 prises, whose activity resulted in the approval and publication
 of the “guidelines for the implementation of health and safety
 management systems in the sgsl - ar network companies -
 edition 2015” in september.

 in 2015, the group also participated in the projects organized
 by the network companies at the national level, with the con-
 tribution of ferrovie dello stato, rfi, anas, enel, eni, poste
 italiane, vodafone, telecom italia, snam, terna, assicurazioni
 generali, ericsson, ansaldo and many others, whose aim was
 to exchange experiences in the field of health and safety and
 develop shared initiatives.

 in 2015, aeroporti di roma implemented various initiatives to
 support improvement in health and safety in the workplace, in-
 cluding: the reorganization of the prevention and protection ser-
 vice, updating of the risk analysis documentation, instructions
 for working under safe conditions and the airport emergency
 plan. the last was followed by a targeted training activity and
 the integration of the alarm communication systems.
 during the same year emergency simulations multiplied.

 in 2015, pavimental experimented the implementation of the
 safety qualification procedure on the operating unit of barberi-
 no infrastrutture for the purpose of developing a monitoring and
 classification system for external contractors and their workers,
 based on a series of parameters associated with health and
 safety in the workplace.

 the los lagos company has adopted a risk prevention plan
 called “pec programa de empresa competitiva” that requires
 a series of actions to be implemented in order to achieve an
 improvement in risk management.
 in order to obtain the certification, it is necessary to reach an
 efficiency rate higher than 85% in the audit. in 2015, los lagos
 scored 100% compliance.

 the total delay (td) index is a summary index representing the level of service and trafﬁc ﬂow on the network. since its adoption in
 2006 total delay has decreased by 54%, as a result of both the investments made and greater management efficiency.

 in 2015, total delay (4.50 million hours lost in queue) increased by approximately 11% over 2014, mainly as a result of increased
 traffic and hours lost due to accidents.

    of the supervisory body of the italian ministry of infrastructures and transport and the ministry of economy and finance.

  • includes a fee allocated to autostrade per l’italia and a supplementary fee for anas plus 22% vat.

  • the anas supplementary fee amounts to 6 thousandths euro/km for vehicle categories a and b and 18 thousandths euro/
      km for categories 3,4 and 5 (italian law 102/2009 and 122/2010).

  • due to rounding to 10 eurocents (italian interministerial decree no. 10440/28/133 of 12.11.2001), the fi-
     nal toll increase between the entry and exit gate may be higher, lower or nil against the unit tariff annual increase.
     in fact, there may be cases where the toll due on specific motorway sections does not change for a few years in a row and
     whose annual tariff increases are recovered all together, in a subsequent year.

 the annual tariff adjustment is based on two different components, one is linked to the real inflation rate (on the order of 70%) mea-
 sured by istat (nic index), taking into account the 12 preceding months (1 july-30 june) and a component covering investments
 as a function of the actual progress of investments.

(1)	raccordo autostradale valle d’aosta (rav) and tangenziale di napoli (tan) applied a toll formula that takes into account the target inﬂation rate, a
     rebalancing component and a return on investment, in addition to quality. based on the memorandum of understanding stipulated with the landlord
     and pending the approval of the updated revision of the financial plan, rav determined the application of a tariff increase provisionally authorized
     equal to 1.5%, subject to the fact that the lower tariff increase against the expected amount will be included and authorized upon the approval of
     the financial plan. the memorandum of understanding envisages rebalancing measures, including also the possibility of assigning up to 50% of the
     extra amounts collected by the rav company, deriving from the higher tariff increases already adopted in compliance with the combined declara-
     tion of 3 december 2012 of the competent italian and french ministries. based on the memorandum of understanding stipulated with the landlord
     and pending the approval of the updated revision of the financial plan, tan determined the application of an authorized provisional tariff increase
     equal to 1.5%, in the expectation that the lower tariff increase will be included and authorized upon the approval of the financial plan.
(2)	autostrade meridionali was not authorized to apply any toll increase following expiry of its concession on 31 december 2012. the company has
     filed an appeal against the denial of authorization for a tariff increase for 2014 and 2015.
(3)	traforo del monte bianco, based on bilateral agreements between italy and france, applied a total increase of 2.59% from 1 january 2015, in-
     cluding a 0.19% component for inﬂation (average between italy and france) and a 2.40% component for the aforementioned tariff increases in
     compliance with the combined declaration of 3 december 2012 of the competent italian and french ministries, in accordance with the resolutions
     approved by the relevant intergovernmental committee.

in 2015, the group produced approximately 557 thousand tons           approximately 89% of the total registered amount and reflect
of waste against 284 thousand in 2014. the variation is due to        extremely variable quantities as they are mainly associated with
increased works on the motorways and in the airports managed,         works for the improvement of the infrastructures and construction
which generated mixed waste deriving from demolitions and con-        of new ones. waste is almost entirely sent to recycling and recov-
struction, soil, rocks and bitumen compounds. these represent         ery plants.

 waste disposal is essentially managed by municipal waste
 collection service companies and specialized and authorized
 companies that also carry out waste recycling activities.
 in 2015, 9 instances of spills of hazardous materials were reg-
 istered, mainly as a result of car accidents on the motorway (in
 particular, fuels, oils and ﬁre extinguishing substances) for a
 total volume of approximately 38 tons and a cost for reclama-
 tion services of nearly euro 44 thousand. the management of
 these events is governed by specific internal procedures that
 deal with all the main emergencies as well as environmental
 risk management.

 as to energy generated from renewable sources, in 2015 the
 160 photovoltaic plants installed by the group, operational along
 the autostrade per l’italia motorway network, produced 11,400
 mwh of electricity (of which 40% used on site) with approximately
 3,694 tons of co2 saved. these investments deliver a euro 960
 thousand saving per year for the entire life cycle of the plants, in
 addition to the government thermal solar energy grant.

 as for airports, at the terminal 1 of the fiumicino airport a “smart
 grid” aisle was installed, i.e. a 15 kw photovoltaic energy and 20
 kw thermal energy accumulation plant, a thermal solar plant for
 the generation of 7 kwt thermal energy and two 3 kwe micro-wind
 plants, all connected to a smart energy accumulation and man-
 agement system (the plant will become operational in 2016).

aeroporti di roma: cascade project
cascade is a project funded by the european union and coordinated by the fraunhofer german research center, focusing on ener-
gy saving at airports by using the innovative “fdd” (fault detection and diagnosis) technology, applied particularly to thermal-con-
ditioning systems. adr participated in the project as part of a consortium formed with other european companies. the initiative is
producing interesting results in terms of prevention of faults, improved efficiency of the systems and energy savings. in consideration
of the results achieved, the system was extend to terminal 1, where it was tested, and to the other terminals. the system will also
be installed in the front building and at pier c.
