            dear stakeholders,

            i would like to thank you for your support and patronage to lg household and health care. all the executives
            and employees of lg h&h are continuously carrying out various efforts to help customers discover their
            beauty and realize their dreams.

            in 2015, despite the slow growth of the world economy and sluggish domestic market demand due to the
            outbreak of mers, we achieved remarkable performance in the areas on which we strategically focused based
            on our experience, determination, and ability to put our ideas into practice.

            also to fulfill our corporate social responsibility (csr), we ran the csr committee regularly to discuss major
            sustainability issues, gathered advices from csr expert panels, and reflected their opinions into our business activities.


            based on these efforts, we have been listed on the dow jones sustainability index for six consecutive years
            and selected as the leader of the carbon disclosure project for two year in a row. moreover, we achieved the
            first class rating in the win-win growth index and won the korea sustainability company awards.

●   appendix




considering the expected slowdown in the global market affected by the decreasing economic growth rate in
china and the prolonged economic downturn in europe, we will further strive to lead the market and pursue
sustainable growth in three aspects as follows.

focusing on key business areas and developing new growth engines
in order to improve our business expertise and product premiumization, we will think outside the old
boundary upon the reorganizing of business system, and focus on key business areas where we can create
differentiated customer value. we will then continue to foster overseas business through our luxury brands,
whoo and su:m that are competitive in china and also enter global personal care market.

maintaining the trust of customers
lg h&h will become socially responsible and trusted company by expanding its activities in transparent
and sustainability management. with the chungbuk creative economy support foundation, we plan to
aid startups realize their innovative capacity into products, pursue win-win growth with our suppliers, and
further comply with fair trade throughout the company. also, we will operate the business-related educational
program, the borrowed earth school which habituates students to environmentally friendly lifestyle, to
invigorate the free semester program in middles schools, thereby extending our impact in local community.

strengthening sustainable management through communication with stakeholders
we believe that support and attention from our customers, suppliers, employees, and investors are the main
driving force behind lg h&h. in return, we will tighten relationship with customers by creating safe products,
promote win-win growth with suppliers, support career development of employees, and build advanced
labor-management culture. our biannual expert panel discussions about csr issues will be held quarterly.
we will also converge communication channels with suppliers into the ceo academy, thus promoting
sustainability management to secondary and tertiary suppliers.


lg h&h's 2015 csr report, the 7th report to be published, shares performance and activities of its sustainability
management. as a global leader of sustainability management, lg h&h promises to not only comply with the ten
principles of the un global compact, but also commit to fulfilling csr for the better future.

thank you.

            2015 business status
            despite tough business conditions at home and abroad due to the unstable exchange rate and oil price, eco-
            nomic slowdown in china, low growth rate of the domestic economy, and the outbreak of mers, lg h&h
            achieved satisfactory results across all businesses in 2015. this can be attributed to the high growth in the
            high-end cosmetic brands in korea and the greater china region, the strengthened reputation of our household
            goods, and the increase in the sales of beverages in the domestic market.

            beauty
            ▪ although there was an excessive discount competition between low-price brands at home, our high-end cos-
            metic brands, particularly the history of whoo (hereinafter whoo), achieved remarkable growth based on the
            significant rise in the sales at duty-free shops with a growing number of tourists from the greater china region.
            we expanded our share in the domestic prestige cosmetics market, including door-to-door selling and depart-
            ment stores, and reinforced marketing activities targeting consumers from the greater china region.
            in the greater china region and southeast asian countries, our company enhanced whoo and the face shop’s rep-
            utations as high-end and global brands. we expanded opportunities to communicate with consumers through online
            malls, social media, and other channels, and increased the number of stores to attract new customers. in hong kong,
            whoo sales doubled from the last year, thanks to the increase in the number of shops. in the u.s., belif joined sephora,
            a global beauty retailer, and its aqua bomb cream was ranked second in the moisture product category in the first year.
            in canada, we continued marketing activities for the face shop to build up our business foundation in north america.

            healthy
            ▪ in the domestic household goods market, lg h&h released leading, new concept products and improved
            convenience products for consumers through new distribution channels, including online malls, duty-free
            shops and h&b (health and beauty) stores. we were also ranked first in the hair product market with the growth
            of our natural hair care brand, organist, and medicinal herbal cosmetic brand, reen yungo.
            in the greater china region, the sales of shampoo and body care products, such as reen yungo and elastine perfume,
            significantly increased, as well as sales of toothpaste and toothbrushes. in japan, we expanded strategic channels
            in the private brand (pb) market by releasing quality liquid detergents at reasonable prices. in russia, ukraine, and
            kazakhstan, since business conditions were deteriorated due to their unstable economy, we maintained the prices
            of our products while strategically increasing the actual sales at stores. in iran, we boosted the sales of household
            goods including toothpaste and shampoo, cooperating with a partner that has distribution channels in pharmacies.

            refreshing
            ▪ despite the slow growth in the domestic beverage market, we recorded positive performance thanks to the
            invigorated carbonated water market and the increased sales of coca-cola products. we are now planning to
            invest in the production and logistics sectors to secure cost competitiveness.
            although the export volume decreased because of the aggravated economic situation in iran, brazil, and russia,
            sales rose by 6% from the previous year. we accomplished this by retaining the growth trend with the enhanced
            distribution structure and expanding our business areas in china.

2016 business plans
in 2016, lg h&h will concentrate on businesses that can create differentiated values for customers by reinforc-
ing its business expertise and releasing premium products. based on the success of whoo in the greater china
region, we will boost our overseas businesses, focusing on high-end brands and premium personal care busi-
nesses with huge potential.

beauty
▪ in the domestic market, we anticipate a steady rise in the sales of cosmetics at duty-free shops because of
the increasing number of tourists from the greater china region and expanded online channels. we will develop
more high-end cosmetic brands in addition to whoo, and strengthen our capacity in online channels. we also
plan to enhance the competitiveness of high-end brands, such as whoo, su:m37゚  , o hui, and belif, and premium
brands, such as isaknox and sooryehan, and continue to further improve their quality.
in the greater china region markets, our company is planning to accelerate the growth of high-end brands with
a focus on whoo, and improve the image and reputation of su:m37゚     , and the saga of xiu as high-end brands,
which are popular in domestic duty-free shops. we will also step into the middle east markets, where the cos-
metic market has shown steady growth, to increase the number of our stores in key regions. in the u.s., we
will raise brand awareness of the face shop, and utilize sephora chains to accelerate the growth of belif and
expand our business to other countries.

healthy
▪ lg h&h will release new products to maintain its top position in the domestic household goods market. we
will also increase profitability by improving the premium images of our major products; for instance, we plan to
improve the competitiveness of organist in the personal care market. our company will also develop new healthy
functional food products and invest more in marketing to secure momentum for future business growth.
in overseas markets, we will strengthen our global brand portfolio by expanding our personal care brand to
other countries, especially in china. in japan, we will build the competitiveness of our fabric softener brand,
saffron, and release new products such as bamboo salt toothpaste and saffron flower vinegar to provide
diversified options to consumers. in russia, kazakhstan, and ukraine, our focus will be on household goods
such as toothpaste and shampoo along with detergents—which is our major item in that market so far. further-
more, we will attain price competitiveness of toothpaste products that have been sold in the western coastal
regions in africa and expand our business to inland areas with high potential in the continent.

refreshing
▪ in the beverage market, our company will expand and strengthen our carbonated beverage products, and
we will develop a range of new products to secure growth engines for the future. we will also build internal
capacity and develop new products to secure competitiveness in the growing healthy beverage market.

            governance
            lg h&h operates the board of directors (bod) to make decisions on management issues, the audit committee for the inde-
            pendent audit process, and the outside directors nomination committee for the fair appointment of outside directors.

            bod operation
            the bod is the top decision-making body which monitors key management issues. the board consists of four out-
            side directors, two inside directors, and one non-executive director, for its transparency and independence. for the
            board meeting, the outside directors are provided with data relevant to the agenda. they offer professional opinions
            on each area of their expertise, and also provide fair evaluation and review of the company's annual performance.
            the regular meeting of the board is held according to the annual plan, and additional meetings are held if any urgent
            agenda needs to be decided. in order to avoid any conflict of interests, an director with interest in accordance with
            the commercial act and the bod regulations, any director who has interest with certain agenda loses his/her rights

panel discussion
lg h&h holds panel discussions every year to seek advice from external stakeholders and csr experts in each
field. from 2016, we will expand the number of meetings from two to four times a year to select more specific
agendas, ask for opinions, and apply the outcomes to the company-wide management process. in the first
quarterly meeting held in march 2016, participants discussed the reestablishment of the standard of sustain-
able products to supplement the existing criteria. the company will improve its sustainable standard for prod-
ucts based on suggestions from the experts in the panel meeting.

            materiality test
            lg h&h annually conducts the materiality test to analyze the significance of its products and activities and the correla-
            tion with diverse sustainable management issues. we report the result by focusing on the issues with high priority.

            materiality test process
            lg h&h carried out the materiality test based on the methodology of the five-part materiality test of accountabil-
            ity, a leading global organization in the sustainable management area. first, we organized the issue pool by utiliz-
            ing various data: sustainability-related global standards, indexes and media research findings such as the gri g4
            guidelines, iso 26000 and djsi, business cases of other companies in the same industry, and lg h&h’s issues from
            the previous year. we then conducted an online survey of internal and external stakeholders, as well as interviews
            with internal directors, to collect a wide range of opinions.
            in the survey of executives and employees, we divided the respondents into the household goods and cosmetics
            division and beverage division to effectively reflect detailed opinions related to the characteristics of each busi-
            ness. in addition, we differentiated the questions for each group of stakeholders in the internal and external sur-
            veys to help the external respondents easily understand and respond to the questions, thereby obtaining more
            objective responses. as a result, we could measure the internal and external factors regarding the sustainable man-
            agement of the company based on the collected data, and then draw key issues. finally, we examined the effective-
            ness of the issues derived from the interviews with the csr committee and the relevant department consisting of
            directors and staff in charge to select the key issues.
            the selected issues are divided into two categories: the focus issues for effectively explaining our management
            methods and relevant business cases, and the fundamental issues, which are continuously managed by the com-
            pany every year to maintain connectivity with the previous year’s report.

        standards of materiality test
        we analyzed internal and external factors to distinguish key issues related to our sustainability. we then mea-
        sured the relevance with the mid- and long-term strategies, the characteristics of the company, and jeong-do
        management based on the results of the surveys of employees and suppliers, benchmarking of other enterprises
        in the same industry, and the interviews with decision-making directors. we also utilized surveys of customers

            lg h&h operates an integrated company-wide risk management system to prevent manage
            potential risks that could affect the company’s business. we classify potential risks into four
            types: strategic, financial, operational and hazardous risks. according to this classification, the
            relevant departments or the company-wide risk management department will take complete
            charge and minimize damage through monitoring and countermeasures on a frequent basis.

            social contribution


            csr background
            companies all over the world are now expected to not only increase sales and proﬁts, but also fulﬁll their social
            responsibility and strengthen the corporate citizenship. we need to pursue mutual growth with society by carrying
            out social contribution activities in connection with the characteristics of our business.


            our commitment
            we determine and plan lg h&h’s social contribution activities based on the selection and concentration strategy
            and eﬀectiveness analysis so that we can oﬀer more than one-time ﬁnancial support. we maximize the eﬀective-
            ness of our support based on partnerships with government institutions and specialized organizations. we classify
            social contribution activities into four types—health, education, welfare and sharing—and run appropriate pro-
            grams for each category.

            win-win growth


            csr background
            in terms of the relationship with suppliers, there is an increasing demand for more specific areas including welfare,
            support and evaluation, requiring us to go beyond a simple relationship pursuing economic outcomes within the
            company’s value chain. any unethical activities and negative issues linked to the suppliers could also directly affect
            all related companies.


            our commitment
            lg h&h is providing support to the suppliers in multiple aspects such as education, technology, finance, and welfare,
            in order to resolve complaints and strengthen their competitiveness. in 2016, we will carry out surveys of our suppli-
            ers to identify the areas where they need support, and provide more practical help accordingly.

            independent assurance report




            lrqa assurance statement
            relating to lg household & health care ltd.’s csr report for the calendar year 2015

            this assurance statement has been prepared for lg household & health care ltd. in accordance with our contract but is intended
            for the readers of this report.

            terms of engagement
            lloyd’s register quality assurance ltd. (lrqa) was commissioned by lg household & health care ltd. (lg h&h) to provide indepen-
            dent assurance on its ‘2015 lg h&h csr report’ (“the report”) against the assurance criteria below to a moderate level of assurance
            using accountability’s aa1000as (2008), where the scope was a type 2 engagement.

            our assurance engagement covered the operations and activities of lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries (coca-cola beverage
                                               	  
            co., haitai beverage co. and thefaceshop) in korea and specifically the following requirements:
            ˙evaluating adherence to aa1000 accountability principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness
            ˙confirming that the report is in accordance with gri g4’s sustainability reporting guidelines (core option) and gri’s sector dis-
              closure for food processing
            ˙evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:
              - environmental: energy (en3, en5, en6), water (en8, en10), emissions (en15, en18, en19), effluents and waste (en22, en23,
                 en24), supplier environmental assessment (en32, en33)
               -
             ocial: employment (la1, la2, la3), labor/management relations (la4, fp3), training and education (la9, la10, la11), diversity
            s
            and equal opportunity (la12), supplier assessment for labor practices (la14), supplier human rights assessment (hr10), local com-
            munities (so1, so2), supplier assessment for impacts on society (so9, so10), customer health and safety (pr1, pr2, fp5)
               -data and information listed on page 70 of this report

            our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of suppliers, contractors and any third-parties mentioned in the
            report associated with lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries.

            lrqa’s responsibility is only to lg h&h. lrqa disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote.
            lg h&h’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the report and
            for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the report is derived. ultimately, the report has been
            approved by, and remains the responsibility of lg h&h.

            lrqa’s opinion
            based on lrqa’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that lg h&h has not:
            ˙met the requirements above
            ˙disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as all errors or omissions identified during the assurance engagement
              were corrected
            ˙covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this report.
            the opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a moderate level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the ver-
            ifier.
            note: the extent of evidence-gathering for a moderate assurance engagement is less than for a high assurance engagement. moderate assurance engagements
            focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.


            lrqa’s approach

further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:
                                    	  
˙stakeholder inclusivity: we are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from stakeholder engagement
  process of lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries. lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries have panel meetings annually for
  hearing csr experts’ opinions on their csr activities and the report.
˙materiality: we are not aware of any material issues concerning sustainability performance of lg h&h and its three major subsid-
  iaries that have been excluded from the report. it should be noted that lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries have established
  extensive criteria for determining material issues/aspects and that these criteria are not biased to management of lg h&h and
  its three major subsidiaries.
˙responsiveness: lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries have developed their sustainability management strategies and objec-
  tives for 2018 and report their progress in the report. the report also explains how lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries are
  managing the issues important to stakeholders.
˙reliability:lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries have developed their internal reporting guidelines using gri g4. however,
  lg h&h and its three major subsidiaries should increase the detail and clarification within this guidance in terms of explaining
  how to report the indicators. also to ensure that the data is free from errors, the data quality assurance procedures should be
  improved.
