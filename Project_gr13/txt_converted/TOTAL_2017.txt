    (a) adjusted results are defined as income using replacement cost, adjusted for special items, excluding the impact of changes for fair value.

    upstream adjusted net operating income was $3,633 million for the full-year 2016, compared to $4,774 million in 2015, a decrease of 24%,
    mainly due the impact of lower hydrocarbon prices which was partially offset by the increase in production combined with the decrease in
    operating costs as well as the lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate for the upstream was 26.6% in 2016 compared to 45.5% in 2015.

    technical costs (3) for consolidated affiliates, calculated in accordance with asc 932 (4), were reduced to 20.4 $/boe in 2016 compared to
    23.0 $/boe in 2015. this decrease was essentially due to the reduction in operating costs from 7.4 $/boe in 2015 to 5.9 $/boe in 2016.

         the chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer, if the two roles are carried out separately; and, where applicable, any deputy chief executive officers or chief
         operating officers, depending on the organizational structure adopted by the board of directors.

1. social information
the quantitative information set out below regarding the group’s employees worldwide covers all the entities that are fully consolidated (1) in
the group’s financial statements. however, some of the data comes from the group’s worldwide human resources survey (whrs), which
gathers approximately 100 indicators measuring important aspects of total’s human resources policy. the whrs is performed on a sample
of employees from representative consolidated companies at the business segment and regional levels; when whrs is mentioned in this
document, reference is made to data related to this sample, which represents 87.5% of the group’s employees at 135 subsidiaries in 2016,
a slight decrease compared to 2015 (91%) and 2014 (91%), due to the variation in the number of employees in the consolidated companies,
principally due to the acquisitions of saft groupe and lampiris.

in line with its code of conduct, total has adopted a safety health environment quality charter on which the group relies for the conduct
of its operations (available on total.com). this charter represents the common framework of the group’s management systems. group
directives define the minimum requirements expected in the areas of safety, security, health, the environment, quality and societal, and are
implemented in the business segments, which subsequently factor in the specific characteristics of their operations. recommendations,
guides and manuals, which are the primary documents used for implementing and managing the group’s policies, are regularly distributed
within the different business segments. the hse division supports the group business segments and oversees the implementation of the
policies that reflect the hse principles of this charter concretely and effectively.

principles reporting framework – becoming the first oil & gas
company to do so. this information document presents total’s
approach to integrate respect for human rights into its operations
and business relations. it focuses on the three key topics for the
group and presents the most important subjects for each topic:

– human rights in the workplace, concerning total’s employees
  but also those of its suppliers, contractors, partners, and those
  of their subcontractors. the subjects identified are forced labor
  and child labor, discrimination, fair and just working conditions
  and safety;
– human rights and local communities, concerning the impact of
  its activities on the communities in countries where total is
  present and including issues of access to land and the right to
  health and an adequate standard of living; and
– human rights and security, concerning measures to protect
  against the risks and threats to which the group’s employees
  and facilities are exposed, while ensuring that the risk of
  disproportionate use of force is avoided.

5. independent verifier’s report
independent verifier’s report on consolidated social, environmental and societal information presented in the management report
this is a free translation into english of the original report issued in the french language and it is provided solely for the convenience of english speaking
users. this report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, french law and professional standards applicable in france.
to the shareholders,
in our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the cofrac (1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the
statutory auditors of the company total s.a., we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established
for the year ended on the december 31st 2016, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the “csr information,” pursuant
to the provisions of the article l.225-102-1 of the french commercial code (code de commerce), integrated in the registration document 2016.

responsibility of the company
it is the responsibility of the board of directors to establish a management report including csr information referred to in the article r. 225-105-1
of the french commercial code (code de commerce), in accordance with the human resources reporting protocols and environment,
health and safety protocols used by the company (hereafter referred to as the “criteria”), and of which a summary is provided in point 4.1
of chapter 7 of the registration document and available on request at the company’s headquarters.

independence and quality control
our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the code of ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the article l. 822-11
of the french commercial code (code de commerce). in addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations.

responsibility of the independent verifier
it is our role, based on our work:
– to attest whether the required csr information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate
  explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of article r. 225-105 of the french commercial code (code de
  commerce) (attestation of presence of csr information);
– to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the csr information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, according to the
  criteria (limited assurance on csr information);
our verification work mobilized the skills of seven people between september 2016 and the date of signature of this report, for an estimated
duration of thirty weeks.
we conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france and the order of 13 may 2013
determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of fairness and
the reasonable assurance report, in accordance with the international standard isae 3000 (2).



5.1. attestation of presence of csr information

nature and scope of work
we obtained an understanding of the company’s csr issues, based on interviews with the management of relevant departments, a presentation
of the company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the activities of the
company and its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes.
we have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the article r. 225-105-1 of the french
commercial code (code de commerce).
in the absence of certain consolidated information, we have verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in
article r. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the french commercial code (code de commerce).
we verified that the information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the
article l.233-1 of the french commercial code (code de commerce) and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the
article l.233-3 of the same code with the limitations specified in the methodological note presented in point 4 of chapter 7 of the registration
document and notably the worldwide human resources survey which covers 87.5% of the employees.

conclusion
based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above, we confirm the presence in the management report of the required csr
information.

      5.2. limited assurance on csr information

      nature and scope of the work
      we undertook interviews with about ten people responsible for the preparation of the csr information in the sustainable development and
      environment division, industrial safety division and human resources division, in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable,
      the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:
      – assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability,
        taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;
      – verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
        csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information.
      we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information, in relation
      to the characteristics of the company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry
      best practices.
      for the csr information which we considered the most important (1):
      – at the level of the consolidated entity and the three segments, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate
        the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and
        verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the
        other information presented in the management report;
      – at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected (2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators,
        their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests
        on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. the sample selected
        therefore represented on average 6% of the total workforce and between 7% and 21% of the environmental information, that were considered
        as representative characteristics of the environmental and social domains.
      for the other consolidated csr information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company.
      finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information.
      we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to
      express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. due to the
      necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk
      of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated.

      conclusion
      based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information, taken together,
      has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the criteria.

10    consolidated financial statements
      statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements




      1. statutory auditors’ report
         on the consolidated financial statements
      this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements issued in french and it is provided
      solely for the convenience of english-speaking users. the statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by french law in
      such reports, whether modified or not. this information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and
      includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. these
      assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to
      provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. this report also includes information relating to the
      specific verification of information given in the management report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders. this report should be
      read in conjunction with and construed in accordance with french law and professional auditing standards applicable in france.
      to the shareholders,
      in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your general annual meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
      december 31, 2016, on:
      – the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of total s.a.;
      – the justification of our assessments;
      – the specific verification required by law.
      these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these
      consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

      i. opinion on the consolidated financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and perform
      the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
      involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and
      disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and
      the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. we believe
      that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
      in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the
      group as at december 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with international financial
      reporting standards as adopted by the european union.

      ii. justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of
      our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:
      as stated in the introduction to the consolidated financial statements, in paragraph “major judgments and accounting estimates”, some
      accounting principles applied by total s.a. involve a significant amount of estimates, judgments and assumptions. management reviews
      these estimates, judgments and assumptions on a regular basis, if circumstances change or as a result of new information or changes in
      your group’s experience. different estimates, assumptions and judgments could have significant impacts on the consolidated financial
      statements and their notes and consequently the final achievements could also be different from the amounts included in the consolidated
      financial statements. these estimates, assumptions and judgments relate principally to the application of the successful efforts method for
      the oil and gas activities, the valuation of long-lived assets, the provisions for asset retirement obligations, the employee benefits and the
      current and differed tax computation. detailed information relating to the application of these accounting principles is given in the notes to
      the consolidated financial statements.
      in order to assess the reasonableness of management’s estimates, we performed audit procedures, using sampling techniques, that entailed
      the review of the assumptions and calculations on which these estimates are based, the comparison of prior years’ actual results to their
      related estimates and the review of management’s process for approving these estimates. additionally, the introductory note to the financial
      statements was reviewed to ensure that appropriate information regarding the estimates used by management had been disclosed.
      in addition, regarding the impairment of long-lived assets described in note 3.d to the consolidated financial statements, we reviewed the
      manner in which impairment tests were performed and the key assumptions that led to the determination of recoverable amounts. we also
      assessed the sensitivity of the valuation to possible changes in these assumptions and the management’s process for approving these estimates.
      these audit procedures support our assessment of the reasonableness of these estimates.
      these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to
      the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

      iii. specific verification
      as required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in france, the information related to the
      group, presented in the management report.
      we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

the discount rate retained is determined by reference to the high quality rates for aa-rated corporate bonds for a duration equivalent to that
of the obligations. it derives from a benchmark per monetary area of different market data at the closing date.

sensitivity to inflation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is not material in the united states.

a 0.5% increase or decrease in discount rates – all other things being equal – would have the following approximate impact on the benefit obligation:

      as a result of the policy for the management of currency exposure previously described, the group’s sensitivity to currency exposure is
      primarily influenced by the net equity of the subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro and the ruble, and to a lesser extent, the
      pound sterling, the norwegian krone.

      this sensitivity is reflected in the historical evolution of the currency translation adjustment recorded in the statement of changes in
      consolidated shareholders’ equity which, over the course of the last three years, is essentially related to the fluctuation of the euro, the ruble
      and the pound sterling and is set forth in the table below:

1.8. standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
(excluding transportation)

the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows               – future income taxes are computed by applying the year-end
relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities was developed as           statutory tax rate to future net cash flows after consideration of
follows:                                                                     permanent differences and future income tax credits; and

– estimates of proved reserves and the corresponding production            – future net cash flows are discounted at a standard discount rate
  profiles are based on existing technical and economic conditions;          of 10 percent.

– the estimated future cash flows are determined based on prices           these principles applied are those required by asc 932 and do not
  used in estimating the group’s proved oil and gas reserves;              reflect the expectations of real revenues from these reserves, nor

(a) the reported volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table due to gas consumed in operations.
(b) the volumes used for calculation of the average sales prices are the ones sold from the group’s own production.
(c) the reported price represents an average aggregate price of prices for crude oil, condensates and ngl. the table does not include separate figures for ngl production prices because
    the production of ngl represented less than 7.5% of the group’s total liquids production in each of the years 2014, 2015 and 2016.
(d) the volumes of liquids used for this computation are shown in the proved reserves tables of this report. the reported volumes for natural gas are different from those shown in the reserves
    table due to gas consumed in operations.

payment of this benefit is subject to performance conditions. the performance conditions are deemed to be met if at least two of the
following three criteria are met:
      - average return on equity (roe) in the three years preceding the year of retirement is at least 10%;
      - average debt-to-equity ratios for the three years preceding the year of retirement is less than or equal to 30%;
      - total group’s oil and gas production growth rate over the three years preceding the year of retirement is greater than or equal to
        the average growth rate of the following four oil companies: exxonmobil, royal dutch shell, bp and chevron.

- supplementary defined benefit pension plan
the chairman and chief executive officer also has a supplementary defined benefit pension plan. the plan is applicable to all corporate
officers and employees whose annual compensation is greater than eight times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security
contributions (plafond annuel de la sécurité sociale, pass), set at €308,928 for 2016, and above which there is no conventional pension plan.

to be eligible for the supplementary pension plan, set up and financed by total s.a., members must be at least 60 years of age and
have served the company for at least five years. in addition, they must still be employed by the company at the time of their retirement,
unless they retire due to disability or take early retirement at your company’s initiative after the age of 55. they must also have claimed
their basic pension from the french social security.

during its meeting on december 16, 2014, the board of directors decided to maintain the seniority vested by mr patrick pouyanné in respect
of his previous salaried positions with the group since january 1, 1997.

average gross annual compensation (fixed and variable) over the retiree’s last three years of employment is taken into account to calculate
the supplementary benefits.

the supplementary benefit plan provides beneficiaries with a pension equal to the sum of 1.8% of the portion of the reference compensation
between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security contributions, and 1% of the reference compensation
between 40 and 60 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security contributions, which is multiplied by the number of years
of employment (up to 20 years). the assessment basis for this supplementary plan is indexed to changes in the french association for
supplementary pensions schemes (arrco) index.

aggregate supplementary and other pension plan benefits (other than those funded personally on a voluntary basis) may not exceed 45%
of average gross compensation (fixed and variable) for the last three years of employment. in the event that this percentage is exceeded,
the supplementary pension is reduced accordingly.

at the date of his appointment as chairman and chief executive officer, mr patrick pouyanné had served the company for 18 years and
352 days. pursuant to the new provisions of article l. 225-42-1 of the french commercial code, the performance conditions to be defined
by the board of directors may only be taken into account to calculate the chairman and chief executive officer’s additional pension rights
for one year and 13 days as the current scheme limits the reference period to 20 years.

the conditional rights awarded for the period from january 1, 1997 to december 18, 2015 inclusive correspond to a replacement rate
of 34.14% of the portion of compensation that is between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social security
contributions, and 18.96% of the portion of compensation that is between 40 and 60 times the annual ceiling for calculating french social
security contributions. these conditional rights are not subject to performance conditions.

the conditional rights awarded to the chairman and chief executive officer for the period from december 19, 2015 to december 31, 2016
correspond to a maximum replacement rate of 1.86% of the portion of compensation that is between eight and 40 times the annual ceiling
for calculating french social security contributions, and 1.04% of the portion of compensation that is between 40 and 60 times the annual
ceiling for calculating french social security contributions. these additional rights are awarded subject to fulfilment by the chairman and
chief executive officer of a performance condition, determined on the basis of the company’s financial position.

the performance condition is deemed to be fulfilled if the variable portion of the chairman and chief executive officer’s compensation
paid in 2017 for financial year 2016 is 100% of his base compensation due for financial year 2016. should the variable portion not reach
100% of his base compensation, the rights will be awarded on a pro rata basis.

during its meeting on february 8, 2017, the board of directors noted that the specified performance condition had been fulfilled and
mr patrick pouyanné had additional vested pension rights for the period from december 19, 2015 to december 31, 2016.

the board of directors also noted that mr patrick pouyanné would not be entitled to further pension rights under the plan, given the terms
for determining pension rights under the plan and the 20 years of service vested by mr patrick pouyanné at december 31, 2016.

consequently, based on his seniority in the company at december 31, 2016, the commitments made by total s.a. to the chairman
and chief executive officer in terms of supplementary defined benefits and similar pension plans represented a gross annual retirement
pension estimated at €599,320, which is 16.03% of mr patrick pouyanné’s gross annual compensation, comprising the annual fixed
portion for 2016 (€1,400,000) and the variable portion paid in 2017 for financial year 2016 (€2,339,400).

the supplementary pension includes a clause whereby up to 60% of the amount will be paid to beneficiaries in the event of death after retirement.

                 which was signed on october 17, 2002, guarantees the beneficiary a death benefit payment corresponding to two years’ compensation.
                 this is defined as annual gross base compensation in france corresponding to 12 times the gross monthly salary for the last month of
                 service prior to death, plus the highest amount of variable compensation received during one of the last five years of service in absolute
                 value terms. the amount is increased to three years in the event of accidental death. in the event of accidental permanent disability,
                 the beneficiary receives a payment proportional to the degree of disability. death benefits are increased by 15% for each dependent
                 child. payments due under this contract are made after the deduction of amounts paid under the above-mentioned plan for all employees.
               - the health care plan covering all employees.

        or non-renewal of the chief executive officer’s term of office.
        the severance benefit is only paid if termination is imposed due to a change in control or strategy decided by the company. it is not due in the
        event of gross negligence or willful misconduct or if the chairman and chief executive officer leaves the company of his own will, accepts new
        responsibilities within the group, or may claim full retirement benefits in the short term.

for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual
account balances, transactions or disclosures. this report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in
the management report and in the documents addressed to the shareholders. this report should be read in conjunction with and construed
in accordance with french law and professional auditing standards applicable in france.
to the shareholders,
in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
december 31, 2016, on:
– the audit of the accompanying financial statements of total s.a.;
– the justification of our assessments;
– the specific verifications and information required by law.
these financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audit.

i. opinion on the financial statements
we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit involves performing
procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the company as at
december 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with french accounting principles.

ii. justification of our assessments
in accordance with the requirements of article l. 823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of
our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:
we assessed the methods adopted by your company to value investment in subsidiaries and affiliates as described in note 1 to the financial
statements and performed tests using sampling techniques to verify the application of these methods. as part of our assessments and based
on the information available to date, we also verified the reasonable nature of the estimates derived from these methods.
these assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we
formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

iii. specific verifications and information
we have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in france, the specific verifications required by french law.
we have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the
management report of the board of directors and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position
and the financial statements.
concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article l. 225-102-1 of the french commercial code (code de
commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have
verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where
applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. based on this
work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.
in accordance with french law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling
interests and the identity of the shareholders or holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.
