                          since our start, at&t has been about one thing: harnessing the power of our network to change
                          lives and improve the world. and just as our network technology has gotten better over the
                          years, so has our ability to address some of society’s toughest challenges.

                            we are living in a time of extraordinary global change. amidst the ongoing digital revolution,
                            rapid urbanization and the impacts of climate change, our world is a different place than it
                            was even a year ago. that’s why we focus on one central question: “how can we harness
                            connectivity and the power of our network to create meaningful, lasting benefits in a world
                            that’s evolving so quickly?”


                            we see great opportunity              $268 and $857 million higher     to hiring 100 nanodegree

    distracted driving and are adding resources to address our concern
    about the growing reality of online hate. in 2016, we launched
    #laterhaters, a campaign aimed at empowering young people to
    stand up to online abuse, and i’m encouraged by the campaign’s
    progress so far.

    these are just a few of the ways in which at&t technology and
    the dedication of our employees is helping connect people to new
    solutions and opportunities. i hope you’ll follow along on our website
    and @connecttogood as we embrace the opportunities ahead. in
    the meantime, please enjoy this annual update and take a look at the
    strides we’ve made so far.
