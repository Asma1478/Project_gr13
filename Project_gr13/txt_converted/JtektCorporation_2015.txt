the foundation supporting csr

the 3 pillars of sincere business activities
at jtekt, we believe that the continual implementation of sin-
cere business activities is important for the promotion of csr.
one thing that is essential to sincere business activities is a                                                                h^cxzgz

statutory and social norms. the three pillars, “corporate gover-
nance”, “compliance” and “risk management”, are positioned
as important mechanisms to achieve this. all of these three have
been emphasized in recent years in all corporations however the
                                                                                                                    8dgedgviz<dkzgcvcxz                    m _ 04
important thing is whether they are actually being implemented
or not. in order to use these 3 pillars effectively, jtekt makes                                                         8dbea^vcxz                         m _ 05

such as shifting from disposable cardboard to returnable plastic
containers, revising excessive packaging, and reducing the

proper storage and control of pcb devices
the act on special measures concerning the proper treatment
of polychlorinated biphenyl waste requires the storage and noti-
fication of devices containing pcb (polychlorinated biphenyl),
widely used as an insulating oil. here at jtekt, we properly
store such devices and notify government agencies in accor-
dance with this act. in addition, by fy 2014 all high pressure
condensers with highly concentrated pbc levels currently in
storage were rendered harmless at pcb treatment facilities
of jesco (japan environmental storage & safety corporation),
excluding one condenser that could not be treated at the time
due to breakage. the damaged condenser will be disposed of af-
ter preparations have been made at the waste disposal company.
furthermore, 126 pcb ballasts from the tokushima plant were
rendered harmless in fy 2014. the 1,078 ballasts at the kariya
plant, okazaki plant, and higashi-kariya operation center are
scheduled for treatment in fy 2015.
