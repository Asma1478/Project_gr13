   key figures                                       20th anniversary




year 2011 in brief
sponda celebrated its 20 years of existence in 2011. during the anniversary year, sponda successfully reorganised its debt financing
and developed its processes in order to improve the implementation of its strategic focus areas. the property development projects
completed in 2011 as well as properties purchased strengthened the company’s property holdings in key locations of cities according
to the company’s strategy.



successful financial arrangements a sign of confidence from the capital market

in 2011, sponda signed a credit limit agreement of eur 50 million and a syndicated credit agreement of eur 375 million. in addition, it issued a
sek 650 million bond directed at scandinavian institutional investors, expanding sponda’s broad base of financiers even further.


success in significant refinancing in the challenging financial situation is a proof of sponda’s good reputation as a reliable debtor. the funds
received through the financial arrangements implemented were used partly for the rearrangement of loans maturing in 2012 and in part for the
payment of properties bought during the year.

property acquisitions supporting the strategy

sponda strengthened its property holdings in its key strategic locations, in the city centres with good public transport access, by buying the
fennia block located in helsinki’s central business district. this purchase also supports the company’s long-term goal to increase the share of
office properties and shopping centres in its property portfolio.


the structure of the property portfolio was strengthened even further by increasing the company’s holding in the shopping centre zeppelin
located in kempele. an extensive expansion of the shopping centre was carried out during the year.


sponda also increased its holdings by buying in the kauppa-häme property located in the central business district of tampere. sponda will
renovate this property completed in 1965 into functional, modern and comfortable retail and office premises.


in 2011, sponda joined the russian invest property investment company founded in cooperation with srv, ilmarinen, etera and onvest. the
company will invest in property development projects in moscow and st.petersburg. sponda will have the opportunity to acquire new properties
that meet international standards from the joint venture.



property development projects proceeding as planned

sponda’s most important ongoing property development project, the citycenter located in helsinki’s central business district reached an
important milestone in 2011 with the completion of the 4,200 square metres office building and the 10 storey light well bringing daylight into the
premises.


also the renovation project of the havis business center in helsinki’s central business district continued. this project will create modern space in
the office property complex of some 22,500 square metres.


in the logistics properties segment, the new production facilities of metso automation were completed at the beginning of the year in the
vantaan akseli business park favoured by the logistics industry and various fields of manufacturing.



international environmental certification for four properties

also environmental issues were a strong focal point of sponda’s operations in 2011. certification processes started in previous years yielded
results with the environmental certification of four properties as a proof that environmental issues have been taken into account both during the
construction and the operation of the properties. breaam® certificates were awarded to the ruoholahden tähti office building in helsinki and
the vuosaari harbour portgate office building. leed® certification was completed for the office properties located in sörnäistenkatu 2 and
citycenter, both in helsinki.


sponda also took care of its environmental responsibility in 2011 by, among other things, promoting its energy efficiency programme, improving
the processing of waste and increasing cooperation in environmental matters with its customers. in addition, seven priorities of responsibility
relevant for the company’s operations were determined as areas of special implementation and development focus in the company.




in brief
•   property portfolio structure strengthened through strategic property acquisitions

chief executive's review
in this video kari inkinen presents sponda’s year 2011.


“the purchase of fennia block strenghened our property portfolio in the helsinki cbd” -kari inkinen, president and ceo



please read the full review below.


year 2011 was very successful for sponda. we increased our revenue and our net operating income was the highest in the company's 20 year
history. despite the challenging market conditions in 2011, the occupancy rates of our properties improved.


implementation of the strategy

our strategy is to aim for profitable growth in the property market in finland and russia. in 2011, we completed many new-build and renovation
projects that support our strategy. the sites were located in helsinki, the oulu region, vantaa and tampere. the completion of the projects
increased the proportion of office and shopping centre properties in our property portfolio in line with our investment strategy. our portfolio, which
consists mainly of offices and shopping centres located in central areas, was strengthened significantly by the acquisition of the fennia block in
the spring.


financing

the tightening of economic conditions in 2011 was reflected in the financial market as decreased availability of financing. we can continue
expect this to pose challenges to many companies in 2012. due to the uncertainty in the market, we decided to refinance most of our loans
expiring in 2012. the successful execution of significant financial arrangements in challenging conditions can be considered proof of the
financing market’s trust in our company. sponda will have no significant refinancing needs before 2014.


business environment

the favourable market development of 2010 continued throughout the first half of 2011, after which economic uncertainty once again began to
increase. the change in the economy was reflected in the rental market in the latter half of the year. early in the year, rental levels in the prime
areas had risen and vacancy rates had fallen, but these levelled off in the latter half. in the outskirts of cities, rental levels remained unchanged
and very high vacancy rates were seen in some areas.


an increased offering of premises and unchanged demand will probably increase vacancy rates in the helsinki metropolitan area in 2012, with
200,000 square metres of new office premises to be built in the region during the year. in economically uncertain times, tenants and investors
traditionally focus their interest on properties in prime areas, which leads to increasing differences in the appreciation and vacancy rate of
properties located in different areas.


our second important market area, russia, has developed more favourably than the finnish market. especially in moscow, rents have risen and
vacancy rates fallen. in st. petersburg the development has been less pronounced. russia has been a good investment choice for our business
and we believe that the favourable development of the market will continue.


environmental responsibility

environmental responsibility has a significant role in sponda’s operations, because properties are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions
in finland. therefore, companies in the real estate sector play an important role in improving the efficiency of energy use and, consequently,
arresting climate change.

                                                                                                                   annual report 2011       year 2011




sponda has chosen environmental responsibility as its strategic focus, and the development of environmental responsibility processes is part of
the implementation of this strategic goal. the work particularly aims at reducing energy consumption in the properties. we strive for energy
efficiency in our property development projects and in property maintenance. in addition to the improvement of our own activities, we encourage
our customers to pay attention to energy consumption in properties with the help of our energy efficiency and environmental partnership
programmes.


in order to ensure that our properties are energy efficient and environmentally friendly, we apply for environmental certificates for all new-build
sites and the most important renovation sites. in 2011, four of our properties received the leed® or breeam® environmental certificate.


urban development

as a responsible company in the property sector, we see urban development as an important part of our social responsibility. we take part in
urban development by taking into account the environment of properties, the urban structure and the cityscape in our property development
projects. we own many protected properties. by investing in their renovation and maintenance we are also investing in the cityscape and the
appeal of the area surrounding the property.


the ongoing citycenter project in the centre of helsinki is an excellent example of our desire to participate in the development of urban centres.
when completed, the project will considerably improve the appeal of the area. the service tunnel built as part of the project enables underground
freight deliveries to the quarter, away from the bustling streets of the city centre.


future outlook

we believe that our high-quality property portfolio with the focus on prime areas will continue to be our strength. in 2012, we will particularly focus
on developing our property portfolio, maintaining occupancy rates and rents at a healthy level and looking after our equity ratio.


in order to achieve the goals we have set and to respond to market challenges we must also improve our own operations. sponda is currently
concentrating on customer management, the enhancement of our customer service models and the development of quality and environmental
responsibility processes. the work started already in 2010 and will continue in 2012.


i would like to thank our shareholders for their trust in our company and our customers for their loyalty and partnership in the development of our
environmental services and other projects. i would also like to thank our personnel for their active participation in the development of our
processes and services in 2011.

sponda
sponda plc is a property investment company
that specialises in commercial properties in the
largest cities in finland and russia. sponda's
                                                                               3.2
                                                                               the fair value of sponda’s property portfolio
                                                                               was eur 3.2 billion at the end of 2011.
business concept is to own, lease and develop
office, retail and logistics properties into
environments that promote the business
success of its clients.

sponda is organised into four business units:
investment properties, property development,
russia and real estate funds. in finland, the company has regional offices and a national
customer service centre. sponda also has offices in st. petersburg and moscow.




business environment
after a positive start to the year, the markets suffered from uncertainty resulting from the public debt crisis in europe and the united
states. on the property markets, the uncertain economic conditions led to caution in property transactions and tenant decisions
regarding the need for new business premises. however, this cautious approach is not yet reflected in key figures other than
transaction volume of 2011.



markets characterised by uncertainty

positive economic growth in the early part of 2011 fizzled after the summer, as uncertainty began to dominate the markets. the main source of
uncertainty was the public debt crisis in europe and the united states. according to estimations finland's gdp growth in 2011 was 2.6 per cent.
one reason for the slowdown in gdp growth was the finnish export sector, which is sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in the international economy
and began to slow down in the first half of the year. consumer confidence in the economy was also on the decline.


the public debt crisis, which began to deteriorate rapidly in late summer 2011, and the weaker general economic prospects make it difficult to
formulate reliable forecasts. the finnish economy's growth prospects weakened considerably in autumn 2011. gdp growth is expected to
decline to 0.4 per cent in 2012 and recover to 1.7 per cent in 2013. there has also been a marked increase in uncertainty in finland's key export
markets.


property investment is a late-cycle business, which meant that the market for business premises continued to be positive in the late summer
despite increasing uncertainty about the economy. this was particularly reflected in the increased net take-up of office properties, growth in new
construction and a slight decrease in vacancy rates.


investors are more risk averse in uncertain times, which leads to a growing gap between low and high risk profile property investments. central
helsinki's position as the most attractive property market is expected to solidify as uncertainty increases.

the brisk growth in property transactions pointed to by springtime forecasts eventually failed to materialise. total property transaction volume in
2011 was low at approximately eur 1.7 billion.


the meagre supply of prime properties contributed to the low transaction volume. the challenging conditions on the financial markets drive
investors to focus on low-risk properties with reliable rental cash flows and better financing terms. at the same time, current owners are largely
unwilling to sell prime properties. the most demanded properties on the market are highly rated office and retail properties in central helsinki and
modern office properties with excellent transport links in the helsinki metropolitan area.


according to the rakli-kti business premises barometer, the yield requirement for prime office properties in helsinki cbd at the end of 2011
stood at 5.75 per cent. yield requirements are expected to increase slightly in 2012. the yield requirements for prime properties outside helsinki
also decreased somewhat in 2011. the yield requirement for prime office premises in helsinki's central business district declined throughout the
year but levelled off late in 2011 due to the prevailing general uncertainty. however, the yield requirement for prime retail space continued to fall
below that of office premises. the yield requirement for prime retail space in helsinki's central business district now stands at 5.25 per cent.


according to sponda's estimates, the values of office properties in the helsinki metropolitan area increased moderately in the first half of 2011,
only to slow down later in the year due to the uncertain economic situation.


in 2011, international investors accounted for over one quarter of the total property transaction volume in finland, their share remaining largely
unchanged from 2010. the relatively small proportion of the transaction volume attributable to international investors is primarily the result of the
poor availability of debt financing, the meagre supply of prime properties and the tendency of investors to focus on familiar home markets during
difficult periods.

the finnish market
the finnish market for office premises

vacancy rates for offices in helsinki metropolitan area decreased during the year 2011 despite increased uncertainty on the markets. the
vacancy rate for offices in the helsinki metropolitan area stood at 10.6 per cent and in helsinki business district at 5.6 per cent at the end of
2011. the vacancy rate is expected to rise slightly in 2012. this estimate is based on weaker economic prospects and the fact that nearly
200,000 square metres of new office space is currently being built in the helsinki metropolitan area. regional differences are also expected to
increase and a larger number of properties are likely to be left permanently off the market.


the next few years will see a significant amount of internal movement in helsinki's central business district as a new office hub develops in
töölönlahti, freeing up considerable space elsewhere in central helsinki as companies relocate. however, the effects of this wave of relocations
will not yet be seen in 2012.


the net take-up almost quadrupled from the previous year. in 2010 the net take-up was 45,000 square metres and in 2011 175,000 square
metres.


in spite of the uncertain economic conditions, central helsinki remains strong on the rental markets and rental levels have increased for the city's
most highly rated office properties. the average rent level for new leases for prime properties in central helsinki in 2011 was slightly over

eur 300 per square metre per year. rents for the city's best office premises exceeded eur 360 per square metre per year. the prime rental
levels for the helsinki metropolitan area varied from eur 180 to 354 per square metre per year.


the market for office premises in tampere, turku and oulu has traditionally been very stable. the effects of cyclical fluctuations on rental levels
and vacancy rates are not as strong as they are in the helsinki metropolitan area. at the end of 2011, the vacancy rate in tampere was 6.3 per
cent, in turku 7.4 per cent and in oulu 6.6 per cent. rents increased slightly in tampere, turku and oulu in 2011. in turku, rental levels were
eur 144–180, in tampere 156–192 and in oulu 144–168 per square metre per year.



retail property markets in finland

the occupancy rate of retail premises is stable and expected to remain high due to migration flows to the helsinki metropolitan area and the
limited supply of new retail space. new retail space was introduced in helsinki's central business district in 2011 with the opening of the
citycenter and kluuvi shopping centres.


at the end of 2011, the vacancy rate of retail premises in helsinki's city center was 1.4 per cent, in turku 2.7 per cent, in tampere 2.9 per cent
and in oulu 3.2 per cent. the average vacancy rate of retail premises in the helsinki metropolitan area in 2011 was 3.1 per cent. vacancy rates
of retail premises are expected to increase in the helsinki metropolitan area as well as elsewhere in finland.


the recent years have seen a strong increase in the rental levels for prime retail premises and rental growth continued to outpace the office
property market in 2011. the shortage of good retail properties makes them more recession proof than office properties. rental levels are
expected to fall outside helsinki metropolitan area. rental levels for retail premises in helsinki's central business district were between eur
840–1,680 per square metre per year in 2011. in turku, rental levels ranged from eur 420 to 960 per square metre per year, in tampere they
were between eur 600 and 960 and in oulu eur 480–1,020 per square metre per year.


logistics property market in the helsinki metropolitan area

the first half of 2011 saw the rental rates for logistics properties in the helsinki metropolitan area increase slightly as vacancy rates declined.
smaller logistics premises were particularly in demand. at the end of the year, the rental levels in helsinki metropolitan area were approximately
eur 106 per square metre per year. the slowdown in economic growth and, in particular, declining exports in the latter part of the year posed
challenges to the logistics properties segment. the vacancy rate of logistics premises stood at approximately 5.7 per cent at the end of 2011.

russian market
compared to finland, the russian economy is affected more by both recessions and boom periods. russian gdp growth in 2011
was approximately 4 per cent. gdp growth is expected to slow down to 3.5 per cent in 2012 and under 4 per cent in 2013. russia's growth
continues to be based on the export of oil and other raw materials, strong consumption and, in particular, the price of oil. continued growth in the
longer term will require that problems related to investments, infrastructure and the credit market are resolved and that private consumption
increases.


moscow's prime property markets continued to recover in late 2011, with record investment volumes hit for the full year. investments doubled
from the previous year, reaching approximately usd 8 billion. investments made by international investors also increased during the year.



the market for office properties in russia

market rents took a positive turn due to increased demand and the lack of newly built office premises. the increase in rents was the strongest in
a prime and class a properties. cb richard ellis forecasts that rental levels will further increase in 2012 in all business districts.


property yield requirements have clearly started to decline, especially in moscow. this has been particularly apparent in high quality office
properties. the trend of declining yield requirements is expected to also have an impact on the st. petersburg property market in the future.


the number of class a and class b office premises continues to be low relative to the size of moscow and st. petersburg. the total amount of
class a and b office space in moscow is approximately 13 million square metres. the corresponding figure for st. petersburg is 2 million square
metres. the vacancy rate of office properties in moscow was 13 per cent and it is expected to still decline in 2012. it is worth noting that
significant part of the vacancy is located outside ring road 3.

new construction volume remained low, with only approximately 600,000 square metres of new office space completed in moscow, decreased by
a third from 2010. there was relatively more construction activity in st. petersburg with approximately 200,000 square metres of new office
space added to the market in 2011. new construction is expected to remain on the current level in the next three years with estimates suggesting
that some 1.5-2 million square metres of new office space will be completed in moscow. in moscow, new construction projects will largely be
located outside ring road 3. compared to 2011 slightly more office space will be completed in st. petersburg in 2012.



the market for retail premises in russia

rent prices in the prime shopping centres in moscow and st. petersburg increased moderately in 2011. in some places, rent levels of properties
on central shopping streets have seen a brisk increase over the course of 2011. rent levels in prime areas are expected to rise by 5 to 10 per
cent in 2012.


the yield requirements for prime retail premises in moscow ranged from 9 to 9.5 per cent in late 2011. this represents a decrease of 2
percentage points from the previous year.


the vacancy rates for retail premises in late 2011 were approximately 4 per cent in moscow and 6 per cent in st. petersburg. vacancy rates are
expected to continue to decline due to newly constructed properties being in short supply. as with office properties, newly constructed retail
premises in moscow will primarily be located outside ring road 3.



the market for logistics properties in russia

the rents for prime logistics properties in moscow increased by 12 per cent in average in 2011. rental levels are expected to increase in 2012
due to the particularly meagre supply of logistics properties.


the yield requirement for prime logistics properties in 2011 was approximately 10.5 per cent for moscow and 11 per cent for st. petersburg. this
represents a year-on-year decrease in yield requirements of some 1.5 percentage points.


due to the shortage of logistics properties on the moscow market, vacancy rates at the end of 2011 stood at just 1 –2 per cent. new construction
volume in logistics premises was relatively low in 2011. the new production stock of approximately 500,000 square metres to be completed in
2012 will not significantly increase the vacancy rate, as the majority of the premises has already been pre-let.

effort to seek energy savings in cooperation with customers. with some of the customers, this cooperation has developed into an environmental
partnership that focuses especially on the environmental impact of the customers’ operations in addition to the environmental characteristics of
the property.

strategic operations in 2012
2012 is shaping up to be a year of challenges

sponda aims to adapt quickly to economic conditions. the year 2011 was a positive one for the company, but the market prospects for 2012 are
quite uncertain. the demand for business premises has stabiliced and the year 2012 is expected to be challenging for sponda's operations due
to new premises to be constructed on the market. the uncertain economic conditions call for a critical analysis of growth prospects, particularly
when it comes to property development projects.


competitive advantage through property holdings in strategic locations

sponda's property portfolio is built on high-quality business premises in key locations, which gives the company a relative competitive advantage
even during an economic slowdown. under challenging economic conditions, the occupancy rates and rental levels of properties in prime
locations develop more positively than those located in more peripheral areas. in total, 65 per cent of sponda's property portfolio is located in
helsinki's highly valued central business and ruoholahti districts. the company is confident that the high proportion of prime properties in its
property portfolio will be a profitable strategy even under uncertain market conditions.



a strong balance sheet provides operational stability

sponda has a strong balance sheet, which provides a stable foundation for the company's operations and gives it added flexibility in uncertain
markets. nevertheless, the company has cut back on planned investments for the next few years in order to ensure that it can maintain a good
financial standing. the company currently has only eur 41 million in existing commitments to property development investments for the next two
years. during times of economic uncertainty, the company aims to finance its growth primarily by selling off properties that are not fully in line with
its strategy.

the values of sponda's finnish properties are expected to remain largely stable in 2012. sponda expects the vacancy rates of its investment
properties to remain at current levels in 2012. this adjustment to the company's previous estimates is due to weaker economic conditions in
finland and internationally.

the company's properties in good condition, modernising the property portfolio and offering customers individually tailored solutions that support
their business operations and meet their needs.


sponda improved its management of property maintenance and service quality by developing the company's purchasing and quality processes
and the property maintenance services produced by the service network for sponda's customers. the development in the quality of the service
experience is also supported by sponda's customer experience management and environmental responsibility processes.


the company responds to the changing needs of its customers by developing existing business premises or by offering alternative premises or
newly constructed buildings. flexible properties offer customers versatile business premises solutions that can be adapted as their needs
change. flexibility extends the property life cycle and reduces the environmental load caused by alterations, repairs and renovations.


the majority of the properties under the investment properties unit are included in sponda's energy efficiency programme, which aims to
achieve energy savings together with clients. the programme involves monitoring the energy consumption of properties and taking steps to
reduce the consumption of electricity, heating, cooling and water by carrying out energy saving measures and issuing energy saving tips and
instructions to tenants.


in 2011, the energy efficiency programme was complemented by an environment partnership programme aiming to reduce the environmental
load resulting from the use of properties by engaging in closer cooperation with customers. in addition to energy consumption, the programme
takes into account the broader environmental impact of properties and clients' operations. the partnerships are based on a focus on clients'
individual needs and cooperation to achieve environmental goals. environmental partnerships were initiated in 2011 among others with kesko in
ruoholahti shopping centre, elisa, nordea bank finland plc, the city of espoo, evli bank plc, national board of patents and registration in
finland and the cancer society of finland.

unioninkatu 20–22 in helsinki. construction of the new talentum head office in helsinki's ruoholahti district also started in 2011. the project is

central administration for road, rail, maritime and aviation operations to the new building.

* includes segments office and retail properties and shopping centres




shopping centres
sponda owns five shopping centres in finland with a total floor area of 157,500 square metres. the largest of these is the citycenter property in
helsinki's central business district.


the total revenue of the shopping centres segment in 2011 was eur 40.4 million. the economic occupancy rate remained high, standing at
94.1 per cent at the end of the year. at the end of the year, the fair value of shopping centre properties stood at eur 586.1 million, with 187
tenant customers and 302 lease agreements. the segment's largest clients are kesko group, hok-elanto liiketoiminta oy and stockmann plc.


sponda increased its ownership in the zeppelin shopping centre in kempele in april. this was followed by an 8,700 square metre expansion of
the shopping centre, which made it the largest in northern finland. the expanded premises were opened for use in november 2011.


the most significant event in 2011 for the shopping centres segment was the completion of the second phase of expansion of the citycenter
property. construction was completed on a new office building for evli bank plc with 4,200 square metres of floor space and a 10 storey light well
that also added some 3,700 square metres of new retail space to the property. the new office building in the middle of the citycenter block was
granted leed® gold environmental certification.


work was also completed in 2011 on the citycenter block's underground maintenance facilities, which significantly improve logistics services for
retail businesses operating in the shopping centre and reduce maintenance traffic in central helsinki. the citycenter project will, for the most
part, be completed in late 2012.

technical design of the ratina shopping centre also continued in 2011. in vaasa, the company proceeded with zoning and planning in
cooperation with the city for a new shopping centre to be constructed at the site of vaasa's old bus station. the plans are based on the winning
entry in a design competition.

logistics properties
sponda is one of the major owners of logistics properties in finland and the largest provider of logistics premises in the helsinki metropolitan
area. at the end of 2011, the combined leasable area of logistics properties was 534,500 square metres.


no major property sales or purchases were made by the logistics unit in 2011. the demand for logistics premises grew in the early part of 2011
due to increased export and import activity, only to level off later in the year.


the total revenue of the logistics properties segment in 2011 was eur 42.0 million. at the end of 2011, the segment's economic occupancy rate
was 78.1 per cent, the fair value of the properties totalled 449,0 million, the number of customers stood at 328 and the number of lease
agreements was 420. the segment's largest clients are metso group, fujitsu finland oy, finnsteve oy ab and nordea bank finland plc.


the most significant event of the year for the logistics properties segment was the completion of a project to build a production facility for metso
automation oy in vantaa's hakkila district. the facility has a total floor space of 22,000 square metres and metso automation has signed a 15
year lease for the property. the company also renovated some 12,000 square metres of office space for metso in the honkatalo office building
adjacent to the newly constructed production facility.


the facilities developed for metso are located in vantaan akseli business park, which provides excellent operating conditions for logistics and
manufacturing companies. sponda has further capacity to develop the area.


vantaa holds the most promise among sponda's logistics sites. the aviapolis area, which is still under development, is expected to attract an
increasing number of tenants in the future.

property development
sponda seeks growth and profitability through responsible, customer-focused property development. these objectives are pursued in
all of the property development business unit’s projects through the development of environmentally sound business premises that
satisfy customer needs.


the property development business unit implements property development projects in finland and russia. the unit develops business premises
according to customer needs by modernising existing properties or contracting the construction of new property, suitable for the customer's
operations, on land owned by sponda. the company’s property development strategy is based on long-term ownership and leasing.


sponda's extensive land portfolio offers a wide variety of sites to choose from, with the majority located in key urban locations with good public
transport links. the company is also active within the market to identify properties with strong development potential.


the starting point for planning is always the customer's needs. sponda places a great deal of emphasis on the energy efficiency of buildings,
environmentally sound solutions and the adaptability of business premises. in planning and designing new buildings, attention is paid both to the
building itself, as well as its close surroundings and how it integrates with the surrounding urban structure.


sponda develops properties that have a long lifespan and can be adapted into pleasant and effective business premises that meet the needs of
customers operating in various sectors. adaptable and flexible properties with a long lifespan are profitable investments for sponda.



property development projects progressing according to plan

in 2011, sponda continued a number of projects, including both modernisation and newly constructed properties, in line with previously set
targets. the balance sheet value of sponda's property development portfolio stood at eur 262.0 million at the end of 2011. of this amount, land
value represented eur 90.3 million and the remaining eur 171.7 million was tied to existing property development projects.


the project to renovate the citycenter commercial property reached an important milestone with the completion of a light shaft that lets in
daylight to all floors of the shopping centre and the inauguration of 3,700 square metres of retail premises around the light shaft. the premises of
the shopping centre have been renewed on all four storeys, starting from the asematunneli underground premises. construction was completed
in summer 2011 on a new office building with 4,200 square metres of floor space. the office building, which is leased to evli bank plc, takes the
place of a former car deck in the middle of the citycenter block. also completed at the same time were the citycenter service facilities below
ground level, which are linked to helsinki's central maintenance tunnel. citycenter is a long-term project with development continuing into 2013.

work was completed in spring 2011 on a newly constructed production facility and renovated office premises for metso automation in vantaa's
hakkila district. a project to expand the zeppelin shopping centre in kempele by some 9,000 square metres was completed in november. the
project was carried out on a tight schedule and completed in less than a year.


a refurbishment project on old bank buildings dating back to 1940–1960 and located at unioninkatu 20–22 in helsinki's central business district
progressed according to plan. work has already been completed on some of the properties being renovated into modern office premises, with
some tenants moving into the first units in spring 2011. the renovation of the properties, which covers a total floor area of approximately 22,500
square metres, will be completed in early 2012.


new projects were started in helsinki and tampere. construction began in late 2011 on an office building to be let for talentum plc in the
ruoholahti district of helsinki. scheduled for completion in spring 2013, the office building will feature a high level of energy efficiency and
environmentally friendly solutions. in tampere, work began in spring 2011 on renovating the kauppa-häme office and retail property in the city's
central business district. the first completed phase of the newly renovated business premises were occupied in the autumn 2011.


on the zoning development front, sponda's most significant project was the ilmalanrinne zoning plan change in helsinki. the change of the town
plan gained legal force in the end of 2011.



first international environmental certificates

certification processes initiated by sponda over recent years bore fruit in 2011 with the company being awarded its first four environmental
certificates for four office buildings in helsinki. breeam® certification was granted for the ruoholahden tähti office building and portgate office
building at vuosaari harbour. leed® certification was granted for the office buildings at sörnäistenkatu 2 and in citycenter.


sponda will apply for environmental certification for all its newly constructed properties. the certification process is part of sponda's strategy of
offering customers business premises the design and construction of which is based on environmentally sound materials and solutions.



continued development of environmental expertise

sponda is constantly developing its environmental expertise to be able to offer customers energy efficient high-quality business premises and
respond to its customers' environmental requirements. in the property development unit, this environmental expertise is reflected in the
company's design guidelines that define the quality criteria for property development projects. environmental specifications are part of sponda's
design guidelines and the quality standards applied, which are often higher than those required by building regulations. the guidelines apply to
all of sponda's property development projects.


sponda also fosters environmental responsibility within its industry by being an active participant in property and construction industry
associations and their environmental initiatives. on the property development front, the company strives to promote sustainable development
through its membership in the green building council finland and rakli, the finnish association of building owners and construction clients.
in 2011, sponda was involved in a project to plan a low-energy commercial building. the project was coordinated by the finnish association of
civil engineers ril, which published guidelines for low-energy construction in early 2012. sponda will also continue developing its own concept
for a low-energy office building based on the ril guidelines.



aiming to launch the ratina project

the prospects for property development are largely determined by the general economic climate. at present, sponda is focused on completing
work on its current projects. for instance, the citycenter project in helsinki is scheduled to be largely completed by the end of 2012.


investments in new projects can be increased as the economic conditions improve. starting the ratina shopping centre project in tampere is
sponda's main property development objective for 2012. the value of the project is estimated at approximately eur 200 million. if the project is
started, it will constitute a significant proportion of the company's investments planned for 2012. construction will not begin until a sufficient
advance occupancy rate is reached.

sponda owns land sites worth a total of eur 90.3 million. the land sites located in helsinki, tampere and oulu, as well as the airport and marja-
vantaa regions in vantaa and the leppävaara region in espoo, for example, are sufficient to cover the company’s real estate development needs
for several years.

russia
sponda’s russia business unit leases, manages and develops business premises in russia. the company has been operating in
russia since 2006. sponda's long-term goal is to have 10–20 per cent of its balance sheet invested in russia, in properties located in
moscow and st. petersburg.


sponda has established its position in the russian market with its quality property portfolio, customer-focused working methods and strong
regional know-how. the company owns a total of nine properties in russia: four office properties, two shopping centres, a logistics property and
two land areas. both the business properties and the land areas are located in moscow and st. petersburg regions.



positive trend in occupancy rates continued

the long-term objective of the russia business unit is to achieve growth and profitability in the russian market. in 2011, the focus was
particularly on improving profitability by developing operational efficiency and ensuring the stability of cash flow. while the company concluded no
actual sales or purchase transactions during the year, it continued to seek growth opportunities by actively surveying the market to identify
potential properties for purchase.


there were no changes in the number of russian properties, their locations or floor areas in 2011. the unit’s total revenue in 2011 was
eur 25.1 million, with 286 clients and 345 leasing agreements. the total revenue increased over 6 per cent compared to the previous year.


sponda’s economic occupancy rate in russia continued to outpace the market in 2011, reaching 98.7 at the end of the year. the high occupancy
rate of sponda’s properties proves that the company is successful in offering its corporate clients business premises solutions that suit their
business operations and needs.


the fair values of sponda’s russian properties increased slightly in 2011. the fair value of the property portfolio stood at eur 224.6 million at
the end of the year (2010: 204.2). the increase in value was primarily due to a decrease in the yield requirement for the moscow region during
the first half of the year. the fair values of properties in st. petersburg remained largely unchanged from 2010.



systematic renovation of properties

on the russian property development front, there was progress in the long-term project to develop the europa terminal logistics centre in
moscow province. the building permit was granted in early 2011. construction work will begin in phases depending on demand.


the systematic condition surveys of russian properties that began in 2010 were concluded for properties in moscow in 2011. one property in st.
petersburg has not been surveyed yet, and the renovation work for its part is scheduled for 2012. the condition survey involves inspecting all
properties and preparing an improvement plan for each of them. in 2011 a total of eur 0.3 million was invested in improving the quality and
condition of the company’s properties in russia. there are no major renovation needs for any of the russian properties.



implementing environmental responsibility is challenging in russia

sponda’s role as a socially responsible partner is highlighted in russia. sponda encourages a sense of community by, among other things,
organising events for tenants and their families. sponda also co-operates with local autorities to enliven the cities by organising common events
in its shopping centres.


maintaining a high standard of environmental responsibility is challenging in russia due to the lack of recycling infrastructure and the absence of
a culture that encourages to energy conservation. despite the challenges of the operating environment, sponda promotes environmental
responsibility in its properties in partnership with its clients, by taking small steps towards more environmentally sound practices. using motion
detectors for lighting control, adopting energy-saving light bulbs and regulating building temperatures are examples of practical measures
implemented by sponda in russia to improve energy efficiency.

sponda is a member of the international green building council, which promotes environmental awareness, also in russia. in the future, the
company will also apply for environmental certification under international standards for all its newly developed properties as well as some of its
existing business premises in russia. sponda is currently in the process of applying for environmental certification for one of its russian
properties.


sponda’s energy efficiency scheme, which was launched in 2009, was expanded in 2010 to cover the company’s russian properties. in 2011,
the results of energy consumption reviews were analysed to set energy efficiency targets for each property and plan measures for achieving
them. going forward, the impacts and results of these measures will be monitored in regular client meetings.



growth and profitability remain the key objectives for 2012

the negative developments in the general economic situation are also casting a shadow over the prospects of the russia business unit, despite
the fact that the prospects in russia are significantly brighter than they are in finland. the russian economy is continuing to grow, albeit at a
more moderate rate than expected. russia’s economic growth continues to be based on the export of oil and other raw materials, the price of oil
and strong consumption. russian trends in property values and rental levels are positive.


the russia business unit’s objectives for 2012 remain the same as before: achieving growth and enhancing profitability through improving the
efficiency of operations. the stability in the moscow market, in particular, highlights the need for further growth. with this in mind, the company is
working systematically to identify potential targets for purchase.


the company also looked to improve the consistency of its business management by adapting an operating handbook, originally based on the
company’s finnish business structure, to suit the russian market. instead of simply translating the document, it was adapted to the russian
operating environment and operations. the operating handbook will be used in 2012 to promote consistent management practices and ways of
working.

real estate funds
the objective of sponda's real estate funds business unit is to grow by developing new products that appeal to investors. in 2011,
sponda fund ii nearly reached its full investment capacity and the company strengthened its role on the russian market by signing a
partnership agreement for a new real estate investment company that will engage in property development.


the real estate funds business unit serves as the active manager and part-owner of the property portfolios held by the funds managed by
sponda. through the real estate funds, sponda invests in office, retail and logistics properties located in medium-sized finnish towns, outside
the company's core geographical area.


the real estate funds managed by sponda are directed at international and finnish institutional investors, offering them an easy way to invest in
real estate. the indirect investment method frees up investors' resources, with sponda handling the management of the real estate portfolios and
offering investors the opportunity to benefit from its market intelligence.

property investments of the funds in which it has a share of ownership.



sponda fund ii almost fully invested

increased as a result of several property purchases, with the target value of eur 200 million nearly achieved in 2011. the total value of the
fund’s properties at the end of 2011 was eur 176.6 million. sponda owns approximately 44 per cent of the fund's assets.


sponda fund i invests in logistics properties outside the helsinki metropolitan area. the fund concluded a significant sale of property at the turn

tampere will be completed in spring 2012. the project involves converting kesko's former central warehouse into a retail and warehouse facility
primarily used by lvi-dahl. the total value of the fund's properties at the end of 2011 stood at eur 182.0 million. sponda owns approximately 46
per cent of the fund's assets.


first top luxco fund invests in office and retail premises. the fund launched significant development projects in 2011 in the central business
districts of medium-sized finnish towns, including two shopping centres in lappeenranta. the development projects are a good example of
sponda's active asset management. the property portfolio had a fair value of eur 93.1 million at the end of 2011. sponda's holding is 20 per
cent of the fund.


sponda also manages the niam iii east holding oy fund, which continued to sell property in 2011 in line with its strategy.



russian invest supports the company's growth strategy in russia

joining the russian invest property investment company established in partnership with srv group, ilmarinen, etera and onvest was the
second significant event in 2011. the investment company's mission supports sponda's growth strategy in russia. sponda owns 27 per cent of
russian invest.


the company aims to identify promising property development projects in moscow and st. petersburg. the investment company's strategy is to
invest in property development projects and sell off the completed properties after a few years of ownership. investment decisions on projects
had not been made by the end of 2011.



aifm directive to regulate investment funds

the alternative investment fund managers directive (aifm) , which regulates the operations of investment funds, will most likely be applied in
finland from the beginning of the year 2013. aimed at promoting stability and reliability in the financial markets, the new directive will govern
previously unregulated investment funds. as sponda complies with the legislation on the operations of listed companies and good corporate
governance, satisfying the requirements of the new directive will not demand major changes from the company.


the principles of ethics and responsibility are emphasised in the operations of sponda's real estate funds business unit. ethics and
responsibility are important criteria in the investment activities of the funds as well as the management of properties and they strengthen the
funds' profitability and long-term viability.


the real estate funds place emphasis on the energy efficiency of properties and strive to reduce the environmental impacts of the properties
owned by them. energy consumption is actively monitored and solutions for reducing consumption are sought in cooperation with customers.
more information on managing the customer experience and improving energy efficiency is available in the spondability section of this annual
report.



growth through new product development

while property markets are slow, businesses are engaged in capital market transactions and restructuring activities which create new
opportunities for sponda as an investor. in uncertain times, property investments are a stable asset class that offers strong yield and long-term
diversification advantages. indirect investment instruments are an excellent alternative for property investment, particularly when the investor
does not have operational familiarity and expertise in the sector or geographical region concerned.


sponda expects fund management profitability to remain at a good level. the unit's objective is to grow by developing new products and
alternatives that appeal to investors. the company will actively analyse opportunities to create new funds in 2012.

risks and risk management
sponda uses effective risk management to ensure the continuity of its operations and the achievement of key objectives. risk
management is integrated into the company’s planning system and day-to-day operations.



integrated risk management as a key strength

sponda manages the risks associated with its operations by identifying, measuring and preventing key uncertainties. the company employs
effective risk management to protect its business operations and ensure that key objectives are achieved. risks are assessed in terms of their
probability as well as their financial impact. achieving financial targets is a sign that risk management has been successful. sponda’s key risks
are classified as strategic risks, operational risks, damage and asset risks and financing risks.


sponda has adopted a systematic approach to risk management and one of the company’s key strengths is its ability to integrate risk
management as part of the strategy process, the enterprise resource planning system and business processes. the responsibility for risk
management is determined in accordance with business responsibility. the ultimate responsibility for risk management lies with the board of
directors, which sets risk management objectives, decides on risk management policy, organises risk management and monitors key risks.
business units and corporate functions are responsible for arranging for risk management to be monitored and reported as part of the company’s
other reporting activities. the company’s internal audit function monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system.


risk management is tied to the company’s annual planning process and risks are assessed in a risk survey carried out twice a year. the risk
survey identifies the company’s key risks, assesses the probability of their occurrence and potential impacts thereof, and defines risk
management procedures. the risk survey is updated every autumn in conjunction with budgeting. the group’s risk management guidelines and
the operations handbook are updated to reflect the decisions made on the basis of the risk survey. the risk survey also includes an assessment
of the company’s approach to risks.


sponda’s risk management toolbox includes risk aversion, risk elimination and reducing the probability that risks will materialise. risks can also
be restricted and reduced. a business continuity and recovery plan has been prepared for the contingency that substantial risks materialise.



no major changes in short-term risks

sponda’s risk management was effective in 2011 and no substantial risks materialised. in the risk survey carried out by the company, the
availability of financing resulting from a weaker business environment was identified as a new short-term risk. sponda protects itself against this
risk by actively monitoring the status of the financial markets and by taking a proactive approach to restructuring its liabilities. due to effective risk
management and refinancing arrangements, difficulties in the availability of financing are unlikely to pose an immediate risk to sponda in the next
two years. the company’s next major refinancing needs will arise in 2014.


with the exception of the weaker availability of financing, key short-term risks remained unchanged. a decline in the economic occupancy rate
resulting from a slowdown in economic growth and a loss of rental income due to tenant insolvency remain relevant risks in sponda’s operations.
with regard to sponda’s russian business operations, the exchange rate risk and differences in legislation and official practices between russia
and finland are the major risks and uncertainty factors.



key risks and risk management actions

short-term risks related
to sponda’s operations                          risk management actions

fall in economic occupancy rate                 sponda’s property portfolio is mainly located in helsinki’s city centre and the ruoholahti district. the company
                                                                        –
                                                spends approximately 1 1.5 per cent of the property portfolio value on modernisation investments each year.
                                                sponda will place more focus on rental operations.

short-term risks related
to sponda’s operations                          risk management actions

decline in tenants’ solvency                    sponda carries out regular checks to monitor tenants’ solvency and changes therein. most tenants submit a
                                                security deposit corresponding to 3 to 6 months’ rent at the start of their tenancy. the company has a diverse
                                                tenant base representing a wide variety of sectors.

availability of financing                       sponda reorganises maturing loans in a timely manner. when the financial market is tightening up, the
                                                company refinances loans well before their maturity. sponda’s next major refinancing needs will arise in 2014.
                                                at the end of 2011, sponda had unused credit limits for eur 440 million.

                                                sponda mitigates its interest rate risk through fixed-interest loans and interest rate derivative contracts.
interest rate risk

special features of the russian property        sponda receives half of its russian rental revenue in us dollars and half in roubles. most of the rent payments
market and exchange rate fluctuations           made in roubles are tied to the us dollar or euro exchange rate. the exchange rate risk arising from the use of
                                                the rouble is reduced by the fact that a significant portion of the company’s own expenses in russia is also
                                                paid in roubles. sponda hedges a six-month cash flow from russia. the company’s investments in russia are
                                                mainly funded in euros from the parent company balance sheet.




strategic risks
risks relating to the business environment

uncertainty in the business environment and an oversupply of new office premises are expected to result in the vacancy rates for business
premises in finland remaining at a high level. the occupancy rate of sponda’s office premises is high, but increasing supply and weaker
economic growth may have a negative effect on sponda’s rental operations. the occupancy rate of retail premises has remained high despite
the weaker business environment, but the prospects for logistics properties have become dimmer as finnish exports are beginning to decline.


the weakening of the financial markets caused by the european public debt crisis resulted in poorer availability of financing in 2011. sponda has
taken steps to prepare for the risks related to the availability of financing by refinancing its loans maturing in 2012. sponda’s next major
refinancing needs will arise in 2014.



changes in the fair value of properties

the value of real estate is sensitive to cyclical fluctuations. it is affected by several factors including interest rates, inflation, economic growth,
business environment, availability of credit, property taxation, demographic factors and construction activity. changes in supply and demand can
also significantly affect property values regardless of the general economic trends of regional real estate markets.



loss of rental income

in 2011, sponda’s ten largest clients accounted for approximately 31 (2010: 32) per cent of rental income. the loss or insolvency of one or
several tenants may lead to a substantial loss in revenue for the company. the sustained vacancy rate of a property may also have a negative
impact on the property value as well as the company’s balance sheet and operating profit. sponda was successful in managing the risks related
to its tenants’ solvency in 2011, as indicated by receivables from tenants remaining at the previous year’s levels.


at the end of 2011, sponda had a total of 3,277 (3,111) lease contracts and 2,160 (2,003) customers. the largest client sectors were retail,
banking and the public sector.



exchange rate risk from russian operations and differences in property markets

sponda’s russian properties are located in st. petersburg and moscow. at the end of 2011, russian properties represented 7 (7) per cent of the
company’s balance sheet total. differences in legislation and official practices between russia and finland may cause risks for sponda’s
operations. the exchange rate risk associated with russian business operations may also have a negative effect on the company’s profit.

                                                                                                                                            annual report 2011           sponda




sponda has set an upper limit for its russian property holdings of 10–20 per cent of the balance sheet total, which helps mitigate the risks
associated with the company’s russian operations.



risks relating to property development

sponda’s property development operations focus on development projects of unbuilt land areas and buildings requiring modernisation that are
profitable but require extensive planning and may go on for several years. due to the long-term nature of the projects, rental income and cash
flow can, in some cases, be delayed by several years. sponda also incurs expenses from the planning phase that takes place before a project is
confirmed. the key risks are related to the degree of success in leasing premises and the potential increase in construction costs. the company
manages the risks relating to property development by requiring a minimum advance occupancy rate of 50 per cent before launching projects.


due to the uncertainty in the business environment, sponda has adopted a careful approach to launching new property development projects. in

key features of internal controls relating to financial reporting

the risk management in sponda’s financial reporting process is part of the group’s overall risk management and internal control. the company
has defined the main features of its internal control using the international coso model. the model has been used in defining the control
environment, risk assessment method and the applicable control measures. the internal control solutions adopted by the company also take into
consideration its industry, the management of the group as a single entity and the company form of ownership of properties.


the company’s internal control is a group-wide process that involves the board of directors, executive directors, other staff members and
internal audit. internal control aims to ensure the effectiveness and appropriateness of the company's operations, the reliability of financial
information and reporting as well as compliance with laws and regulations.

for more information on internal control, please refer to sponda's corporate governance statement.




damage and asset risks
sponda has adopted an occupational health system, travel safety programmes and crisis readiness instructions to ensure the safety of its
personnel. sponda has all required insurance coverage in place and the company’s properties are insured for their full value. sponda has
prepared guidelines and processes for property sales, purchases and leasing as well as safety issues. no substantial damage or asset risks
materialised in 2011.




financing risks
interest rate risk

significant changes in market interest rates and margins may have a negative effect on sponda’s financial result and contribute to slower growth
in the property business. despite the weaker business environment, the average interest rate of the company’s debts remained largely
unchanged in 2011.


for more information on financing risks and their management, please refer to the section on financing and financial risks in this annual report.



exchange rate risk

the cash flow from sponda’s russian operations is subject to exchange rate risk. sponda receives half of its revenue from russia in us dollars
and half in roubles. the rouble risk is reduced by a significant proportion of the rouble-denominated revenues being tied to a fixed dollar or euro
exchange rate and by the fact that a major part of the russian business unit’s expenses are denominated in roubles. sponda hedges the cash
flow from its russian operations for six months in advance. risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations may have a negative effect on
sponda’s profit.




financing and financial risk management
sponda’s financing strategy aims to secure the financing needed to carry out the company's business operations and manage sponda group's
financial risks. under uncertain market conditions, the company's reputation as a trustworthy debtor has made refinancing arrangements easier.




treasury strategy
sponda's treasury strategy is based on a broad base of financiers, a diversified range of financing instruments, a debt portfolio with evenly
spread maturity dates, managed hedging of interest rate risks and good liquidity. the company aims to primarily finance its operations by
arranging credit that is unsecured.

    the company's interest-bearing loans consist of syndicated credit facilities totalling eur 735 (2010: 675) million, bonds totalling eur 173
    (250) million, commercial papers totalling eur 219 (17) million and bilateral loans totalling eur 628 (631) million. the company maintains its
    liquidity and ensures the availability of financing with a eur 350 million commercial paper programme and unused binding short-term credit
    limits. at the financial statements date, sponda had unused credit limits approximately for eur 440 million.


    sponda's treasury unit is responsible for the group's financing and funding acquisition.




    managing financial risks
    sponda's financial risk management aims to minimise the unfavourable impacts of changes in the financial markets on the company's profits and
    cash flow. risk management objectives and policy are set by the company's board of directors, which is also responsible for monitoring risk
    management. the company's main financing risks are interest rate risks, risks related to the availability of financing, exchange rate risks and
    credit risks. according to sponda’s risk management policy, the hedge level of the debt portfolio's interest rate risk is at least 60 per cent and at
    most 100 per cent. at the end of 2011 the hedging level of the debt portfolio was 77 per cent.


    sponda’s strengths in financial risk management include the active identification of risks and reacting to them, the company's reputation as a
    trustworthy debtor and the diversity of its financing instruments. the management of risks is also supported by the company's broad base of
    financiers, which was further strengthened in 2011 through a bond issue directed particularly at institutional investors in scandinavia.


    sponda's creditors are protected by covenants included in financial contracts. the most important covenants are:


•     interest cover ratio, which must be at least 1.75. at the end of 2011, the interest cover ratio was 2.7.
•     equity ratio, which must be at least 28 per cent. at the end of 2011, the equity ratio was 38 per cent.

a syndicated credit facility of eur 375 million, consisting of a loan of eur 275 million and a credit limit of eur 100 million. the funds received
from the syndicated credit facility were also used in their entirety to repay loans maturing in 2012. the margin on the new loan was 1.70 per cent

bond issue further diversifies sponda's base of financiers. the exchange rate risk related to the cash flows of the bond issue has been hedged.

prospects for 2012

based on property acquisitions and the completed property development projects in 2011.

                                                                                 in the helsinki metropolitan area.
attractiveness and occupancy rate of the
company's properties. while the primary
responsibility for the development of cities lies
with the cities themselves, sponda believes that
being active and showing initiative is part of
being a responsible actor in the property sector.

sponda uses innovative customer-focused solutions and high-quality property maintenance to
actively create best practices in its industry and act responsibly in developing the environment
and cityscapes.




a living city is welcoming and safe
although the city authorities are primarily responsible for the development of the city, sponda feels that initiative and an active
approach are a part of the role of a responsible operator in the real estate business. the company participates in the development of
cities in cooperation with the city authorities and surrounding properties.


sponda’s properties are focused in the largest cities in finland and russia. as a result, the vitality of cities is an important factor for the appeal
and occupancy rate of the company’s properties. factors affecting the company’s property holdings and purchase decisions include, amongst
other things, a good location in central locations of cities with good access to public transport.



cooperation with the city and surrounding properties

sponda participates in the development of cities in cooperation with the companies operating near its properties, owners of the surrounding
properties and city officials responsible for planning. the needs of society and economic life form the framework for development. sponda
enlivens cities by offering appealing office and retail premises for companies, creating a flexible setting for the development of the economic life
of cities. properties complementing the urban framework also create natural meeting places for the local residents.


in all its property development projects, sponda pays close attention to the immediate surroundings and the surrounding urban framework.
external lighting of properties, heating of streets and covered pathways, for example, can significantly improve the comfort and safety of the area
surrounding the property.


the company’s most important development project related to the development of cities is the renovation of the citycenter shopping centre in
helsinki’s central business district. during the project, the company has worked in cooperation with the city of helsinki and the stockmann
department store operating in a nearby property developing an underground maintenance tunnel improving traffic safety in the city centre.

sponda also participates in the development of cities by means of active participation in associations promoting the activities of cities. the
company is a member of elävä kaupunkikeskusta ry (living city centre), for example, with the aim of continuous development of finnish

municipal and city centres into more lively, welcoming and competitive locations. sponda is also a support member of design district helsinki
and a member of helsinki city markkinointi ry (helsinki city marketing).



actively participating in the development of cities

land use planning prepared by cities do not generally require input from the owners of properties regarding development actions. the will to
develop a district starts from the property owner itself. sponda’s active participation in public tenders is evidence of the company’s desire to
participate in the development of cities.


sponda has won several public tenders, including the property development projects of the vuosaari harbour in helsinki and the ratina shopping
centre in tampere. the company is especially strong in the creation of innovative business premises solutions, observing aspects related to
cityscape in addition to the needs of cities and customers. its expertise is largely based on extensive experience in the real estate business and
real estate development.


cities are often also developed inside properties by, for example, planning flexible and appealing premises that attract companies and thereby
improve the services of the area.

in brief
•   sponda is involved in urban development through the properties it owns
•   development is pursued in cooperation with cities and neighbouring properties
•   sponda's most significant project related to urban development is the renovation of the citycenter block in the heart of helsinki




projects
enlivening the centre of helsinki and development of the cityscape

with the citycenter project, sponda is involved in the development of helsinki’s central business district into an even more interesting and vibrant
area. the completion of the citycenter will considerably modify helsinki’s cityscape, and it is expected that the focal area of the business district
will move to the renewed business quarter and its surroundings.


the construction of citycenter’s maintenance yards is one of the projects related to helsinki's central maintenance tunnel, improving the traffic
safety of the streets and reducing emissions and noise caused by traffic. the transfer of the quarter’s freight deliveries underground allowed the
removal of driving ramps from keskuskatu and the later revision of the street into a pedestrian street.


in addition to the soon-to-be pedestrian street, the covered pedestrian routes reaching aleksanterinkatu in 2012 improve the comfort of the area
and the business quarter. the railway station and helsinki’s busiest metro station connect to citycenter through the asematunneli underground
premises, allowing train or metro users to reach the shopping centre safely through the tunnel unaffected by the influences of weather.

sponda also continued the renovation of the unioninkatu office premises in the centre of helsinki. this project involves creating modern business
facilities in classic city buildings. building of new premises of this type is rarely possible in helsinki’s central business district. the comfort and
energy efficiency of the property under renovation are improved by, amongst other things, modernising hvac solutions and lighting and

                                                                                                             annual report 2011        urban development




renovating the buildings' ceiling, floor and wall surfaces. the renovation of the unioninkatu properties will mainly be completed during the second
quarter of 2012.


sponda’s influence as a property developer is also visible in the development of the cityscape and services of the ruoholahti and salmisaari
districts of helsinki, for example. the company owns some 170,000 square metres of rental premises in the area. the street scene and services
of these districts have been improved by, amongst other things, renovating old industrial buildings into modern business and public
administration facilities while respecting the history of the buildings and the cityscape of the area.



more customers to tampere city centre

sponda is currently renovating the kauppa-häme property located in central tampere into functional, modern and comfortable retail and office
premises. at the same time, the goal of the project is to make central tampere increasingly attractive and appealing by making it possible to
provide a broader range of services. the project involves transforming the retail and office building completed in 1965 into a property that meets
today’s standards. the property will undergo a facelift that also benefits the urban environment around it. this will particularly be reflected in a
renovation of the facade of the property’s retail space. the renewed kauppa-häme will attract passing customers more effectively, while
enlivening the centre of tampere.


sponda is also planning the ratina shopping centre in the centre of tampere with the goal of strengthening the range of services available in the
area. the property, which has been designed to fit in with its functionalist surroundings, is located in the high-traffic area between the stadium
and the bus station. a good location combined with a varied range of services is expected to bring in customers from the entire tampere region.
sponda was selected as the developer in the public tender process organised by the city of tampere. the planning of the shopping centre
continued in 2011 and the construction of the property is estimated to begin in 2012. the start of the project requires an adequate pre-let and an
investment decision of the company.

urban development,
citycenter case study
“the city centre is like an icon for the entire city”, says tuomas rajajärvi, head of the helsinki city planning department, to illustrate the
significance of the city centre to helsinki as a whole. if the city centre is lacking in vitality, developing other areas will be very challenging.



city planning promotes making better use of the inner courtyards of city blocks

the city's aim is to maintain the current scale of the helsinki city centre, which poses challenges to the development of the central areas of the
city. as a result, current development plans are largely based on connecting the properties that make up city blocks by making better use of the
space between them by constructing arcades and glass roofs, for example. rajajärvi says the citycenter project, with its inner courtyard covered
by a glass roof, is a model example of this type of development.


one of the main objectives of helsinki's city planning is eco-efficiency, which is managed through building permits. according to rajajärvi,
creating business opportunities and services in locations with good public transport access is a great example of sustainable planning.



the citycenter project supports the development of a pedestrian city centre

rajajärvi considers the renovation of the citycenter block to be an important development project that promotes helsinki's positive image as a
city. he believes that the new look for the former "sausage building" will make the block and its surroundings much more attractive, which will
represent a significant upgrade for the station tunnel area that was previously perceived by many as unpleasant. the citycenter project will also

support the development of keskuskatu into a high-quality pedestrian street.



helsinki’s image as an attractive and modern winter city

the renewal of the citycenter block also has a positive effect on helsinki's image as a winter city. according to rajajärvi, the citycenter block's
new heated walkways covered with glass roofs and solutions such as the planned cover for the saarinen courtyard will make central helsinki
more pleasant for pedestrians in the wintertime. he adds that street heating and lighting will also make the wintery city centre more attractive.


rajajärvi says lighting has a great deal of potential in developing the image of the city. improvements to lighting can make central helsinki more
pleasant and attractive without the need to make changes to major structures. new led technology also means that lighting solutions can be
implemented in more environmentally friendly ways than before.



cooperation as the foundation of development

rajajärvi says urban development is a shared process where multiple actors play important roles. he hopes property companies, in particular,
show a genuine desire to develop helsinki in cooperation with the other parties involved. the central business district has tailor-made zoning
plans and properties must be compatible with their surroundings.


from the city's perspective, the key aspects of the citycenter renovation project are the cityscape and accessibility. in practice, accessibility
refers to aspects such as walkways that are sufficiently wide to allow large amounts of people to move smoothly in the citycenter block and the
areas surrounding the central railway station. the accessibility of central helsinki has also been improved by the maintenance tunnel project
related to the citycenter project. the tunnel allows maintenance vehicles to travel underground instead of taking up space on the city streets. the
project was implemented by several parties involved in helsinki's development, including sponda.

design
in the urban environment, design is always present in the architecture of buildings and city districts. for sponda, good design means
the aesthetics of the properties, but also functionality and flexibility.




this pdf is composed of selected elements from the sponda annual report and may deviate from generated documents                                    64

                                                                                                            annual report 2011       urban development




meeting customer requirements while observing the cityscape

the planning of properties at sponda is always customer-based with a focus on the changing needs of customers. this applies to both new
construction and renovation. good overall solutions are emphasised in order to guarantee the economy, healthiness and safety of premises.
successful design of office premises also creates a positive image for the company and improves working conditions.


in addition to the needs of customers, good design can also respond to the development requirements of cities. functional and flexible properties
designed with environmental aspects in mind attract companies and thereby improve the availability of services in cities. the look of the city or
the city district is always taken into account in the design, paying special attention to the local characteristics and the existing building stock.


properties located in the centres of cities experience substantial wear as large volumes of people pass through them on a daily basis. in
properties such as these, design focuses on functionality and accessibility in addition to aesthetics. special attention is paid to factors allowing
the premises to withstand wear and tear, but also the test of time.




taking environmental aspects into account in the
development of cities
sponda’s property portfolio is focused on urban areas, near traffic and customer flows. a central location also decreases the
environmental load of properties.



ecological location

lots of services have gathered in the centres of cities and near public transport routes. they stimulate the cities and make it easier to respond to
the needs of local residents. by concentrating its properties in the centres of cities and near good public transport routes, sponda offers the
companies operating in its premises the possibility to favour environmentally friendly solutions in commuting. a good, central location of
properties also brings the company closer to the services offered in the central districts, thereby reducing the need to travel.



flexible and ecological premises

in addition to location, solutions and choices related to construction and renovation also have a significant impact on the environmental impact
and functionality of properties throughout their life cycle. good planning aims to make all premises, both newly constructed and renovated, into
flexible buildings with a long life cycle.


flexibility extends the life cycle of properties and reduces the environmental load caused by alterations, repair and renovations. even the use of
the building can be changed when required. sponda’s flexible premises also offer a flexible framework for the development of cities’ economic
life.


in addition to flexibility, sponda pays particular attention to energy efficiency and environmentally sound solutions of its properties. sponda
applies either leed® or breeam® certificates for its newly constructed buildings. the company utilises the certification process to better meet
the environmental demands of its customers.



lighting brings comfort in an energy-efficient manner

utilising new environmentally friendly technologies allows an energy-efficient improvement of comfort and safety in cities. in the renovation of the
lighting of citycenter in 2011, for example, environmentally friendly and energy-efficient led technology was implemented. in addition, many of
the company’s properties already utilise street heating making use of the waste heat from properties, improving the usability of the city centre
during the winter. the company intends to extend the use of street heating in the future.

a glimpse into our portfolio




citycenter, helsinki
located in the heart of helsinki's central business district and benefiting from some of the city's busiest pedestrian flows, the citycenter retail and
office complex is the most significant of sponda's current property development projects. the extensive renovation of this culturally and
historically important property, formerly referred to by helsinkians as the “sausage building”, will make this traditional retail block and its
surrounding areas a great deal more attractive and appealing.


major improvements have been made to the interior of the building to offer companies modern and light-filled retail and office premises in the
heart of helsinki. the appeal of the property is further increased by covered walkways and the adjacent keskuskatu, which will become a
pedestrian street upon completion of the citycenter project. the central railway station and helsinki's busiest metro station are accessible from
citycenter through the underground station tunnel, which allows train and metro commuters to enter the shopping centre without being exposed
to the weather conditions.


in 2011, a 10 storey light well, a new 4,200 square metre office building and 3,700 square metres of newly renovated retail space were added to
the citycenter property. the office building was awarded leed gold environmental certification upon completion. the renovation project will
increase the leasable area of the citycenter block from 41,000 square metres to 55,000 square metres. the project is scheduled to be largely
completed in late 2012.

responsibility as part of sponda's strategy
responsibility is an integral part of sponda's day-to-day operations and business expertise, supporting the company's profitability
and long-term viability.



responsibility and strategy

sponda's main priorities are increasing shareholder value, ensuring the sustainability of operations and continuously developing the company.
the company's principle of responsibility plays an important role in the pursuit of these priorities. sponda has highlighted the development of the
customer experience and environmental responsibility as strategic focal points in its business development.



increasing environmental requirements

the property sector has a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency. sponda supports the fight against climate
change in its own operations by improving the energy efficiency of its properties and reducing their environmental impact. the united nations
environmental programme estimates that buildings make up as much as 40 per cent of global energy consumption, with the majority of that
consumption occuring during use. as efforts to reduce emissions are ramped up, national and eu requirements on corporate environmental
responsibility will become tighter.


sponda believes that, in the future, client companies will increasingly pay attention to the life cycle environmental impact of their business
premises. sponda is preparing for these future challenges today by investing in improving its environmental expertise and developing solutions
that promote the wellbeing of the environment.


environmental requirements are highlighted in sponda's property development operations as well as property maintenance. sponda also works
together with its clients to develop more energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable business premises, as the majority of the environmental
impact of a building is created during its use.


the wellbeing of the environment is included among the criteria the company applies in deciding on property investments. in accordance with its
investment strategy, the focus of sponda's property portfolio is on central locations with good public transport links.



developing the customer experience

sponda aims to achieve a competitive advantage and identify the best ways of working from the customer's perspective, through its new
customer experience management process. the company aims to be a trustworthy property partner that offers each customer premises that are
precisely tailored to their needs combined with an effective customer relationship. in customer relations, the goal is to achieve a long-term
interactive partnership rather than a unilateral landlord-tenant relationship.


sponda actively monitors changes in how client companies work and what new requirements they have regarding their business premises in
order to develop its own operations in accordance with the changing needs of its customer base.



managing responsibility

environmental responsibility and managing the customer experience are strategic focal points for sponda and the company has set annual
targets and defined key actions for them. the executive board and the board of directors regularly monitor the achievement of targets and
implementation of actions. the major challenges in achieving the targets set for environmental responsibility are related to the reduction of

    environmental impacts during the use of buildings, as in the company's properties work over 30,000 individuals who each play an important role
    in making environmentally conscious choices on a daily basis.


    sponda encourages its employees to work towards the goals related to environmental responsibility and the customer experience by including
    them as factors in the incentive scheme that covers all personnel.




    responsibility priorities
    sponda's vision, which guides the implementation and development of its responsible operations, is to be the most reliable, profitable and
    responsible player in the real estate sector, implementing sustainable development. the strategic focus of the company's responsibility is on
    environmental responsibility and the customer experience.


    in 2011, sponda defined seven responsibility priorities, the implementation and development of which will be particularly focused on in the
    company's operations.


    some members of sponda’s executive board were involved with defining responsibility priorities. the priorities are based on the company’s
    strategy and in particular on its strategic areas of focus related to customer experience and environmental responsibility. the purpose of the
    responsibility priorities is to support developing sponda’s operations from the perspective of sustainable development.


    sponda's responsibility priorities are:


•     improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint
•     material efficiency
•     property locations
•     enhancing the customer experience
•     investing in employees
•     transparency in operations
•     taking the industry forward


    more detailed information on each of the responsibility priorities can be found in sections dedicated to them in this online annual report.




    improving energy efficiency and reducing the
    carbon footprint
    the property sector plays a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency. sponda recognises this and pays
    particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint caused by energy consumption.



    why is this a priority?

    improving the energy efficiency of buildings is an essential element of the eu climate and energy strategy, which aims for a 20 per cent decrease
    in the energy consumption of new buildings by 2020. improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions plays a key role in
    achieving that aim, as construction activity and energy consumption during the use of buildings together represent over 40 per cent of final
    energy consumption. in 2021, all new buildings must meet near zero energy standards.

                                                                                                                   annual report 2011          spondability




    as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy consumption of a building, co-operation between the landlord and tenant is of
    crucial importance in reducing energy consumption. every day nearly 30,000 people work in premises owned by sponda, which means that even
    small acts can result in major changes.


    sponda strives to reach the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients. energy efficiency is an important
    consideration in all of the company's property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations. sponda also provides
    guidance and encourages its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties.


    the figures for environmental responsibility are based on sponda’s properties located in finland, from which data is collected regarding energy
    and water consumption and waste management. there is a certain degree of annual variability in sponda’s property holdings due to sales and
    purchases, which affects the comparability of the annual environment figures.



    improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint at sponda

    the key aspects of the priority are:


•     the consumption of heat, electricity and water in buildings
•     property development
•     increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees



    certification and sponda’s planning guidelines

    at sponda, new construction, property renovation and the design of office buildings are all subject to the company's planning guidelines, which
    are in many ways more extensive than the generally applied standards and regulations. the guidelines help the company develop adaptable and
    energy efficient properties that offer good physical working conditions for tenants and users.


    sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations. by applying for environmental
    certification for new buildings and major renovation projects, the company can offer its clients high-quality business premises that are
    environmentally friendly.



    energy efficiency scheme

    the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through sponda's energy efficiency scheme. originally launched in 2009, the
    scheme is aimed at achieving energy savings in cooperation with clients.


    the energy efficiency scheme starts with an energy review at the premises to determine the energy consumption of each property and to
    examine the different technical systems relating to energy consumption. energy efficiency goals and measures for achieving them are set
    individually for each property in cooperation with the users. developments are then monitored in regular meetings with clients. sponda's partners
    ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data.


    the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency scheme are reinvested in the properties. the goal of the scheme is a 10 per cent
    reduction in energy consumption by 2016. sponda will expand its cooperation with clients in the future to reduce the overall environmental load of
    properties by paying attention to not only energy consumption, but also other environmental factors related to the property and client operations.



    environmental awareness in day-to-day work

    sponda's head office in helsinki was granted wwf’s green office certification in 2010 in recognition of the high extent to which environmental
    aspects are taken into consideration in office work. sponda uses the green office programme to promote the environmental expertise of
    personnel and guide employees in making environmentally sound choices. environmental awareness is increased for example through an annual
    green day event as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet.

    sponda reports to the wwf annually on the energy consumption of its head office. the company takes an active approach to reducing the
    energy consumption and other environmental load of its head office building. in 2011 energy consumption at sponda's head office decreased
    compared to 2010. electricity consumption declined by 1.4 per cent, heating consumption (weather-adjusted) by 9 per cent and district cooling by
    10.9 per cent. the building's water consumption fell by 16 per cent from the previous year.


    sponda's employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports low-emission options. employees
    are also provided with company bicycles. as part of sponda's green office environmental programme, employees are also trained in economical
    driving. the company makes shared public transport tickets available to employees who need to travel in helsinki metropolitan area during the
    working day.

    objectives for 2011
•     energy efficiency scheme will be continued
•     international environmental certification application process will be initiated for all new construction projects
•     concept for low-energy commercial buildings will be applied in all new build property development projects
•     environmental impacts (consumptions) will be reduced
•     expanded monitoring of the environmental indicators in russia



    measures taken in 2011

    more properties covered by the energy efficiency scheme


    at the end of 2011, there were a total of 113 (2010: 84) properties included in the energy efficiency scheme. an energy review had been
    conducted at 83 of these properties and action proposals drafted for 49 properties. the energy efficiency scheme has also been initiated at
    three properties owned by real estate funds managed by sponda.


    for properties that joined the programme in 2010, energy reviews continued, a part of recommended actions were taken and consumption was
    monitored in accordance with property-specific action plans. certain measures were implemented in cooperation with property users, while some
    of the measures will be implemented in conjunction with major renovation projects.


    the results of the energy reviews under the company's russian energy efficiency scheme, launched in 2010, were compiled and analysed in
    2011. energy efficiency goals and measures for achieving them will be set individually for each property based on the results of the energy
    reviews.


    energy savings were achieved in sponda-owned properties over the course of 2011 partly thanks to the energy efficiency scheme. however,
    the exceptional weather conditions in finland made it difficult to monitor consumption for the part of adjusted or weather-corrected heating
    energy. the adjusted energy consumption of comparable properties remained nearly the same (+0.2 per cent), while the measured heat
    consumption decreased by 18.5 per cent in actuality. in comparable properties overall electricity consumption decreased by 2.3 per cent, water
    consumption decreased by 4.8 per cent and cooling consumption decreased by 10 per cent.


    the carbon footpring caused by the total energy consumption of all of sponda’s properties was 56,080 tonnes/co2 (2010: 60,048), which
    represents a decrease of 6.6 per cent compared to the previous year.


    in order to improve the monitoring and reporting of the consumption of its properties, sponda further expanded real-time consumption monitoring
    and remote reading of electricity consumed by the building, as well as heating, cooling and water consumption.


    in 2011, sponda joined a voluntary action plan related to property sector’s energy efficiency agreement to promote the energy efficiency of
    business premises (tets). the aim of the framework agreement is to reduce the energy consumption of participating properties by 6 per cent by
    2016.

    environmental awareness among clients increased


    in order to strengthen its cooperation with clients on environmental matters, sponda proposed an environmental partnership to ten clients in 2011
    with the aim of improving the energy efficiency and waste recycling rate of business premises while taking clients' individual needs into
    consideration. in the partnerships, particular attention is paid to the environmental effects of the client's operations. sponda and the clients that
    enter into an environmental partnership agree on a case-specific basis what the objectives of the partnership are and how the cooperation will be
    implemented. at the turn of the year, new partnerships were launched with kesko in ruoholahti shopping centre, elisa, nordea, evli bank plc,
    the city of espoo, national board of patents and registration in finland and the cancer society of finland, to name a few.


    sponda's environmental communications aimed at clients were increased significantly in 2011. the company's redesigned extranet services give
    clients guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting and also includes information on the progress of the energy efficiency scheme.
    clients can also use the extranet to monitor the energy consumption of their property. environmental content on the company website was also
    expanded with the addition of environmental tips courtesy of sponda's partner wwf finland.


    customer communications will be further improved in 2012 by organising environmental events at clients' premises in partnership with wwf
    finland. the goal is to increase environmental awareness among the users of sponda's properties and to encourage clients to take
    environmentally friendly action in their daily operations.



    international environmental certification for four properties


    by seeking certification for its newly built or renovated properties, sponda looks to offer its customers high-quality and environmentally friendly
    business premises. interest in property-specific international environmental certificates has increased significantly in recent times. sponda
    decided in early 2011 to apply for environmental certification for all of its newly constructed properties.


    a total of four sponda-owned properties were granted international environmental classification in 2011:


•     an office building completed in 2008 and located in helsinki at sörnäistenkatu 2 was granted leed® silver environmental certification for an
      existing building.
•     an office building completed in 2011 as part of the citycenter block in helsinki's central business district was granted leed® gold
      environmental certification.
•     ruoholahden tähti, an office building completed in 2008 in helsinki's ruoholahti district, was granted breeam®-in-use-certification.
•     port gate, an office building completed in 2008 in helsinki's vuosaari harbour was granted breeam®-in-use-certification.


    as of the beginning of 2012, sponda has certification processes pending at seven properties or property development projects. the currently on-
    going certification processes will continue in 2012 and the certification application process will be initiated for all new construction projects also in
    the future.


    in 2011, sponda updated its planning guidelines to take the requirements and instructions of international environmental classification systems
    into account. the guidelines apply to all of sponda's new construction and renovation projects.



    commitment to industry agreements and participation in associations


    sponda aims to promote environmental responsibility through active participation in property and construction industry organisations and their
    environmental initiatives. on the property development front, the company strives to promote sustainable development through its membership in
    the green building council finland, russian green building council and rakli, the finnish association of building owners and construction
    clients.


    in 2011, sponda was involved in a project to compose guidelines for construction of a low-energy commercial building. the project was
    coordinated by the finnish association of civil engineers ril, which published guidelines for low-energy commercial construction in early 2012.
    sponda will also continue developing its own concept for a low-energy commercial buildings based on the ril guidelines.

    estimates of the carbon footprint from energy consumption in properties in 2009 and 2010 are based on the specific emission coefficients reported by energy companies for

    2009.

    areas have been recalculated in 2010.




    in brief
    •    sponda's environmental communications aimed at clients were increased and the extranet service was improved
    •    four sponda-owned properties were granted international environmental classification
    •    sponda participated in the development of energy efficiency in the property sector, for instance through being involved in the drafting of the
         low-energy construction planning guide led by the association of finnish civil engineers (ril)




    material efficiency
    material efficiency is part of sponda's comprehensive approach to environmental responsibility. sponda’s efforts in the area of
    material efficiency are particularly focused on waste sorting and providing instructions for waste sorting.



    why is this a priority?

    in 2008, the finnish government approved a national waste plan aimed at reducing waste generation and achieving a reduction in the total
    annual volume of municipal waste by 2016. the objective of the plan is to have less than 20 per cent of municipal waste end up in landfill sites,
    with the remaining 80 per cent recycled or used for energy generation. sponda aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the
    national waste plan through its own operations.



    material efficiency in sponda

    the key aspects of the priority:


•       the sorting and recycling of property waste
•       improving efficiency in material use, also in purchasing
•       producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects


    while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties, sponda aims to facilitate convenient and effective sorting of
    waste at its properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place. the company arranges
    for post-sorting waste management at its properties, unless otherwise agreed with tenants. sponda guides the users of its properties in waste
    recycling and sorting as well as in the reduction of waste volume.


    reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency. sponda's construction and renovation projects take this
    aspect into account by incorporating flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design. this reduces the need for subsequent alterations
    that produce further construction waste.

    in the construction phase of new buildings and major renovation projects, the company has adopted on-site waste management guidelines
    according to the international leed® and breeam® certification systems in order to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal. in all
    construction and renovation projects and in the daily use of the company's properties, the aim is to minimise the volume of waste ending up at
    landfill sites by ensuring the appropriate sorting and recycling of waste


    in addition to the waste sorting and providing instructions for sorting sponda will focus increasingly on reducing the volume of waste as well as
    producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental impact.

    objectives for 2011
•     the total waste volume will decrease and the monitoring will improve


    measures taken in 2011

    in 2011, sponda paid particular attention to waste sorting and recycling as well as monitoring the volume of waste. sponda aims to ensure that
    tenants have appropriate waste sorting facilities at their disposal. the company has also made waste sorting instructions available to customers
    on its extranet services and offers building-specific guidance at certain properties.


    sponda encourages its customers to waste sorting and recycling also with its environmental partner programme, which aims to reduce the
    environmental load resulting from the use of properties. the partnership was started in 2011 among others with kesko in ruoholahti shopping
    centre, elisa, nordea bank finland plc, the city of espoo, evli bank plc, national board of patents and registration in finland and the cancer
    society of finland.


    in 2011, sponda improved its reporting of waste volumes in cooperation with subcontractors. more comprehensive reporting enables the
    company to better communicate with the users of its properties on the volume and type of waste generated. sponda's total waste volume in 2011
    was 5,610 tonnes, of which 2,371 was mixed waste. the volume of mixed waste will be further reduced by improving waste sorting.


    sponda improved waste recycling at its properties in the beginning of 2012 by signing a cooperation agreement with lassila & tikanoja. the new
    cooperation agreement is expected to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions from properties owned by sponda by some 300 tonnes per month
    and increase the recycling ratio to approximately 90 per cent. it is further estimated that the volume of waste ending up at landfill sites will decline
    to one tenth of current levels.



    objectives for 2012
•     environmental partnerships with clients will be increased
•     sponda's properties in finland: recycling ratio of waste increased to over 70 per cent

    sponda-owned properties where the property owner is responsible for waste management is included in the calculation.

    the company responsible for property maintenance has collected the information on a centralised basis from waste management service providers.




    property locations
    sponda takes environmental considerations into account in deciding on the locations for its property investments. sponda’s property
    ownership is guided by the company’s strategic focus on central locations of cities and sites with good public transport links. this
    helps reduce the environmental impacts of the properties and supports the comprehensive sustainability of sponda’s operations also
    from a financial standpoint.



    why is this a priority?

    for sponda, the central location of its properties is a key strategic choice. the company’s properties are in key areas in major cities and in
    locations with good public transport links. this strategy supports sponda’s commitment to environmental responsibility.


    location is also one of the criteria applied in the environmental certification of business properties. the breeam® and leed® certification
    processes take into account public transport links, bicycle parking facilities and the building’s energy source, which is also influenced by zoning.



    property locations as sponda’s priority

    the key aspects of the priority are:


•     taking environmental aspects into account in making decisions on property investments
•     focusing on properties located in cities, accessible by public transportation
•     concentrating on prime areas

    sponda’s investment strategy is sustainable and responsible, not merely from an environmental standpoint, but also financially. the demand and
    rental levels for properties in low-risk prime areas are more stable, even in economically uncertain times. most of the company’s investment
    properties are located in these areas. the investment strategy also supports the comprehensive sustainability of sponda’s operations.



    objectives for 2011
•     increasing the share of shopping centres and office properties in the company’s property portfolio
•     developing the property portfolio by concentrating on prime areas and locations with good public transport links



    measures taken in 2011

    in 2011, sponda strengthened its property portfolio in a key strategic location by purchasing the fennia office and retail block in helsinki’s central
    business district. the purchase increased sponda’s ownership of retail premises in helsinki's central business district by 14,200 square metres
    and office space by 25,500 square metres.


    sponda also boosted its property ownership in central tampere by purchasing the kauppa-häme retail and office property in early 2011. with the
    purchase, sponda’s ownership of retail and office space in tampere’s central business district is increased by 5,500 square metres. following
    the conclusion of the purchase, sponda began a comprehensive renovation of the property.


    an important phase in the project to renovate the citycenter property in helsinki's central business district was completed in 2011. construction
    was completed on a new office building with 4,200 square metres of floor space, located in the middle of the citycenter block. inside the
    shopping centre, a light well was completed, allowing 3,700 square metres of new commercial space to be taken into use. the new office
    building was granted leed® gold environmental certification.


    sponda increased its ownership share in the zeppelin shopping centre in the oulu region and the floor space was increased by 8,700 square
    metres in 2011. the expansion makes the shopping centre the largest in northern finland.

    enhancing the customer experience
    sponda's vision is to be the first choice for customers looking for business premises. in order to realise this vision and systematically
    enhance the customer experience, sponda established a customer experience management (cem) process in 2011. highlighting the
    customer experience as one of sponda's priorities underlines the company's commitment to maintaining a strong customer focus in
    its operations.



    why is this a priority?

    sponda aims to be a trustworthy property partner that offers each customer premises that are precisely tailored to their needs and an effective
    customer relationship. in customer relations, the goal is to achieve an interactive partnership rather than a unilateral lessor-tenant relationship.


    enhancing the customer experience is part of sponda's commitment to its brand promise of being the most trustworthy and competent company
    in its field, offering its clients the best possible operating environment and the most effective customer relationship in the market.


    at the end of 2011, sponda had a total of 2,160 customers and 3,277 lease agreements. the largest client sectors were retail, banking and the
    public sector.

•     creating the conditions for long-term partnerships


    building the customer experience begins from the very first meeting between the client and sponda and it continues and develops throughout the
    customer relationship. successful encounters and experiences lead to customer satisfaction and loyalty, which in turn helps create long-term
    partnerships instead of short-term lessor-tenant relationships.


    by establishing a new process to support the development of the customer experience, the company aims to gain a competitive advantage and
    identify the best ways of working from the customer's perspective.


    sponda monitors customer satisfaction through surveys and as part of its regular interaction with clients. sponda participates in surveys
    conducted by the institute for real estate economics (kti). customer satisfaction is also monitored in all meetings with clients to ensure that
    day-to-day matters are managed effectively and to determine whether there is a need to change anything. sponda's customer service centre also
    carries out telephone interviews to gauge customer satisfaction.


    objectives for 2011
•     customer experience management strategy 2012-2014
•     defining focal areas for customer experience management
•     action plan for 2012
•     developing service innovations



    measures taken in 2011

    sponda's focus in 2011 was particularly on defining the starting level for the customer experience and planning measures for improving it. at the
    same time, the company developed the existing practices it applies in customer relations work to enhance the customer experience. sponda
    established a customer experience management (cem) process in 2011 to support the development of the customer experience. cem creates
    consistent guidelines and a systematic approach for developing the customer experience.


    a customer experience management strategy for 2011-2014 was created in 2011. the customer relations strategy, which was expanded and
    specified in 2010, is one of the key elements of sponda's customer experience management. the customer relations strategy defines the
    customer relations management models and processes for aligning customer service with customer needs. the models defined in the strategy
    are used to develop customer relationships into long-term partnerships. the customer relations strategy will continue to be the foundation for
    developing sponda's customer relations work and making it more effective.


    customers and employees working with customers were interviewed during the development of the strategy. the interviews provided important
    guidelines for setting objectives. in 2012, the company will focus on more effective implementation and execution of the customer relations
    strategy.


    sponda's focus in 2011 was on improving the usability of its online services and making them easier to find. also during the year, sponda
    redesigned its extranet services, which make it easier for customers to manage day-to-day affairs and find the information they need.


    as communications between sponda and a customer often begin with the customer contacting the customer service centre, the company
    invested in improving the customer service centre operating model in 2011.


    in addition to developing current functions and operations, the company also aims to improve the customer experience by developing new
    service innovations. the development of service innovations is based on customer needs and feedback. a research project carried out by
    sponda, with funding from the spaces and places programme of tekes, the finnish funding agency for technology and innovation, will be
    concluded in spring 2012. developing service innovations will remain an integral part of the efforts to develop the customer experience even after
    the research project is concluded.



    objectives for 2012
•     activating the customer relations strategy
•     developing customer experience concerning subcontractors

monitoring job satisfaction

job satisfaction and organisational effectiveness are assessed at sponda on a regular basis with an annual employee survey. the employee
survey was revised in 2011 with the aim of analysing employee perceptions regarding their jobs, organisational effectiveness, management and
engagement. the survey also aims to give respondents the opportunity to express their expectations regarding the development of their jobs and
the work community and to influence the solutions implemented by the company.



personnel development

sponda aims for continuous improvement and learning in all its operations. employees are encouraged to develop themselves and be
independent and active in their own work. common training programmes are arranged for personnel based on the needs arising from sponda's
strategy, customer and stakeholder feedback as well as from performance and appraisal discussions, or personnel may be offered the
opportunity to participate in training outside the company.


sponda's personnel development is guided by the company's customer-focused way of working, as customer expectations and needs determine
the direction for developing employee expertise. appraisal discussions are conducted to ensure that the link between one's own job and
sponda's strategy and objectives is clear to everyone in the organisation. in addition to performance and appraisal discussions, personnel
development and the achievement of goals are evaluated on the basis of benchmarking, the investments made in personnel development and
employee surveys.



health care and supporting physical fitness and exercise

sponda invests in the wellbeing of its employees in many ways, for example by providing comprehensive health services. the aim of sponda's
occupational health care is to prevent illnesses and problems resulting from stress and other work-related psychological factors and to support
work fitness. the goals also include the prevention and early detection of lifestyle diseases and supporting self-care. sponda has a special
wellbeing programme to support the work fitness of employees who have been in working life for a long time.


sponda also looks after occupational wellbeing by supporting its employees' physical exercise and cultural activities. employees are offered
company bicycles to encourage them to choose commuting options that provide significant health benefits while also being environmentally
friendly.



rewarding employees

sponda uses an incentive scheme that covers all personnel and is based on both the company's common goals and on personal targets set
specifically for each employee.


for more information on rewards and incentives, please refer to the section on governance.



measures taken in 2011

employee survey revised


the response rate for the job satisfaction survey conducted in autumn 2011 was very high at 94.4 per cent. the revised survey facilitates group-
level reporting of results. due to the changes, the results of the 2011 survey are not directly comparable with data from previous years.
nevertheless, in relation to comparative data and standards, the 2011 results for both job satisfaction and internal customer relationships were
extremely positive, just as in previous years.


sponda's employer image also remained very good in 2011. confidence in senior management remained high and employees perceived
decision-making to be effective. sponda's employees have a great deal of appreciation for the company's efforts in the area of occupational
health and wellbeing. the survey also shows that organisational effectiveness is improved by the smooth flow of information, which is not
disrupted by rumours. sponda's employees believe in the company's future and are prepared to recommend the company as an employer. they
see their own jobs as challenging and interesting and have positive opinions on managerial work at the unit level.

    the results of the survey indicate that the company treats its employees fairly, which also ensures equality between men and women. sponda's
    objective is that employees do not experience any discrimination or unfair treatment on the basis of gender, age, religion, health or other such
    factors. fair and non-discriminatory treatment applies to the full life cycle of the employment relationship, from recruitment to termination.


    discussing the results of the employee survey in an open and interactive manner in each organisational unit is essential for the development of
    operations. the most recent round of discussions highlighted several concrete ideas on how sponda can improve its service processes and the
    quality of its products and services. the discussions also covered the quality of the tools and systems used.


    after the unit-level analysis and determination of development measures, the executive board chose focal areas based on the analysis of the full
    survey results for the further development of sponda's working atmosphere and operations. occupational tools and systems and improving the
    quality of the company’s products and services were selected as targets for development. to develop its tools and systems the company started
    an enterprise research planning development project in the beginning of 2012.



    personal development and maintaining expertise


    in 2011, there were 2.3 training days per person and training costs accounted for 4.0 per cent of salaries. over the past year, sponda's
    personnel training has focused particularly on personal development and maintaining expertise. the company selects its training and cooperation
    partners on the basis of training quality and reliability.


    all sponda employees participated in performance and appraisal discussions in 2011. in the performance and appraisal discussions, concrete
    training and development measures are determined for each employee on the basis of personal development plans to achieve the objectives set
    for them.



    feel younger through better physical fitness programme supports occupational wellbeing


    in 2011, sponda launched a feel younger through better physical fitness programme focused on physical exercise. the programme supports,
    and is a continuation of, the lifestyle renovation project started in 2010. the programme involves measuring employees' physical age and
    offering customised guidance for all participants, including those who already are physically active.


    the programme includes lectures, health counselling and personal exercise recommendations for all participants. the aims of the programme
    include the prevention of health problems caused by sedentary work and stress. the results of the programme will be monitored throughout
    2012.

    transparency in operations
    the transparency and accuracy of information regarding the company's operations is of utmost importance to sponda. openness and
    transparency are promoted through developing the company's operating models and appropriate methods for interaction with
    stakeholders.



    why is this a priority?

    sponda believes that transparent communications and operations increase stakeholder trust in the company. for sponda, transparency means
    reliable communications and reporting in the first place.



    transparency in sponda’s operations

    the key aspects of the priority are:


•     financial reporting
•     reporting on responsibility
•     communications


    the company's financial reporting complies with existing legislation and standards. the company also serves investors by providing information
    on its operating environment and development in line with epra (european public real estate association) recommendations, amongst others.
    reporting is continuously developed on the basis of interaction with investors and other stakeholders.


    sponda’s most important stakeholders are described in the “cash flows between stakeholders” graph and on the company website. the
    importance of stakeholders is evaluated based on whether or not they are able to have a significant impact on the company’s operations. sponda
    requires responsible operations on the part of its stakeholders, and strives to comply with its stakeholders’ responsibility demands in its own
    operations. sponda’s most important stakeholders form the foundation for the company’s responsible operations.


    sponda's customer relations are based on interactive partnership. this is supported by a commitment to develop the company's operating
    models and make customer communications increasingly interactive. in addition to external reporting and communications, sponda also places a
    great deal of emphasis on internal communications. effective internal communications provide employees the opportunity for open dialogue.
    sponda believes that transparent communications and operations increase trust in the company among key stakeholders.



    objectives for 2011
•     achieving application level c under the gri sustainability reporting framework
•     developing online communications channels



    measures implemented in 2011

    sponda continued to improve the quality of its financial and sustainability reporting in 2011. in recognition of the company's reporting quality,
    sponda's 2010 annual report won silver in the review of annual reports in the european real estate sector carried out annually by the european
    public real estate association (epra). sponda also improved transparency by expanding its reporting on responsibility in 2011 to reach
    application level c under the gri reporting guidelines. the company defined key priorities in the area of corporate responsibility, which will be
    used to further develop reporting activities in the future.

taking the industry forward
sponda develops methods and practices in the real estate sector in the areas of services, economic reporting and energy efficiency
through active participation in collective industry projects and through its activities in different organisations. in addition to
organisational activities, the company takes the industry forward with its own development operations.



why is this a priority?

through organisational activities and its own research and development, sponda promotes sharing of information and expertise and develops its
own operations and those of the real estate industry from the perspectives of environmental, social and economic responsibility.


in finland, buildings are responsible for around one third of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. for this reason, sponda’s development work
takes the energy efficiency of properties and controlling climate change into particular consideration.


as a responsible property company, sponda also participates in the development of cities in terms of its own areas and properties, in cooperation
with cities and other property owners. the vitality of the city environment is also an important factor for the appeal and occupancy rates of
sponda’s own properties.


companies, organisations and authorities in the construction and real estate industry also have an important role in protecting against the grey
economy and commercial crime. this role is emphasised particularly during periods of recession, when commercial crime often increases. rakli
ry (the finnish association of building owners and construction clients) estimates that the damages due to grey economy in the construction
industry alone amount to around eur 500 million each year.


responsible operation modes are also advanced in cooperation with sponda’s subcontractors. the company requires transparent operations on
the part of subcontractors, as well as open and up-to-date communications. by cooperating exclusively with reliable partners, sponda also

in 2011, sponda participated actively in the projects of rakli. the company was involved with the organisation’s green lease practices
development project, whose goal is to develop operational models and tools for contracts between property owners and tenants as well as
service providers, thereby promoting energy and environmental efficiency in properties. a checklist tool for environmental efficiency along with
contract templates for project participants are among the activities completed this past autumn.

in spring 2011, sponda was the main partner in cooperation for aalto university’s master of arts (moa) 2011 exhibition. the event, which was
organised in the sponda-owned salmisaarentalo building, provided new graduates with opportunities to interact with society, prospective

    scope of reporting

    sponda reported on its corporate responsibility for the first time according to the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri). the newest
    gre 3.1 reporting framework is used in reporting. additionally, the real estate and construction industry-oriented construction and real estate
    sector supplement (cress) reporting guideline, which was published in autumn of 2011, has been applied in reporting. for the part of the
    cress directive, the cre indicators related to the real estate sector in particular were reported on where applicable. in addition to the gri
    framework, certain portions of the report also comply with the european public real estate association’s epra criteria, which are taken into
    account separately in connection with the gri index. sponda’s consolidated financial statements are compiled according to the ifrs
    (international financial reporting standards).

    application level c.

      priorities section.

    company’s subsidiaries are mentioned separately. unless otherwise indicated, there have been no changes in the scope or method of calculation

risk management
at sponda, the objective of risk management is to identify the key uncertainties relating to achieving targets, to measure and assess previously
identified uncertainties and to decide on the appropriate response to these uncertainties. sponda’s key risks are classified as strategic risks,
operational risks, damage/asset risks and financing risks.


risks are considered a normal part of business operations. they are assessed from two viewpoints, that of exploiting the opportunities they
contain and that of reducing and eliminating the risks.




risk management organisation
risk management is integrated into sponda’s strategy process, business control system and business processes. responsibility for risk
management is defined in accordance with business responsibility. however, each company employee is responsible for identifying risks that
threaten to prevent the company from achieving its targets and for informing the company of these risks.


the ultimate responsibility for risk management lies with sponda’s board of directors, which decides on risk management goals, defines the risk
management policy and monitors key risks. the specific task of the executive board is to organise risk management. it is the specific task of the
business units and corporate functions to arrange for risk management to be monitored and reported as part of the other reporting systems. the
specific task of the internal audit is to check that the risk management system functions effectively.


sponda’s annual planning process includes carrying out a risk survey, which identifies key risks and estimates their quantity. processing the
strategy and annual plan includes assessing the response to key risks and examining the need to change risk management targets and the risk
management policy. approving the annual plan involves deciding on any revisions to risk management targets and to the risk management

highlights of the 2011 financial period
the focus of sponda’s operations in 2011 was on property development operations, reducing vacancy rates and rearranging financing.


in april 2011, sponda purchased from suomi mutual life assurance company the fennia block located in the helsinki central business district
and consisting of all the shares in six real estate companies and a portion of the shares in a company managing the kaisaniemi metro hall. the
fennia block has a total of approximately 25,500 square metres of office space and approximately 14,200 square metres of retail premises. on
the date of closing the sale, the vacancy rate of this entity was approximately 9.7 per cent. the net initial yield for the property is approximately
5.7 per cent.


sponda paid a total of eur 122,000,000 to suomi mutual for the entity as the debt-free purchase price, of which eur 100,000,000 less the net
debt of the target has been paid in cash in connection with the signing of the purchase. in addition to the cash payment, sponda's board of
directors decided to pay a part of the purchase price through an issue of 5,500,000 new shares in sponda directed to suomi mutual based on
the share issue authorisation given by sponda's annual general meeting of shareholders on 16 march 2011. suomi mutual subscribed for all the
shares at a subscription price of eur 4.00 per share.


sponda issued a sek 650 million bond in march. the maturity date of the five-year bond is 4 april 2016. the bond pays a floating coupon of
three month stibor +2.40 per cent. proceeds and cash flows of the issue have been swapped to euros, eliminating currency risk. in april, the
company signed an agreement with svenska handelsbanken for an unsecured eur 50 million credit limit for five years. the margin and
conditions for the credit limit are the same as in the credit facility that sponda signed on 1 november 2010. in november, sponda signed a
syndicated credit agreement for a total of eur 375 million. the agreement comprises a loan of eur 275 million and a credit limit of eur 100
million. the syndicated credit has a 5 year maturity and its margin was 1.70 per cent on the date of signing the agreement.


the key covenants of all loans are linked to the equity ratio and interest cover ratio. the loans were primarily used to repay existing debts.


sponda’s property development operations continued in accordance with strategy. work continued at the citycenter site, with the second phase
of construction completed for the company's largest property development project. the third and final phase has begun and the project will, for
the most part, be completed in late 2012. the project's adjusted budget was increased by eur 5 million, which is shown as a negative change in
fair value in the income statement. the increased costs are due to realised changes, increases in construction costs and the prolongation of the
project according to an earlier decision. the total investment value of the project is estimated at approximately eur 130 million.

sponda also developed a production facility in the hakkila district of vantaa with a total area of approximately 22,000 square metres. the facility
has been fully leased to metso automation. sponda leased also approximately 12,000 square metres of office and storage facilities from the
adjacent honkatalo building to metso. renovation investments were made in the facilities. the project was completed in early 2011 and it
exceeded the company's target development margin of 15 per cent.


the expansion project of the zeppelin shopping centre in the oulu region was completed on schedule at the beginning of november 2011. the
project added some 4,000 square metres of new retail space for the prisma hypermarket and 4,700 square metres of space for specialty retail.
the new premises built in the shopping centre are fully occupied and the project exceeded the target development margin of 15 per cent.


sponda is developing an office property in the ruoholahti district of helsinki with total floor space of approximately 6,000 square metres. over 70
per cent of the building will be leased to the primary tenant, talentum plc. construction of the office building has begun and the project is
scheduled for completion in april 2013. the project's total investment value is estimated at some eur 23.5 million.


in september, sponda concluded an agreement with srv, ilmarinen, etera and onvest to set up an investment company called russian invest
in russia. this property investment company will invest in real estate development projects in moscow and st. petersburg. the partners have
committed to investing a total of eur 95.5 million in the newly established company. sponda, ilmarinen and srv each own 27 per cent of the
company, etera approximately 13 per cent and onvest some 5 per cent. the capital will be tied up only after the investments have been
identified and investment decisions made.


in march, sponda sold its 45.1 per cent share in ovenia oy, a provider of property management services, to funds managed by vaaka partners
ltd and to ovenia's current management. sponda recorded a sales profit of approximately eur 7.8 million from the deal.




strategy
sponda’s strategic goal is to achieve profitable growth through customer-focused operations, active property development, property acquisitions
and real estate funds in finland and russia.


sponda’s strategy is assessed regularly to ensure that the operations are adjusted to the prevailing market situation as necessary. in spring
2011, sponda purchased the fennia block in helsinki's central business district for approximately eur 122 million. in the second half of the year,
the focus was on maintaining the company's equity ratio and refinancing maturing loans in response to the weakening global economy.


sponda had four active property development projects and spent a total of eur 30.5 million on them during the year. development investments
were primarily financed through profits from operations and property sales. the company signed refinancing agreements for a total of
approximately eur 500 million and its next financing needs will arise in 2014.


sponda's financial objectives are linked to its equity ratio and distribution of dividend. the long-term equity ratio goal is 40 per cent. at the end of
2011, the equity ratio stood at 38 per cent.


in accordance with its dividend policy, sponda pays a dividend of about 50 per cent of the cash flow from operations per share for the period,
nevertheless taking into account the financial situation and development needs. the dividend policy aims at a stable dividend payment.

business conditions
business conditions – finland

the uncertainty of the development of the european economy still continues. its effects are also reflected in the finnish economy and forecasts
concerning it. according to the finnish ministry of finance’s forecast, finnish gdp is estimated to have grown by some 2.6 per cent in 2011 and
growth is expected to slow down to 0.4 per cent in 2012. the inflation rate in 2011 was approximately 3.5 per cent. in 2012, inflation is expected
to decrease to approximately 2.7 per cent. the fact that the finnish economy is stable by european standards and its credit rating is the highest
possible promotes trust in finland being a safe investment choice also in the future.


the effects of the uncertainty of the global economy and the diminishing forecasts are also seen in the real estate market. the anticipatory
atmosphere of the market has led to caution especially in investment decision-making. according to preliminary data, the transaction volume of
2011 will remain clearly under eur 2 billion or approximately one quarter lower than the previous year. the positive trend in rents in the office
market at the beginning of the year levelled out during the rest of the year. the economy and the new office properties soon to be completed in
the helsinki region create increasing pressures on the vacancy rate. the vacancy rate is likely to increase especially in properties in weaker
areas.

the availability of funding for property investments has been becoming increasingly challenging over the last two quarters already, and no
change is expected. good, long-term relations with financiers are the key to securing funding in 2012.



business conditions – russia

the russian gdp is estimated to have grown by 4.4 per cent in 2011 and is expected to continue at the same pace also in 2012. economic
growth is supported particularly by increases in the price of oil and other commodities.


the real estate market has developed positively with the improving economy. the decrease in the vacancy rate of office premises is expected to
continue in moscow in 2012. the vacancy rate of class a office premises is expected to be at the level of 13 per cent. there is a lack of good a
class office premises in particular, which has also led to an increase in rents, but the rent level of the peak years of 2007–2008 is still some way
off. according to an estimate by cushman & wakefield, present lease agreements for prime properties (a+) in moscow are agreed at even usd
1,200/m²/year. the yield requirements for properties in moscow are declining, the average present yield requirement for class a office properties
being approximately 9 per cent on average. property transactions were clearly on the rise in 2011 and the volume of transactions doubled from
the previous year.


the office properties being built at the moment will be completed in 2012-2013, after which there is no significant construction of new buildings
planned in the moscow central area. in the future, construction projects will mainly be carried out outside ring 3.


in st. petersburg, market changes have been moderate and no significant rises in prices and rents have been observed yet. yield requirements
have decreased somewhat from the previous year.




sponda's operations and property assets 1 january -
31 december 2011
sponda owns, leases and develops business properties in the helsinki metropolitan area and the largest cities in finland, and in russia.
sponda's operations are organised into four business units: investment properties, property development, russia, and real estate funds. the
investment properties unit is divided into three segments: office and retail properties, shopping centres and logistics properties. the other
segments are property development, russia and real estate funds.


net operating income from all of sponda's property assets totalled eur 179.4 (168.7) million during 2011. office and retail properties accounted
for 52 per cent, shopping centres for 18 per cent, logistics properties for 16 per cent, russia for 11 per cent and the real estate funds unit for
3 per cent.


on 31 december 2011, sponda had a total of 200 properties, with an aggregate leasable area of approximately 1.5 million square metres. some
51 per cent is office and retail premises, 11 per cent shopping centres and 35 per cent logistics premises. 3 per cent of the leasable area of the
properties is located in russia.


the fair values of sponda's investment properties are confirmed as a result of the company's own cash flow based yield value calculations. the
assessment method complies with international valuation standards (ivs). the data used in the calculations of fair value is audited, at a
minimum, twice annually by external experts to ensure that the parameters and values used in calculations are based on market observations.


at the end of 2011, an external consultant assessed the values of sponda's investment properties in finland and in russia. the change in fair
value of the properties in 2011 was eur 39.0 (40.5) million. the positive change in the value in finland was mainly due to changes in market
rents and yield requirements. the fair value of investment properties is assessed in finland by catella property oy and in russia by cb richard
ellis. the statements of the property assessments conducted in finland and russia are available on sponda’s website. the changes in fair
values are itemised in the table “valuation gains/losses on fair value assessment”.

sponda calculates the growth in rental yield for its properties according to epra best practices recommendations by using a like-for-like net
rental growth formula based on a comparable property portfolio owned by the company for two years. like-for-like net rental growth was 3.1 per
cent for office and retail premises, 8.4 per cent for shopping centres, 2.1 per cent for logistics premises and 10.5 per cent for properties in
russia. all of sponda’s lease agreements in finland are tied to the cost of living index.


the economic occupancy rates (%) by type of property and geographical area were as follows:

the expansion project of the zeppelin shopping centre in the oulu region was completed on schedule at the beginning of november 2011. the
project added some 4,000 square metres of new retail space for the prisma hypermarket and 4,700 square metres of space for specialty retail.
the new premises built in the shopping centre are fully occupied. the 15 per cent development margin target for property development projects
was exceeded.


in the citycenter project, the construction of the second phase has been completed. the office building inside the citycenter block was
completed in summer 2011 and granted leed® gold environmental certification. construction of the third and final phase of the project
comprising the retail premises on the keskuskatu is proceeding according to plans. the entire citycenter refurbishment project is expected to be
completed in 2012. the project budget was increased by eur 5 million, which is shown as a negative change in the fair value in the income
statement. the increased costs are due to realised changes, increase in construction costs and the prolongation of the project according to an
earlier decision. the total investment value of the project is estimated at approximately eur 130 million.


sponda purchased an office and retail property in central tampere for approximately eur 10 million. an additional investment of approximately
eur 6.5 million will be made to modernise the property. the retail spaces of the property are already completed and were taken into use in
november 2011. the majority of office spaces are also completed and taken into use. the property is almost fully occupied.


sponda is developing an office property in the ruoholahti district of helsinki with total floor space of approximately 6,000 square metres. over 70
per cent of the building will be leased to the primary tenant, talentum plc. construction of the office building has begun and the project is
scheduled for completion in april 2013. the project's total investment value is estimated at some eur 23.5 million.

centre with a total area of 55,000 m² and a total investment of approximately eur 200 million. the decision to begin work has not yet been

the change in value of russian properties in 2011, totalling eur 20.2 million, was primarily due to changes in the yield requirements resulting
from evaluation carried out in the second quarter and the changes in market rents during the year.

western realty (ducat ii) property in moscow and the ooo adastra property in st petersburg, where the leases are for longer periods than
average. the average length of sponda's lease agreements in russia on 31 december 2011 was 2.4 (2.9) years, with lease agreements expiring

short-term risks related
to sponda’s operations                        risk management actions

fall in economic occupancy rate               sponda’s property portfolio is mainly located in helsinki’s city centre and the ruoholahti district. the company
                                              spends approximately 1-1.5 per cent of the property portfolio value on modernisation investments each year.
                                              sponda will place more focus on rental operations.

decline in tenants’ solvency                  sponda carries out regular checks to monitor tenants’ solvency and changes therein. most tenants submit a
                                              security deposit corresponding to 3 to 6 months’ rent at the start of their tenancy. the company has a diverse
                                              tenant base representing a wide variety of sectors.

availability of financing                     sponda reorganises maturing loans in a timely manner. when the financial market is tightening up, the
                                              company refinances loans well before their maturity. sponda’s next major refinancing needs will arise in 2014.
                                              at the end of 2011, sponda’s available credit limit stood at eur 440 million.

                                              sponda reduces its interest rate risk through fixed-interest loans and interest rate derivatives.
interest rate risk

special features of the russian property      sponda receives half of its russian rental revenue in us dollars and half in roubles. most of the rent payments
market and exchange rate fluctuations         made in roubles are tied to the us dollar or euro exchange rate. the exchange rate risk arising from the use of
                                              the rouble is reduced by the fact that a significant portion of the company’s own expenses in russia is also
                                              paid in roubles. sponda hedges a six-month cash flow from russia. the company’s investments in russia are
                                              mainly funded in euros from the parent company balance sheet.




environmental responsibility
improving the energy efficiency of buildings is an essential element of the eu climate and energy strategy, which aims for a 20 per cent decrease
in the energy consumption of new buildings by 2020. improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions plays a key role in
achieving that aim, as construction activity and energy consumption during the use of buildings together represent over 40 per cent of final
energy consumption. in 2021, all new buildings must meet near zero energy standards.


as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy consumption of a building, co-operation between the landlord and tenant is of
crucial importance in reducing energy consumption. every day nearly 30,000 people work in premises owned by sponda, which means that even
small acts can result in major changes. sponda strives to reach the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients.
energy efficiency is an important consideration in all of the company's property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance
operations. sponda also encourages its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of
properties. the company also provides guidance to its clients on energy efficiency and environmentally friendly building use.


the 2012 objectives related to environmental responsibility are described in the spondability section under “improving energy efficiency and
reducing the carbon footprint” and "material efficiency".

    events after the close of the financial year

    directors for the annual general meeting to be held on 20 march 2012. more detailed information on the proposal is available under the heading

    prospects
    sponda expects the vacancy rates of its investment properties to rise slightly in 2012. this view is based on the slowing down of the global
    economy, the uncertainty of conditions for business operations and expiring agreements known to sponda.


    the comparable net operating income (excluding any property disposals) of 2012 is expected to increase moderately compared to 2011. this is
    based on property acquisitions and the completed property development projects in 2011.

 epra niy and "topped-up" niy

 the epra net initial yield niy and "topped-up" niy represent the annual net yield on investment property on the date of closing the books.

 the annual computational net yield is the annualised rental yield for the month of closing the books adjusted by the effect of known rent increases on the
 following year's yield deducted by the predicted 12-month maintenance costs of comparable properties.

 the annual computational adjusted net yield is calculated by making an adjustment to the annual computational net yield in respect of the annualised effect of
 rent-free periods and graded rents for the coming year.

accounting policies for the consolidated financial
statements
basic information

sponda is a leading real estate investment company that owns, leases and develops office, retail and logistics properties in the major cities of
finland and russia.


the parent company of the group is sponda plc, a finnish public limited company domiciled in helsinki. its registered office is korkeavuorenkatu
45, 00130 helsinki, finland.


at its meeting on the 3rd of february 2012, the board of directors of sponda plc has approved these financial statements for publication.
according to the finnish limited liability companies act, shareholders may approve or reject the financial statements at the general meeting of
shareholders to be held after their publication. the meeting may also decide to amend the financial statements.


copies of the group’s financial statements can be obtained from sponda plc, korkeavuorenkatu 45, 00130 helsinki, finland and on the internet
at www.sponda.com.



basis of preparation

the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) applying the
ias and ifrs standards and sic and ifric interpretations endorsed for use in the eu and in force on 31 december 2011. the term
‘international financial reporting standards’ refers to standards and interpretations of these in finnish accounting legislation and provisions
based on this approved for applying in the eu in accordance with the procedure established in eu regulation (ec) 1606/2002. the notes to the
consolidated financial statements also comply with the provisions of finnish accounting and corporate legislation that supplement the ifrs
provisions. sponda also complies with the recommendations of the european public real estate association (epra) (www.epra.com).


the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros and are presented in millions of euros rounding to the nearest 0.1 million.
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment properties, investments in real estate funds
and certain financial instruments, which are measured at fair value. all figures have been rounded, so the sum of the individual figures may differ
from the total amount presented.


the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires management to exercise judgment. their judgment affects the
choice of accounting policies and their application, the amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses to be reported, and the notes. in its
judgments, management uses estimates and assumptions that are based on earlier experience and management’s best understanding on the
balance sheet date, especially concerning future developments in the property market. the most significant area in which sponda’s management
has exercised its judgment is in determining the fair value of investment properties. the use of estimates and assumptions is described in more
detail in the section ‘accounting policies requiring management’s judgment and key sources of estimating uncertainty’.


the group has adopted the following revised or amended standards from 1 january 2011 onwards. the revised and amended standards had no
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.


revised ias 24 related party disclosures (applicable to financial periods beginning on or after 1 january). the definition of a related party has
been clarified and certain provisions relating to disclosures by state-controlled entities.


improvements to ifrs, may 2010 (mainly applicable to financial periods beginning on or after 1 july 2010). minor and non-urgent amendments
to the standards made through the annual improvements procedure are compiled and enforced once a year.

revisions and amendments to standards or ifric interpretations that took effect in 2011 in addition to the ones specified above did not have any
effect on the consolidated financial statements.



principles of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements include the parent company and all companies in which the parent company has control. a controlling
interest arises when the group holds more than half of the voting power or when the group holds the right to control the company’s business and
financial principles in order to extract benefit from its operations.


ifrs 3 (business combinations) is applied to acquisitions in which a business is acquired. mutual in-group holdings have been eliminated by the
acquisition method. the consideration transferred and the detailed assets and accepted liabilities of the acquired company are measured at fair
value. goodwill is recorded as the sum of consideration transferred, interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree and previously held
interest in the acquiree minus the fair value of the acquired net assets.


acquisitions that do not fall within the definition of a business are recognized as acquired assets.


the classification by sponda of individual acquisitions of investment properties as acquired assets is based on the view that a single property
and its lease agreements do not form a business entity; the real estate business also requires marketing and development activities for
properties, management of tenancies, and management of property repairs and renovation. acquisitions of investment property classified as
assets do not involve the transfer of business processes or employees.


the results of subsidiaries sold during the financial period are consolidated until the date that control in them ceases. subsidiaries acquired
during the financial period are consolidated from the date that control commenced.


joint ventures and mutual real estate companies whose shares carry entitlement to control over specified premises, and in which the group’s
holding is less than 100 percent, are consolidated in the group’s financial statements row by row in proportion to the group’s holding in these
companies as jointly controlled assets, in accordance with ias 31 (interests in joint ventures). the consolidated financial statements contain the
group’s share of the assets, liabilities, gains and losses of joint ventures.


subsidiaries that are not mutual real estate companies are consolidated using the purchase method. the share of profits and equity belonging to
external shareholders is shown as minority interest.


associated companies are companies in which the group exercises considerable influence, i.e. when the group has more than 20% but less
than 50% of the votes or the group otherwise exercises considerable influence but does not have a controlling interest. they are consolidated
using the equity method. the group’s share of the results of associated companies is presented as a separate item in the income statement.


all intragroup transactions, receivables, liabilities and profit distributions are eliminated.



translation of foreign currency items

the figures concerning the financial performance and position of the group’s business units are measured in the currency in the main business
environment of each unit (“business currency”). the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, which is the business and
presentation currency of the group’s parent company.



transactions denominated in foreign currencies

transactions carried out in foreign currencies are recorded in the business currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. receivables
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the exchange rate at the year-end. non-monetary items denominated
in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate on the transaction date, except for items valued at fair value, which are translated into
euros using the exchange rates on the valuation date.

gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and from translating monetary items are recorded under financial
income and expenses in the income statement. exchange rate gains and losses from business operations are included in the relevant items
above operating profit.


the revenue and expense items in the comprehensive income statements and separate income statements of foreign group companies are
translated into euros using the average rate for the financial year, and balance sheets using the rate on the balance sheet date, which gives rise
to a translation difference that is recorded in the balance sheet in shareholders’ equity, and the change in this is recorded in other comprehensive
income. translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition cost of foreign subsidiaries and from equity items accumulated after
acquisition are also recorded in other comprehensive income. translation differences from selling a subsidiary are recorded in the income
statement under capital gains or losses.



investment properties

investment properties are properties held by the company for the purpose of earning rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. sponda
measures its investment properties using the fair value method, as stated in ias 40, investment property, under which the profit or loss from
changes in fair values is recognized through profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred.


investment properties are valued initially at acquisition cost, including transaction costs in measurements after the initial recognition, the fair
value is used. the fair value is the sum of money for which the property could change hands between parties who know the business, wish to
carry out the transaction and are independent of each other. if a reliable market price is not available, the value can be determined using
discounted cash flows.


the fair value of completed business properties is calculated by sponda itself using the discounted cash flows method (dcf). cash flows are
calculated over a period of at least 10 years. net cash flows in the period and the terminal value are discounted from the end of each accounting
year to the assessment date. the terminal value is calculated by capitalizing the net cash flow of the year following the most recent accounting
year with the required yield (gordon growth model). the discount rate is determined by adding the expected long-term rate of inflation to the
required yield. the yield is based on sponda’s own assessment of the market situation and on information from published sources including kti
finland (institute for real estate economics).


potential gross income is based on current lease contracts and, in the case of vacant premises, on estimated market rent levels. potential gross
income per property is adjusted annually by the estimated long-term vacancy rate taking into account any special aspects related to the property
itself and the status of the lease contract. the estimated impact of inflation is calculated on maintenance expenses and on market and contract
leases.


the value of non-developed sites and unused but usable building rights is determined using the sales price method.


sponda’s internal property assessment process, calculation methods and reporting are audited by an external valuer and are considered to fulfil
the valuation criteria of the ifrss and ivs (international valuation standards) as well as the aka (finnish authorized real estate auditors) criteria
for good property valuation practice. in addition to auditing, sponda also commissions at least twice a year an external valuer to examine the
material used in calculating the market value of the property portfolio, in order to confirm that the parameters and values used are based on
market indications.


an investment property is derecognized from the balance sheet when it is divested or taken permanently out of use. gains and losses on sales of
investment properties are presented as a separate item in the income statement.



investment properties for development

the acquisition cost for an investment property built by the company itself consists of the construction costs, capitalized borrowing costs and
other costs accumulated by the completion date.


development projects in which a new building or extension to a building is being constructed and that are unfinished at the balance sheet date
are valued in accordance with ias 40 investment properties at fair value.

the risk arising from the incomplete state of the property - which refers to the risk relating to construction costs, the construction schedule,
financial costs and the yield requirement of the potential buyer of the unfinished property – is taken into account when determining the fair value
of an unfinished property by not recognizing the risk-weighted portion of the margin to be obtained on the property corresponding to the
remaining construction time. all other risks relating to the unfinished property, including those relating to the leasing of the property, are taken
into account in the same way as when valuing other investment properties.



investments in real estate funds

sponda owns and manages through real estate funds holdings in retail, office and logistics properties. the investments in real estate funds
contain these holdings. investments in real estate funds are measured at fair value. the change in fair value is recorded in the income statement
under “valuation gains/losses on fair value assessment”.


an external consultant assesses the fair value of properties held by the real estate funds at least once a year.



property, plant and equipment

property, plant and equipment comprises land areas, office premises, equipment and furniture in company use, other tangible assets and
advance payments and incomplete acquisitions. these are valued at their original acquisition cost, less accumulated depreciation and possible
impairment losses, adding capitalized costs related to modernization work.


the properties, office equipment and furniture and vehicles used by the company itself are depreciated over their useful lives.


useful lives of property, plant and equipment:


office premises used by sponda                                       100 years

office machinery and equipment                                       3–20 years

office machinery and furniture, vehicles                             10 years




goodwill and other intangible assets

goodwill is recorded as the sum of consideration transferred, interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree and previously held interest
in the acquiree minus the fair value of the acquired net assets. goodwill is not amortized but tested annually or more often for impairment.


for impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units which are expected to obtain synergy benefits from combining business.


if there is any indication of impairment, the recoverable amount is allocated to the cash generating unit to which the goodwill belongs, i.e. in
sponda to the above mentioned development projects. the recoverable amount is compared to the unit’s carrying amount and an impairment
loss is recognized if the recoverable amount is smaller than the carrying amount. the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement and
it cannot be reversed at a later date. testing is described in more detail in the section "accounting policies requiring management’s judgment and
key sources of estimating uncertainty".


other intangible assets include computer software recorded at acquisition cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years.



trading properties

trading properties are properties that are meant for sale and which do not correspond to the company’s strategic targets owing to their size,
location or type. trading properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. net realizable value is the estimated selling price
in the ordinary course of business, less the direct costs resulting from completion of the sale. the net realizable values are mainly determined
using the market value method. if the net realizable value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized.

                                                                                                              annual report 2011        financial statements




all sponda’s trading properties were acquired in the kapiteeli acquisition.


when a trading property becomes an investment property that is measured in the balance sheet at fair value, the difference between the fair
value on the transfer date and its previous carrying amount is recognized in the profit or loss under profit/loss on sales of trading assets.



impairment of assets

at each balance sheet date the group assesses the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. if
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. with respect to goodwill, the recoverable amount is always estimated annually
regardless of whether there are indications of impairment or not.


the recoverable amount is the fair value of the asset less cost to sell. impairment losses are recognized in the income statement when the
carrying amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount. an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in circumstances
and the recoverable amount of the asset has increased after the date when the impairment loss was recognized. an impairment loss is not
reversed, however, to an extent higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized in
prior years. impairment losses recognized for goodwill are never reversed.



financial assets and liabilities

in accordance with ias 39 financial instruments: recognition and measurement, sponda group’s financial assets are classified as follows:
financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. correspondingly
financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit and loss and financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost. financial assets and liabilities are classified on the basis of the purpose for which they were acquired and on the original
acquisition date. financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value based on the consideration received or paid. transaction costs are
included in the original carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities for items that are not measured at fair value through profit and loss. all
purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on the transaction date.


financial assets are derecognized from the balance sheet when the group has lost the contractual right to the cash flows or when it has
transferred a significant part of the risks and yield outside the group.


financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss contain assets held for trading. held for trading financial assets have been
acquired mainly to obtain profit from short-term changes in market prices. held for trading assets include derivatives to which hedge accounting,
as described in ias 39 financial instruments: recognition and measurement, is not applied. financial assets held for trading and that mature
within 12 months are included in other current assets. the items in this category are measured at fair value and the fair value of all the
investments in this category is determined on the basis of publicly quoted prices or generally accepted option pricing models. realized and
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are
incurred.


payments relating to loans and receivables are fixed or determinable, they are not quoted on the active market, and the company does not hold
them for trading purposes. this category includes the group’s financial assets that have been obtained by handing over cash, goods or services
to a debtor. they are valued at amortized cost and are included in current or non-current financial assets, in non-current assets if they mature in
more than 12 months time. the group recognizes an impairment loss for an individual receivable if there is objective evidence that the receivable
will not be recovered in full.


available-for-sale financial assets are assets that are not part of derivative assets and have been specifically allocated to this category or have
not been allocated to any other category. they belong to non-current financial assets if it is planned to keep them for more than 12 months from
the balance sheet date, otherwise they are included in current financial assets. changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are
recognized in other comprehensive income and are presented in the fair value reserve after tax. changes in fair value are taken from equity to
the income statement when the investment is sold or its value has fallen so that an impairment loss has to be recognized. the group had no
available-for-sales financial assets on the balance sheet date.


financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit and loss are financial liabilities held for trading. the held for trading category also
includes derivative instruments to which hedge accounting, as described in ias 39, is not applied. financial liabilities held for trading that mature

                                                                                                           annual report 2011        financial statements




within 12 months are included in other current liabilities. the items in this category are measured at fair value and the fair value of all the
investments in this category is determined on the basis of publicly quoted prices or generally accepted option pricing models. realized and
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are
incurred.


financial liabilities measured at amortized cost include the group’s financial liabilities that are initially recognized at fair value, taking transaction
costs into account. the financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. financial liabilities
are included in non-current and current liabilities and they can be interest-bearing or non-interest-bearing.



derivative instruments and hedge accounting

sponda uses derivative contracts mainly to hedge its interest rate risk exposure. interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments for
future interest flows and the group applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain such contracts when they meet the hedge accounting criteria
under ias 39.


the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps is recognized in equity to the extent that hedging is effective. the ineffective (non-qualifying)
portion of the hedging is recognized immediately in financial items in the income statement.


should an interest rate swap used as a hedging instrument mature, be sold or terminated prematurely, but it is highly probable that the hedged
cash flows will be realized, the gains and losses accrued from the derivative contracts remain under equity until they are realized, at which point
they are recognized in the income statement. if it is no longer highly probable that the hedged cash flows will be realized, the gains and losses
accrued from the derivative contracts are taken immediately from equity to financial income and expenses in the income statement.


derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recognized through profit and loss. they are measured at fair value and changes
in their fair value are recognized in the income statement.



borrowing costs

borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.


borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalized as part of the cost
of the asset. for sponda, capitalized borrowing costs are costs arising from loans taken for property development construction projects or the
costs calculated for construction projects multiplied by a financial costs factor, if a separate loan has not been taken out for a construction project.
the financial costs factor is the weighted average interest rate for sponda group’s interest-bearing loans during the fiscal period, which is
determined each quarter.



cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank deposits that can be raised on demand, and other short-term extremely liquid investments.
items classified as cash and cash equivalents have a maturity of less than three months from the acquisition date.



equity

equity shares are presented as share capital. costs relating to the issue or acquisition of sponda’s own shares are presented as a deductible
item under equity. if sponda plc repurchases own equity instruments, the acquisition cost of such instruments is deducted from equity.



hybrid bond

an equity bond (hybrid loan) is a bond that is subordinated to the company’s other debt instruments but is senior to other equity instruments. the
interest on a hybrid loan is paid if the annual general meeting decides to pay a dividend. if a dividend is not paid, the company decides
separately on whether to pay the interest. unpaid interest accumulates. hybrid loan holders have no control over the company and no right to

vote at shareholders’ meetings.



provisions

a provision is recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an
outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. long-
term obligations are discounted to their net present value.


provisions are made for compensation relating to land-use agreements; for costs arising from property demolition; and for soil restoration costs
for properties where it is known or suspected that the soil is contaminated in the area because of earlier activity. provisions are also recognized
for obligations arising from disputes in progress when the settlement of the obligation is probable.



leases, the group as a lessor

property leases are classified as operating leases when the risks and rewards incidental to ownership remain with sponda.


when the risks and benefits incidental to ownership have been substantially transferred to the lessee, a property lease is classified as a finance
lease. in that case the parts of the properties covered by the finance lease are recognized as finance lease receivables in the balance sheet at
the commencement of the lease term in an amount that equals the net investment in the lease, i.e. the present value of the minimum lease
payment plus the present value of the non-guaranteed residual value.


the leases collected by sponda are total leases, separate capital and maintenance leases, or leases indexed to the lessee’s net sales.
maintenance costs associated with the property are either included in the lease or they remain the responsibility of the tenant, depending on the
contract. leases are linked to the cost-of-living index. leases are either signed for an indefinite period or are fixed-term.



leases, the group as a lessee

those leases in which the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the lessor are treated as operating leases. leases paid by sponda based
on operating leases are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. the group has no finance leases.



revenue recognition principles

sponda’s revenue mainly consists of rental income from its investment properties, fund management fees and interest income.


total leases as well as separate capital and maintenance leases are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. rental income tied to the tenant’s net sales are recognized on the basis of the tenant’s actual sales. fees paid for lease assignments are
allocated over the lease term.


fees paid for fund management are allocated to the financial period during which the service has been provided.


interest income is recognized using the effective interest rate method and dividend yield in the period in which the entitlement has occurred if the
dividends are disclosed at this point. if not, they are recognized at payment date.



total revenue

in sponda, total revenue includes rental income and charges for consumption, interest income on finance leases and the fees for managing the
real estate funds.

expenses

expenses include maintenance expenses and direct fund expenses. maintenance expenses are maintenance and annual repair costs arising
from the regular and continuous maintenance of the properties and are recognized immediately in the income statement.



net income

net income is defined in the group as the net amount after deducting expenses from total revenue.



operating profit

in the group, operating profit is defined as the net amount after adding other operating income to net income, then deducting sales and
marketing expenses, administrative expenses and other operating expenses, the group’s share of the results of associated companies and
amortization of goodwill, and then adding/deducting gains/losses from the disposal of investment properties, from assessment at fair value, and
from the disposal of trading properties.



employee benefits

the group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. contributions made for defined contribution plans are recognized in
the income statement for the year to which they relate. pension costs incurred from the group’s defined benefit pension plans are computed
using the projected unit credit method, i.e. the pension costs are expensed in the income statement by spreading the cost over the service lives
of the employees based on calculations prepared by qualified actuaries.


actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss by the projected unit credit method for the remaining service of individuals to the
extent to which they exceed the higher of the following: 10% of the pension liability or 10% of the fair value of assets.


sponda has had long-term executive incentive schemes since 2006, and key individuals within these schemes are entitled to a bonus determined
on the basis of defined targets. the bonus in 2006–2009 was determined based on one-year reference periods and the scheme in force from the
beginning of 2010 involves two 1-year reference periods, years 2010 and 2011, and two 3-year reference periods, years 2010–2012 and
2011–2013.


the payment of the bonus is conditional upon the achievement of set performance targets and the person’s continued employment in the
company. taxes and statutory employer’s contributions are deducted from the bonus, and the remaining sum is used to acquire sponda’s shares
from the market. these shares may not be surrendered during a commitment period following the reference period, which is two years for the
1-year reference period and three years for the 3-year reference period.


the incentive schemes are accounted for as equity-settled share-based business transactions and recorded as personnel expenses on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period. the counter-entry for the part paid in shares is taken directly to retained earnings.



income tax

income tax expense in the income statement consists of the current tax and changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities. the tax payable by
group companies for the period is calculated using the taxable profit as determined in accordance with local legislation. the tax is adjusted for
any taxes related to prior periods.


deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for all temporary differences between the book values and values for tax purposes of assets
and liabilities, apart from the initial recognition of acquisitions of individual assets as referred to in ias 12.15b, for which no deferred tax is
recorded. a deferred tax asset is also not recorded where the fair value of an individual asset falls below the acquisition cost and a corresponding
deferred tax liability has not been recorded for the original acquisition. in sponda these acquired assets are typically investment property
acquisitions which do not meet the criteria of business entities and are therefore classified as assets.

    the most significant temporary difference in sponda is the difference between the fair values of the investment properties and their carrying
    amounts for tax purposes. the carrying amount for tax purposes is the value of an asset in a property company. other temporary differences
    arise, for example, from the measurement of financial instruments at fair value and unused tax losses. deferred taxes are calculated using the
    tax rates enacted by the balance sheet date.


    changes in deferred taxes are recognized in the income statement apart from when they are related to items recognized as crediting or debiting
    shareholders’ equity or to other comprehensive income items. a deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future
    taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.



    earnings per share

    undiluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, adjusted by
    the interest expenses of the hybrid loan, by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.



    new or amended ifrs standards and interpretations

    the iasb has published the following new, revised and amended standards that have not yet been approved for application in the eu. the
    standards have not yet been adopted by the group. they will be adopted on the date they become effective, or in the event that their effective
    date is not the first day of a financial year, at the beginning of the financial year following the effective date. other published amendments to
    standards or interpretations are not expected to affect future consolidated financial statements.


    ias 12 income taxes (amendment, effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 january 2012). ias 12 previously required an entity to
    evaluate what proportion of the carrying amount of an asset recognised at fair value on the balance sheet will be recovered through use (e.g.
    rental revenue) and what proportion through sale. under the amendment, recovery of the carrying amount of investment properties valued at fair
    value will normally happen through sale. in the event that the amendment to the standard is adopted in the eu in its current form, it will have a
    significant effect on the deferred taxes recorded on investment properties on sponda's consolidated financial statements.


    ias 1 presentation of financial statements (amendment, effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 july 2012): the most significant
    change concerns the grouping of other comprehensive income items based on whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss at a
    later date, subject to certain conditions being met. the amendments only affect the presentation of the consolidated financial statements.


    ias 19 employee benefits (amendment, effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 january 2013): the amendment requires
    immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income items, discontinuing the use of the corridor method and
    measuring finance cost based on net interest. discontinuing the use of the corridor method will have an effect on the calculation of the group's
    benefit schemes, but the group does not expect the effect to be significant.


    new and revised standards governing the preparation of consolidated financial statements (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1
    january 2013):


•     ifrs 10 consolidated financial statements
•     ifrs 11 joint arrangements
•     ifrs 12 disclosure of interests in other entities


    ifrs 10 defines control as the key factor in determining whether an entity should be included in consolidated financial statements and provides
    additional instructions for defining control in circumstances where its assessment is difficult. ifrs 11 emphasises the importance of the rights
    and obligations arising from joint arrangements in accounting rather than the legal structure of such arrangements. the standard also requires
    the equity method to be used in reporting on joint ventures in place of the previously allowed proportionate consolidation method. ifrs 12 covers
    the disclosure of information regarding interests in other entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, special purpose entities and
    unconsolidated structured entities. the effects of the new standards on the consolidated financial statements will be assessed in future periods.


    ifrs 13 fair value measurement (effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 january 2013): ifrs 13 includes requirements on fair
    value measurement and the disclosure of related information in financial statements. the standard does not extend the use of fair value, but

provides a framework for situations where another standard requires or permits fair value measurements. the new standard is expected to have
some effect on the consolidated financial statements, mainly in the form of new notes to financial statements.


ifrs 9 financial instruments (and amendments, effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 january 2015): the new standard, which
will be published in three phases, is intended to replace ias 39. the first phase simplifies the measurement of financial assets: financial assets
will be divided into two categories, those measured at amortised cost and those measured at fair value. the majority of the ias 39 provisions on
financial liabilities have been included in the new standard in their existing form. the effects of the new standard on the consolidated financial
statements will be assessed in future periods.



accounting policies requiring management’s judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

sponda’s management exercises judgment when taking decisions about the choice of accounting policies for the financial statements and their
application. this concerns in particular situations in which the ifrs standards have alternatives for recognition, measurement or presentation.


the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with ifrss requires management to some extent to make estimates and assumption
that affect the recognition of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. the estimates and assumptions are based on earlier experience and the
best understanding on the balance sheet date. actual results may differ from the estimates.


in sponda, management’s judgment, estimates and assumptions mainly concern the fair value measurement of investment properties,
impairment testing for goodwill, recognition of deferred taxes and provisions.


determining the fair value of investment properties using the discounted cash flows method is a key element in the financial statements, and
requires significant management estimates and understanding especially concerning future developments in yield requirements, market rental
rates and occupancy rates. the fair value of investment properties reflects, among other things, the rental income based on existing leases as
well as reasonable and well-founded estimates of future rental income made by knowledgeable willing parties in the light of current conditions. it
also reflects expected future cash payments related to each property in question. the yield requirement is determined for each property taking
into account the property-specific risks and the market risk. the discount rate is determined by adding the expected long-term rate of inflation to
the required yield.


impairment testing for goodwill relates to the goodwill allocated to certain development projects planned in the helsinki metropolitan area that
came with the kapiteeli acquisition and are in the property development unit. impairment testing requires management’s judgment concerning
the costs during construction and the fair value of an investment property when it is completed and is transferred to the category of completed
investment properties.


before starting a project, the fair value at completion of the investment property being developed is determined using the 10 year discounted
cash flows method with the same variables and parameters as for the fair value of completed investment properties. rental income is based
either on leases made in advance with future tenants or on management estimates of future rents and occupancy rates. management assesses
the accuracy of the calculations by testing for impairment. if there is indication of changes in the estimates and assumptions due to the market or
other reasons, the calculations are revised to correspond to the best understanding at the moment of testing. the sensitivity of the yield
requirement is also assessed.


management also checks that the construction costs for the project stay within the prepared cost estimate. if there are indications of a rise in
costs or of other causes as a result of which costs may be exceeded, the values are updated.


deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for all temporary differences between the book values and the carrying amounts for tax
purposes of assets and liabilities, apart from the initial recognition of acquisitions of individual assets as referred to in ias 12.15b, for which no
deferred tax is recorded. a deferred tax asset is also not recorded where the fair value of an individual asset falls below the acquisition cost and a
corresponding deferred tax liability has not been recorded at the time of the original acquisition. management has exercised judgment such that
individual acquisitions of investment properties at sponda are classified as acquired assets, since a single property and its lease agreements do
not form a business entity. to constitute a business entity they would require related marketing and development activities as well as
management of tenancies, property repairs and renovation. acquisitions of investment property classified as assets do not involve the transfer of
business processes or employees.

the most important temporary difference in sponda is the difference between the fair values of the investment properties and their carrying
amounts for tax purposes. the carrying amount for tax purposes is the value of the asset in the property company. other temporary differences
arise, for example, from tax losses carried forward, provisions and financial instruments. a deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilized. it may
become necessary to decrease the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if future taxable income differs from the estimate.

 1. segment information

 segment information is presented according to the group's operational and geographical segments. the primary form of segment reporting is based on
 operational segments.

 operational segments are based on the group's internal organisational structure and internal financial reporting. segments are based on different types of
 business premises and services as well as geographical areas. results and the fair value changes of properties are reported to sponda's board of directors
 and executive board according to the following segments: office and retail properties, shopping centres, logistics properties, property development, real
 estate funds and russia.

 the president and ceo is paid a full salary. the salary and fees paid to sponda plc's president and ceo totalled eur 506,000 (2010: 478,000). in addition,
 during the period the president and ceo was paid a bonus of eur 383,000 (2010: 285,000) under the incentive scheme, based on the company's actual
 performance in 2010.

 the members of sponda plc's board of directors are paid an annual fee and a fee for each meeting attended for the term ending at the 2012 annual general
 meeting. 40% of the annual fee is paid in the form of sponda plc shares acquired on the market. the chairman of the board was paid eur 73,000 for the year
 (2010: 74,000), the deputy chairman eur 49,000 (2010: 49,000) and the other members of the board, in total, eur 173,000 (2010: 178,000).

 the president and ceo and the members of the company's executive board, altogether seven persons, also participate in the long-term share-based
 incentive scheme for top management introduced on 1 january 2006. the first incentive scheme covered the period from 2006 to 2008. the company also had
 an incentive scheme with the same terms in effect for the 2009-2011 period, but the board of directors of sponda plc decided to revise the incentive scheme
 adopted in 2009 by extending the vesting periods. the extension will take effect in stages by 2012, reducing the proportion of one-year vesting periods each
 year and increasing the proportion of new three-year vesting periods correspondingly. the purpose of the incentive scheme is to link the objectives of
 shareholders and key personnel to increase the company's shareholder value, increase the commitment of key personnel to the company and offer them a
 competitive bonus scheme based on share ownership.

 the new scheme comprises two one-year vesting periods, which are the 2010 and 2011 calendar years, and two three-year vesting periods, 2010-2012 and
 2011-2013. the incentive scheme's criteria are tied to cash flow from operations per share and return on investment. the board of directors determines the
 targets for each vesting period separately.

 the bonuses, less taxes and other employer contributions, are used to purchase company shares for the person on the open market. the shares may not be
 disposed of within a set period of their receipt. the duration of this period is two years for the one-year vesting periods and three years for the three-year
 vesting periods. the personnel covered by the scheme also have a continued obligation to hold shares received under the scheme at a minimum amount
 corresponding to their gross annual salary for the duration of their employment in the company.

 the maximum annual fee under the incentive scheme is the recipient's gross annual pay at the time of payment. gross annual pay refers to fixed basic salary
 excluding annual performance bonuses and the long-term incentive scheme.

 the bonuses payable based on the 2010 and 2010-2012 vesting periods correspond, at a maximum, to the value of 684,471 shares in sponda plc (including
 the cash component of the bonuses). the bonuses payable based on the 2011 and 2011-2013 vesting periods correspond, at a maximum, to the value of
 473,377 shares in sponda plc (including the cash component of the bonuses).

 management’s pension obligations and termination benefits

 the president and ceo of sponda plc is entitled to retire on reaching 63 years of age and his pension is determined in accordance with the employee
 pensions act (tel).

 the director's agreement stipulates the period of notice for the president and ceo as six months. in the event of the company terminating the director's
 agreement, the president and ceo is entitled to compensation equal to 12 months' pay.

 the members of the executive board are insured with a contribution-based group pension insurance. sponda plc makes an annual insurance payment until
 the member of the executive board reaches the age of 63 years. in addition, the members of sponda’s executive board are entitled to participate in a
 voluntary group pension scheme. under the terms of this scheme the accrued savings may be withdrawn between the ages of 60 and 65 or as a
 supplementary pension in addition to the individual’s statutory earnings-related pension. the pension contribution amounts to approximately 7.5% of a
 person's annual pay.

 properties using the fair value method, under which changes in fair values are recognized through profit and loss. the value of each investment property is
 calculated by sponda itself. sponda's property portfolio in finland was assessed in the first, third and final quarters of the year by catella property oy. the
 properties in russia were assessed in the first quarter by cushman & wakefield -stiles & riabokobylko and in the third and final quarters by cb richard ellis.
 the value of each property has been assessed separately.

 statements on the assessments of value for properties in both finland and russia are available on sponda's website at

 the group’s most significant investment commitments arise from the following properties:

 in the citycenter project, the construction of the second phase has been completed. at the same time the leed® gold environmental certification for its office
 building was completed in the summer of 2011. construction of the third and final phase of the project comprising the retail premises on the keskuskatu is
 proceeding according to plans. the entire city-center refurbishment project is expected to be completed in 2012. the revised project budget was increased by
 eur 5 million, which is shown as a negative change in the fair value in the income statement. the increased costs are due to realised changes, increases in
 construction costs and the prolongation of the project according to an earlier decision. the estimated total investment value of the project is some eur 130
 million.

 sponda purchased an office and retail property in central tampere for approximately eur 10 million. an additional investment of approximately eur 6.5
 million will be made to modernise the property. the retail spaces of the property are already completed and were taken into use in november 2011. the
 majority of office spaces are also completed and taken into use. the property is almost fully occupied.

 sponda is developing an office property in the ruoholahti district of helsinki with total floor space of approximately 6,000 m². over 70% of the building will be
 leased to the primary tenant, talentum plc. construction of the office building began in august 2011 and the project is scheduled for completion in april 2013.
 the estimated total investment value of the project is some eur 23.5 million.

 sponda is carrying out development projects for the ratina shopping centre in tampere and related areas. the current plans are for a shopping centre with a
 total area of 55,000 m² and a total investment of approximately eur 200 million. the decision to begin has not yet been made.

 the acquisition of kapiteeli oy in 2006 resulted in goodwill of eur 27.5 million being allocated to certain planned development projects, which were
 considered to have great potential for increase in value upon completion. some of these were completed in 2008. the goodwill allocated to the completed
 projects was written down corresponding to the change in fair value during 2008 and it had an impact on the result of eur -13.0 million. goodwill and related
 writedowns were entirely allocated to the property development segment.

 the remaining eur 14.5 million of goodwill has been tested by comparing the future cash flows of the asset containing goodwill to the carrying value of the
 goodwill. cash flows have been discounted using an interest rate of 8.80% (2010: 9.24%). based on the impairment testing, there is no need for further
 writedowns on goodwill.

 before starting a project, the fair value at completion of the investment property being developed is determined using the 10 year discounted cash flows
 method with the same variables and parameters as for the fair value of completed investment properties. rental income is based either on leases made in
 advance with future tenants or on management estimates of future rents and occupancy rates. management assesses the accuracy of the calculations by
 testing for impairment. if there is indication of changes in the estimates and assumptions due to the market or other reasons, the calculations are revised to
 correspond to the best understanding at the moment of testing. the sensitivity of the yield requirement to change is also assessed.

 management also checks that the construction costs for the project remain within the prepared cost estimate. if there are indications of a rise in costs or of
 other causes as a result of which costs may be exceeded, the values are updated.

 financial risk management

 the purpose of sponda's risk management is to minimise the unfavourable impacts of changes in the financial markets on the company's profits and cash
 flow. sponda plc’s board of directors decides on the goals for risk management, defines the risk management policy and is responsible for monitoring risk
 management. the company’s treasury unit identifies and assesses risks and is responsible for practical risk management measures within the framework of
 the risk management policy. the internal audit is responsible for checking the effectiveness of the risk management system. regular reports are made to the
 board on financing. sponda’s main financial risks are the interest rate risk, risks concerning access to financing, the credit risk and the exchange rate risk. the
 group’s financing activities are centrally handled by its treasury unit, which is responsible for financial risk management.

 1. interest rate risk

 the group mainly uses floating rate loans in financing its operations, and these are the source of the company’s interest rate risk. the company may also use
 fixed-rate loans. the group uses interest rate derivatives to reduce growth in future interest flows caused by a rise in short-term market rates. with interest
 rate swaps sponda pays a fixed-rate interest and obtains floating-rate interest. interest rate options are bought.

 according to the risk management policy, the aggregate nominal value (hedging rate) of the group’s fixed-rate loans with a maturity of more than one year and
 of the interest rate derivatives used to manage interest rate risk must be at least 60% and at most 100% of the group’s interest-bearing liabilities. the group’s
 hedging rate on 31 december 2011 was 77 (84) %. the duration of the interest-bearing debt portfolio must be at least one year. the duration of the group’s
 portfolio was 2.2 (2.2) years.

 derivative contracts have been made for the purpose of hedging the loan portfolio and they are valued in the financial statement at fair value. the fair value
 represents the result if the derivative position had been closed on the balance sheet date. the fair values presented are based on assessments by the
 counterparty banks. in addition, sponda plc checks the assessments using assessing methods that are generally available on the market. the fair values and
 nominal values of interest rate derivatives are presented in note 31.3.

 interest rate derivatives have been defined as cash flow hedging or as derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. sponda applies group
 hedging, in which the behaviour of the loan portfolio is compared with the interest rate derivative portfolio. the interest rate derivative portfolio is divided into
 interest rate options and interest rate swaps. in addition sponda may use forward rate agreements and interest rate futures, to which hedge accounting is not
 applied.

 at the time of closing the books, sponda applied hedge accounting to all interest swap agreements. the interest swap agreements mature in 2012-2016,
 during which time also the interest flows resulting from the interest swap agreements will be realised. the hedging efficiency between the loans hedged in the
 financial year 2011 and the hedging instruments was very good. the inefficient portion of interest swap agreements included in hedge accounting is recorded
 in a manner affecting the result. hedge accounting was not applied to interest rate limit options bought. the change in the current value of interest rate limit
 options is also recorded in a manner affecting the result.

 net losses/gains for the period recognised in other comprehensive income items are presented under consolidated statement of comprehensive income. more
 information on their recognition is available in the section on accounting principles. hedge accounting is applied to interest derivatives satisfying the ias 39
 criteria for hedge accounting throughout their maturity.

 sponda plc analyses its interest rate position by simulating changes in market interest rates. the treasury unit calculates a forecast of interest expenses for
 the coming year and its interest rate sensitivity. the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity to change in interest rates:
 – the short-term market rates at the stated balance sheet date change by one percentage point
 – the calculation includes interest-bearing liabilities eur 1,761 million (1,573)
 – the calculation includes current derivative contracts eur 1,537 million (1,423)

 the calculation aims to measure the impact of short-term market rates on the interest expenses of the company’s loans and correspondingly on the interest
 income to be obtained from interest rate derivatives or on the interest costs to be paid in the following year. the figures are presented net. the financial
 instruments used in the calculation are accounted for in accordance with the ifrs definitions mentioned in the company’s accounting principles for the
 financial statements. the interest rates used are the official interest rates quoted on the last banking day on the balance sheet date.

 in its 2011 financial statements sponda plc applied hedge accounting to 63% of interest rate derivatives, compared to 58% in 2010. in the sensitivity analysis,
 changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives to which hedge accounting is not applied are presented in full through profit and loss. the group’s interest-
 bearing liabilities decreased during 2011 by about eur 182 million.

 2. liquidity and refinancing risk

 the group seeks to continuously assess and monitor the amount of financing required by its business operations to ensure the sufficiency of liquid funds for
 financing purposes and to repay maturing loans. the risk related to access to finance is reduced by making financial contracts with several financial sources
 and using a variety of financial instruments. the group seeks to spread the maturity of its new borrowings so that as loans mature, the amount needing
 refinancing each year remains stable. the group's single largest creditor represents approximately one fifth of the group's total interest-bearing liabilities. the
 group's largest creditors are nordic banks with which the company has a long-term customer relationship. sponda expects to be able to renew the loans that
 fall due. notes 31.4 and 31.5 show the maturity analysis based on the group’s agreements. the average loan period of the group’s loans on 31 december,
 2011 was 3.1 years (31 december, 2010: 3.2 years).

 for short-term financing purposes, the company uses a commercial paper programme. the size of the commercial paper programme is eur 350 million. the
 group's loans maturing in 2012 total some eur 375 million, of which a bond maturing in may represents eur 219 million. the remainder of the loans
 maturing in 2012 are loans from financial institutions. if the company so desires, it can pay off the debts maturing in 2012 by, for example, withdrawing long-
 term credit limits with a total unwithdrawn amount at the time of closing of the books that was eur 440 million (425). there is still strong interest in the
 company’s commercial papers, which is why the company aims to keep the commercial paper volume issued approximately at the current level.

 the group assures its liquidity with sufficient credit limits and bank account limits. the credit limits also provide a reserve for the commercial paper
 programme. unused long term credit limits totalled eur 440 million on the balance sheet date. in 2011, the company replaced the credit limit of a eur 200
 million loan that was originally due to mature in 2012 with eur 100 million and eur 50 million long-term limits. in addition, the group had unused account-
 based limits for a total of eur 10 million. according to the financing policy confirmed by the board of directors, cash surplus is invested in the market in short-
 term financial instruments or bank savings. on 31 december 2011, the group’s cash and cash equivalents totalled eur 26.4 million (27.0).

 in addition, the risks relating to access to finance are reduced by maintaining the company’s reputation as a trustworthy debtor. sponda’s financial contracts
 contain normal covenants to protect the creditors, which concern for example the equal status of financiers, certain financial indicators, and the use of
 collateral. the most important covenants used are:

 - the interest coverage ratio (ebitda/net interest cost) for which the minimum acceptable ratio is 1.75. the ratio on the closing date was 2.7 (3.0).

 - the equity ratio, for which the set minimum ratio is 28%. on the closing date the equity ratio stood at 38% (39).

 - the group was not in breach of covenants during the financial year.



 3. credit risk

 credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a contract fails to fulfil their obligations as given in the contract. the group’s most significant credit
 risks at the balance sheet date arose from investments in the money markets, from derivative contracts, and from rent receivables and trade receivables. the
 group has no major concentrations of receivables or credit risks.

 to avoid risks from counterparties, the group uses only financially solid banks with a good credit rating as counterparties in its money market investments and
 derivative contracts. the banks’ credit rating must be classified as at least a- by s&p (or a similar credit rating company). sponda plc may invest in the
 commercial papers issued by well-known, financially solid companies operating in finland. sponda plc’s board of directors decides on acceptable
 counterparties, on counterparty limits and on the permitted financial instruments. in derivative trading, sponda plc observes the stipulations given by isda
 (international swaps and derivatives association, inc.) or the finnish bankers association with counterparties. the maximum amount of the credit risk is the
 carrying amount of the financial assets and the positive fair value of derivatives, and details of the combined total of these (eur 59.3 milion) are given in note
 31.1.

 the risk arising from tenants is managed by analysing the creditworthiness of tenants before leases are signed, by requiring rent deposits, and by the monthly
 collection of rent. the business units responsible for leasing properties are responsible for arranging collateral for rents. the maximum amount of the risk is the
 total carrying amount of the receivables less the amount of the collateral. total collateral for rents received amounted to eur 37 million. collateral for rent is
 primarily in the form of bank deposits or bank guarantees. collateral is not, however, required for separately approved counterparties such as the finnish state
 or municipalities. collateral received in fulfillment of lease obligations may be used to cover the company's receivables without hearing the tenant on the
 matter. ovenia oy monitors the group’s rent receivables.

 the total amount of rent receivables on the balance sheet date was eur 3.2 million. the total rent unpaid for more than three months was eur 1.3 million.
 the group recorded credit losses of eur 1.1 million for rent receivables in 2011. the group recognises a final credit loss when a tenant is found to be without
 means in the debt collection process or when the company’s share of a bankruptcy is confirmed. the group uses well-known external debt-collection firms to
 collect receivables.

 the collateral for a selling price receivable is almost always a real security. the real security for selling price receivables is typically real estate mortgages for
 the sold property or shares. at the time of closing the books, the group had sales price receivables in the amount of eur 1.4 million. the total sales
 receivables at the time of closing the books excluding rent receivables was eur 2.1 million. the group considers the risk related to sales receivables as low. a
 maturity analysis of all sales receivables is presented on the table in note 24.

 in addition the company has given guarantees as security for the commitments of the property companies it owns. the guarantees are typically guarantees
 relating to the construction phase of a new company, in which the beneficiary is almost always the city. the amount of the guarantees (eur 3.6 million) is
 small in proportion to the carrying amount of the companies owned. the guarantees given are not expected to cause significant costs to the group.




 4. currency risk

 the group has international operations in russia. changes in the exchange rate between the russian rouble and the euro and between the us dollar and the
 euro may affect sponda group’s financial position and operations. the group is exposed to currency risk since balance sheet items for foreign subsidiaries
 and revenue and expenses from properties are translated into the business currency of the parent company, into euros.

 sponda's russian companies receive their rents monthly in us dollars, in russian roubles or in euros. the companies pay most of their expenses in russian
 roubles. usd-denominated net cash flows from lease agreements are some usd 18 million (usd 14 million) annually and rub-denominated net cash flows
 some rub -34 million (rub -5 million). in accordance with the board's decision, sponda hedges foreign currency denominated future net cash flows for a
 period of six months. the company may use currency denominated forwards, options and currency swaps in hedging. one currency derivative will mature and
 be renewed in each month during the next six months, so that a total corresponding to the net position for six months is always effective.

                                                                                                                  annual report 2011          financial statements




 on the balance sheet date the company had currency options to the value of usd 9 million to hedge the usd net cash flows. the difference between
 incoming cash flows denominated in russian roubles and outgoing rouble-denominated expenses is minor, so it has not been considered necessary to hedge
 this net cash flow. in accordance with the board's decision, sponda does not hedge the translation risk from russian companies. if the exchange rate between
 the euro and the usd changed 10 per cent from the closing date, the change in the fair value of the currency options would be recognized through profit and
 loss in full. if the euro weakened 10 per cent against the usd, this would reduce the result by some eur -0.5 million and if the euro strengthened 10 per cent
 against the usd, this would improve the result by some eur +0.4 million. with the the currency derivative maturing each month, the company can sell cash
 flow of some usd 1.5 million based on rental income, and this would have the opposite effect on the result to that of the currency option.

 the group uses internal euro loans for the financing of investments in russia.

 in 2011, the company issued a sek 650 million bond. in addition, the company converted existing euro denominated loans into sek loans in 2011 for a total of
 eur 265 million (sek 2,405 million). the loans were converted into sek because of permanent cost savings. all sek denominated loans are hedged against
 exchange rate risks by means of interest rate and currency swap agreements. the net amount of the unrealised exchange rate differences of the sek
 denominated loans and the current value of unrealised interest rate and currency swap agreements hedging the loans may vary during the duration of each
 agreement. the changes in profit caused by the unrealised exchange rate differences and unrealised changes in current value decreases over time and
 reaches zero on the due date. the sek cash flows received from the interest rate and exchange rate swap agreement cover all future cash flows of the sek
 currency loans and capitals due on the due date

 the company does not apply hedging according to ias 39 to currency derivatives. the changes in the current value of currency derivatives are recorded in the
 income statement.



 5. managing the equity structure

 the objective of managing the group’s equity structure is to optimise the equity structure in relation to prevailing market conditions at any particular time. the
 goal is an equity structure that best assures conditions for the group’s long-term strategic operations.

 factors affecting the group’s equity structure, in addition to the result, include capital expenditure, asset sales, acquisitions, dividend payments, equity-based
 facilities and assessment at fair value. the group's key covenant in credit arrangements is the equity ratio. the company's equity ratio must always be greater
 than 28%. in the event that equity ratio approaches the 28% limit, the company will carry out arrangements to boost equity. the company's equity comprises
 an equity bond (hybrid loan) that improves the company's equity ratio. the nominal value of the hybrid loan is eur 130 million and it is recorded in the balance
 sheet under 'other equity reserve'. more information on the hybrid loan is provided in the accounting principles. the company aims to distribute a dividend of
 approximately 50% of the period's cash flow from operations per share, taking into consideration the aforementioned equity ratio target and the company's
 business development. the group's capital structure is also guided by the value of the interest cover ratio covenant. interest cover ratio is determined by the
 ratio between ebitda and net interest expenses, with gains from sales deducted and losses on sales added. changes in the value of property assets are also
 included in the calculation and depreciation and amortisation are deducted. the interest cover ratio must be greater than 1.75.

 sponda plc's board of directors has set the group's long term equity ratio target at 40%. on 31 december, 2011 the group's equity ratio was 38%, compared
 to 39% at the end of 2010. sponda's interest cover ratio on 31 december, 2011 was 2.7. in 2010 the interest cover ratio was 3.0. sponda group’s interest-
 bearing liabilities increased during 2011 by eur 182 million and at the end of the year totalled eur 1,755 million. sponda group sold property assets during
 2011 for altogether eur 9 million. the funds received were used to pay off loans and finance property development investments. the formula for calculating
 the equity ratio is shown in the annual report under ‘calculation of financial ratios’.



 the group's capital structure and equity ratio were as follows:

 the company has entered into interest rate derivatives to hedge the loan portfolio and currency derivatives to hedge the currency risk. hedge accounting is
 applied at the closing date only to interest rate swaps.

 interest rate and currency swaps are used to hedge the exchange rate risk related to loans denominated in swedish krona. the nominal values of interest rate
 and currency swaps are identical with the nominal values of the loans hedged.

 derivatives are valued in the financial statements at fair value. the fair value represents the result that would have arisen if the derivative position had been
 closed at the balance sheet date. the fair value is calculated in the manner generally approved in the market. sponda uses an external valuer for valuations.
 currency options include an equal amount of call and put pairs of currency options.

accounting principles for the parent company
accounts
the financial statements of sponda plc have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the finnish accounting act, the finnish
companies act and the finnish securities market act.



measurement and timing principles

contractual improvements


costs arising from renovation work for individual tenants are entered as an annual expense or capitalized to other long-term expenditure of the
landlord, sponda plc. repair costs and tenant improvements are capitalized over the duration of the lease when they generate income in several
accounting periods. for open-ended leases, costs are capitalized over the period until the date that is defined in the lease agreement as the first
possible termination date.



fixed assets and straight-line depreciation


fixed assets are valued at cost less straight-line depreciation. straight-line depreciation on machinery and equipment and on buildings and
building materials is calculated using the declining balance method. renovation costs related to tenant improvements and capitalized to other
long-term expenditure are depreciated over the lease period.


other machinery and equipment 3–10 years


in addition to capitalized tenant improvements, other long-term expenditure includes computer software and renovation of the business premises
occupied by sponda plc itself.



investments


property investments are shares in subsidiaries and associated companies, loans granted to group companies and associated companies,
investments in real estate funds and other investments. investments are valued at cost in the parent company’s balance sheet. permanent
writedowns are deducted from cost.



research and development costs


the company has no research activities. building project costs equivalent to r&d costs are capitalized when the technical implementation of the
project is completed and the project can be considered to generate income over a period of several years. otherwise research and development
costs are entered as an expense.



financial assets, liabilities and derivative contracts


financial assets and non-interest bearing debt are recognized at cost. interest-bearing debt is measured at amortized cost using the effective
interest rate method. interest rate swap contracts made to hedge the risk exposure associated with long-term loans are not entered in the
balance sheet but instead are listed in the notes to the financial statements. interest arising from these contracts is recognized in the income
statement as it is incurred.

                                                                                                        annual report 2011    financial statements




as an exception to the above, the derivatives implemented to hedge against the exchange rate risk and interest rate risk of the sek denominated
loans are valued at fair value according to section 5, chapter 2a of the finnish accounting act. the change in fair value is recorded as an
income or expense in the income statement. the fair value represents the result if the derivative position had been closed on the balance sheet
date. external valuations are used for valuation.



extraordinary income and expenses


extraordinary income and expenses consist of group contributions.



income tax


income tax includes tax in the period and adjustments to taxes for previous periods. the current tax expense is based on taxes calculated on the
result for the period and tax rules. no deferred tax liabilities or credit are entered in the parent company balance sheet.



foreign currency denominated items


transactions denominated in foreign currency are recognized at the exchange rate on the transaction date. balance sheet items in foreign
currency outstanding on the closing date are valued at the exchange rate on the closing date.



other principles


the group has arranged statutory pension insurance for its personnel with a pension insurance company. the pension costs are entered as an
expense in proportion to salaries.


fees arising from leasing assignments are recognized over the duration of the leasing contract. interest payable during construction projects in
progress are entered as an expense. the group has no significant finance leases.

 proportion of one-year vesting periods each year and increasing the proportion of new three-year vesting periods correspondingly. the purpose of the

auditor's report
this document is an english translation of the finnish auditor’s report. only the finnish version of the report is legally binding.


to the annual general meeting of sponda plc


we have audited the accounting records, the financial statements, the report of the board of directors, and the administration of sponda plc for
the year ended 31 december 2011. the financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of financial position, income statement,
statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, as well as the parent company’s balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes to the financial statements.



responsibility of the board of directors and the managing director


the board of directors and the managing director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and
fair view in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu, as well as for the preparation of financial
statements and the report of the board of directors that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the
preparation of the financial statements and the report of the board of directors in finland. the board of directors is responsible for the
appropriate arrangement of the control of the company’s accounts and finances, and the managing director shall see to it that the accounts of
the company are in compliance with the law and that its financial affairs have been arranged in a reliable manner.



auditor’s responsibility


our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements, on the consolidated financial statements and on the report of the board of
directors based on our audit. the auditing act requires that we comply with the requirements of professional ethics. we conducted our audit in
accordance with good auditing practice in finland. good auditing practice requires that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements and the report of the board of directors are free from material misstatement, and whether the
members of the board of directors of the parent company and the managing director are guilty of an act or negligence which may result in
liability in damages towards the company or have violated the limited liability companies act or the articles of association of the company.


an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the report of
the board of directors. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation of financial statements and report of the board of directors that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control. an
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and the report of the board of directors.


we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.



opinion on the consolidated financial statements


in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of
the group in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) as adopted by the eu.

company’s financial performance and financial position in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of the financial
statements and the report of the board of directors in finland. the information in the report of the board of directors is consistent with the
information in the financial statements.



other opinions


we support the adoption of the financial statements. the proposal by the board of directors regarding the treatment of distributable funds is in
compliance with the limited liability companies act. we support that the board of directors of the parent company and the managing director
be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.
