    ceo message




    greetings to the respected stakeholders!
    2013 has been a year in which the korean economy highly dependent on export and import experienced many difﬁculties caused by domestic and
    overseas events, , such as the reduced consumer spending, lukewarm growth of employment rate, and a decrease in corporate investment, due to
    the prolonged international recession.

    despite these difﬁculties, kyobo life strived to accomplish its business policy of “innovation of insurance coverage to customers and advance-
    ment of proﬁt generation” through the hard work of all its employees. we focused on achieving our long-term goal of becoming the company that
    “provides the best insurance coverage to customers” by 2015. as a result, kyobo life became more competent in creating proﬁt and maintaining
    ﬁnancial soundness and subsequently earning greater level of trust from you. i am deeply grateful for our stakeholders’ unfailing trust and faith in
    kyobo life and give them all the credit for allowing us to achieve what we have until today.

    kyobo life values human life and believes that their values should be respected and realized. in this respect, kyobo life is presenting its fourth edi-
    tion of the sustainability management report titled, the “people and future.” this is to put in practice the basic process of listening to the stake-
    holders, focusing on their needs, delivering the pledges we made every year after listening and focusing with our utmost sincerity and sharing the
    results and progresses with all of you, the stakeholders.

pledge: we will become a company that is good at providing insurance coverage to customers.
the continued promotion of the “lifelong care project” started in 2011 to boost our competitiveness in providing insurance coverage to custom-
ers improved the quality of our insurance service, throughout all processes, including subscription, persistency, and payment, resulting in earning a
higher grade in the customer complaint evaluation by the financial supervisory service. this grade, however, is still not as high as we wish it to be:
we will work harder to listen to the various opinions of customers and swiftly apply them to our service policies.


pledge: we will become a company that succeeds together with its financial planners.
we accepted the requests of financial planners aspiring to become the expert in providing insurance coverage to customers and built training cen-
ters that offer programs that will help them develop the ability to design insurance coverage and sell and service the insurance policies. in addition,
i, the ceo, myself frequently visited the ﬁelds of sales service and gathered their suggestions for improvements for better communication, to pro-
vide a greater opportunity to the financial planners and support their development into the experts.


pledge: we will become a company that grows together with its employees.
we endeavored to cherish our human resources and build a company where employees are rewarded according to their performance and sup-
ported for their growth, so that they would enjoy working for the company. to this end, we strengthened our training on the marketing of insur-
ance to help employees better understand the life insurance business, and promoted the rotation and expansion of positions to provide greater
opportunity for the employees to develop their careers.


pledge: we will become a company that is attractive to investors.
kyobo life has consistently increased its investment in long-term bonds in anticipation of prolonged low interest rates and focused on securing
a steady ﬂow of proﬁt by increasing investment in high-yield assets within the limit of manageable risk. as a result, kyobo life earned an a+ rat-
ing from fitch ratings, one of the three major international credit rating agencies. kyobo life has also maintained a rating of a2 for six consecu-
tive years from moody’s and the aaa rating, the highest rating by nice rating, a korean credit rating agency, for seven consecutive years. we will
maintain the momentum of growth supported by a healthy proﬁtability, by securing new growth engines and more precise risk management.


pledge: we will become a company that grows together with the government and communities.
in order to materialize the sprit of neighborly love inherent in the insurance business, we labored to practice the wisdom of coexistence, focusing
on social contribution activities to help the less fortunate to overcome the difﬁculties caused by illnesses, ﬁnancial hardship and lack of education.
we will strengthen our partnership with expert and transparent nonproﬁt organizations and promote with them the projects that local communi-
ties need and at which kyobo life can excel.

kyobo life’s diligent work over the past year received much recognition, earning the top place among all life insurance companies for four consec-
utive years in the korean sustainability management competition sponsored by the ministry of commerce, industry and energy and korean stan-
dards association. we were also awarded the 2013 consumer grand award from the korean society of consumer studies and recognized as the
best family-friendly corporation. these accomplishments encourage us to faithfully and continually honor our pledges with stakeholders and push
ourselves to a higher standard.

additionally, kyobo life would like to express its enduring support of the 10 principles involving human rights, labor, environment and anti-corrup-
tion, suggested by the un global compact, as a member of the compact. the volatility of the global economy has risen higer than ever since the
global economic crisis. especially in the life insurance business, the negative spread due to prolonged low interest rate will have a negative impact
for the next several years. kyobo life, however, is determined to keep its business policy of growing together with all stakeholders under any cir-
cumstances, in pursuit of sustainable development. we will continue our journey to becoming “an admired company that will thrive for hundreds
of years to come” with the help of all stakeholders.

thank you.

     business overview and primary products
     the life insurance process can be organized into 3 stages: sign-up, retention, and payment. the sign-up stage involves a recommendation of the best plan
     for customers, meeting their needs and budget with detailed explanations. the retention stage involves the introduction of contract terms and future cov-
     erage details to customers and handling of related matters. in the event of a case calling for payment, the beneﬁts promised in the insurance contract will
     be paid to assist the customer to overcome ordeals during the payment stage. the premiums paid by customers are under stable management for a long-
     term basis. kyobo life entered into a total of 718 thousand cases of new contracts, provided retention service to 4,485 thousand customers, and paid 4.8
     trillion won in 1,829 thousand cases as of the 2013 ﬁscal year.

as of now. each director is selected through having their qualiﬁcations evaluated by the standards provided by the relevant industry regulations, and is
then appointed through the general meeting of shareholders. outside directors in particular are closely investigated by the outside director recommen-
dation committee regarding their expertise as well as their stake in the management; this fair and thorough screening is intended to increase the man-
agement’s transparency.

sustainability management framework
kyobo life’s sustainability management means “the fulﬁllment of our pledge to grow together with all stakeholders”. in last june’s regular meeting of
shareholders, the message of “the corporation pursuing long-term co-development with all stakeholders” was incorporated into the preface of the articles
of association. the executive conference room of the gwanghawmun headquarters has two incense burners: one of them is supported by three balanced
legs while the other one is tilted and in danger of collapsing because its three legs are all different lengths. this signiﬁes kyobo life’s resolve to carry out
sustainability management, keeping in mind that the continuous and stable growth of corporation requires the balanced growth of all stakeholders.

                                        after promoting the lifelong care project through 2013, a total of 2.19 million customers experi-

     third party assurance report
     messrs. kyobo life's board of directors and stakeholders

     foreword
     the korean standards association (hereafter 'assurance provider') was asked for an independent assurance request regarding its 'kyobo life 2013 sustainability
     management report (hereafter 'the report')'. the assurance provider provides an independent assurance opinion based on the data included in the report and the
     validity of the evidence related to performance and relevant systems. the assurance provider's responsibility is to provide to the board the results that came from
     the assurance procedures. the purpose of this assurance report is as follows: to investigate the existence of serious mistakes or prejudice in the report, to investi-
     gate whether or not the information collection system works, and to review the selection process and results of the sustainability management materiality test in
     order to provide opinions that can increase the quality of the report. the accountability for all assertions in the report as well as the collection, analysis, and organi-
     zation of data for publishing the report lies with kyobo life.


     independence
     the assurance provider does not have any common, proﬁt-related interests with kyobo life regarding its business activity except the tasks regarding the provision
     of the third party's assurance. as an independent assurance institution, we hold no other interest that may decrease our independence.

     assurance standards and levels
     with the aa1000as 2008 assurance standards at the core, the assurance provider has also applied gri g3.1 guidelines as well as iso 26000. we have identiﬁed the
     scope of inclusivity, materiality, and responsiveness according to the assurance standards of aa1000as 2008 as well as the credibility of the data that was included in
     the 2013 report. the credibility of the data included in kyobo life's sustainability management report was found to be of a 'moderate level' of assurance.


     assurance types and scope
     the assurance provider carried out type 2 assurance according to the aa1000 assurance standards (aa1000 as). type 2 assurance means that the exactness and
     quality of the sustainability management performance information and kyobo life's assertion were evaluated under the accountability principles of aa1000 2008
     assurance standards. the scope of assurance was during fy2013 (april 1st, 2013 to december 31st, 2013). the assurance provider has carried out assurance activ-
     ities regarding kyobo life's sustainability management policies, objectives, business activities, standards, and performances, mostly within their systems and activ-
     ities. we have also assured its environmental, social and ﬁnancial data relating to its broad sense of performance, and the involvement of the assurance provider
     regarding stakeholder participation was limited to the review of the materiality tests.


     assurance methods and performance
     the assurance provider has used the following methods to collect necessary information, data, and evidence related to the assurance scope, and has performed the
     assurance procedures.
     · reviews of the selection process of major issues used in sustainability management performance improvement and the report

     · analysis of major issues in sustainability management through benchmarking of companies in the same industries or those with excellent sustainability management

       announced data

     tify any grave mistakes or inappropriately written portions in the report through our assurance activities. the assurance provider has conﬁrmed that the report has
     an a+ application level of the international reports standards of the gri g3.1 guidelines, and would like to give the following opinion regarding kyobo life's sus-
     tainability management report.

inclusivity - has kyobo life included the stakeholders during its process of strategically dealing with sustainability management?
   the assurance provider has conﬁrmed that kyobo life has recognized the importance of core stakeholder participation within its pursuit of sustainability man-
   agement and is putting efforts into the creation of a participation process. it has selected core stakeholder groups such as customers, ﬁnancial planners, employ-
   ees, investors, government and local communities and has operated customized channels for each stakeholder trait, and we would like to speciﬁcally give credit
   to how the committee regarding sustainability management is operated so that collecting the board's opinions and supporting its decision-making process is
   carried out on a periodical basis. the assurance provider has not found a major group of stakeholders excluded from the participation process of stakeholders
   operated to promote kyobo life’s sustainability management.

materiality - has kyobo life incorporated material information so that stakeholders can make sound decisions?
   the report has examined the issues that need to be considered in the promotion of sustainability management through internal and external environmental
  analysis and drew major issues according to the core groups of stakeholders and 10 principles of sustainability management. the assurance provider has decided
  that kyobo life has not omitted nor excluded any important information from the stakeholders. as a recommendation, kyobo life should precisely complement
  the materiality test process so that it reﬂects daily tasks in the current business and sustainability trends that can create future value appropriately to promote
  kyobo life’s sustainability management strategies in connection with such issues.

responsiveness - has kyobo life appropriately responded to stakeholders' demands and interests in the report?
   the assurance provider has conﬁrmed that kyobo life has carried out diverse activities to appropriately respond to issues related to sustainability management
  and they were adequately stated in the report. it is worth noting that sustainability management tasks were reported by connecting them to pledges,
  principles, and kpis for individual stakeholders, and dma (disclosure on management approach) performances were reported in a time series devel-
  opment, which is worth highly positive remarks in that kyobo life continuously responds to stakeholder opinions and interests. as a recommendation,
  we believe that kyobo life lacks the connectivity between reporting issues to stakeholders and suggest building the structure of future stakeholders’
  expectations and demands, pledges (responsibilities), and accomplishing plans to publish reports based on stakeholders’ principles.


opinions by area and recommendations for improvement
in order for kyobo life to further pursue its company-wide sustainability management strategically and to create a basis for continued responses toward core issues, we
would like to give recommendations to review the following.


sustainability management processes
 - we think highly of kyobo life’s efforts in its promotion of company-wide sustainability management by establishing major sustainability management issues in
  terms of pledges to the core groups of stakeholders, principles, and kpis to produce and disclose results and future plans. we advise kyobo life to include global
  sustainability management trend issues in the selection of future reporting issues and engage in more in-depth communication with stakeholders to reﬂect their
  demands directly and publish the results in the reports for the completion of a two-way reporting process.

sustainability management results
 - kyobo life obtained an a+ credit rating from the fitch ratings for the ﬁrst time among domestic life insurance companies by maintaining a sound ﬁnancial structure.
  we advise kyobo life to publish objectives and rate of accomplishment in each ﬁeld to reveal their efforts in honoring their pledges with stakeholders in the reports.

 - in consideration of the promotion of ﬁnancial corporation’s sustainability from the point of esg, an explanation of the governance structure is essential. kyobo
  life’s sustainability management is based on the ceo’s strong resolve and the founder’s philosophy, which is different from other domestic corporations, and it is
  advisable to be more speciﬁc and to put more emphasis in the reporting and reporting standard of the governance structure.

 - kyobo life is not directly related to the industry dealing with greenhouse gas and energy, but is leading efforts to manage energy consumption and co2 emission.
  we hope to see kyobo life develop and manage quantitative indexes for the reduction of greenhouse gas as part of direct regulatory measures to strengthen its
  position as the leader in the ﬁeld of climate change.
