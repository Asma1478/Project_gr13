what’s next?

the future of sustainability



sustainability has so much meaning at hines. we think about our partners
who invest with us to produce returns for future generations of their own
beneficiaries. we think about our tenants and clients who are making the
environment a priority. we think about the 3,400 hines employees who rely
on hines to help sustain their own futures. we consider the communities in
which our projects are located and the lasting contribution they can make
to the creation of better cities. as we publish this third sustainability report,
i am proud to say that, for more than half a century, hines has championed
sustainable practices and technologies, proving, time and again, that a
sustainable approach to real estate makes good business sense and creates
better places for people.
at hines, and in the real estate industry in general, we have made great
progress in our journey toward sustainability. today, green building has
become more of the norm. yet, we know that green building certifications
alone cannot meet the environmental challenges we face today. we must
continue to evaluate and incorporate new technologies, find new ways to
capture and analyze data and continue to leverage our influence for the
benefit of the real estate industry as a whole. we can join together to make
even greater strides to improve the efficiency of the built environment and
create healthy, resilient places for people to live and work.
our sustainability report gives us a platform from which we can continue to
evaluate our progress and to ask questions like: what’s next for sustainability
in the built environment? how can we make advancements toward
sustainability on a greater scale? what new breakthroughs are needed in
technology and renewable energy? what is the next generation of green?
as always, we will make it a priority to lead this conversation, but we will also
listen and learn. we are asking ourselves at hines, and our stakeholders in the
industry, to take on this challenge with a sense of urgency and inspiration,
and to reach for an ever-greater commitment to sustainability.
please join this dialogue with us.
