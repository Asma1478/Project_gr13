            our reporting approach
            while integrating sustainability into sustainalytics’ planning is important, so too is the
            exercise of reporting on our successes and challenges. the process of sustainability
            reporting ensures that we track and manage sustainability issues appropriately, thereby
            enhancing their operational usefulness and insights. moreover, publishing a report such as

conflicts of interest
sustainalytics avoids entering into commercial relationships that might jeopardize the
company’s integrity and research independence.

in 2014, sustainalytics began updating its code of conduct. this was necessary, in part, to
ensure that regional codes were aligned and that a variety of policies and procedures were
aggregated. sustainalytics’ revised code was approved in q2 2015. sustainalytics continues
to focus on ensuring its implementation, including adherence to the process to be followed
if an employee believes a specific client relationship (or prospective relationship) presents
a potential conflict.

sustainable procurement
the environmental and social impacts of sustainalytics’ supply chain are not considered to
be significant. nevertheless, we make efforts to source responsibly and established a formal
sustainable procurement policy in 2014. the policy applies, at a minimum, to office supplies
and services, and food and drink associated with staff functions, at all of our offices globally.
our objective is to extend this policy to cover 100% of company purchases. operations
staff, who are responsible for purchasing, received training focused on how to recognise
and source sustainable products in their regions.

                                what’s next?
                                in addition to continuing to measure the key indicators highlighted in this report, in 2015
                                sustainalytics will focus on embedding sustainability metrics more effectively into our
                                strategic decision-making and management reporting systems. this will include efforts
                                to improve our data collection systems as well. sustainalytics will continue to build on its
                                commitment not only to measure and manage these issues, but to report more effectively
                                to our stakeholders.

                                one of the greatest challenges sustainalytics faces in the coming years is to measure, and
                                more meaningfully understand, the impact our work (directly and through our clients) has on
                                the economy, environment and society. we will strive to make progress in this area in 2015.
