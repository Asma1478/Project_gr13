                                  coexisting with environment and society
                                  since its founding, alpine has practiced contributing to society as a corporate
                                  philosophy, providing automakers and customers worldwide with mobile
                                  multimedia products such as car audio and car navigation systems to help make
                                  society and its members more affluent through worthwhile products.
                                   we believe that, as a manufacturer, a company is obligated to develop and
                                  provide products that meet customer needs while maintaining corporate
                                  awareness of such issues as environmental preservation. we are thus committed
                                  to manufacturing environment-friendly products, including the development of
                                  ecoproducts, the achievement of lead-free materials, and the implementation of
                                  green procurement using unique core technologies we have accumulated as a
                                  car products specialist.
                                   we thank our customers and vendors for their kind understanding of our
                                  approach and for their ongoing support.
                                  starting this fiscal year, we will change the activity report from an environmental
                                  report to a sustainability report to cover both environmental activities, including
                                  zero emissions, and our response to local community, compliance, and
                                  communication with customers.
                                   we will also launch a csr committee as a
                                  corporate organization to further approaches
                                  integrating       business   activities   with     those
                                  contributing to society.
                                  as a member of the alps group, alpine is working
                                  to promote efficient, sound corporate activities
                                  fulfilling our public and social obligations.

                                  and informative. we also hope that it will provide
                                  you   with    a    deeper    understanding       of   our
                                  environmental and social activities.                                         june 2006

                environmental policy
                in 1998, alpine established an environmental policy and implemented full-scale environmental
                preservation activities, based on the corporate philosophy contribution to society, which we have
                maintained since our founding. in 2003, we revised our conventional policy to further step
                up environmental preservation activities.

                                                         envi r on men t al policy
                                                                       main policy
                    our aim is to reconcile the often contrary goals of environmental friendliness and business
                    efficiency by keeping our operations fast,      light, and transparent as we fulfill our social
                    responsibilities as inhabitants and stewards of this planet.
                                                                     specific actions
                    1．fast − quickly answering the needs.
                        ① not only will we maintain domestic and international environmental standards,
                          we will take the extra initiative and responsibility to set and maintain new standards.
                        ② we will keep a close watch on trends throughout our society as well as the needs and wants of
                          our customers concerning environmental practices, and rapidly respond accordingly.
                    2．light − less weight, less waste.
                        ① we will develop products with full consideration of environmental safety and protection by decreasing the
                          weight, cutting down on use of harmful chemicals and improving resolvability.
                        ② we will conduct our day-to-day business operations putting a minimal burden on the environment-preventing
                          pollution, saving precious resources, recycling wherever possible, and decreasing the amount of waste.
                    3. transparent − communication and education.
                        ① regarding environmental practices, we encourage and support individual initiative in all our employees and
                          will actively educate them to improve their environmental awareness.
                        ② we also start environmental activities on our own initiative, harmonizing with the environment and with society.
                    4. practical plans for environmental preservation.
                        ① we will implement a company-wide comprehensive system for environmental protection/preservation and
                          promote continual reforms and technological renovations to those ends.
                        ② we will make concrete plans and achievable goals, and devote the
                          appropriate resources and funds necessary to realize them.
                                                                                                                                         april 1, 2003

                environmental management and implementation structure
                 in 1997, alpine set up the alpine environmental management committee, the top organization for
                 deliberating and controlling environmental problems throughout the alpine group.
                 we also set up the environmental management working group (wg) consisting of experts from
                 different fields to cope with today s increasingly complex environmental problems.

                   among the environmental burdens that directly affect the workplace,
                  the greatest is energy consumption and waste disposal.

                    to reduce greenhouse gases, mainly co2, alpine is working to
                   reduce electricity consumption. in 2005, we improve electricity
                   consumption nearly 7% although absolute consumption
                   increased due to business upscaling and introducing new
                   equipment.

               information disclosure

  alpine regards information disclosure as one of its most
 important corporate activities. we have made our
 environmental reports available on our website since 2002. in
 2004, we issued an environmental report disclosing more
 specific information so that more people could view our
 environmental preservation activities. you can also read our
 environmental reports on past and present issues on our
