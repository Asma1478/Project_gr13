1. ’cat a’ or category a are projects with potential significant adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented
2. ’cat b’ or category b are projects with potential limited adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible
   and readily addressed through mitigation measures
3. ’cat c’ or category c are projects with minimal or no adverse environmental and social risks and/or impacts
4. ’designation’ is split into designated and non-designated countries. designated countries are deemed by the equator principles to have robust environmental and social
   governance, legislation systems and institutional capacity designed to protect their people and the natural environment. non-designated countries are countries that are not
   found on the list of designated countries. the list of countries can be found on the equator principles website

additional notes on financial crime prevention data
the group has implemented, on a risk assessed basis, client and transaction screening processes to detect clients and
transactions which pose sanctions, money laundering or other related risks.
specialised automated transaction surveillance systems monitor customer transactions for aml purposes and generate
alerts. these alerts may, in turn, result in suspicious activity reports that are submitted to law enforcement authorities with whom
the group collaborates.

   company, and fred reichheld. standard chartered uses bain methodology                        source: standard chartered data
   recalibrated for financial services to calculate nps. in 2014, we began to move to
   a new methodology, progressively changing our sampling periods and method to
   create greater transparency, and benchmarking our nps against the overall market.
   nps gauges customer support for the retail banking products and services
   we provide. we ask our customers “how likely are you to recommend standard
   chartered to a friend or colleague?” and apply a 10-point scale where 10 is
   most likely. we then derive the nps by subtracting the percentage of detractors
   (those who score zero to six) from the percentage of promoters (those who score
   nine to 10). nps operates on a scale from –100 (all detractors) to +100 (all promoters)

additional notes on environment data
the emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014. this is to allow
sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results. accordingly, the operating income used
corresponds to the same period rather than calendar year used in financial reporting. this is consistent with international carbon
reporting practice.
‘measured’ data is collected from global environment management system (gems) properties, defined as all properties that are
over 10,000 square feet. the group’s pwc assurance report for measured scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions can be
found on page 20.
‘scaled-up’ data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the group’s occupied property
footprint (as at the end of the reporting period).
in accordance with guidance issued by the uk development for environment, food and rural affairs (defra) in 2014, we have
included scope 3 emissions with equivalent distance uplift from 2012, which is our baseline year. the group’s reporting criteria
can be found at sc.com/environmentcriteria.
on-site renewable energy generation is not included in the energy intensity calculation. all other forms of renewable energy
are included.
carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account.
total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.
net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas.
warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied
by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation.
scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 41 countries, based on seating class and distance flown.
as we operate largely outside of the uk, all flights domestic or international with flight distance <463km, labelled by defra
as ‘domestic flights’, have been classified as ‘short haul’. all flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled
by defra as ‘short haul’ have been classified as ‘medium haul’.
