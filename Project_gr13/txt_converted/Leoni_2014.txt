shareholders’ letter


2013 was a year of transition for leoni. in 2013 – after three years of growth in succession – we again gen-
erated a sales increase of nearly 3 percent to € 3.92 billion, thereby exceeding our original expectations. by
contrast, operating profit was, at a total of € 163 million, noticeably below the targeted figure of € 170 million.
given the difficult economic conditions in europe and the large number of forward-looking measures that
leoni launched in 2013, it is nevertheless reasonable to describe this as satisfactory performance.
     thanks to good automotive business in china and north america, from which the export-heavyweight
german manufacturers also benefited, worldwide demand from the car industry increased further despite                 dr klaus probst

weak business in europe. this more than compensated for the sales decline in our industrial business, which is
still mostly based in europe.
     at the same time, we invested in leoni’s future during this transition year. the wiring systems division
prepared for a large number of new product start-ups and model changeovers, which consequently incurred
substantial pre-production spending on development and capacity expansion. in the wire & cable solutions
division we forged ahead further with the internationalisation of our business and initiated a range of impor-
tant efficiency enhancement measures. in addition, there were necessary restructuring measures at facilities
of both divisions within and outside germany, which also weighed on our earnings. we were nonetheless able
to report a solid consolidated net profit of € 106 million. in keeping with the dividend policy that we have ap-
plied over many years, namely of paying out about one third, the management board and supervisory board
will propose a dividend of € 1.00 per share to shareholders at the annual general meeting.
     the unfavourable economic setting in europe, just as the extensive pre-production spending and measures
for future growth, confronted our staff with major challenges that they again mastered with flying colours in
2013. leoni employed about 62,000 people worldwide at the end of the year. on behalf of the management
board, i thank all staff for their strong performance and their great commitment.
     alongside our day-to-day business, we also in the past year launched numerous strategic projects to
enhance our global position, capacity to innovate, systems expertise and efficiency, which will underpin our
success in the years ahead:

■■   for instance, in line with our objective to globalise further, the wire & cable solutions division in 2013
     opened its first production facility in india, from which it will initially supply the automotive and petro-
     chemical industries in this region with cables and conductors. capacity to produce automotive cables in
     china and mexico was also extended further. the wiring systems division boosted its global production
     network with a new plant in northern china as well as with targeted expansion of facilities in mexico and in
     the significant production region of eastern europe. we furthermore successfully completed the turna-
     round of our subsidiary lws korea.

                      ■■   we also proved our ability to innovate in 2013 – above all with optimised wiring system architectures as
                           well as new insulation and conductor materials for automotive and industrial cables, which take into ac-
                           count not only cost factors, but increasingly also environmental aspects. the number of patents and utility
                           models registered in the past year was up by more than 60 percent on the previous year.

                      ■■   with the revised organisational structure of the wiring systems division, which focuses the wiring systems
                           business even more sharply on our customers, we improved our position for future growth.

                      ■■   in both of our divisions as well as in the group holding company we are currently working on several
                           projects to further enhance our efficiency; for example optimising business processes and it systems in the
                           wire & cable solutions division as well as standardising our most important hr processes worldwide.


                      solid financial foundations underpin the leoni group’s preparations for future growth. leoni secured the
                      refinancing due in 2013 as early as 2012 on favourable terms, as a result of which interest expense was down
                      from the previous year. at about € 257 million, net financial liabilities were up slightly on previous year; the
                      equity ratio rose to about 35 percent.
                           having taken all these measures, we regard ourselves as being well-equipped for the upcoming phase of
                      strong growth: for fiscal 2014 we project an initially moderate increase in consolidated sales to approx.
                      € 4.1 billion together with a significant rise in earnings to more than € 200 million. this will be accompanied by
                      a further rise in the number of new product start-ups and model changeovers in the wiring systems division,
                      which will not reach their full impact on sales and earnings until the subsequent years. in the wire & cable
                      solutions division we expect to see solid growth for both the automotive cables business and the industrial
                      sectors, especially so in america and in the bric countries.
                           our medium-term target remains the same; namely leoni plans to reach consolidated sales of € 5 billion
                      and a 7 percent ebit margin by 2016. thanks to the dynamic trend in the automotive sector, we are aiming
                      for strong, worldwide expansion of our business involving cables, cable harnesses and wiring systems for the
                      automotive and component supply industries as the core activity of both our divisions. the industrial business
                      represents the – likewise expanding – second mainstay with its focus on the capital goods, medical technol-
                      ogy, communications and infrastructure markets. across all of its business segments, leoni will be growing
                      above all in asia and america in order to achieve an even distribution of sales in the world’s three strongest
                      economic regions over the long term.

                                                                                                                 shareholders’ letter   |   5




leoni will gear itself to key global trends in the future as well. the showcase topic of this annual report is
devoted to the trend of greatest importance to us – namely mobility. from alternative drive technologies to
lightweight construction through to autonomous driving, from public passenger transport to the carriage of
goods and the required infrastructure: on the pages from 18 to 31 we show where we are heading and what
leoni will be contributing.
 all employees of the leoni group will continue to work with great commitment on mastering the growth
planned for this year and the upcoming ones. the same applies to the whole management board team, of
which dr frank hiller will become the fourth member from april 2014. dr hiller will take charge of the
wire & cable solutions division at the midyear mark so that i will spend more time on strategy implementati-
on as well as acquisitions.
 we would all be delighted if you, as shareholders in leoni ag, were to constructively support our work in
the future, too. many thanks for your confidence!

supervisory board report


leoni ag’s supervisory board again in fiscal 2013 dealt in depth with the situation and performance of the
group of companies during the past financial year. it conscientiously and diligently fulfilled its duties in
accordance with statutory requirements, the provisions of the company’s articles of association and its rules
of procedure, at all times standing at the management board’s side, providing advice as well as assisting and
monitoring its work.


constructive collaboration                                                                                                   dr werner rupp

the deliberations between the management board and the supervisory board were at all times construc-
tive, open and characterised by mutual trust. a key foundation for this was the fact that the management
board regularly, promptly and comprehensively informed the supervisory board about all matters pertinent
to leoni concerning strategy and planning as well as the group’s operating performance including its risk
situation, risk management and compliance. deviation in business performance from the prepared planning
and targets was explained in detail. the management board also at all times involved the supervisory board
immediately and early in decisions of material importance.
 to fulfil its duties, the supervisory board was provided with detailed written management board reports
in advance of its meetings. all topics, especially transactions requiring consent, were thoroughly discussed
during the supervisory board’s meetings. the management board and supervisory board also at all times
kept in close touch outside their scheduled meetings. among other activity for instance, the chairmen of the
management board and the supervisory board consulted on matters requiring agreement at short notice,
both regularly on a fixed day every month and also as warranted by events. the entire supervisory board was
comprehensively informed of the content of these discussions during its next meeting at the latest. there
were no conflicts of interest involving supervisory board members in relation to exercise of their office during
the period under report.


main topics of discussion on the supervisory board
the supervisory board held five regular meetings during the 2013 financial year, specifically on 19 march,
30 april, 18 july, 19 september and 5 december. the september meeting was held in sousse, tunisia to give
the members of the supervisory board deeper insight into the production of wiring systems and to provide
the opportunity to familiarise themselves with another facility of the leoni group. the supervisory board
had a quorum on each occasion. at three meetings one different member on each occasion had excused their
absence. all members of the management board attended each of the meetings so far as these did not cover
topics requiring that they absent themselves.
 the topics that were regularly discussed during the meetings in 2013 included current trends in the econo-
my and the business, which was marked on the one hand by the recession in the eurozone and above all by
weak demand from the capital good industry in the first half of the year. on the other hand, the international
automotive industry performed significantly better than expected, especially so in north america and china.
in addition, the effectiveness of risk management, financial, capital investment and human resource planning
as well as the operating targets were key agenda items during all of the meetings. during its meetings in
april, july and september the supervisory board also discussed the respectively pending quarterly and half-
year reports.

                                            in addition to these regular topics, the supervisory board dealt in depth with the annual financial statements
                                            for fiscal 2012 of leoni ag and the group during its meeting in march. after comprehensive deliberation, the
                                            board approved both sets of statements without any objections.
                                             on 30 april, the supervisory board discussed the topic of compliance in great detail. among other items in
                                            this context, a confidentiality agreement for staff of supervisory board members involved in the preparation
                                            of meetings was approved.
                                             the ‘factory of the future’ project was a key topic during the meeting on 18 july, which comprised submis-
                                            sion of a detailed report on the status of this groundbreaking leoni production facility that is being planned.
                                             during its meeting on 19 september, the supervisory board dealt in detail with budgeting for the upcom-
                                            ing years and analysed the impact of various economic scenarios on the future performance of the leoni
                                            group. in addition, the board decided to form a strategy committee that held two meetings in november and
                                            december together with the management board and closely examined the group’s corporate strategy. other

                    corporate-governance
                                            taken by other mdax companies.
                                             a key item on the agenda for the meeting on 5 december was the presentation of the corporate strategy
                                            and business planning for 2014 as well as medium-term planning by the management board, which the
                                            supervisory board examined in depth. following extensive discussion, the supervisory board approved the
                                            strategy and the planning. other topics concerned the declaration pertaining to the corporate governance
                                            code pursuant to article 161 of the german public companies act as well as reviewing the efficiency of the
                                            supervisory board’s work.
                                             the supervisory board’s meetings on 19 september and 5 december were both held partly without the
                                            management board members. on these occasions the board discussed personnel matters and, among other
                                            things, the management board compensation for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014 as well as the new compensa-
                                            tion systems planned for 2015 onwards.
                                             in a selection process that was at all times transparent both within the company and publicly, the superviso-
                                            ry board during its meeting on 5 december and after intensive preparatory work by the personnel committee
                                            appointed dr frank hiller as the fourth member of leoni ag’s management board effective 1 april 2014.
                                             on 1 july 2014, he takes over responsibility for the wcs division from dr klaus probst, who will in the future
                                            apart from his duties as ceo with a view to the group’s impending growth deal mainly with implementing the
                                            newly defined group strategy as well as with mergers & acquisitions.


                                            work of the committees
                                            leoni ag’s supervisory board formed five committees. they are the audit committee, the personnel com-
                                            mittee, the nomination committee and the strategy committee, which was newly set up in 2013. in addition
                                            there is the arbitration committee in compliance with article 27 (3) of germany’s co-determination act. the
                                            committees prepare the topics to be addressed by the entire supervisory board and the resolutions on which
                                            the board is to vote during its meetings. the respective committee chairpersons reported during the supervi-
                                            sory board meetings on the matters discussed by the committees and the outcome of their discussions.
                                             the audit committee met on a total of four occasions in 2013. it dealt in depth with the 2012 financial state-
                                            ments and consolidated financial statements, the management reports and the auditor’s report. in addition,
                                            it prepared for nomination of the auditors for the 2013 financial year and dealt in detail with the quarterly

                                                                                                 company information   |   bericht des aufsichtsrats   |   11




reports as well as the half-year report. other topics involved the effectiveness of the risk management and of
the internal control systems as well as preparing proposals for the further development of compliance within
the group.
 the personnel committee met five times during the past financial year, with the focus on the search for an
additional member of the management board and consultation on a new system for compensating manage-
ment board members in line with the german corporate governance code. in this connection, the committee
also discussed the level of management board compensation relative to that for senior management and
the workforce as a whole. the personnel committee also discussed the other amendments to the corporate
governance code.
 the nomination committee met on two occasions together with the personnel committee during the
latter’s july and september meetings and supported the personnel committee above all in selecting a new
management board member.
 the newly formed strategy committee also met twice together with the management board to deal in
depth, in accordance with its rules of procedure, with the strategy of the leoni group and of the business
divisions. following comprehensive discussion, the committee approved the corporate strategy presented by
the management board.
 convening of the arbitration committee pursuant to article 27 (3) of germany’s co-determination act was
not required in fiscal 2013.


corporate governance and declaration of conformity
as has already been illustrated by the description of the board’s principal topics of discussion, the supervisory
board again in 2013 thoroughly examined corporate governance at leoni. the guideline in this respect was
the german corporate governance code, the amendments to which and their impact on the leoni group the
supervisory board considered in detail. the declaration of conformity pursuant to article 161 of the german
public companies act was adapted.
 with one exception, leoni fulfilled all the recommendations and suggestions of the corporate governance
code in its current version. the exception involves the new stipulation for management board compensation,
which recommends, among other things, that when determining the compensation for management board
members, the level of compensation relative to that for senior management and the workforce as a whole,
also over time, should be taken into consideration. however, leoni’s supervisory board does not deem a
rigidly prescribed proportionality based on fixed reference amounts to be expedient. details concerning this
decision are contained in the current declaration of conformity.                                                           declaration of
                                                                                                                           conformity
 the majority of the supervisory board’s members again in 2013 took advantage of the informational and                     ›› page 38

advanced training courses offered by the company. in the past year these covered primarily the topics of
compliance and the german corporate governance code.


audit of the annual financial statements
the annual general meeting of leoni ag’s shareholders on 30 april 2013 appointed the ernst & young ag
auditing company of stuttgart as auditors for the 2013 financial year. ernst & young audited and granted an
unqualified certificate for the 2013 financial statements and the management report of leoni ag prepared in
accordance with the german commercial code as well as the consolidated financial statements and the group
management report prepared in accordance with ifrs. the auditors responsible pursuant to article 319a (1)

                       sentence 4 of the german commercial code (hgb) were udo schuberth and gero schütz. the management
                       reports describe the situation of the ag and of the group as well as the future risks and rewards in an appro-
                       priate manner. the auditors also gave the quality of the risk management system a favourable verdict.
                        the annual financial statements of the company and of the group, the management reports and the audit
                       reports were made available to all members of the supervisory board in good time. the audit committee
                       pre-examined these documents during its meeting on 17 march 2014. these financial statements and reports
                       were comprehensively discussed during the regular meeting of the supervisory board on 24 march 2014. the
                       auditing company’s representatives took part in both meetings, reported on the findings of their audits and
                       were available to provide additional information. with respect to the accounting process, they confirmed the
                       effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems to the supervisory board. the auditors
                       gave written assurance, furthermore, that they did not perform any significant services other than to audit
                       the financial statements for leoni ag during the year under report and that there are no circumstances that
                       might compromise their independence. the final audits of the annual financial statements and the ma-
                       nagement reports of the ag and the group by the supervisory board did not give rise to any objections. the
                       members of the supervisory board approved the annual financial statements of the ag and the consolidated
                       financial statements for fiscal 2013 as prepared by the management board. the financial statements of leoni
                       ag have thus been duly adopted. the supervisory board supports the management board’s proposal to pay
                       out a dividend of € 1.00 per share for fiscal 2013.


                       thanks to the management board and staff
                       the supervisory board thanks all members of the management board as well as all staff for their very good
                       work, which resulted in a solid performance in 2013 despite substantial pre-production investment.

automotive cables




from seat adjustment to climate control; from
park assist to the rain sensor; from the gps
receiver through to the mobile phone inter-
face – all these components depend on leoni
cables and conductors. in total, we provide
4,500 different products for these applica-
tions; primarily from within our leoni dacar
and leoni adascar product families.


leoni adascar cables that can simultane-
ously control many different functions are
to an increasing extent prevailing in safety
engineering. a new leoni adascar cable
supplies power and simultaneously controls
the sensors for three brake assist systems: the
abs anti-lock braking system, the esp elec-
tronic stability programme and the electronic
parking brake.




leoni dacar full hd-capable screens,
which are fitted in cars in the form of a tilting
display, are a new trend in the multimedia
segment. the innovative dacar cables, which
leoni supplies for these applications, are not
only capable of providing the volume of data
needed for high-resolution image quality,
but are also robust enough to withstand the
frequent movement that a tilting display
involves.

ethernet for cars leoni is currently working
together with carmakers and other compo-
nent suppliers on a car-compatible ethernet
system. the first samplings for certain vehicle
types are already running for the 100 kbit/s
system. as early as four to five years from now,
it will be possible to mass produce the gigabit
ethernet and thereby for a new wiring system
architecture to become reality.

cable harnesses and components
for commercial vehicles




for heavy goods and other commercial
vehicles leoni has developed and produces
complete wiring systems, preformed cable
harnesses, high-voltage cable harnesses,
electrical components and connector sys-
tems.


cable harnesses for euro 6 engines
the stricter the emission standard the more
complex the engine: cable harnesses for
commercial vehicle engines of the new euro 6
generation are fitted with significantly more
sensors and are far more complex than their
euro 5-compliant predecessors. that is why
they are up to 30 percent more extensive.




aluminium battery cables
custom-made, weight-reduced cable har-
nesses lower the weight of the commercial
vehicle and therefore also its fuel consump-
tion: battery cables made of aluminium, for
example, are 30 to 40 percent lighter than
conventional options.

cables and cable systems
for high-speed trains




leoni’s range of products for railway vehicles
encompasses fire protection-compliant pow-
er and data cables to supply and control a
wide variety of electric applications in trains,
custom-made cable harnesses, roof and
railcar jumper systems suitable for very low
temperatures to transmit power and signals
between the individual railcars and earthing
concepts for safety.


power and control cables transmit electrical
current, signals and data, e.g. for the train
driver’s control panel, switch cabinets and
control modules, for the drive systems with
the motors, for lighting and climate control
in the passenger coaches as well as for moni-
tors, power sockets and reading lights at the
individual seats.
 combined into complete cable harnesses
for railcars and locomotives, these cables
become highly sophisticated, custom-made,
assembled systems.




railcar jumper systems leoni designs
and produces railcar jumper systems as
customised solutions for transmitting power
and signals between the cars. this usually in-
volves two jumper systems being fitted to the
right and left of the couplings, each for up
to ten different cables. roof jumper systems
normally are mostly for power transmission.

cables for infrastructure applications




medium voltage cables are used to supply
power in tunnels, for example for the opera-
tions centres, ventilation and lighting inside
a tunnel, but also for the power supply to the
locomotive via the overhead lines.


control cables transmit signals for points,
light signals and signal boxes. they are used
both inside tunnels and also along above-
ground tracks.


safety cables are archetypal infrastructure
cables for emergency services. they ensure,
for instance in the event of a fire, that the
emergency lighting works, and they are
therefore especially robust and fireproof.




betajet deltaflex cables are patented 400 hz
cables that are highly flexible and resistant to
abrasion. this cable type is capable, even at high
ambient temperatures of 55 °c, of still constant-
ly transmitting the full electric charge of 260
amperes per phase and is therefore beneficially
deployed at airports in arab and gulf countries.

                                    corporate governance report and statement
                                    corporate governance at leoni
                                    leoni is committed to maintaining responsible and transparent corporate governance, the basis of which con-
                                    sists of statutory rules, leoni ag’s articles of association, the rules of procedure for the management board
                                    and supervisory board, and the german corporate governance code (code). these rules and guidelines are
                                    observed in all decision-making processes. in line with the legal requirements for a german public company,
                                    leoni ag has a dual management system that is characterised by the separation of personnel between the
                                    management board as the executive and corporate business management body and the supervisory board as
                                    the corporate monitoring body.
                                     hereinafter we report pursuant to section 3.10 of the code on our corporate governance as well as, in ac-
                                    cordance with article 289a of the german commercial code (hgb), on our key corporate governance practices.


                                    implementation of the german corporate governance code
                                    in the 2013 financial year, leoni conformed to all the recommendations and suggestions of the code in its
                                    version valid until 9 june 2013. the deviation from the recommendation in section 5.4.6 (2) sentence 2 as de-
                                    clared in december 2012 was removed as a result of a change to supervisory board compensation adopted by
                                    shareholders at the annual general meeting on 30 april 2013 and retroactive to 1 january 2013. the members
                                    of the supervisory board now receive fixed compensation, to which the recommendation in the code does
                                    not apply, instead of performance-related compensation.
                                     leoni fulfils the code’s recommendations contained in its version valid from 10 june 2013 with one
                                    exception: this concerns a new recommendation on determining the compensation for management board
                                    members (section 4.2.2 (2) sentence 3). it provides that, when determining the compensation of management
                                    board members, the level of compensation relative to that for senior management and the workforce as a
                                    whole, also over time, should be taken into consideration. there are, for the purpose of determining man-
                                    agement board compensation, certain demarcation characteristics as well as compensation and comparison
                                    benchmarks, which also include the proportionality among various compensation groups. however, the
                                    supervisory board does not deem a rigidly prescribed proportionality based on fixed reference amounts to be
                                    helpful for individual, appropriate determination of compensation for members of the management board.
                 declaration of     the current declaration of conformity explains this deviation in detail. all other recommendations and sug-
                 conformity
                 ›› page 38         gestions are adhered to and are also to be fulfilled in the future.

during the annual general meeting on 30 april 2013, three voting right representatives were again available
to shareholders not present to cast their votes as instructed, thereby making it easier for shareholders to
exercise their rights. shareholders were able at any time to authorise and instruct these representatives, who
were available to all shareholders throughout the meeting.
 interested parties and shareholders who did not attend the annual general meeting were able to follow the
president & ceo’s speech and a presentation shown during this speech on the internet. this presentation will

corporate governance by the management board
the management board is responsible for the corporate governance of leoni ag. it acts in the interests of
leoni ag with the aim of raising its enterprise value on a lasting basis. to do so, the board develops a suitable
strategy, agrees this with the supervisory board and ensures that it is implemented. its duties also include
effective opportunity and risk management as well as controlling and ensuring compliance (observance of
legal requirements and guidelines within the company) throughout the group.
 rules of procedure, which the supervisory board has approved, govern the collaboration and division of
duties among members of the management board. the rules of procedure also contain the departmental
responsibilities of the individual board members, matters that are the responsibility of the entire manage-
ment board, the required majority as well as a catalogue of the types of transaction requiring the supervisory
board’s approval.
 the system for compensating the members of the management board, which the supervisory board again
reviewed in 2013, applied without change during the year under report. all the information on compensation
for management board members is contained in the compensation report.                                                                compensation report

                                          during its meeting on 5 december 2013, the supervisory board appointed dr frank hiller (47) as an additional
                                          member of the management board effective 1 april 2014. starting mid-year, dr hiller will take charge of the
                                          wire & cable solutions division from dr klaus probst, who will then devote himself primarily to implementing

                                          management board chairman.
                                           in line with the code’s recommendation, dr hiller’s first appointment to the management board does not
                                          involve the maximum possible term, but rather terminates on 31 december 2017.


                                          work of the supervisory board
                                          the supervisory board of leoni ag monitors and advises the management board in running the company. in
                                          accordance with the german co-determination act, the board has an equal number of six members represent-
                                          ing employees and six members representing shareholders. its composition is, furthermore, in line with the
                                          latest code requirements concerning diversity and appropriate participation of women as well as the criteria
                                          of independence, experience, internationalism and expertise of the supervisory board members.
                                           the supervisory board’s work is governed by rules of procedure. during its meeting on 19 september 2013,
                                          the supervisory board decided to form, in addition to its existing committees, a strategy committee, which
                                          deals with corporate strategy in a consultative and preparatory role and is to meet at least twice a year.

collaboration between the management board and supervisory board
the management and supervisory boards of leoni ag collaborated closely and in mutual trust for the benefit
of the company again during the year under report. the management board’s rules of procedure stipulated
the obligations on the board concerning provision of information and reporting. during the supervisory
board meetings the management board and supervisory board discussed all key strategic decisions as well
as transactions requiring consent openly and based on maintaining strict confidentiality. the management
board gave a detailed presentation of corporate strategy to the supervisory board, which approved it after
comprehensive discussion. the management board also kept the supervisory board comprehensively
informed on a regular and up-to-date basis during the financial year about all key matters as well as the
planning, business performance, the risk situation and the compliance measures. in addition to the regular
supervisory board meetings, the chairmen of the management board and supervisory board discussed all
relevant, current matters on a fixed day every month. the supervisory board report also contains additional               supervisory board

                                    statements in the 2013 half-year report and in the two quarterly reports of leoni ag were prepared in accord-
                                    ance with the international financial reporting standards (ifrs). at the annual general meeting on 30 april
                                    2013 accountants ernst & young gmbh of stuttgart were appointed as the auditors for the year under report.
                                    the nomination was preceded by an examination of independence. this ruled out any business, financial,

                                    one hand and leoni ag as well as members of its corporate bodies on the other hand that might give cause
                                    to doubt the independence of the auditors. ernst & young issued a correspondingly binding declaration of
                                    independence in this respect.
                                        the supervisory board also agreed with the auditors that the former would be notified without delay of find-
                                    ings and occurrences material to the duties of the supervisory board that arise during execution of the audit.
                                    accordingly, the auditors are obliged to advise the supervisory board, or note it in their audit report, if pieces
                                    of information are found that point to incorrectness in the declaration pursuant to the code submitted by the

                       of the german public companies act (aktg) on the recommendations of the government commission
                       on the german corporate governance code in its version of 13 may 2013 (most recently published in the
                       electronic federal gazette – bundesanzeiger – on 10 june 2013)


                       during their meetings on 2 december 2013 and 5 december 2013, the management board and supervi-
                       sory board of leoni ag approved the following declaration of conformity pursuant to article 161 of the
                       german public companies act:


                       i. with reference to both the version of the code dated 15 may 2012, which was valid until 9 june 2013, and
                          its current version dated 13 may 2013, which has been valid since 10 june 2013, the management board
                          and the supervisory board declare that the deviation, as notified in the declaration of conformity released
                          most recently in december 2012, from section 5.4.6 (2) sentence 2 has, since the annual general meeting
                          on 30 april 2013, retroactively no longer existed throughout the 2013 financial year.
                             in section 5.4.6 (2) sentence 2, the code recommends that any performance-related compensation paid
                          to supervisory board members shall be geared to long-term business growth. under article 12 (2) of the
                          articles of association valid until 30 april 2013, the members of the company’s supervisory board received
                          variable performance-related compensation geared to the company’s distributable profit. on 30 april 2013
                          shareholders at the annual general meeting decided that, with effect from the 2013 financial year, mem-
                          bers of the supervisory board should no longer receive any performance-related compensation. article
                          12 of the articles of association was amended accordingly. with effect from 1 january 2013, the option to
                          deviate from this code recommendation consequently no longer exists.


                       ii. the management board and supervisory board also declare that, from 10 june 2013, they have been
                          conforming to the recommendations valid from that date of the government commission on the german
                          corporate governance code in its version of 13 may 2013, with the following exception:
                             the code recommends in section 4.2.2 (2) sentence 3 that the supervisory board should, when de-
                          termining the compensation for management board members, take into consideration the management
                          board compensation level relative to that for senior management and the workforce as a whole also over
                          time, with the supervisory board determining for this assessment where the demarcations for senior man-
                          agement and the relevant workforce are.
                             the management board and supervisory board declare in this respect that they have currently not fully
                          applied this recommendation. there are, for the purpose of determining management board compensa-
                          tion, certain demarcation characteristics as well as compensation and comparison benchmarks, which also
                          include the proportionality among various compensation groups within the company. the supervisory
                          board has, furthermore, clearly specified the individuals who belong to the senior management group. the
                          supervisory board has in recent years also repeatedly considered such proportionality among the various
                          salary groups. however, this consideration was neither structural nor was it in complete conformity with
                          the criteria of the new code recommendations.

                                                                                                company information   | corporate governance report   |   39
                                                                                                                        and statement




   benchmarks for comparison only make sense when they are realistic, provide guidance and leave ample
   scope for consideration of individual cases. these conditions do not fulfil the code recommendations
   under section 4.2.2 (2) sentence 3. the supervisory board does not regard a rigidly prescribed proportion-
   ality based on fixed reference amounts involving the workforce or parts of the workforce that can be ma-
   nipulated at will as providing any help in determining the compensation for members of the management
   board, which must be both fair in individual cases and always appropriate relative also to many other and
   more significant parameters. nor does rigid comparison of the performance of the various compensation
   groups over time provide any assistance in this respect.
      this applies especially to leoni as a company with an overwhelming proportion of its workforce em-
   ployed in countries outside europe. any form of comparison based on the wage groups of the part of the
   workforce outside germany, which is de facto very relevant, would merely lead to arbitrary outcomes and
   therefore to comparison benchmarks that no longer make any sense. the supervisory board consequently
   does not consider it acceptable to draw on across-the-board parameters that make sense only in notional
   terms, but which beyond that are not meaningful.


iii. the management board and supervisory board furthermore declare that they intend, with the exception
   of the recommendations under section 4.2.2 (2) sentence 3, in the future to conform to all the other rec-
   ommendations of the government commission on the german corporate governance code in its version
   of 13 may 2013.

markets of the industrialised countries well up
the equity markets of the large industrialised countries increasingly gained momentum over the course of
2013, mostly posting significant gains for the year as a whole. impetus stemmed above all from the central
banks’ still generous supply of liquidity to the financial markets. in addition, the economic prospects gradu-
ally picked up in parts of europe and the united states. the declining economic momentum in the emerging
countries, which caused some share prices to drop significantly on these markets, put only a temporary
damper on the industrialised countries‘ markets. some share indices posted new record levels against this
backdrop. also among these was germany’s leading dax index, which continued its uptrend of the preceding
years unabated and in december rose to 9,589 points – based on closing prices. the year’s final level was
only just below that at 9,552 points. the dax thus appreciated by nearly 26 percent. the mdax generated an
increase of about 39 percent.


leoni share a strong outperformer
the shares of the automotive and component supply sector also benefited from the favourable market
setting, which, with the tailwind from the very good performance of the car markets in the united states and
china, generated above-average gains. the dax ‘automobile’ sector rose by about 43 percent in the past year,
while the sub-index for the automotive component suppliers even rose by nearly 82 percent.
 leoni’s share performed even better in 2013 by almost doubling in value with a 90 percent increase to
€ 54.33. this is an expression of investors’ confidence in leoni’s earnings-oriented growth strategy. during
this upward trajectory the leoni share set a new all-time record with a high of € 55.08. the share posted its
lowest 2013 price of € 28.97 right at the beginning of the year.
 the market capitalisation of the roughly 32.7 million leoni shares stood at about € 1,775 million on
31 december 2013, as opposed to about € 933 million one year earlier.


trading volumes
a total of 57.3 million leoni shares changed hands on the frankfurt stock exchange and in the xetra electro-
nic trading system in 2013, down from 72.3 million in 2012. an average of 226,364 shares thus changed hands
on each trading day (previous year: 284,545). in euros, the value of leoni shares traded in 2013 came to a
total of € 2,212 million (previous year: € 2,307 million). leoni therefore assumed 21st place in deutsche börse’s
mdax ranking of trading volumes, down from 17th in the previous year.


shareholder structure stable
there was virtually no change in the shareholder structure in 2013 even though 100 percent of leoni’s shares
are in free float. about two thirds of the roughly 32.7 million leoni shares were held by institutional investors
at the end of december. private investors accounted for about one third of the total. the largest shareholders
with holdings of between three and five percent at yearend were wilms beteiligungs gmbh and oslo-based
norges bank. no single shareholder owned more than 5 percent of the shares.
 the majority of leoni shareholders are based in germany, where about two thirds of the shares are held.
the remainder is evenly distributed across the rest of europe, where it is concentrated in the united kingdom,
and the united states.

                       dividend payout
                       leoni ag pursues an earnings-oriented growth strategy, with shareholders receiving a commensurate return:
                       in principle, leoni pays out about one third of consolidated net income in dividends. accordingly, we will
                       propose to shareholders at the annual general meeting on 8 may 2014 to pay a dividend of € 1.00 per leoni
                       share for fiscal 2013 (previous year: € 1.50). the total payout would therefore amount to about € 32.7 million
                       (previous year: about € 49.0 million).

financial analysts like leoni’s share
leoni ag enjoys very good standing on the financial market. a total of 22 banks and investment firms (at
the end of december) regularly monitored our company in 2013. while the coverage was thus down by two
institutions versus the preceding year, it was still at a high level.
  the majority of capital market experts rate leoni’s prospects positively in view of its convincing corporate
strategy and the systematically established conditions for entering the next growth phase. of the 22 invest-
ment professionals, eleven rated the leoni share as a buy. eight issued a hold recommendation. only three
financial analysts advised to sell.

in-depth investor relations work
leoni considers transparency and proactive communication to be core elements of good corporate govern-
ance. we advise our shareholders as well as analysts and other financial market players, the media and the in-
terested public equally, comprehensively and promptly on the company’s current and projected performance.
in this way we establish lasting confidence among shareholders and stakeholders.
  in particular, one-on-one dialogue with the aforementioned target groups also has high priority as part
of our investor relations policy. all members of the management board are therefore closely involved in the
corresponding work. in 2013, we presented leoni ag’s strategy and prospects at a total of 23 roadshows in
and outside germany. the regional focus in this respect was – alongside events in germany – on meetings
in the united kingdom and the united states. in addition, we continued our activity in canada and australia.
complementing the roadshows, members of the management board held a large number of one-on-one
discussions with analysts and representatives of the media. they also took part in six international investor
conferences.

                                    numerous other measures round off the personal commitment of the members of the management board. for
                                    instance, the investor relations team provides timely statements on all share-relevant information by means
                                    of ad hoc announcements as well as other publications. these include above all annual and interim reports as
                                    well as shareholders’ letters and media releases. the release of leoni’s quarterly figures is on each occasion
                                    complemented by separate conference calls for analysts and business journalists. furthermore, a balance
                                    sheet press conference is held once a year. this is, just like the conference calls, broadcast live and in full on the
                                    internet.

                                              the leoni group’s customers principally include the motor vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers. in

                                              customer sector, accounted for about 75 percent of leoni’s total sales in 2013. with sales to the five largest

                                              group strategy
                                              leoni pursues an earnings-oriented strategy of sustained expansion. growth is targeted to take consolidated
                                              sales to € 5 billion by 2016. in so doing we aim not only to grow more strongly than the respective market
                                              segments, but above all also to disproportionately increase our profitability. the targets for the ebit margin
                                              (earnings before interest and taxes divided by sales) and the roce (return on capital employed) are
                                              7 and 20 percent, respectively.
                                               during the year under report we sharpened our strategic targets – in line with current market trends: based
                                              on the strong momentum in this market, there is to be substantial worldwide growth in our business with the

                                              invest particularly in the future markets comprising capital goods, medical technology, communications and

                                              and to achieve an even breakdown of sales between europe, asia and the americas; i.e. the world’s three

in terms of products, we constantly study options for extending our value chain to complement our core
business comprising cables and cable systems. to do so, we build development know-how and our own
production capacity in fields that are closely related in terms of technology and application as well as examine
acquisition opportunities.


strategic levers
implementation of the strategy follows the four levers of globalisation, innovation, system business and
efficiency.

                                                           leoni group




to take the globalisation of its business forward, leoni is setting up not only sales offices, but increasingly
also additional production facilities in key markets. this enables us to offer customers based in these locations
local value creation and a high level of delivery flexibility. the focal areas of this growth are the bric countries
including south korea, where we aim to increase our sales from the current € 700.7 million to about € 1 billion
by 2016, as well as north america
 to strengthen our power of innovation, we are enhancing and improving our own expertise as well as
technologies and our position in innovation-driven growth markets. in so doing we are geared primarily to
the global megatrends, such as the growing demand for environmentally friendly technologies. the intention
is to further increase sales of new types of products and solutions, and to make leoni the leading and most
innovative manufacturer of cables for green technologies.
 leoni rates the system business and extension of the value chain as key growth drivers. that is why we
intend to develop towards being a system supplier to additional fields of work and to offer more high-end
services in such areas as engineering. the objective is to further increase the profitable sales in this business.
 efficiency constitutes a key success criterion for leoni’s competitiveness. we are raising this by realising
synergies, rationalising as well as optimising our business processes and production networks. these meas-
ures will achieve annual efficiency gains in order thereby to offset increases in staff and material costs.

                                      corporate governance and management system
                                      leoni’s corporate governance is geared to the principles of the german corporate governance code. the
                                      management board is responsible for corporate governance. its work is monitored by the supervisory board.
                                      the management board also determines group strategy and, together with those in charge of the divisions
                                      and the individual business units, measures suited to strategy implementation.
                                           the operating units are governed by the key figures of sales, earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) and
                                      capital employed as well as free cash flow. we measure the respective target attainment by the benchmarks of
                                      return on sales (ebit margin) and return on capital employed (roce). information on how roce is deter-

macroeconomic trend
the international monetary fund (imf) calculates that the global economy again in 2013 grew no more than
moderately at a rate of 3.0 percent. the good news was, however, that momentum picked up significantly in
the second half of the year and alleviated the consequences of the very subdued trend of the first few months.
unlike in the preceding years, particularly the industrialised countries, whose overall economic output was up
by 1.3 percent and thus more strongly than originally projected, contributed to this turnaround. by contrast,
the developing and emerging countries lost a little pace with 4.7 percent growth.
  although the eurozone was again down with 0.4 percent contraction, this was less than in the previous
year thanks to the trends of recovery in some countries. the german economy once more provided support.
according to the german federal office of statistics, it again put on a solid performance with slight growth of
0.4 percent even though the balance of imports and exports was actually negative because of the persisting
weakness of demand in some areas of europe.

                       the trend in the worldwide car market was on the whole positive in 2013, according to the german asso-
                       ciation of the automotive industry (vda), but there were strong regional differences. while new vehicle
                       registrations were up in the by far two largest markets of china and the united states, by 23 and 7.5 percent
                       respectively, the figures were down in the other key countries, in some cases significantly so. this involved
                       particularly india and russia with setbacks of 7.5 and 5.5 percent, respectively, but, due to the tough macroe-
                       conomic situation in some southern european countries, also the european union with a decrease of 1.7 per-
                       cent. in japan, the market settled at roughly the previous year’s level. these trends were also reflected in 2013
                       car production, which the ihs global insight market research institute estimates increased by about 2 percent
                       worldwide. more cars were manufactured in asia and the americas in 2013 than in the previous year, while
                       output in the far east rose only in china, whereas it was down in japan and korea. in europe including russia
                       car production was down slightly. the trend towards premium cars meanwhile continued unabated, however.

the commercial vehicle sector again registered heavy demand in 2013. alongside the favourable economic
trends in china and the united states, this also reflected bringing-forward effects in europe. these were due to
introduction of the stricter emission regulations (euro 6 standard) from january 2014. ihs global insight says
that, worldwide, about 6 percent more heavy goods vehicles were manufactured in 2013 than in 2012.
     the global market for electrical and electronic products also grew in 2013: according to the german elec-
trical and electronic manufacturers’ association (zvei), this market grew at an overall rate of 4 percent, with
asia (up 6 percent) and the americas (up 4 percent) as the driving forces. by contrast, the market in europe was
flat. in germany, the sector’s sales and output were down by about 2 and 3 percent, respectively, in the past
year. on the other hand, the order receipts of the german electrical and electronic goods manufacturers rose
by about 3 percent. the manufacturers of automatic processing machines and measurement technology did
especially well.
     the german engineering federation (vdma) says that the global mechanical engineering sector grew
by about 1 percent in 2013. however, among the major manufacturing countries, only china and the united
states generated sales increases, while volumes were down in germany, japan and italy. the german mechan-
ical engineering companies registered a sales decrease of about 1 percent during the year under report; their
orders were down by 2 percent.
     the worldwide sales of products and services of the information and communication technology (ict)
industry also rose in the past year. the german association for information technology, telecommunications
and new media (bitkom) estimates a global increase of about 4 percent, underpinned above all by the emerg-
ing countries. bitkom says that, in germany, sales of information technology, telecommunications equipment
and consumer electronics remained steady at the previous year’s high level.
     in the german medical technology sector sales during the period under report are likely, according to esti-
mates of the spectaris trade association, to have increased by about 3 percent, thanks mainly to rising exports
to emerging countries.
     from leoni’s perspective, the 2013 trend in worldwide car production and thus in the demand for cables,
cable harnesses and wiring systems was on the whole somewhat better than expected. this involved demand
in china and the united states exceeding our projections, whereas it fell short in the european mass-market
business. the industrial business in europe was also weaker than anticipated. here the cable industry was still
subject to heavy pressure on margins. at the same time, the trend towards the use of alternative conductor
materials and reduced cable cross-sections, where leoni is a key driver, continued during the year under
report.



other factors
alongside the macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions, there are a number of other factors that play a
key role with respect to leoni’s business performance:

■■   the prices of commodities, especially of copper, exert a considerable influence on the size of our business.              procurement
                                                                                                                               ›› page 78
     we largely pass the fluctuation in the price of copper on to our customers based on contractual agreements
     to this effect, albeit normally after a time lag. a change in the price of copper will therefore normally result
     initially in a corresponding effect on leoni’s sales without notable impact on earnings. on the reporting
     dates there may – depending on the change in the price of copper – be write-downs on inventory or provi-
     sions to cover contingent losses on partial quantities of inventory. the same applies to the raw material of
     silver, which is used primarily in the refining of wire products.

                                           ■■   group-wide, the trend in energy prices does not have any major impact on leoni. however, the com-
                                                paratively high level of energy costs in germany continued to weigh on our domestic production facilities
                                                during the year under report.

                                           ■■   another significant factor involves personnel costs in the countries where we produce. they are considered
                                                in our decisions on choices of location, as are reliable legal and political conditions as well as favourable
                                                transport options. in 2013, wage costs again increased significantly in north africa as well as china and
                                                moderately so in eastern europe.

                                           ■■   we continue to watch the unstable political situation in north africa and the ukraine very closely. it has so
                                                far not had any notable effect on leoni. like our customers, we still consider the conditions for production
                                                in these countries to be competitive and will keep our capacity in place accordingly.

                                           ■■   alongside the respective national legislation of the countries where we are present, the legal factors that
                                                affect leoni also include international laws. the stricter co2 emission limits in europe, for example, exert
                                                indirect influence. they are raising demand from the automotive industry for cables, cable harnesses and
                                                wiring systems that are especially lightweight or suited to alternative drive technologies. new emission
                                                standards for trucks, such as the euro 6 standard in europe and a similar regulation in the united states,
                                                which apply from 2014, are also likely to exert a beneficial effect on demand for cable harnesses because of
                                                the more complex engine technology involved.


                  notes                    ■■   thanks to appropriate hedging transactions, exchange-rate fluctuation does not have any major impact

                                               competitive situation and advantages
                                               during the year under report we succeeded in bolstering our leading position in the european market for ca-
                                               ble harnesses and wiring systems with a share of 23 percent. based on our own research, the wiring systems
                                               division continues to rank 4th worldwide with a 9 percent share of the market. the most significant competi-

                                                 alongside our international competitive position, the factors assuring our lasting success are our great
                                               power of innovation and a high real net output ratio, strong logistics and systems expertise as well as devel-

2013 strategic projects
various projects were launched and executed in the wiring systems division during the year under report in
line with the four levers of globalisation, innovation, system business and efficiency:                                   group strategy

globalisation with focus on china          in october 2013, we opened a fourth production facility in china to
improve our market position and be able to supply the plants of our customers that manufacture in the coun-
try flexibly and with short response times. the new plant in langfang near beijing will supply beijing benz
automotive co ltd., a joint venture of daimler ag in germany and its chinese partner baic. the plant started
with production of wiring systems for mercedes’ c-class, which is sold in china; the gla and glk models are
to follow. the go-ahead was given in november 2013 for a fifth plant in china to be located in north-eastern
tieling, which will be producing wiring systems for bmw starting in the second half of 2014. we also expanded
our capacity in the other production regions of importance to us. the section headed capital expenditure                  capital expenditure

daekyeung integration successfully completed              the restructuring and integration in full of the south
korean wiring systems manufacturer daekyeung t&g co. ltd. based in busan, the shares in which leoni
acquired in two stages in 2008 and 2012, was successfully completed in 2013 as planned. the business per-
formed well in the period under report. the turnaround in terms of operating profitability was achieved in the
summer of 2013 and the business broke even over the year as a whole. a new contract from the south korean
sport utility vehicle manufacturer ssangyong motor company, which was obtained in february 2013, under-
pins our progress in this important automotive market. it covered cables harnesses for a new vehicle that is to
be launched in 2015.


innovations: electromobility         we enhanced our position in this future segment significantly in 2013
thanks to the numerous innovations that we launched in the past year for vehicles with alternative drive
systems. of the 14 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids of german manufacturers, which were included in
the national electromobility platform market preparation phase in 2013, leoni supplies ten with products                  research & development

to some extent at least. this involves both premium and small cars. the section on research & development
provides information on the key product innovations of 2013.


new organisational structure enhances systems expertise                with our newly established business
group systems & components we have boosted our starting position for broadening systems expertise in the
areas of electromechanical components, connector systems and electromobility. the corresponding produc-
tion capacity is pooled at our existing facility in slovakia where we set up a new injection moulding line in
2013. by the end of the year the first production projects were already underway; involving, for example, the
main fuse boxes for a large model of a german premium carmaker.


facility optimisation to ensure our great cost efficiency            during the period under report we not
only expanded our production network, but also restructured it with respect to efficiency. at the centre of this
stood realignment of our wiring systems production in morocco, where in 2013 we closed a plant and began
setting up state-of-the-art capacity at a new location. there were also relocations in eastern europe for cost
reasons, among them from poland to the ukraine. production capacity in serbia is likewise undergoing further
expansion. in addition, a new organisational structure involving the setting-up of pan-divisional competence
centers and pooling of business units into business groups will entail efficiency benefits and synergies.

                       the wiring systems division increased its external sales by just over 5 percent to € 2,321.0 million in fiscal
                       2013, thereby generating a new high. this good performance was based on the substantial demand from our
                       export-heavyweight customers in the german automotive industry, which expanded above all in the current
                       growth areas of north america and asia. there was also a further increase in demand for wiring systems from
                       the foreign manufacturers in china. we furthermore generated increases in sales to the commercial vehicle
                       and international component supply industries. this more than offset the decreases involving some european
                       carmakers.

numerous new products making initial sales contributions                            the division’s 2013 sales were spread
across a large number of manufacturers and vehicle models, from premium to small cars. new product start-
ups also made initial contributions to sales. among other products, we started making wiring systems and
cable harnesses for several new and successor models of various premium and mass-market manufacturers
based in germany and europe. we also commenced new projects for the american commercial vehicle indus-
try as well as in the electromechanical components sector. there were, furthermore, several production start-
ups involving high-voltage wiring systems for the hybrid and electric vehicles of various german premium
and mass-market manufacturers. we thus more than doubled – from a low base – the amount of our business
involving cable harnesses and wiring systems for electric vehicles during the period under report.


ebit affected by pre-production and restructuring expenses                           in total, the wiring systems division
prepared for starting 16 new products in the year under report. as expected, the pre-production spending

amounting to € 12.6 million (previous year: € 8.6 million), incurred above all by having closed a facility in
morocco. furthermore, a fine of € 1.4 million had to be absorbed in the result, which stemmed from the mean-

new contracts ensuring future growth                           all five business groups booked new contracts in 2013, which
underpin our medium-growth targets. they stem from premium and mass-market carmakers in germany,
europe, asia and the united states as well as from the international commercial vehicle industry, agricultural
machinery producers and the component supply industry. we also obtained several projects involving com-
ponents and cable harnesses for vehicles with alternative drive systems. the wiring systems division thus had
a consistently large order book totalling € 12 billion at the end of 2013; a more than solid basis for the planned
expansion. the exact amount and timing of the shipments will depend on what our customers actually call
forward.

                       the wire & cable solutions division’s range of products and services encompasses wires, strands and optical
                       fibers, standardised cables, special cables and completely assembled systems as well as related services for
                       a wide variety of industries, especially so in the automotive, capital goods, medical technology, telecommu-
                       nications, infrastructure as well as household and electrical appliance sectors. leoni in this respect focuses
                       on technologically sophisticated products as well as customer-specific applications for niche markets. at the
                       same time we continue to develop our product portfolio for the increasingly important emerging countries in
                       line with the particular demands of the local markets. solutions for the global trends of mobility, population

                       in organisational terms, the wire & cable solutions division is subdivided into five business groups (bgs):
                       automotive cables, industry & healthcare, communication & infrastructure, electrical appliance assemblies
                       as well as conductors & copper solutions. this is therefore in line with the division’s five core markets. the
                       operations of the five business groups are structured into a total of 16 business units (bus). these business
                       units function flexibly; they are in worldwide charge of products, plants, markets as well as customers and are
                       responsible for profitability. in addition there are central functions that perform services for all bgs, bus and
                       subsidiaries.
                        for china, this segment’s most significant growth region, there is an additional organisational unit. it oper-

                       the supply chains were optimised and product development as well as product management was expanded
                       for the local market.
                        our customer base comprises the majority of wiring system manufacturers and numerous automotive
                       suppliers worldwide as well as the key providers in the other sectors that we supply in more than 90 countries.
                       we maintain close relationships with our customers for many years. particularly our sales and development
                       departments are in constant contact with customers. in many projects leoni is closely involved as a product
                       or system supplier and solution provider as early as the design and planning phase.
                        the most important sale region is europe, followed by asia and north america. our international sales
                       network is continually being enlarged to further raise our market penetration in the developed economic re-

of the strategic lever of globalisation. the key customers in the individual business groups are looked after by
key account managers with sector knowledge.
 the division’s up-to-date production facilities are located in the most significant economic regions around
the world: in western and eastern europe, the americas as well as asia. we are continuing to expand our
capacity above all in growth markets like china, india and mexico, which is clearly reflected in the trend of our
sales broken down by region. the facilities are favourably located in the proximity of customers. our produc-
tion networks and supply chains are continually optimised to make the best possible use of available capacity
and to reduce the complexity of structures. in 2013, for instance, we further concentrated our european pro-
duction of household appliance cables in eastern europe. in serbia we are making joint use with the wiring
systems division of a plant for these products.


competitive situation and advantages
the wire & cable solutions division, which is the third-largest cable business in europe, is the technology and
market leader in many of its target areas. in some product segments, such as automotive cables for the car
industry and cable systems for robotic engineering, we are global market leaders. we also command leading
positions in the market for cables for particular industrial applications; for example in mechanical engineer-
ing, measurement and control technology as well as medical technology.
 our crucial competitive advantages include a vertically strongly integrated value chain, core skills developed
over decades such as a broad understanding of raw materials and know-how concerning input materials,
engineering and applications as well as command of technologically sophisticated manufacturing processes
across all the links in the value chain. our increasing systems expertise also enhances our opportunities in the
market.


2013 strategic projects
the wire & cable solutions division is applying the group strategy in the context of its ‘wcs 4ward’ strategy
programme with its four levers of internationalisation, innovation, systems business and efficiency. the pro-
portions of sales generated in asia and the americas were further increased as planned in 2013. the amount
of business in asia has risen by 50 percent since 2008 and in the americas it was doubled. that reduced the
proportion of sales the division generates in europe from 82 percent to 66 percent. enhancing efficiency
was another focal area. with respect to these two levers, we launched and executed the following strategic
projects:


new facility in india     the wcs division opened its first cables plant in pune, india in 2013. on production
space of about 15,000 m2, we are initially making automotive cables as well as instrumentation cables for the
petrochemical industry here. initial customer orders from the region were already fulfilled during the year un-
der report. the next step is to also include manufacture of products for the local railway and solar industries.


capacity expansion in asia and the americas          based on the consistently good growth opportunities in
these continents, we enlarged our capacity to produce automotive cables in china and the americas in 2013.                capital expenditure

cables business in europe remained fairly steady despite absence of market impetus. overall, the heavy
demand for automotive cables compensated for the declining demand in our industrial businesses, which are
still very much focused on the european market with its currently weak economy. in addition, adverse changes
in the prices of metals affected business group conductors & copper solutions, while the weak spell involving
the chinese household appliance industry was reflected in bg electrical appliance assemblies. business group
communication & infrastructure suffered from very weak business with the petrochemical industry as well as
a downturn in demand for data cables. bg industry & healthcare also registered less demand in the first half of
the year, but it gradually stabilised in the second half.

earnings well below previous year’s level           the wcs division’s ebit amounted to € 47.1 million in
2013 and was thus, as expected, substantially below the 2012 figure of € 101.3 million, which included a large
item of non-recurring income of € 28.3 million from having sold the operations of leoni studer hard that
were deemed not to fit with core business. the decline was furthermore attributable to considerable sales
decreases in the industrial businesses and the correspondingly weaker capacity utilisation as well as to a less
favourable mix of automotive cable products. in addition, there were restructuring expenses amounting to
€ 8.9 million (previous year: € 0.9 million). these were incurred primarily in connection with the necessary ad-
justment of capacity and realignment of the facility in stolberg to boost its competitiveness on a lasting basis.
the facility had recently suffered considerably from the cancellation of cable shipments for the petrochemical
industry in iran due to the temporarily tightened international embargo conditions.

order receipts exceed amount of sales          the wire & cable solutions division obtained new orders worth
€ 1,642.5 million in 2013. this took the amount of orders above both the 2012 like-for-like figure of € 1,569.5
million and the total sales of the year under report. promising new projects were obtained above all in bg
automotive cables: an international component supplier commissioned us to produce special abs cables that
will be fitted to new vehicles of a japanese manufacturer for the chinese and american car markets. leoni
thus received its first large order from the japanese car industry. there was also an order from the component
supply sector for high-speed data transfer cables to connect cameras in vehicles, which are being made at our
facilities in china, mexico and europe. environmentally friendly applications are also playing an increasingly
important role. for instance, an electric cars specialist placed an order with leoni to supply charging cables
for its next generation of vehicles, a well-known automotive component supplier ordered rapid charging
cables for the new electric car of a german car manufacturer and a further component supplier ordered cables
for emission measurement equipment.


business group communication & infrastructure won a pilot project of a multinational railway manufacturer
with a view to award the contract to make cable harnesses for fixed installation inside trains. there is major
market potential in this segment because the majority of these manufacturers still make these cable harnesses
themselves. via our sales office in the united arab emirates, we were also commissioned to supply the king
abdullah financial district (riyadh) and the new jeddah airport as well as dakar’s blaise diagne airport in
senegal with infrastructure and data cables from plants in europe. bg electrical appliance assemblies fur-
thermore reported a significant new contract. it covers provision of cables for the white goods of a household
appliance supplier that operates internationally, which secures our status as this customer’s sole supplier.

                       leoni’s performance was in the management board’s view on the whole satisfactory in 2013. in particular,
                       this involved encouraging sales performance. leoni’s consolidated sales increased by about 3 percent year
                       on year to the new record level of € 3.9 billion. this was based on the better-than-expected demand from the
                       international automotive industry, which was underpinned by strong car sales in north america and asia. not
                       only did this more than compensate for the weaker business on the european motor vehicle market and the
                       industrial sectors, it also exceeded our sales forecast: at the beginning of the year leoni had estimated con-
                       solidated sales of about € 3.7 billion and in the middle of the year raised this target to around € 3.8 billion. the
                       growth stemmed from the wiring systems division, which increased its external sales by about 5 percent to
                       € 2.3 billion and thereby topped the originally projected figure of € 2.1 billion. as indicated, the wire & cable
                       solutions division generated external sales of € 1.6 billion, a total virtually unchanged from the previous year.
                           consolidated ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) amounted to € 163.1 million in 2013 and was thus, as
                       expected, well below the previous year’s figure of € 237.9 million, which included a large amount of non-re-
                       curring income. in particular during the year under report, the company had to cope with spending on
                       stepped-up development work and preparing for new wiring system projects, less utilisation of capacity in
                       the industrial business as well as substantial restructuring costs. the latter item turned out significantly larger
                       than estimated, which is why the originally projected ebit figure of € 170 million was not quite matched. the
                       wiring systems division provided € 116.1 million of the consolidated ebit and the wire & cable solutions
                       division € 47.1 million.

                                                                                                  group management report   | business report   |   67




after taxes, leoni reported consolidated net income of € 105.9 million (previous year: € 157.0 million). in
keeping with our dividend policy in principle to pay out about one third of consolidated net income to share-
holders, we will propose to shareholders at the annual general meeting to pay a dividend of € 1.00 per leoni
share for fiscal 2013 (previous year: € 1.50).
 the leoni group’s financial and asset situation remained solid in 2013 and was, with a slightly improved
equity ratio of 34.5 percent, a minor increase in net financial liabilities of about € 257.0 million and free cash
flow of € 36.7 million, mostly in line with expectations.
 the good trend of business in the automotive sector continued in early 2014. leoni ag’s management board
rated the group’s financial position and performance as on the whole positive at the time this group manage-
ment report was prepared.



group sales and earnings
record sales thanks to strong automotive business
leoni ag increased its consolidated sales by about 3 percent to € 3,917.9 million in 2013. this growth
stemmed above all from the still good business with the international automotive industry, which in turn ben-
efited from the heavy demand for vehicles in north america and asia. thanks to the associated momentum,
we more than compensated for the weak demand for cars in europe as well as decreases in other industry
sectors.
 the additional sales in 2013 were generated exclusively from our own resources. changes in exchange rates
had a negative effect of € 33.9 million and curtailed the growth by 0.9 of a percentage point. the price of
copper on the whole had virtually no impact during the year under report with an adverse effect of 0.2 of a
percentage point. the scope of consolidation remained largely the same.
 the widely diverging economic conditions around the world were reflected in the regional breakdown of
leoni’s sales. we generated by far the strongest growth in the bric countries including south korea with an
increase of 19 percent to € 700.7 million. thanks to the good business in north america, we held our sales
in the nafta countries steady at roughly the previous year’s level of € 521.9 million with a figure of € 516.1
million. in germany, sales rose by about 6 percent to € 1,089.0 million. in the rest of europe, on the other
hand, we had to cope with a decrease of more than 3 percent to € 1,481.3 million because of the partially very
difficult economic situation of some countries. sales generated in the other regions outside europe dipped by
approx. 7 percent to € 130.8 million.

                       new product start-ups and restructuring expenses weigh on earnings
                       overall, the cost of sales rose by just over 3 percent to € 3,240.1 million and thus by a little more than consoli-
                       dated sales. this slightly disproportionate increase was above all a consequence of the numerous new product
                       start-ups in the wiring systems division, which required substantial pre-production spending on personnel
                       and materials. another factor exerting an adverse effect on earnings involved the smaller contributions to
                       profit of the capital goods business in the wire & cable solutions division, which reported less utilisation of
                       capacity because of the weak demand in europe. while the overall consolidated gross profit figure of € 677.8
                       million was slightly above the previous year’s € 675.9 million, the gross margin contracted from 17.7 percent
                       to 17.3 percent.
                        despite high special freight costs, which were incurred mainly in the first few months of 2013, selling
                       expenses rose at only a moderate rate of about 2 percent to € 196.4 million. structural improvements, which
                       presented increasing effect in the course of the year, made a beneficial impact in this respect. general admin-
                       istrative costs were similarly up by just approx. 3 percent to € 191.0 million even though the company carried
                       out major infrastructure projects like modernising and upgrading its group-wide it set-up. research and
                       developments costs, which are mostly incurred on a project-related basis, rose by more than 14 percent to
                       € 106.1 million because of the numerous new product start-ups in the wiring systems division.

                                                                                                 group management report    | business report   |   69




other operating income dropped considerably from € 48.9 million to € 10.4 million. the previous year’s figure
did include substantial non-recurring amounts. this involved the proceeds of € 28.3 million from the sale of
leoni studer hard ag, which was deemed no longer to fit core business, as well as income of € 5.0 million
related to consolidating businesses for the first time. by contrast, other operating expenses rose significantly
from € 17.0 million to € 31.3 million. this reflected primarily the more substantial restructuring costs, which
were incurred due, among other things, to measures to optimise the structure of our production in north
africa and of our facility in stolberg, germany. in addition, there was a fine of € 1.4 million resulting from the
eu competition proceedings concluded in the middle of the year.
     on the bottom line, consolidated earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) dropped from € 237.9 million
in 2012 to € 163.1 million in 2013. ebit adjusted for exceptional proceeds from sales, restructuring costs and
other items decreased from € 227.5 million to € 198.7 million.
     leoni’s financial result involved a significant improvement from negative € 38.7 million to negative
€ 32.2 million. this reflected the refinancing measures successfully carried out in the past two years, which
resulted in a more favourable interest-rate structure: finance costs were therefore down substantially from
€ 43.4 million to € 32.7 million. by a considerable margin, this more than offset the fall in finance income to
€ 0.5 million versus the previous year’s figure of € 4.7 million, which included exchange gains.
     in total, leoni reported consolidated earnings before taxes of € 131.2 million for the 2013 financial year
(previous year: € 199.3 million). tax expense amounted to € 25.3 million, which still corresponded to a very
low tax rate of 19.3 percent (previous year: 21.2 percent). in particular, this reflected income in the fourth
quarter from reversal of deferred tax assets relating to loss carryforwards, which will probably be useable in
the future because of the merger of two subsidiaries in italy and a case of restructuring in china.

                       value creation
                       the leoni group’s net value creation in 2013 was down by approx. 4 percent versus 2012, to € 929.4 million,
                       because of the exceptionally large amounts of other income included in the previous year. it is calculated
                       on the basis of sales revenues and other income less cost of materials, depreciation/amortisation and other
                       advance payments and thus represents leoni’s own output. the largest part of the value created is spent on
                       staff. in 2013 they received a share of 82.4 percent in the form of wages and salaries as well as social benefits.
                       in each case our shareholders and lenders received 3.5 percent and the government received 2.7 percent. to
                       strengthen our financial base, 7.9 percent was retained in the company.

financial situation
finance strategy
the leoni group endeavours to have a permanently solid, balanced finance structure. the aim is to have and
maintain an equity ratio of at least 35 percent and gearing (debt/equity ratio) below 50 percent so as to last-
ingly safeguard the company’s strong acceptance by the capital market as well as banks and suppliers. we use
the capital market to cover our long-term financing requirement. we obtain short-term finance via credit lines
from our core banks. deutsche bundesbank has rated leoni as an eligible borrower for more than a decade.
the rating agencies are not commissioned to issue a rating because this would, in our view, not provide any
added benefit. leoni does not have any financial covenants to fulfil for borrowings.
 our growth is normally to be funded via net cash flow. furthermore, we take care that significant expansion
surges – especially in the case of acquisitions – are backed to an appropriate extent by equity. details on capi-
tal management are contained in the notes.                                                                                     notes
                                                                                                                               ›› page 193


finance and liquidity management
the leoni group’s financial management is handled by the leoni ag holding company. it takes the necessary
measures for the entire group of companies, based on ascertaining the capital requirement at corporate level.
in exceptional cases we transact regional, special finance deals. the most important objectives of financial
management are safeguarding the group’s liquidity worldwide, optimising finance costs and revenue as well
as controlling and minimising currency and interest rate risks. we use a wide range of instruments to keep our
exposure to individual markets or types of finance as low as possible. generally speaking, leoni pursues long-
term collaboration with international banks that is based on mutual trust. group subsidiaries are financed
mostly in their functional currency. as in the previous year, the principal financial liabilities in 2013 were
denominated in euros, russian rubles, us dollars as well as chinese yuan.
 among other means, we manage our liquidity via a cash pooling system with pools in the home countries
of the currencies of most importance to the group. furthermore, leoni ag executes the majority of the pay-
ments for the group.
 in order to be able to reliably meet all our financial obligations at any time, we use capital market instru-
ments such as bonds and borrower’s note loans at the corporate level for the whole group and obtain credit
lines in sufficient amounts. existing credit lines were extended in 2013 to ensure liquidity. on 31 december
2013 there were short and medium-term credit lines from banks amounting to € 478.7 million (previous year:
€ 486.0 million) with terms up to 28 months, of which € 13.8 million were utilised at short term on the report-
ing date (previous year: € 23.9 million).
 the off-balance sheet instruments leasing and factoring, which we use to improve liquidity, are also man-
aged at head office. factoring in particular constitutes an important addition to the other short-term liquidity
management instruments because of its flexibility with respect to the trend of sales and the associated need
for finance. at the end of 2013, factoring reduced trade receivables by the amount of € 122.5 million (previous
year: € 91.3 million). of the other liabilities, € 18.0 million (previous year: € 32.3 million) was due to the receipt
of payment on receivables that were sold within factoring agreements. details on leasing are contained in the
notes.                                                                                                                         notes

                                     interest rate and currency hedging
                                     interest rate risks on money-raising measures are hedged with underlying instruments such as swaps and
                                     collars. as at 31 december 2013 the nominal volume of existing interest rate swaps amounted to € 63.5 million
                                     (previous year: € 63.5 million). there were no collars on the balance sheet date (previous year: € 136.0 million).
                                     an interest rate derivative contract was also signed in 2013 as part of having taken out a new borrower’s note
                                     loan in the amount of € 25 million.
                                       to minimise the impact of exchange rate variation on consolidated earnings, foreign currency items are net-
                                     ted within the group. for the other amounts we make use of currency hedging transactions; mostly in pounds
                                     sterling, mexican pesos, polish zloty, romanian leu, swiss francs and us dollars. at the end of 2013, they
                                     totalled € 462.4 million versus € 484.4 million on the same closing day one year earlier. further information on
                 notes               interest rate and currency risks is contained in the notes.

                                     new financing transacted as planned
                                     leoni secured the refinancing due in 2013 early by having successfully placed a borrower’s note loan in the
                                     amount of € 250 million in september 2012 and having signed a development loan, which can be drawn flex-
                                     ibly, with the european investment bank (eib) in the amount of € 100 million in december 2012. this enabled
                                     us not only to repay the bond in the amount of € 200 million due in 2013 and a borrower’s note loan in the
                                     amount of € 24 million, but also to realign our entire finance structure on favourable terms. due to the current
                                     low interest rate level, we also placed a borrower’s note loan in the amount of € 25 million in november 2013,
                                     which matures in 2020. our finance is thereby assured for the long term.

                                     the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) for the leoni group rose to 8.19 percent in 2013 (previous year:
                                     7.92 percent), due above all to the larger proportion of equity. the return on capital employed (roce) stood at
                                     13.2 percent (previous year: 20.9 percent) and was thus below the 15 percent target for 2013.

statement of cash flows: operating cash flow of € 187.4 million
operating activities provided leoni with cash of € 187.4 million in 2013, as opposed to € 211.7 million in the
previous year. above all, this reflected the decrease in earnings and an increase in working capital. the addi-
tional amount of funds tied up in working capital was related to the sales growth, the numerous new product
start-ups and strategic accumulation of inventory in the wiring systems division.
     the amount of cash used for capital spending activity was up from € 125.5 million in the previous year to
€ 150.7 million. the 2012 figure included, unlike the year under report, a net inflow of € 22.7 million from
acquisitions and disposal of subsidiaries.
     the successfully implemented refinancing measures entailed major changes in the year under report:
new loans provided us with cash totalling € 165.5 million, of which a low-interest loan with a five-year term
accounted for a nominal amount of € 100 million. this inflow and some of our liquid funds were used to settle
financial liabilities in the amount of € 251.7 million. there was also a payout of € 49.0 million in dividends. the
bottom line involved cash used for financing activity amounting to € 135.7 million (previous year: cash used in
the amount of € 153.6 million).
     when taking the cash inflows and outflows as well as exchange rate-related changes in the negative amount
of € 1.4 million into account, the result was a drop of € 100.3 million in cash and cash equivalents to € 198.0
million.
     free cash flow before acquisitions and divestments came to € 36.7 million in 2013, down from 63.5 million in
the previous year.

during the year under report, germany, where there was a significant increase, accounted for the largest
proportion of capital expenditure. we also substantially increased our investment in asia and the americas,
whereas it was down in north africa, eastern europe and the rest of europe.

asset situation
equity ratio improved
leoni ag’s consolidated balance sheet came to € 2,399.7 million as at 31 december 2013 as opposed to
€ 2,386.4 million at the end of 2012. on the asset side, this moderate balance sheet enlargement was due
mainly to the larger items of property, plant and equipment, which were up by nearly 5 percent to € 709.8 mil-
lion. this is primarily a reflection of our proactive capital investment policy. intangible assets were down from
€ 91.1 million to € 82.3 million due to normal amortisation. overall, non-current assets increased by about
5 percent year on year to € 1,067.4 million.

                       by contrast, current assets were down by approx. 3 percent to € 1,332.4 million. primarily, this reflected the
                       reduction in cash and cash equivalents from € 298.3 million to € 198.0 million. we used this liquidity to repay
                       financial liabilities and to pay the dividend. we also used cash to accumulate inventory by more than
                       4 percent to € 509.7 million as well as the total of trade receivables by about 9 percent to € 502.7 million.
                            the item ‘assets held for sale’ in the amount of € 8.0 million (previous year: nil) involved a building at our
                       facility in bouznika, morocco, which was restructured in 2013.
                            on the liabilities side of the balance sheet, there was a considerable shift between current and non-current
                       financial liabilities as a consequence of the refinancing measures. as described above, we concluded a low-in-
                       terest development loan with the european investment bank (eib) amounting to € 100 million in december
                       2012, which was used in 2013 to repay part of the still existing bond in the nominal amount of € 200 million.
                       we used cash on hand to settle the then remaining partial amount. in november 2013, we placed another bor-
                       rower’s note loan in the amount of € 25 million, which matures in 2020, because of the currently low interest
                       rate level. in total, non-current financial liabilities amounted to € 413.7 million at the end of 2013 as opposed to
                       € 276.6 million one year earlier. this increase was also the key reason for the rise in total non-current liabilities
                       from € 479.6 million to € 608.5 million.
                            as the still existing bond matured in less than one year at the time of repayment, it was recognised under
                       current financial liabilities. with its on-schedule repayment in july 2013 and settlement of a borrower’s note
                       loan in the nominal amount of € 24.0 million, which was already executed in the first quarter, this item was
                       down significantly from € 270.8 million at the end of december 2012 to € 41.3 million on 31 december 2013.
                            net financial liabilities amounted to about € 257.0 million at the end of the year, comparing with € 249.2
                       million at the end of 2012.
                            other current financial liabilities were down from € 44.7 million to € 23.6 million due to diminished obliga-
                       tions vis-à-vis factoring partners. on the other hand, trade liabilities rose by € 80.4 million to € 675.1 million
                       and current provisions were up by more than 3 percent to € 37.1 million. the latter was due to restructuring
                       measures that we initiated during the period under report. overall, the sum of current liabilities was down by
                       approx. 14 percent to € 963.6 million.
                            equity rose from € 784.0 million to € 827.6 million as a result of the net income generated. this comprised an
                       increase in retained earnings of nearly 12 percent to € 537.2 million despite the dividend payout of € 49.0 mil-
                       lion. the item accumulated other comprehensive income increased from negative € 22.0 million to negative
                       € 34.5 million because of negative effects of currency translation not recognised in income. the equity ratio
                       improved from 32.9 percent to 34.5 percent.

off-balance sheet assets
alongside the assets presented on the consolidated balance sheet, the group also uses off-balance sheet
assets. these are intangible assets that are not permitted to be entered on the balance sheet because of the

                       procurement
                       cost of materials rises roughly in proportion to sales
                       the raw and plastic materials as well as components purchased account for a large proportion of leoni’s con-
                       solidated sales. in 2013 the group-wide cost of materials rose by nearly 3 percent to € 2,352.0 million, equating
                       to 60.0 percent of sales and down from 60.2 percent in the previous year.
                         in the wire & cable solutions division the cost of materials decreased slightly from € 1,173.0 million in the
                       previous year to € 1,168.4 million; this again equated to approx. 73 percent of external sales. copper remains
                       the most important raw material with a quantity of more than 100,000 tons. in addition there are such other
                       metals as nickel, silver and tin. as in the previous year, plastics were the second-largest group of materials
                       with more than 50,000 tons. these included such special insulation materials as polyurethane, thermoplastic
                       elastomers and fluoropolymers; such standard plastics as polyethylene and polyvinylchloride and plasticizers
                       for production of pvc components. the wiring systems division buys cables and conductors for the manu-
                       facture of wiring systems mostly from the wire & cable solutions division, but it also uses outside suppliers.
                       connectors and fixings, on the other hand, are largely sourced externally. the division’s cost of materials
                       amounted to € 1,351.0 million for the period under report, up from € 1,288.6 million in the previous year when
                       it likewise corresponded to about 58 percent of external sales.

                       metals prices down significantly in 2013
                       leoni sources its key raw material, copper, from major strategic suppliers, with the price geared to that
                       quoted on the london metal exchange. starting at € 6.18 per kg in 2013, the price of copper reached its high
                       of € 6.29 per kg straightaway on 3 january and then declined significantly in the first half of the year. the price
                       hit its low of € 5.14 per kg at the end of june. thereafter the price of copper initially edged upwards and then
                       moved sideways to € 5.45 per kg at the end of the year. on average, copper cost € 5.59 per kilogramme in
                       2013, 11 percent less than the 2012 figure of € 6.27. the average prices of silver and nickel also dropped consid-
                       erably in 2013: silver was down by 26 percent to € 576.49 per kg and nickel by about 17 percent to € 11.33 per
                       kg. the price of tin, on the other hand, at € 16.83 per kg remained roughly on the previous year’s level.

plastics supply situation only slightly eased
the prices for standard plastics and plasticizers remained relatively stable through the year 2013. the
petrochemical industry responded to the cyclical downturn in demand by adjusting its production capacity,
meaning that supply and demand balanced out at a still relatively high price level. by contrast, special plasti-
cizers for the manufacture of automotive cable compounds became more expensive as shortages repeatedly
occurred.


component procurement increasingly global
as in the previous year, leoni frequently worked with suppliers that are stipulated by customers in the auto-
motive industry as part of being awarded the contract to procure components like connectors and fixings in
2013. purchasing activity for global projects was stepped up in the year under report, especially so in asia and
the americas. we also extended our supplier marketing to encompass our bus electromobility and compo-
nents. we counteracted price increases and procurement bottlenecks by means of intensive, global negotia-
tions with the suppliers as well as with new technologies and by substitution.


supplier relationships internationalised further
enhancing and maintaining supplier capital plays an important role for leoni. the wcs division systematically
continued to develop its supplier management in 2013 especially with respect to qualification and assessment
to ensure reliable supply of raw materials and special insulation materials via suitable suppliers and sources.
the supplier pool was internationalised further and procurement requirements were, wherever possible,
combined worldwide or regionally to stabilise supply and optimise costs. in the wiring systems division, the
supplier pool was enlarged slightly by having extended the activity to bus electromobility and components.
we also developed and set up an it-supported interface to be able to monitor the performance of our suppli-
ers by means of a ‘supplier score card’ in real time and transparently.

                       employees
                       the number of employees rises to more than 61,000
                       the leoni group employed 61,591 people at the end of december of the past year, which is 2,198 more than
                       in the previous year. the wiring systems division had 53,163 employees (previous year: 51,089), with increases
                       mainly at its production facilities in the regions the americas and eastern europe. on the other hand, the
                       number of staff was down especially in north africa because of the plant closure in morocco. the wire & cable
                       solutions division had 8,201 employees on the reporting date (previous year: 8,096), with recruitment mainly
                       in mexico and india being offset by redundancies at the facility in stolberg, germany, which had come under
                       pressure as a result of the iran embargo. the workforce at the leoni ag holding company increased by 19 to
                       227 employees.
                        the vast majority of the overall workforce was again employed outside germany with a total of 57,369
                       people (previous year: 55,221) or a 93.1 percent proportion (previous year: 93.0 percent). leoni had 4,222 em-
                       ployees in germany (previous year: 4,172). 10.7 percent (previous year: 10.9 percent) of all employees worked
                       in high wage countries and 89.3 percent (previous year: 89.1 percent) worked in low-wage countries. leoni
                       also had 13,756 staff on temporary employment contracts at the end of 2013 (previous year: 8,952) to be able
                       to respond flexibly to cyclical fluctuation. in addition, there were 5,665 staff working via personnel leasing
                       contracts (previous year: 4,591).
                        the average age in 2013 of employees in germany was 41.0 years (previous year: 40.8 years) and they have
                       been with leoni for an average of 11.4 years (previous year: 11.3). 59 employees celebrated their 25th anniver-
                       sary with the company. 2.6 percent of employees were severely handicapped (previous year: 2.2 percent), 305
                       people (previous year: 225) worked part-time and a further 109 (previous year: 106) were in partial retirement.

aging and constructive setting in order to gain their loyalty to the company. among the aspects contributing
to this are flexible working-time models, extensive advanced training options and performance-related
compensation. occupational health and safety also play an important part in the appeal of a job. you will find
information on this in the sustainability report.                                                                                               sustainability report
                                                                                                                                                ›› page 88


working time models               the existing range of flexible working-time arrangements, like part-time, flexitime
and trust-based working, job-sharing and teleworking, was extended even further in 2013. the objective is to
achieve a better work-life balance and thereby greater diversity in the workforce. to do so, we extended our
range of teleworking options to include a flexible one that allows a greater proportion of the workforce to par-
ticipate. staff who have the corresponding facility can perform up to 20 percent of their working time in their
home office. this ‘leoni@home flex’ solution is currently a pilot project at the two divisional headquarters in
kitzingen and roth and is in the future to be offered at all locations in germany. leoni also devised a plan for
family caregiver leave based on the new legislation in this respect.

                                         performance-related compensation            the performance-related compensation programme in line with
                                         that for the management board to create greater incentive and to reward the contributions of individual teams
                                         to corporate success was continued in 2013. the target criteria of this incentive compensation programme
                                         are return on capital employed, liquidity and sales performance in the respective organisational unit as well
                                         as additional, individual parameters based on the corporate strategy. the plan is to update this programme in
                                         2014. we also continued to offer an unchanged, attractive corporate pension plan involving pay conversion.


                                         company suggestion scheme          stemming from the ideas management system revised in the previous year,
                                         about 18,500 suggestions for improvement were deemed useful and implemented in 2013 (previous year:
                                         nearly 14,000).


                                         advanced training       leoni offers its employees worldwide a wide range of advanced training opportunities
                                         both within and outside the company. alongside multifaceted, trade-specific qualifications, these also include
                                         language and it courses as well as administration and project management courses. in germany during the
                                         year under report, we organised 1,110 training events (previous year: 1,054) for 4,267 participants (previous
                                         year: 3,698). to underpin the company’s increasingly global outlook, we established uniform worldwide stand-
                                         ards for management training and internationalised the management training scheme.
                                          there was also outside affirmation in 2013 of leoni’s appeal as a place of work: the top employers institute
                                         commended leoni as ‘top employer germany’ as well as ‘top employer automotive’, while the burda-verlag
                                         publishing house commended us as one of germany’s best employers.


                                         promoting diversity
                                         leoni endeavours to establish a prejudice-free working environment that does not discriminate against
                                         anyone. corresponding instructions are contained in the company’s own policy documents and in external
                 sustainability report   declarations on principle, which leoni has signed.

                                          to enhance diversity within the company, management positions in the regions are increasingly being
                                         given to non-german candidates. leoni also participates in an initiative, which is supported by the bavarian
                                         educational institute for industry and commerce, to promote tunisian engineers and has launched a project
                                         to occupy engineer positions with suitable candidates from eastern european countries. leoni is expanding
                                         its employment of women by way not only of a large number of flexible, family-friendly working-time models,
                                         but also by participating in the ‘women in management positions’ project that aims to promote the careers
                                         of female trade-qualified staff and junior managers. again in 2013, we organised ‘girls’ days’, which provided
                                         girls still at school with information on technical careers at leoni. during the year under report, women ac-
                                         counted for 54 percent (previous year: 56 percent) of the overall workforce and occupied 25 percent (previous
                                         year: 23 percent) of the management positions.


                                         training and starting a career
                                         leoni employed 150 apprentices (previous year: 155) in germany on 31 december 2013. they were learning
                                         their trades at eleven facilities in state-of-the-art classrooms and in some cases with their own training work-
                                         shops. the number of mainstream commercial and trade apprenticeships increased to 21, among which the
                                         new and resumed courses covered the trades of machinery and plant operator as well as warehouse logistics
                                         and information technology.

                                                                                                 group management report   | further performance indicators   |   83

at our key apprenticeship facility in roth we again in 2013 complemented career preparation with the leoni
junior group – a company within a company that is run by apprentices with full responsibility. the aim is to
teach overarching skills. the apprentices in technical trades at this facility furthermore have a modern study
island at their disposal. for our next generation in china there is a technical training center based on the
german model, where our junior employees receive specialist training towards mechanical and electrical
qualifications.
 in 2013, 22 leoni apprenticeship graduates were commended with very good test scores. in collaboration
with roth’s secondary school, the apprentices of the wire & cable solutions division facility in roth won the
writing competition of the employers’ association for the bavarian metalworking and electrical industries.
 as part of the ‘power (me)’ project of the bavarian industry association, leoni again in the past year pro-
vided also those young people who had difficulty finding an apprenticeship place with an opportunity and
looked after them closely. at the same time, former apprentices with potential as well as very good achieve-
ments and final examination scores were granted scholarships. leoni also funds, either partly or in full,
courses or study related to particular occupations and qualifications.
 eighteen young people (previous year 19) took advantage in the past financial year of the option of a
combined course of study. this involved, among others, youngsters studying at dual course universities, who
completed their practical semester at leoni. courses towards bachelor degrees in mechatronics and business
information systems were added in 2013. there was also again the opportunity to take the twin-track course
of study including mechanical engineering to do an industrial mechanic apprenticeship at leoni. further-
more and as in the preceding years, university graduates were able to do a trainee programme or join the
company directly in certain positions. the wiring systems division offered business-specific trainee pro-
grammes for the first time.


recruitment of young people
to promote the interest of school pupils in leoni as an employer, we again in 2013 collaborated closely
with schools, for instance in the form of application coaching or a questionnaire on career choices. we also
presented our company at career choice fairs and career information days, the ‘night of the future’ appren-
ticeship fair as well as other school contact events. youths were offered school trips and increasingly also
trial internships. potential future apprentices were also again able during an introductory event to familiarise
themselves more closely with the company and prospective colleagues before embarking on a career.
 during the year under report, leoni established initial contact with students at about 30 university and
corporate jobs fairs, by offering excursion trips to leoni facilities and project work with various universities
and technical colleges. we also again promoted highly qualified students in the context of the ‘scholarship

                       germany’ programme as well as with participating teams in university competitions such as the ‘automotive
                       supplier trophy’, the ‘elbflorace’ and ‘formula student germany’. university final paper work, internships in
                       and outside germany, student work placements and casual employment also raised the recognition of leoni
                       as an appealing employer. in addition, the company provided mentor sponsorship of university students,
                       trade presentations and organised a leoni day at the university of würzburg-schweinfurt.


                       human resource strategy and organisation
                       leoni’s human resource strategy aims to present the company as an attractive employer also in the future
                       and to underpin the projected growth in structural terms. the hr solutions project launched for this purpose
                       in the previous year for group-wide harmonisation of standards, structures and processes was taken further
                       forward in 2013. it is based on a uniform core data model, which we introduced in the ukraine last year as the
                       first country. the global shared service center in romania also commenced its work in this context. there
                       were also initial pilot projects in germany and switzerland in the areas of travel management, international
                       assignment and global recruitment. a central travel office was set up for leoni companies in germany, which
                       will be the first to implement the travel guidelines that apply worldwide and were also redefined in 2013.
                       in the wiring systems division, we furthermore started to standardise talent development and systematic
                       succession planning at all facilities. the programmes involving individual human resource development and
                       succession planning have for this reason already been combined in many countries.




                       research & development
                       r & d objectives
                       leoni’s in-depth research & development (r & d) work is aimed at developing products and solutions, further
                       enhancing our leading competitive position in many markets as well as developing additional customer
                       groups. enhancing our systems expertise as well as the efficiency of our production processes also constitute
                       important aims. we are furthermore endeavouring to become the most innovative provider of cables for
                       environmentally friendly technologies (green technology).


                       organisation
                       the responsibility for r & d work lies in the two business divisions and their specialist departments. the
                       wiring systems division operates development centres in, among other countries, china, germany, france,
                       the united kingdom, south korea and the united states; i.e. the markets of greatest importance to our wiring
                       systems business around the world. the wsd head office department in kitzingen also does basic research
                       and provides project-related support. in 2013, the electromobility know-how within the wiring systems divi-
                       sion was pooled in business unit electromobility. in addition, we realigned our shared development work with
                       intedis gmbh & co kg, our joint venture with hella kgaa hueck & co. intedis’ activity will in the future be split
                       into six innovation clusters that involve a high degree of synergies for the parent companies.

                                                                                                group management report   | further performance indicators   |   85




in the wire & cable solutions division, development work is done primarily at the larger facilities in germany
and switzerland, but increasingly also in the important markets of asia and north america. in addition, there
is the research & development department within the head office business development function, which runs
division-wide innovation and application-oriented development projects. additional impetus stemmed from
a new strategy department within business development, which generates innovation ideas and provides
methodologies for sustained innovation and technology management.
 the r & d specialists of the two divisions collaborate closely in many areas of work. leoni can thereby com-
bine a wide variety of know-how for specific tasks, thus achieving synergies also in the interests of customers.


focal areas of development
as in the preceding years, the wiring systems division’s r & d work in 2013 was focused on the development
of customised, project-related wirings systems. reducing the weight and costs of cable harnesses, sizing as
well as the use of alternative conductor materials also played an important role. we simultaneously forged
ahead with the development of further high-voltage components and of the 48-volt wiring system, which,
among other things, raises the efficiency of the components and, thanks to smaller conductor cross-sections,
leads directly to weight savings.
 the wire & cable solutions division during the year under report continued to work on a large number of
customer and market-specific projects, including expansion of its portfolio of halogen-free cables, miniatur-
ised cables, fiber optic cables and production for high-frequency applications. apart from the automotive
industry, the most important target markets include medical technology, the capital goods industry and the
infrastructure sector. we also stepped up optimisation of our metals and alloys production processes.


r & d spending up more than 14 percent
group-wide, spending on research and development increased by more than 14 percent to € 106.1 million in
2013, which equated to 2.7 percent of consolidated sales (previous year: 2.5 percent). assets furthermore in-
cluded € 0.2 million in capitalised development costs (previous year: nil). the deferred development costs and
those capitalised as receivables amounted to € 21.5 million in the financial year (previous year: € 15.2 million).
at the end of 2013, 1,347 employees (previous year: 1,329), or 2.2 percent of the total workforce as in the
previous year, worked in r & d; of that, 359 (previous year 392) in the wire & cable solutions division and 988
(previous year: 937) in the wiring systems division.
 the wiring systems division’s spending on r & d in the period under report rose by about 14 percent to
€ 94.4 million, or 4.1 percent of the division’s sales. numerous new product start-ups were the reason. the
wire & cable solutions division accounted for € 12.9 million; about 13 percent more than in the previous year,
which works out to a proportion of the division’s sales of approx. 0.7 percent.

                       results of r & d work
                       our strategic objective of enhancing leoni’s power of innovation demonstrated effect during the year under
                       report: in 2013, we completed numerous, customer-specific development projects, took products to the
                       marketability stage and registered proprietary rights. the number of submitted patents and utility models
                       rose from 26 to 42, of which 24 in the wiring systems division (previous year 17) and 18 in the wire & cable
                       solutions division (previous year 9). two of our development projects also received awards. the chinese car
                       and automotive parts magazine ‘orientauto’ presented our innovative foam-moulding technology and its
                       applications with the innovation award at tongji university in shanghai. and a dissertation overseen by
                       leoni on the topic of electric energy generation from waste car heat was given the innovation prize of the
                       ‘quer.kraft’ association.
                        some of our key new developments are described hereinafter. many of these innovations also strengthen
                       our position in the green technology segment thanks to weight reduction and the use of environmentally
                       friendly materials.


                       aluminium as a conductor material            the use of aluminium in the cable harness was again of great sig-
                       nificance to the application-related projects in the wiring systems division. this enables costs to be saved and
                       the environment to be spared because the proportion of copper in the wiring system is reduced and therefore

                                                                                                 group management report   | further performance indicators   |   87




also the vehicle’s weight and co2 emissions. we successfully validated corresponding prototypes and started
initial mass-production deployment in cars in the past financial year.


optimised wiring system architecture            in 2013 we further developed our methods for sizing cable har-
nesses by considering in the layout, on the one hand, safeguarding of the vehicle as well as its functions and,
on the other hand, adjusted downsizing to simultaneously tap further optimisation potential in a toolchain.
to do so, leoni uses a combination of simulating physical sizes, measuring them in operating condition and
targeted analysis of customer specifications.


innovative insulation materials         the wire & cable solutions division worked, among other things, on
various new insulation materials for automotive cables, which are scheduled for market launch in 2014 and
will also make a contribution to sustained sparing of resources. for instance, we are currently developing a
pvc-based insulation material for automotive cables with an ultra-thin wall to reduce weight and installation
space. furthermore, a halogen-free insulation material, which is suited to temperatures of up to 125 degrees
celsius and is simultaneously abrasion proof as well as resistant to dirt and oil, is particularly environmentally
friendly.


intelligent solutions for the capital goods industry             leoni presented the robotics market with its
lsh 3 umbilical solution in the year under report. this new generation of power supply systems to include
cables as well as pneumatic and hydraulic components reduces, thanks to its innovative design, the risk of
potential clashes and further enhances our systems expertise. with a hybrid cable that has an ethernet core,
we also developed a particularly robust product for various types of drive systems, which transfers both data
and power and thereby reduces the amount of cabling by up to 85 percent.


more patient comfort        leoni also further underpinned its systems expertise in the medical technology
sector in 2013. we developed our leoni orion high-precision and intuitive patient positioning system for can-
cer radiation therapy based on our extensive experience in robotics and programming. leoni orion facilitates
especially rapid and precise treatment and is scheduled for market launch in 2014. another novelty involves an
innovative process for refining silicone cables, which we registered for patent in 2013. this makes the cables
for near-patient applications like ultrasound, minimally invasive diagnostics and treatment smoother, thereby
making it possible to avoid unwanted adhesion effects on the patient’s skin.


basic research and collaboration
in our basic research work, we continued our multifaceted collaboration and projects in 2013, and gained sig-
nificant new findings. in the wiring systems division, for example, we made substantial progress in aluminium
joining technology be means of crimping and ultrasonic welding. in the field of plastic foam-moulding, we
qualified several types of foam with improved properties for use in mass production and developed a cost-ef-
fective high temperature foam with temperature stability of up to 130 degrees celsius and an integrated
foaming process. the subsidised ‘high-teg’ joint venture project to produce thermoelectric generators with
textile methods, which enables waste heat in cars to be used to generate electrical power, was successfully
taken further forward.
 among other things, the wire & cable solutions division participated in the 100 gigabit research project,
which is aiming for a technological leap in data transmission. another important joint project involves the
‘signal conductor’ project to develop metallurgical materials and processes for manufacturing signal transmis-
sion cables. we are, furthermore, collaborating with technische hochschule nürnberg (technical university of

                                           nuremberg), süddeutsches kunststoffzentrum (the south german institute for plastics) as well as the fraun-
                                           hofer institutes for integrated circuits, for production technology and for automation. some know-how was
                                           also acquired with outside institutions in the context of this collaboration, but generally to an insignificant
                                           extent only.
                                            to exchange ideas on the latest technological trends with other companies, we are, among other things,
                                           also members of the ‘forschungsvereinigung räumliche elektronische baugruppen’ (3-d mid e.v.) , partners
                                           in the ‘automotive’ and ‘new materials’ group of bayern innovativ, the bavarian centre established jointly by
                                           government as well as the business and scientific communities for innovation and technology transfer, and
                                           represented in various interest groups on the topic of mobility.

                                           in both of its divisions leoni works continuously on improving the efficiency of its quality management sys-
                                           tems to ensure the high level of reliability and quality of its products, services and processes. during the peri-
                                           od under report, the wiring systems division for instance continued to work on pooling its activity involving
                                           quality management, the she area and our lpsplus productivity system. the effectiveness of this integrated
                                           management system is in the future to be reviewed by way of joint audits. in 2013 as well, all of the wiring
                                           systems division’s facilities were certified to the iso/ts 16949 automotive industry standard and successfully
                                           passed the repeat audits that were due. in addition there were customer-specific audits for particular facilities
                                           and projects.
                                            in the wire & cable solutions division we integrated the human resource processes that apply group-wide
                                           into the division’s management system in 2013 and implemented many separate measures to improve quality
                                           at the individual facilities. three subsidiaries in india, japan and slovakia were iso 9001 certified for the first

time, meaning that all of the division’s companies now fulfil this quality standard. in addition, ten plants are
certified to the iso/ts 16949 automotive industry standard, three to the iso 13485 medical technology stand-
ard and two to the en 9100 aerospace standard.
  various awards from customers in 2013 also underscored the high quality of our products and our dependa-
bility as a partner:

staff and social matters
our employees are a crucial factor for leoni’s sustained expansion. we regard successful recruitment, basic
and advanced training of staff, provision of attractive jobs as well as ensuring equal rights as key indicators for                   employees
                                                                                                                                      ›› page 80
sustainability; likewise healthy and safe working conditions. against the backdrop of increasing international-
isation with worldwide production activity, we have been committing ourselves ever since 2003 in a ‘decla-                            occupational health
ration on social rights and industrial relations’ (social charta) to ensuring human rights and fundamental                            and safety
                                                                                                                                      ›› page 90
employee protection rights at all of our locations. in so doing, leoni adheres globally to the requirements of
the international labour office (ilo) of the united nations. adherence to these standards is regularly reviewed
at all of our facilities worldwide by our internal auditing.
  we also encourage our business partners to match our standards. leoni’s general purchasing conditions
oblige suppliers to observe our social charta and the principles of the un global compact. serious and repeat-
ed breaches of the principles stipulated therein entitle leoni to terminate the supply relationship immedi-
ately. in the wiring systems division, observance of the un global compact principles is also checked using a
supplier self-audit. only companies that agree to either leoni’s social charta or the un global compact are
accepted as suppliers.
  in social terms, leoni commits itself with donations for and sponsorship of various projects and institutions.
the sponsorship concept, which was newly devised in the previous year and that provides for use of most of
this support for social projects, was continued in 2013. to a lesser extent there were in addition contributions
to culture, education and science as well as sport. the largest single donation in the year under report went to
two sos kinderdorf projects in china.

                                     leoni’s two divisions have since 2013 had she guidelines consistent in their content. the primary objective is
                                     to prevent accidents at work and work-related illnesses as well as to reduce environmental impact. in the wir-
                                     ing systems division, 22 facilities successfully passed multi-site certification to the iso 14001 environmental
                                     protection standard for the first time in the year under report. in addition, five facilities were certified to the
                                     oshas 18001 occupational health and safety standard and another was emas light certified. we further-
                                     more conducted internal audits at twelve facilities in brazil, germany, morocco, portugal, romania, russia
                                     and tunisia. having set iso 14001 and oshas 18001 as the parameters for facilities of the wiring systems
                                     division established the basis for also gearing and internally auditing other plants in the future, which not yet
                                     certified according to these standards. in the wcs division, three facilities were certified to the environmental
                                     standards for the first time in 2013, one of which – leoni special cables in friesoythe – also to the iso 50001
                                     energy management standard for the first time. overall, 26 legal entities (51 percent) have the iso 14001
                                     certificate and seven of them are also emas validated.


                                     she activity
                                     leoni invested at various facilities in further enhancement of safety at work in 2013. the focal areas were, for
                                     example, the area of electroplating as well ergonomic optimisation of assembly work stations. in the wiring
                                     systems division, the work accident statistics were adjusted to the internationally recognised oshas. either
                                     way, the work accident rate was below the sector average during the year under report.
                                      due to the growing number of foreign assignments, leoni has since 2012 used the services of a leading
                                     provider of travel safety, healthcare and medical advice in foreign countries. the foreign healthcare insurance
                                     cover for employees was also extended in the year under report. in addition, we introduced a standard in the
                                     wiring systems division that is consistent worldwide for organisation of first aid and healthcare to improve
                                     the medical and emergency care provided.
                                      in the plant and equipment-intensive wire & cable solutions division, we again obliged all of the larger
                                     facilities to each implement a project to raise energy efficiency. in 2013 we achieved, for example, significant
                                     energy and cost savings in wire production by using self-generated nitrogen in wire drawing at our facility
                                     in bad kötzting, germany, and better regulation of the compressed air station at our plant in cinderford,
                                     england. on the cable production line at our plant in roth, germany we switched to combined cycle cooling
                                     and thereby substantially lowered our energy and water consumption. at the same facility we also installed
                                     thermostats covering all of the production space, thanks to which warmth is distributed more evenly and
                                     both mean room temperature and heating costs were lowered. a new, division-wide guideline on considering
                                     energy efficiency in the procurement of production plant and technical infrastructure will in the future also
                                     contribute to reducing energy consumption.

                                                                                                group management report    | sustainability report   |   91




energy consumption and co2 emissions in the group
as part of its un global compact communication on progress (cop), leoni has since 2012 made public the
trend in its group-wide energy use and co2 emissions. we regard both of these figures as key indicators for
sustainability. the figures available by the date of the management report refer to 2012: this year we succeed-
ed in reducing our energy consumption relative to sales by 2.5 percent. our co2 emissions rose by 4.4 percent
in absolute terms due, among other factors, to major preparatory work for new projects in the wiring systems
division. this meant a 1.5 percent increase per € 1 million of sales and no change per employee. the data for
2013 will be available at the end of march 2014 and will be made public in the next cop.

carbon disclosure project
leoni participated in the carbon disclosure project for the sixth time in 2013. on behalf of institutional inves-
tors, the initiative surveyed among other things the co2 emissions of the 350 largest, market-listed companies
in the german-speaking area. the corresponding 2012 figures were ascertained during the year under report.
compared with other companies in the automotive and cable sectors that participated in the carbon disclo-
sure project, leoni’s emission readings were well below the average measured both as a proportion of sales
and relative to the number of employees.


recycling
leoni participates in the ‘our cars’ initiative and thus in projects to recycle them, such as the eu end-of-life
vehicle directive, for example. by using copper, the principal component in our products and a material that is
100 percent recyclable, we have a very good starting position in this respect.


green technology
leoni understands the term ‘green technology’ as encompassing all products, system solutions and services
that make the use of energy more efficient and easier on resources, thereby reducing emissions and pollution
of the environment. leoni already serves all of the most significant markets for environmental technologies as
defined by the bundesumweltministerium (bmu), and is very well positioned in many of these sectors.

risk and opportunity report
as a company with an international outlook and operating accordingly, leoni is regularly confronted with
risks and opportunities. our objective is to accept risks only when the associated opportunities can be expect-
ed to be make an appropriate contribution to enterprise value and any threat to continued existence can be
ruled out. to do so we have set up an effective risk and opportunity management system. as a general rule,
risks and opportunities are defined at leoni as deviation from the planned result.

risk management system
leoni has a multi-stage risk management system as well as other, supporting control systems for early identi-
fication of risks that might threaten the company’s continued existence. this group-wide system encompass-
es the corporate risk manager and two area risk managers as well as the managers involved in the operations
of all relevant business areas. a unit that reports directly to the management board is in charge of monitoring
and coordinating the risk management process at head office. it also determines and describes the group’s
overall risk situation.
 risk management is integrated in the existing planning, controlling as well as information systems and cov-
ers all companies in the leoni group worldwide. the group-wide internal control system and the compliance
management system also complement the risk management system.

                       the primary instrument for identifying and assessing risk comprises the risk workshops that are held once a
                       year for the divisions and the holding company, during which the inventory of risks of the divisions and of the
                       group is updated, a training session is held and the likely range of fluctuation in market risks is estimated for
                       the aggregate statement. we run these risk workshops for the divisions and for the leoni group. prior to these
                       events, the corporate risk manager and the responsible area risk managers conduct separate interviews with
                       the operations managers for each business group/unit of the two divisions.
                            the responsibility for indentifying, assessing and dealing with risk always remains with the respective risk
                       owner. dealing with risk is prioritised by the maximum possible loss. insurance solutions, so far as they are
                       commercially viable, play a large part in this respect. as soon as a risk-minimising measure has been imple-
                       mented, the potential maximum loss is reduced by this factor.


                       reporting        via the risk reporting system, an assessment of the risk situation is made per quarter and dis-
                       cussed with the management board. the change in the value-at-risk for the budget year serves as the overall
                       indicator. this information and the twelve most significant (top 12) risks are presented to the management
                       board and the supervisory board on an annual basis. in the risk management of the divisions, risk reporting
                       is carried out with the help of a risk reporting sheet at least quarterly at the business group level. the focus
                       here is on the top 10 risks per division and the top 12 risks at group level. the risks reported in the divisions
                       using the risk reporting sheet are verified by the risk management of the divisions and entered on a central
                       risk database on a quarterly basis as well as updated with any risk reduction that has taken place as a result of
                       initiated countermeasures.


                       the management board receives a quarterly risk report with the following content:
                       ■■   top risks per division and for the leoni group
                       ■■   risk status and trend relative to risk-bearing capacity
                       ■■   current risks with a potential maximum loss of more than € 500,000
                       ■■   compliance status of the leoni group
                       ■■   status of the leoni group’s internal control system


                       the quarterly risk report for the respective fourth quarter is replaced by the report on risk aggregation and the
                       findings of the risk workshops. the risk aggregation takes place immediately after the risk workshops and is
                       reported to the management board and to the supervisory board. in addition to the ongoing reporting, there
                       is also the option of ad-hoc risk reporting.

                       risk management system. the effectiveness of the risk management system is examined once a year by the
                       audit committee and the auditors as well as every three years by the internal audit department and outside
                       experts.

opportunity management system
the identification, awareness and exploitation of opportunities of the leoni group is managed on a decen-
tralised basis under operations management. forming the basis for this is the target agreement and strategy
process originating from the management board. outside forecasts and market analyses also support oppor-
tunity management. it is integrated in the risk management and controlling process at the respective business
group / unit levels as well as in the principal projects of the wiring systems division.


reporting­  the documentation is prepared by our operational managers on the basis of an annual risk/op-
portunity comparison by our operational managers per business group / unit as well as for significant projects
and condensed for the management board and the supervisory board in an aggregate statement, for which
we make use of what is known as monte carlo simulation.


process improvement          process improvement for the opportunity management system occurs via the risk
management system.



internal control system
the task of leoni ag’s internal control system is to document the group-wide controls pertaining the princi-
pal process risks, to fulfil the legal obligations stemming from the 8th eu directive and their implementation
in the german act on the modernisation of accounting law (bilmog) as well as to identify weaknesses in the
control system.
 the operational and organisational structure of the internal control system is, at leoni, divided into four
local control levels (corporate departments, divisions, business groups/units and local companies) and a cor-
porate documentation level, which is integrated in the risk management system. the locally executed manual
and it-supported controls are documented in risk management at the corporate level as part of a control
self-assessment (csa) process. our control processes are not limited to just accounting-related risks, but also
encompass operating and compliance controls. the corporate internal control committee, which is composed
of the persons responsible for control at the respective head offices and the control level managers, carries
out audits of all control matters and processes involving the internal control system with respect to being up
to date, complete and effective. the control level managers support the process and the persons responsible
for control.


reporting        reporting is done quarterly on the corporate internal control committee and via the quarterly
risk report to the entire management board. the csas submitted by operating management form the basis of
the reporting.


process improvement          the audit committee reviews the internal control system’s effectiveness once a
year. this may involve the auditors presenting weaknesses in the internal control system found during the
annual audit. furthermore, the internal audit department checks on a random basis whether the internal
controls at the four business levels are being carried out.
 recommendations for action that arose from the external audit carried out in 2012 on implementation of the
legal requirements to have an operational and accounting-related control system that is fit for purpose were in
their key points implemented in 2013.

                       the risk management system comprises the totality of all organisational rules and measures to identify risks
                       and for dealing with the risks associated with entrepreneurial activity. with respect to the group accounting
                       process, the following structures and processes have been implemented in the group: the management
                       board bears overall responsibility for the internal control and risk management system with respect to the
                       accounting process in the group. all strategic business segments and units are bound by a firmly defined
                       management and reporting organisation. the principles, the operational and organisational structure as well
                       as the processes of the accounting-related internal control and risk management system are laid down in
                       an internal guideline that is updated at regular intervals to include the latest external and in-house devel-
                       opments. with respect to the accounting process we deem such features of the internal control and risk
                       management system to be significant that could materially influence the accounting and overall information
                       provided in the financial statements and consolidated financial statements including the management report
                       and the group management report. in particular, this involves the following elements:

                       ■■   identification of key areas of risk and control of relevance to the accounting process
                       ■■   monitoring controls for supervising the accounting process and their findings at the level of the manage-

compliance management system
the corporate compliance management system is geared towards prevention in the principal fields of compli-
ance in order to adhere to legal requirements and the company’s own guidelines. the principal compliance
fields include: competition law, export control, prevention of corruption, code of ethics / social charta, the
tread act (duty to report recalls to the us authorities), information security / data protection, taxes and capital
market law (bafin).


e-learning     to further underscore the leoni code of ethics / social charta and anti-corruption compliance
fields, leoni joined the united nations global compact in 2011. the objective is for this compliance standard
also to be applied externally vis-à-vis our customers and suppliers. further information on this is contained in
the sustainability report as well as in the un global compact index. it is the duty of the compliance field man-           sustainability report
                                                                                                                           ›› page 88

                                                                                                                           un global compact index
they are the contacts with respect to all questions arising about their compliance field.                                  ›› page 218
 all operational managers and pertinent staff worldwide regularly participate in training courses on com-
pliance. in 2013 we ran e-learning courses on the compliance fields of information security, prevention of
corruption, product liability, competition law, export control, capital market law, data protection as well as the
general equal treatment act (agg) and the global compact. for 2014 we are planning e-learning courses on
the compliance fields of code of ethics / social charta, antitrust law, export control and data protection. we
currently teach up to 12,500 employees in up to seven languages (arabic, chinese, german, english, french,
spanish and russian). the associated internal guidelines are available in up to twenty languages.


reporting     the persons responsible for risk management are also responsible for compliance. there is also
quarterly compliance reporting in line with the risk reporting. each of the eight aforementioned compliance
fields has one compliance field manager in charge. automated compliance tests by means of self-checks
and a personal undertaking to be submitted by each manager on an annual basis provide compliance with
additional safeguard. the scope of our self-check is determined in consultation with the compliance manager.
the status of checks is presented and other process improvements are agreed on the corporate compliance
committees.


process improvement        the compliance field managers meet quarterly on the corporate compliance com-
mittee and also serve to ensure that our compliance management system is continually improved. potential
for improvement found in the 2011 external audit concerning the structure, appropriateness and effectiveness
of compliance at leoni according to the new ‘idw ps 980 principles of proper auditing of compliance man-
agement systems’ auditing standard has been implemented in the points of significance to leoni. in 2013 we
split the compliance fields of ‘prevention of corruption’ and ‘code of ethics / social charta’ in order thereby to
focus even more sharply on prevention of corruption. the process of ‘investigation’ was set within compliance
management and the internal audit department for further improvement.

                       presentation of the principal risks and opportunities
                       the risks to and opportunities for the leoni group are broken down by the classes of strategic risks/oppor-
                       tunities and market risks/opportunities, operational risks/opportunities, financial risks/opportunities and
                       compliance risks/opportunities. the principal risks (top 12) and opportunities are presented below.


                       strategic risks and market risks
                       we encounter strategic risks and market risks mainly in the areas of
                       ■■   price pressure / fluctuation
                       ■■   procurement market risks
                       ■■   threat to market position and competitive advantages
                       ■■   market trends / fluctuation in sales
                       ■■   location / country risks
                       ■■   market appeal
                       ■■   competitive forces
                       ■■   strategy / organisation / core skills


                       the four principal risks are:


                       economic slump          customers in the automotive industry and among its suppliers account for about 75
                       percent of leoni’s consolidated sales. the current business performance of this sector therefore has great
                       influence on leoni’s business volume and earnings.          measures: leoni has prepared for any cyclical slump
                       in sales by making its cost structure even more flexible.


                       pressure to cut prices          leoni supplies its products to markets that are characterised by fierce compe-
                       tition. the trend prevailing in the automotive industry towards sharing development costs with suppliers
                       also continues to affect leoni.       measures: we confront the unabatedly heavy pressure on prices in the
                       automotive industry with effective, stringent cost management in all areas of our company, setting up more
                       production facilities in low-wage countries and resolutely optimising purchasing prices.


                       copper price fluctuation            leoni uses copper in all of its business segments. the global market price of
                       this raw material, which is subject to substantial fluctuation, therefore exerts a major influence on the cost
                       of materials in the group. if the price of copper rises for a protracted period of time, the lag in passing this
                       cost on to our customers can exert an adverse earnings effect on the reporting date. any substantial drop in
                       demand could, if there is a simultaneous dip in the price of copper, lead to us having to sell at lower prices
                       some of our copper inventory bought forward at higher prices. this would impact negatively on earnings. if
                       the price has fallen sharply up to the reporting date, copper inventories may be exposed to the risk of deval-
                       uation. a shortage of copper stocks could lead to supply bottlenecks and higher copper prices.         measures:
                       this pronounced volatility can, with a time lag, largely be passed on to our customers based on contractual
                       agreements to this effect. leoni prefers long-term and direct supply relationships with copper suppliers to
                       avoid supply bottlenecks.

                                                                                                 group management report   | risk and opportunity report   |   99




fluctuation in the cost of materials         contact systems, which consist of plastic casings and metal con-
tacts, are made mostly with tools stemming from a single source due either to customer requirements or eco-
nomic considerations. rising demand could lead to increases in the costs of our most important raw materials.
this can result in demands for higher prices and therefore in increased procurement costs for the correspond-
ing components, and can furthermore cause supply bottlenecks in the event of shortages.          measures:
international competition has hitherto enabled us to largely avoid any increases in the cost of materials.


strategic opportunities and market opportunities


globalisation, innovation, systems business and cost leadership               thanks to its strategic alignment,
the leoni group has the opportunity to benefit more substantially and more quickly from outside develop-
ments, i.e. to expand its market position and to raise its profitability. the primary approaches to this involve
the four levers of our strategy: by further globalising its operations, leoni can better exploit the opportunities
in the emerging markets and increasingly internationalise its industrial business, which is still quite european
in nature. enhancing the power of innovation provides the opportunity to improve our market position on the
one hand with new products and solutions and, on the other hand, by ongoing optimisation of our processes.
the systems business lever harbours potential in terms of gearing our range of manufacture even more closely
to customer requirements. raising the efficiency of our production structures and processes entails the oppor-
tunity to achieve additional cost benefit and thereby to increase profitability.


the economic cycle       generally speaking, leoni has the opportunity to generate more sales than expected
in the markets it targets by outperforming the overall market and correspondingly rising demand. this applies
especially to the bric countries and south korea. should, for example, the automotive markets in these
countries grow more strongly, leoni could benefit via both direct shipments to these regions and indirectly
by supplying cars exported from europe.


commodity prices       a more favourable trend in commodity prices would benefit leoni’s cost-of-materials
ratio and therefore its margins.


electromobility, green technology and alternative energy generation                   new trends in technology
and society also present leoni with growth opportunities – for instance the growing interest among car
drivers in hybrid and electric drives as well as electrical and electronic innovations in vehicles. green technol-
ogy and energy saving are also playing an ever larger role in virtually all of the other sectors of importance
to leoni. in china and india, for example, we see mounting potential for alternative energy generation using
solar and wind power plant as well as for railway engineering. in general, the key global trends – of mobility,
urbanisation, environmental awareness and shortage of resources, demographic change, globalisation as well
as industrialisation and automation – present leoni with additional expansion opportunities in many areas.

                        operational risks
                        we face operational risks mainly in the areas of
                        ■■   production
                        ■■   purchasing / logistics
                        ■■   personnel
                        ■■   project management
                        ■■   research / development
                        ■■   distribution
                        ■■   information management


                        the six principal risks are:


                        break in the supply chain to our customers           the leoni group had a total of 79 facilities in 33 countries
                        in 2013. policy on choice of location is geared closely to the requirements of our customers, which leoni
                        follows into foreign markets. the constant pressure on prices and costs compels us towards disproportion-
                        ately large increases in production capacity located in low-wage countries. this means that buyers and
                        customers in many instances have to be supplied across several national boundaries. there are also political
                        risks in some countries, for example in north africa and the ukraine. difficult political situations could at any
                        time result in unrest and also strikes at our production facilities in those locations, or in closed seaports and
                        airports. the option of temporary supply from production facilities in other, non-affected countries is severely
                        limited because of the customised products in the wiring systems division. just-in-time delivery and the
                        single-source principle of some customers extend the reach of this risk further. relocation is possible only with
                        a corresponding lead time necessitated by setting up the required production capacity and recruitment. that
                        is why we offer our customers the option of supply from two facilities in different countries. in many cases,
                        however, our customers have decided for economic reasons to continue to share the risk of 100 percent supply
                        from north africa. a break in the supply chain to our customers, due for example to unrest, cybercrime or
                        natural disasters, could result in a supply bottleneck persisting several weeks.    measures: owing to the size
                        it has attained, leoni operates a considerable number of production facilities worldwide, which have backup
                        capacity as is prudent and accepted by the carmakers. furthermore, preventive measures have been applied at
                        all production facilities and are documented in a global emergency plan. these range from a round-the-clock
                        guard service to extensive fire protection systems. furthermore, no leoni facility is located in an area known
                        to be under serious threat of earthquakes, flooding or other natural disasters.


                        start-up and project costs         we successfully started making a large number of new products in the 2013
                        financial year. the current expansion of our production capacity for our customers’ new model ranges is
                        progressing according to plan. should we fail to ensure that production starts on schedule and according to
                        the requirements of our customers, this could have serious consequences for future business and incur heavy
                        exceptional costs.      measures: we enhanced our fully-developed project management for such large pro-
                        jects by setting it up as a separate organisational unit within the wiring systems division. ongoing monitoring
                        ensures that start-up risks are identified and that countermeasures can be applied in good time.

                                                                                                   group management report   | risk and opportunity report   |   101




information management            running a company like leoni that operates on a global scale is only possible
with the help of sophisticated it systems. constant readiness to supply goods and services – especially to the
automotive industry that frequently calls for either just-in-time or just-in-sequence delivery – also depends
on the availability of it systems and their data at all times. serious disruption such as system outages, attacks
on our networks, loss or corrupting of data could threaten leoni’s ability to supply, temporarily stop custom-
ers’ production and hence result in having to face far-reaching claims for compensation.         measures: leoni
therefore constantly works – in some instances with the support of outside specialists – at optimising its it
set-up, both in terms of concept and operation. one example of this is having a second, backup computer
centre as an emergency system. an information security and data protection officer who reports directly to
the management board demonstrates the very high priority given to security of our information systems and
networks, as well as to safeguarding the confidentiality, availability and dependability of our data.


product liability / recall­ leoni’s output is used primarily for technically sophisticated products and
equipment with high safety standards. a failure could have far-reaching consequences ranging from down-
time costs to penalties and through to personal injuries.      measures: we minimise the associated risks by
taking effective measures as part of process safety and quality management. all plants are iso 9001 certified
and some, depending on the customer group they supply, have additional iso/ts 16949 (automotive industry),
en 9100 (aerospace) or iso 13485 (medical technology) certification. some plants also have an environmental
management system certified to iso 14001. there is also insurance cover for operating, product and environ-
mental liability as well as for product recalls. product liability cases and recalls are reported without delay,
by means of a red alert process that has been set up, to all concerned units so that countermeasures can be
applied immediately.


loss of a customer       the loss of a customer we supply could temporarily result in losses of earnings /
contributions to profit and additional capacity adjustment costs.       measures: we have reduced our exposure
to a small number of major customers in the wiring systems division with a broader, international customer
base. the lengthy contract periods, which usually cover the lifespan of a particular model range, and having
established very close and stable customer-supplier relationships, for instance by way of comprehensive
development work and outstanding service in terms of delivery, mean that there will be early notice of losing
a customer.


fluctuation in personnel costs          the growing shortage of skilled professionals in germany, changes in
the availability of personnel and the resulting rise in wage and salary costs at labour-intensive production
locations in eastern europe, north africa and asia present human resource management with particular
challenges. this situation is brought about by the large number of production operations being located in
countries with low wage levels.     measures: effort has been stepped up to increase staff advancement – for
example with internal programmes to provide employees with further qualifications and aimed at integration
as well as offering a wide range of social benefits – to maintain the ability to recruit and tie staff as an attrac-
tive employer. for our travelling and seconded staff members we have enhanced an existing care insurance
policy to include further medical and security-relevant benefits. for example, evacuation in the event of
unrest as in north africa or a natural disaster would be handled by an international service provider.

                        operational opportunities
                        the leoni group’s operating strengths include its leading position in the most important markets across
                        europe, our global footprint in terms of distribution, development and production as well as our broad,
                        international customer base. these factors enable us, as the case may be, to benefit globally from favoura-
                        ble market trends. leoni also focuses sharply on core products and markets, has a consistently high level of
                        expertise along the entire value chain and covers an extensive portfolio of technology. finally, the collabora-
                        tion between our two business divisions in the context of a complementary value chain creates synergies that
                        provide leoni with opportunity not only to reduce costs, but also to expand.
                             for example, the future market of electromobility and the growing demand for electrical components
                        provide the wiring systems division with good opportunity to outperform expectations. expanding the
                        value chain in the area of plugs and connectors also provides additional earning potential. in the wire & cable
                        solutions division, product, material and technology innovations above all in the fields of halogen-free and
                        flame-retardant cables, miniaturisation as well as fiber optic and high frequency cables present opportunity
                        for market share gains. stepped-up involvement in the markets for renewable energy – especially in the hydro,
                        wind and solar industries – as well as mobility, advanced manufacturing, medical technology and sensor
                        systems provide the opportunity to participate more significantly in their projected growth.


                        financial risks
                        we face financial risks mainly in the areas of
                        ■■   currency and interest risks
                        ■■   risk of bad debt losses
                        ■■   borrowing
                        ■■   liquidity risks
                        ■■   m&a/impairment risks


                        the three principal risks are:


                        bad debt / liquidity­ the default of a large customer on debt could exert a considerable adverse effect
                        on net income.         measures: all customers with whom the leoni group intends to conclude business on a
                        credit basis are subject to credit screening. regular analysis of receivables and the structure of the receivables
                        facilitates ongoing monitoring of the risk. factoring, or true sale factoring for selected customers, serves as a
                        further tool to reduce the risk of default.
                             to back its plans for growth leoni uses, alongside the existing, long-term borrower’s note loans, ample short
                        and long-term loan commitments from banks, mainly in the form of conventional lines of credit. in addition,
                        stringent cash pooling is used to safeguard liquidity. the most important cash flows in the group are managed
                        and handled by leoni ag at head office. if, in the event of a crisis for example, the in-house rating of our
                        core banks for leoni were to drop below investment grade, this would probably mean increased cost on any
                        required loans, which might not be provided in the desired amount.

the group monitors its current liquidity situation on a daily basis. monthly, currency-specific, rolling liquidity
planning for respective periods of 12 months is used to manage future liquidity requirement. the planning
takes into consideration the terms of investments and financial assets (e.g. receivables, other financial assets)
as well as the expected cash flows from business activity.


impairment risks          leoni subjects assets and goodwill to impairment testing based on the ifrs accounting
rules. an increase in the discount rate and/or worsening of earning prospects will cause the risk of impairment
to rise.


currency risks         although we conduct business mainly in euros or in the local currency of the respective
country, we are increasingly faced with currency risks due to the globalisation of the markets.      measures: in
the group’s holding company, leoni ag, the corporate finance department deals with currency risks in
collaboration with the currency committee. hedging transactions are executed in line with the existing
underlying transactions or the planned transactions. selection of the hedging instrument to be used is based
on regular, in-depth analysis of the underlying transaction to be hedged. the objective is to limit the impact
of exchange rate variation on net income. apart from the actual hedging transactions, we primarily take
advantage of the option of netting foreign currency items within the group to hedge our operating business
activity. as a further currency-hedging measure, as a matter of principle we finance our foreign subsidiaries in
their respective functional currencies by way of refinancing in the corresponding currency.


further details on these financial risks are contained in the notes.                                                        notes
                                                                                                                            ›› page 186 et seq.


financial opportunities
to cover the interest rate and currency risks, the company engages, for example, in hedging transactions
under the auspices of the currency committee with the aim of avoiding any deviation from the budgeted
exchange rate. any appreciation in the currency involved for us in forex items that are not hedged and any
depreciation in the currency of the forex items that we have hedged present opportunities.


compliance risks
we face compliance risks mainly in the areas of

■■   competition law
■■   product liability and recall risks
■■   environmental risks

                                       any infringements could entail substantial fines, loss of reputation, claims for damages and, depending on the

                                       competition law       as reported, leoni was affected since the end of february 2010 by international inves-
                                       tigations under competition law in the automotive supply sector and the european commission commenced
                                       proceedings in this regard on 3 august 2012, against leoni ag among others. as part of these proceedings,
                                       the commission investigated whether competitors breached competition law in the sale of cable harnesses
                                       in europe. as also reported, the eu commission imposed a fine of € 1,378 k on leoni ag and one of its french
                                       subsidiaries, which are jointly and severally liable. the eu commission’s proceedings under competition law
                                       against leoni as a manufacturer of cable harnesses were thus completed in the past financial year. leoni
                                       cooperated extensively with the authority and contributed to resolving the matter, and reached a settlement
                                       in july 2013. a french subsidiary was in one single instance involved in a breach of the law between may
                                       and december 2009. although not itself involved in this violation, leoni ag as the group holding company
                                       assumes joint liability for this violation as determined under the stipulations of european law. the customer
                                       did not suffer any damage due to the alleged conduct. the possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that this
                                       or another customer or a third party might attempt to assert claims. leoni believes that it would be able to
                                       successfully defend itself against any such claims.
                                        since october 2011, several civil proceedings in the form of class action lawsuits against the major wiring
                                       systems manufacturers that operate internationally have been initiated by customers (car buyers) and car
                                       dealers in the united states and canada. the claimants allege that they paid excessively for wiring systems
                                       and thus their vehicles equipped with them because of alleged breaches of us and canadian competition
                                       law. the court decision as to whether and to what extent leoni continues to be included in the proceedings
                                       is still pending. leoni will continue to defend itself in these civil proceedings and believes that it will be able
                                       to refute the allegations and to bring the proceedings in both the united states and canada to a successful
                                       conclusion.

the management board’s assessment of the overall situation
in the management board’s opinion the risk situation for the leoni group did not materially change in 2013.
the biggest risk continues to be any disruption in our ability to supply to the automotive manufacturers. the
presentation below provides an overview in table format of the principal individual risks to leoni, the likeli-
hood that they might occur and the potential maximum financial loss. in our assessment there are no other
significant risks. overall, the risks to the leoni group described above are, from today’s perspective, managea-
ble and do not threaten the company’s continued existence.

forecast

business and underlying conditions
macroeconomic conditions
in the imf’s view the global economy will on the whole gain pace in 2014 and will, from today’s perspective,
register 3.7 percent growth. a tailwind is likely to stem above all from further recovery in the industrialised
countries, which might be able to raise their overall economic output by about 2.2 percent. the eurozone, in
particular, should present a significantly better picture than in the previous year: it is likely to arrest its down-
trend and, for the first time in years, to generate moderate growth of 1 percent again. economic forecasters
also project considerably greater momentum for the united states (growth of 2.8 percent) and the united
kingdom (growth of 2.4 percent).
  although the imf forecasts faster growth of 5.1 percent for the emerging and developing countries as well,
this figure is below the original estimates. in many regions the beneficial effects of rising exports to the indus-
trialised countries are being undermined by a weaker-than-expected trend in domestic demand.
  again the imf has referred to the still numerous risks to the generally positive trend. among other factors
mentioned are the increased risk of deflation in the eurozone and the uncertainty about the direction of mon-
etary policy in the industrialised countries, which could threaten global financial stability.

                        the global car markets are likely to grow somewhat more dynamically in 2014 than in the previous year.
                        worldwide, ihs global insight therefore projects an increase in passenger car output of nearly 4 percent.
                        strong increases are meanwhile to be expected above all in china and russia. however, more vehicles than

                        there is similar confidence in the mechanical engineering sector. the vdma industry federation projects
                        5 percent worldwide sales growth in 2014. alongside china and the united states, europe is likely to provide
                        positive impetus again. germany’s mechanical engineering companies thus estimate a 3 percent real-terms
                        increase in output. the electrical industry will also grow again in 2014: the zvei sector association projects
                        6 percent expansion for the global market, with increases in asia, the americas and – to a lesser extent – in
                        europe. for germany the zvei estimates an adjusted increase in output of about 2 percent.
                          the ict sector should improve its sales in germany by nearly 2 percent this year, according to its bitkom
                        association. there will probably be growth in the information technology segment as well as in consumer
                        electronics and telecommunications.
                          for the german medical technology industry the spectaris association forecasts further export growth in
                        2014, but only sideways movement in the german market.

business performance and future direction
the leoni group’s business performance
leoni’s good performance in the automotive business continued in the first few weeks of the current financial
year. against this backdrop and given the favourable order situation in both divisions, the management board
projects an increase in consolidated sales to approx. € 4.1 billion in 2014. we again expect to see the largest
gains in the bric countries including south korea as well as in the united states, meaning that the proportions
of total sales generated in these countries will probably rise to more than 18 percent and nearly 15 percent,
respectively. with respect to germany we have budgeted for a moderate increase and a share of total sales
of about 36 percent, while the amount of business in the rest of europe and other countries outside europe is
expected to contract and account for roughly 28 percent and 3 percent, respectively. the primary reason for
this is the persisting economic weakness in southern europe.
 from today’s perspective, consolidated ebit will rise at a significantly greater rate than sales to more than
€ 200 million in 2014. we expect beneficial effects to stem from the additional amount of business, efficiency
enhancements as well as the restructuring and rationalisation measures applied in 2013. the wire & cable
solutions division will probably account for the majority of this growth; the wiring systems division’s ebit is
expected to improve slightly.
 our forecast is based on the following assumptions: in terms of the markets, the growth of the global au-
tomotive industry will continue, while demand in europe’s non-automotive sectors will remain rather muted.
the average price of copper in 2014 is projected to be € 5.50 and thus slightly above the previous year’s level.
our wage costs will continue to rise considerably in the low-wage regions of asia and north africa, whereas
we anticipate a moderate trend in eastern europe. spending on restructuring should be down significantly.
 our medium-term planning is unchanged: from today’s perspective, leoni will generate further gains in
both sales and especially earnings in 2015. we project consolidated sales of € 5 billion and an ebit margin
of 7 percent for 2016. this is based on the new projects that went or are going into production in the wiring
systems division in 2013 and 2014, which will then make a substantial contribution to sales, as well as steady
growth of the wire & cable solutions division in its bgs automotive cables, industry & healthcare and com-
munication & infrastructure. there will meanwhile continue to be disproportionately strong sales growth in
the bric countries including south korea and in the nafta area.
 there will be no fundamental change to leoni’s business policy in the next two years. however, we will
adjust our strategic direction to current market developments. in both divisions the automotive business
constitutes the core activity where leoni is aiming for the strongest possible growth. in addition, we will
retain a sturdy mainstay in the non-automotive market with our focus on the communications, infrastructure,
industrial and medical technology sectors. here, too, we will gradually enhance our systems expertise. leoni’s
dividend policy continues to provide for a payout of about one third of annual net income.


performance of the wiring systems division
the wiring systems division is likely to increase its external sales to approx. € 2.4 billion in 2014, together
with a moderate improvement in earnings to more than € 120 million. the current reporting period is again
characterised by numerous new product start-ups. these new and follow-on projects will initially contribute
only slightly to the amount of business and will incur substantial preproduction and start-up costs, but in the
upcoming years this will then increasingly impact on sales and earnings.

                        from a regional perspective, we expect the business to continue to shift in the direction of asia and north
                        america in 2014. the division will thus take another step closer to the medium-term strategic target of having
                        sales evenly distributed among the triad markets with respect to end-use customers. the business growth is
                        to be based on additional orders from both existing customers and new customers in, among other sectors,
                        the power sports as well as commercial vehicle industries and also via our portfolio of plugs and connectors.
                         the wiring systems division’s global production network will continue to be steadily optimised and ex-
                        panded further. our fifth wiring systems plant in china will go into operation in 2014. beyond demand-related
                        extension of existing capacity especially in asia and eastern europe, we are also looking into additional loca-
                        tions, for instance in south america. new technologies and processes could in the future be used particularly
                        for automating the production of wiring systems. in this field we are already working closely together with
                        several customers interested in such innovative processes.


                        performance of the wire & cable solutions division
                        the wire & cable solutions division can be expected to generate sales growth to approx. € 1.7 billion in 2014.
                        all business groups and regions are expected to contribute, with the strongest gains once more likely in the
                        automotive cables business as well as in the nafta area and the bric countries. we expect the proportions
                        of the division’s total sales generated in these two areas to rise to just over 18 percent and about 17 percent,
                        respectively. based on the larger amount of business as well as product mix and productivity-related bene-
                        ficial effects, the projected ebit of more than € 80 million represents growth significantly outpacing that in
                        sales. alignment of our business processes in the context of our business process harmonization project and
                        standardisation of our it systems will also gradually exert a beneficial effect on earnings.
                         based on its improved position in china, india and north america, the wire & cable solutions division ex-
                        pects to be able to gain new customers as well in these important growth regions. we will continue to extend
                        our range of products and services in the direction of system solutions. in so doing, we will focus on our activ-
                        ity in the automotive cables, industrial and medical technology businesses as well as on selected segments of
                        the infrastructure and communications markets.


                        financial and asset situation
                        thanks to the concluded long-term financing measures, the extensive existing credit lines and the expected
                        net income, the leoni group’s liquidity in 2014 is again assured on a lasting basis. given the current low level
                        of interest rates, we will probably place another borrower’s note loan in the amount of € 25 million in march.
                        we estimate group-wide free cash flow of approx. € 30 million in 2014. net financial liabilities should come to
                        an amount similar to 2013 at approx. € 260 million. the net income expected for the year will mean another
                        increase in equity, from today’s perspective taking the equity ratio up slightly to about 36 percent.


                        capital expenditure
                        the leoni group will likely spend approx. € 200 million on property, plant and equipment as well as intangi-
                        ble assets to prepare for the planned growth. of this amount, germany will account for about 28.3 percent;
                        eastern europe for 26.3 percent, asia for 19.4 percent, north africa for 9.3 percent, the americas for 9.8 percent
                        and other european countries for 6.9 percent.

                                                                                                  group management report   | forecast   |   111




in the wiring systems division, the amount required for the necessary work to prepare for the numerous new
and follow-on contracts from the automotive industry will, from today’s perspective, rise to approx.
€ 120 million. in regional terms, the investment in this division will be relatively evenly spread among
growth-related and replacement measures in western europe, eastern europe, north and central america as
well as asia. other significant individual projects involve rebuilding and updating the headquarters in kitzin-
gen, expanding capacity in serbia as well as constructing the new plant in tieling, china.
 the wire & cable solutions division will probably spend approx. € 70 million on property, plant and equip-
ment as well as intangible assets; in germany and particularly also in asia as well as north america. potential
acquisitions are also being studied in these regions. apart from expanding capacity for our core automotive
cables business, the focus will be on the medical technology, industrial solutions, infrastructure and commu-
nications sectors. the holding company is to account for about € 10 million, primarily for it projects.


procurement
the proportion of leoni’s business accounted for by materials will remain high in the upcoming year as well.
alongside a slight rise in the price of copper, we are anticipating further increases in the prices for special insu-
lation materials. optimising procurement structures and costs therefore has an unchanged, high level of prior-
ity. the wcs division will consequently internationalise its supplier pool further and increasingly combine its
purchasing volumes on a regional basis. our regional expansion of strategic providers of development work in
the bric countries is especially important in this respect. the wiring systems division will likewise continue to
globally optimise its sourcing, which also calls for a system applicable worldwide for managing contracts with
the suppliers that also operate internationally. the focus of this activity is on asia and the nafta area.


employees
the number of leoni employees will probably rise slightly in 2014. additional recruitment is planned in both
the leoni ag holding company and the wiring systems division at various locations in eastern europe, asia
and north america involving new product start-ups. start-up, training and recruitment plans will support
the imminent ramping up in this division. the workforce in the wire & cable solutions division is likely to
remain at roughly the same number. our group-wide hr measures this year will focus, among other things, on
best-practice activity to optimise and harmonise our hr processes and organisation, targeted promotion of
young talent and succession planning as well as project management.


research & development
any changes to the focal areas of leoni’s r & d work will be no more than minor in 2014. in the wiring sys-
tems division, development work will support the planned future growth with innovative signal and power
transmission solutions. the focus in this respect will be on further extending the use of alternative conductor
materials like aluminium in cable harnesses and resolute realisation of potential to optimise costs and weight.
another area of activity involves networking between vehicles as well as within vehicles. the wire & cable
solutions division will, among other things, maintain its commitment to the area of green technology.

                        sustainability
                        in mid 2014, leoni will release its third un global compact communication on progress and thereby provide
                        information on its latest developments in the area of sustainability. we will probably also again participate in
                        the carbon disclosure project and work on further improving our ecological footprint. the wcs division will
                        further raise its energy efficiency in production, among other areas. an energy guideline is being prepared in
                        the wiring systems division that is to present the technical savings potential for regions and plants. based on
                        having established the iso 14001 international environmental standard as well as the oshas 18001 occupa-
                        tional health and safety standard across the production plants, all of the wiring systems division’s facilities
                        will in the future gradually be audited according to these parameters. the plan is furthermore to continue
                        standardising occupational health and safety processes. we also encourage our suppliers to prove that they
                        are fulfilling their social responsibility by meeting these occupational health and safety as well as environmen-
                        tal standards.
                             our quality processes are thus to be more closely harmonised across all organisational boundaries and the
                        interfaces between the leoni ag holding company and the divisions are to be made more efficient.


                        general statement on future growth
                        the management board of leoni ag is confident about the company’s future performance. the solid order
                        situation in both divisions, especially the new and follow-on projects in the wiring systems division, as well
                        as the ongoing measures to internationalise and enhance efficiency constitute a good foundation for our
                        medium-term growth and profitability targets. the restructuring measures applied last year will also exert
                        positive effect. for 2014 we forecast moderate sales growth to approx. € 4.1 billion and a significant dispropor-
                        tionate increase in earnings to more than € 200 million, to which both divisions will contribute. the next stage
                        of growth is then to follow in 2015.
                             the impending new product start-ups and activity relating to internationalisation will this year entail a re-
                        cord amount of capital expenditure of approx. € 200 million. our planned expansion stands on solid financial
                        foundations: for 2014 we estimate free cash flow of approx. € 30 million and largely unchanged net financial
                        liabilities of approx. € 260 million. equity is likely to increase slightly, meaning that gearing should again
                        improve to some extent. we consequently regard ourselves as well being equipped to meet our target of
                        generating consolidated sales of € 5 billion and an ebit margin of 7 percent in 2016.

compensation report

this compensation report follows the recommendations of the german corporate governance code (code)
and contains disclosures that, according to the requirements of the german commercial code (hgb) and the
international financial reporting standards (ifrs), are part of the notes as well as of the management report.



compensation of the management board
the compensation structure for the management board, which has applied since 1 january 2010, is based
on the act on the appropriateness of management board compensation (vorstag), which came into force
on 5 august 2009 and is also contained in the recommendations of the current code. the supervisory board
reviews the compensation system at least once a year. the most recent review was carried out during the
meeting of 5 december 2013, when the medium-term planning and its effect on future management board
compensation was also discussed and included in the review.


basic principles of the currently valid compensation system
in accordance with the code, we hereinafter explain the principles of the system for compensating the mem-
bers of leoni ag’s management board and the specific structure of the individual components. the table
below provides an overview of the structure and system for management board compensation:

                        fixed compensation
                        the fixed component is a firm, annual amount of basic compensation that is paid in equal monthly instal-
                        ments. it is commensurate with the amounts paid by other mdax companies.


                        variable components


                        short-term compensation component – annual bonus:                  an annual bonus is paid depending on the net
                        income generated. it is capped at a maximum of the figure than can be attained by 150 percent plan fulfil-
                        ment. the annual bonus can drop to nil. this conforms to the requirements of both the vorstag and the code.


                        medium-term compensation component – multi-year bonus:                   the multi-year bonus is geared to the
                        net income of the year in question measured against the earnings of a three-year period and thus conforms
                        to the sustainability requirement set out in both the vorstag and the code. the multi-year bonus is limited by
                        a corridor (0 to 150 percent). payment is made after the three-year period and only if the (arithmetic) average
                        degree of target attainment for the three-year period is at least 50 percent. otherwise the multi-year bonus is
                        forfeited in full. it is paid in the fourth year, while 50 percent of the amount is paid in the respective subse-
                        quent year as an instalment.


                        long-term compensation component:              a long-term compensation component that takes adequate
                        account of the economic value added (eva) and the company’s market capitalisation is intended to further
                        strengthen sustained, positive business performance. an amount is paid out annually from this bonus account
                        up to a cap, 50 percent of which members of the management board must invest in leoni shares, which
                        must be retained for a period of 50 months, thereby conforming to the 48-month minimum holding period
                        prescribed by the vorstag. this compensation component can drop to nil. negative business performance will
                        reduce the bonus account (penalty rule), which can drop to nil.


                        the total compensation is commensurate with that paid by other mdax companies and other companies of
                        similar size. its takes account of both good and poor performance. furthermore, the individual compensation
                        components do not tempt the management board to take inappropriate risk. an internationally recognised
                        compensation expert oversaw the preparation of the compensation structure and confirmed its conformity
                        with the legislation including the code. the supervisory board assured itself of the compensation expert’s
                        independence. in summary, it may be concluded that compensation for the members of leoni’s management
                        board meets the requirements of both the vorstag and code and is set up for sustainability.


                        disability and other benefits
                        in the event of temporary work incapacity due to illness or other reasons, for which the management board
                        member is not responsible, the fixed compensation will continue to be paid for a period of up to twelve
                        months, at most up to termination of the employment contract. in the event of permanent work incapacity
                        the management board member will receive a disability pension. if a management board member dies, the

                                                                                                            group management report   | compensation report      |   115




widows and orphaned children will be paid pensions. following the end of their 65th (or 63rd with agreed
discounts) year of age, every management board member is entitled to payment of retirement benefits,
which are computed according to the period of management board service and the pensionable fixed salary.
pensionable is defined as a contractually agreed proportion of the final fixed salary. the disability and other
benefits granted to members of leoni ag’s management board are also commensurate with those of other
mdax companies.


other
severance payments upon premature termination of management board duties in the absence of a material
reason are limited to two years’ compensation and shall not be more than the annual compensation for the
balance of the employment contract (severance cap pursuant to the code).
in the event of a change of control, every management board member has the right to terminate for material
reason and shall be entitled to severance payment. such payment is limited to a maximum of three years’
compensation (150 percent of the severance cap pursuant to the code) and shall even in this event not exceed
the annual compensation for the balance of the employment contract.

                                            the cost of compensation for the members of the management board for fiscal 2013 totalled € 5,410 k (previ-
                                            ous year: € 8,098 k). of this, the management board members were paid € 4,901 k for 2013 (previous year:
                                            € 8,751 k).

                                            as well as the addition to pension provisions in fiscal 2013. this in principle comprises service costs and past
                                            service costs. pensions are paid to management board members who have either reached the retirement age
                                            of 63 years or are permanently disabled. the pension entitlement of the active management board members
                                            is computed, so far as there are benefit commitments, as an agreed pensionable proportion of the final fixed
                                            annual salary. previous management board members were paid retirement benefits from either their 65th or
                                            63rd year of age.



                                            new compensation system from 2015
                                            the validity of the current structure for compensating the members of the management board expires on
                                            31 december 2014.
                                              a new compensation system is thereafter to be applied for the financial years from 2015 to 2019. a revision
                                            of the existing system became necessary to take account of updates of the code and furthermore because
                                            extensions to the contracts of management board members for up to a further five years are pending from
                                            1 january 2015.
                                              in accordance with the code, we hereinafter explain the principles of the new system for compensating
                                            the members of leoni ag’s management board and the specific structure of the individual components that
                                            differ from the previous system in some respects. the table below provides an overview of the structure and
                                            system for management board compensation from 2015.

fixed compensation
the fixed component is a firm, annual amount of basic compensation that is paid in equal monthly instal-
ments. as all the other compensation components are variable and can drop to nil, the fixed component is the
minimum amount of management board compensation. the fixed amount is commensurate with that paid by
other mdax companies.


variable components
as in the existing compensation system, there will, alongside the fixed compensation, be three further
variable compensation components, each of which have upper limits in absolute terms and can drop to nil.
the short-term compensation component refers to the respectively completed financial year, whereas the
medium-term compensation component takes account of a three-year period and is geared to sustainability.
the weighting between the short and medium-term components is 50/50 and will, as opposed to the existing
system, be raised towards the medium-term component and thus to sustainability.


short-term compensation component – annual bonus:                          an annual bonus will be paid depending on
the net income generated, whereas amounts that exceed 110 percent (cap) of the budgeted net income for
the year will be disregarded. payment of this annual bonus can rise by another 10 percent provided the group
generates an ebit margin of more than 7.5 percent. payout of the annual bonus will be discounted by 10
percent for ebit margins that are less than 4.5 percent but not below 3.5 percent. should the group generate
an ebit margin of less than 3.5 percent, the discount on the annual bonus will be 30 percent. in each year of
the contract term the annual bonus will have an upper limit in absolute terms; it will be paid in cash and can
drop to nil.


medium-term compensation component – multi-year bonus:                           the multi-year bonus is geared, depend-
ing on the respective year’s net income, to the results of a three-year period, while amounts that exceed 115
percent (cap) of the budgeted annual net income amounts will be disregarded. payment is made after the
three-year period and only if the (arithmetic) average degree of target attainment for the three-year period
is at least 50 percent. otherwise the multi-year bonus is forfeited in full. the multi-year bonus thus conforms

                        to the sustainability requirement set out in both the vorstag and the code. the multi-year bonus will be paid
                        in the fourth year, while 50 percent of the annual amount will be paid in the respective subsequent year as an
                        instalment. in each year of the contract term the multi-year bonus will have an upper limit in absolute terms;
                        it will be paid in cash and can drop to nil.


                        long-term compensation component:              the long-term compensation component will remain unchanged
                        from the existing system and has an upper limit for each member of the management board in each year of
                        the contract term.


                        absolute upper limit:      the total compensation, which is the sum of the fixed, short-term, medium-term
                        and long-term components, has an absolute upper limit in each year of the contract term.


                        pension, disability and other benefits:         the existing, purely defined-benefit plans will expire and will
                        be replaced for first-time plans so far as possible by a defined-contribution plan. in the case of first-time plans,
                        there will for each management board member be an absolute limit to the benefit to be paid for each year of
                        the contract term and, moreover, a general upper limit to the level of pension with respect to the fixed amount.
                         the new retirement benefit system is set up in such a way that the standard retirement age is 67 years and at
                        the earliest 63 years subject to accepting discounts on the pension.



                        supervisory board compensation
                        the articles of association govern compensation for members of the supervisory board. the compensation
                        system was revised to conform to the amended requirements of the code in its version dated 15 may 2012.
                        these amendments provide that any performance-related compensation paid to supervisory board mem-
                        bers shall be geared to long-term business growth. as the compensation arrangement still applicable in
                        2012, which was subjected to a corresponding review with the assistance of an outside expert, may not have
                        conformed to this recommendation, the nomination committee was tasked with the preparation of a new
                        arrangement. the supervisory board adopted the new proposal, which provides for a system of fixed compen-
                        sation and discontinuation of the variable components, in december 2012, but it required an amendment to
                        the articles of association to be approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting. once shareholders
                        had voted in favour of the new system at the annual general meeting on 30 april 2013, it retroactively came
                        into force on 1 january 2013.


                        new compensation system for the supervisory board
                        a system of fixed compensation has thus applied for members of leoni ag’s supervisory board since 1 janu-
                        ary 2013. it stipulates a fixed amount of € 85 k per ordinary member of the supervisory board. the chairper-
                        son receives double this amount and the deputy chairpersons receive one and a half times the amount. the
                        compensation for committee work (personnel, audit, strategy and nomination committees) comes to € 8 k
                        per ordinary member and to € 16 k per committee chairperson. it is paid only if the committee meets at least
                        once in the year. due to the increase in time spent and the greater responsibility involving supervisory board
                        and committee work, attendance of supervisory board and audit committee meetings will be paid for in the
                        amount of € 1,000 per meeting and supervisory board member, with a maximum of ten meetings to be taken
                        into consideration per financial year.
                         the maximum overall compensation possible for supervisory board members including committee work
                        and attendance money comes to € 1,534 k.

                                                                                                                              group management report    | compensation report   |   119

                        disclosures pursuant to art. 315 (4)
                        of the german commercial code

                        composition of the share capital: as at 31 december 2013, the share capital in leoni ag is divided into
                        32,669,000 registered no-par-value shares. with respect to leoni ag, article 67 (2) sentence 1 of the german
                        public companies act defines as shareholders only those persons or entities entered in the share register. all
                        shares are subject to the same rights and obligations. each share provides one vote at the annual general
                        meeting and is key to the shareholders’ share of the profit.


                        constraints concerning the voting rights or the transfer of shares: leoni ag is not aware of any
                        constraints affecting voting rights. legal requirements, especially under article 135 of the german public
                        companies act (aktg), apply to the exercise of voting rights by shareholder associations as well as by financial
                        institutions and persons otherwise granted proxy. transfer constraints exist in so far as shares that members of
                        the management and executives receive or have received in the context of a long-term incentive programme
                        are subject to a holding period.


                        leoni ag is not aware of any shareholdings, either direct or indirect, that exceed 10 percent
                        of the voting rights.


                        nor are there any shares with special entitlements that grant control rights.


                        the control of voting rights in the case of shareholding employees who do not directly exercise
                        their control rights: so far as employees are shareholders, they are entitled to directly exercise the control
                        rights associated with their shares in accordance with the articles of association and the law.


                        statutory provisions and rules in the articles of association on the appointment and recall of
                        members of the management board and on changes to the articles of association: the appoint-
                        ment and recall of management board members is governed by articles 84 and 85 of the german public
                        companies act as well as in article 31 of germany’s co-determination act. accordingly, the supervisory board
                        appoints members to the management board for a maximum of five years. pursuant to article of 5 (1) of the
                        articles of association, the management board has at least two members. furthermore, pursuant to article 5
                        (2) of the articles of association, the supervisory board appoints the management board members and deter-
                        mines their number. it is entitled to appoint deputy members of the management board as well as a chairman
                        and a deputy chairman of the management board.
                         article 179 of the public companies act stipulates that amendments to the articles of association require a
                        shareholder resolution at the annual general meeting. article 16 (3) of the articles of association stipulates
                        that a simple majority of votes and, so far as a majority of shares is needed, a simple majority of shares is
                        required for any amendment to said articles of association unless something different is bindingly required by
                        law or by the articles of association.

                                                                                                  group management report   | disclosures pursuant to art. 315 (4)   |   121

pursuant to article 19 of the articles of association, the supervisory board is entitled to adopt amendments
and additions to the articles of association that pertain only to the version. furthermore, the supervisory
board is authorised pursuant to art. 4 (5) subsection 5 of the articles of association to amend the version of
the articles of association in line with executing an increase in share capital by exercise of authorised capital
and after expiry of the term of authorisation. article 4 (6) subsection 2 of the articles of association also enti-
tles the board to amend the articles of association in line with the respective utilisation of the contingent cap-
ital. the same shall apply in the event of non-utilisation of the authorisation to issue convertible bonds and/or
warrant-linked bonds following the expiry of the authorisation period and in the event of the non-utilisation
of the contingent capital i following the expiry of all conversion and/or option periods.



powers of the management board to issue or buy back shares:


purchase of own shares          at the annual general meeting on 6 may 2010 shareholders authorised the
management board of leoni ag pursuant to article 71 (1) section 8 of the public companies act to acquire up
to 2,970,000 shares in the company until 5 may 2015. the purchase may also take place through group compa-
nies that are dependent on the company, or by third parties on their or the latter’s account. such a purchase
may be transacted via the stock market or by means of a public offer to all shareholders. the management
board is authorised in accordance with the aforementioned resolution to use the company shares acquired
on the basis of this or a previous authorisation for all legally permitted purposes, including in particular those
stated in the authorisation. the statutory right of shareholders to subscribe to own shares shall be excluded
insofar as the shares are used in accordance with the purposes specified in the authorisation.


authorised capital        the management board is authorised pursuant to article 4 (5) of the articles of
association to increase the company’s share capital by up to € 16,334,500.00 on or before 15 may 2017 with
the supervisory board’s approval by issuing up to 16,334,500 bearer shares, each with a pro-rated share
of € 1.00 in the share capital, on a cash and/or non-cash basis once or repeatedly (authorised capital 2012).
shareholders must in the process and as a matter of principle be granted the right to subscribe, however the
annual general meeting authorised the management board, with the supervisory board’s approval, to rule
out shareholders’ subscription rights in certain cases.


contingent capital        furthermore, the management board is authorised pursuant to article 4 (6) of the ar-
ticles of association to issue convertible bonds and/or warrant-linked bonds until 5 may 2015. this involved
a contingent increase in share capital by up to € 14.85 million (contingent capital 1). the contingent capital
increase is only to be performed to the extent that conversion and/or option rights have been utilised or that
the holders and/or creditors obliged to convert have met their conversion obligation and provided that no
cash settlement has been granted or company shares or new shares from the utilisation of approved capital
are utilised for the exercise of rights.

                        agreements of the company that are conditional upon a change of control as a result of a take-
                        over bid: in the event of a change of control as a result of a takeover bid, the borrower’s note loans placed in
                        2012 and 2013 in the total amount of € 275 million as well as the other loan agreements may be called in im-
                        mediately. furthermore, in such an event some of the major customers, suppliers as well as other joint venture
                        partners also have the right to terminate contractual agreements with the company prematurely.

                        ment board or staff with compensation: the service contracts of the management board members
                        include a change-of-control clause. each management board member is thereby entitled, in the event of a
                        change of control, to extraordinary termination as well as to a settlement claim within three months. the
                        settlement comprises the balance of annual compensation to the end of the term of the contract and is, in
                        accordance with section 4.2.3 (4) and (5) of the german corporate governance code, limited to a maximum
                        three years’ compensation, or, if the remaining contract period is less than three years, to the sum outstanding
                        for such remaining period. the annual compensation comprises the fixed annual salary and 80 percent of the
                        maximum attainable bonus.

                        1 | general principles

                        leoni ag (“leoni”, the “group” or the “company”) was founded in germany under the name of leonische
                        werke roth-nürnberg, aktiengesellschaft by an agreement dated 23 april 1917 and was entered in the
                        commercial register on 2 february 1918. leoni ag is registered with the district court of nuremberg under
                        number hrb 202. the company is based in nuremberg, at marienstrasse 7. the group’s principal activities are
                        described in note 29.
                         these consolidated financial statements of leoni ag have been prepared based on section 315a of the
                        german commercial code (hgb – “consolidated financial statements pursuant to the international financial
                        reporting standards“) in accordance with the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) and the asso-
                        ciated interpretations (sic/ifric interpretations) as obliged to by directive (eu) no. 1606/2002 of the european
                        parliament and of the council concerning the adoption of international accounting standards in the european
                        union. the term ifrs also covers the still valid international accounting standards (ias).
                         leoni ag’s consolidated financial statements on 31 december 2013 have been prepared in euros. except
                        where stated otherwise, all amounts are presented in thousands of euros (“€ k”). the balance sheet is struc-
                        tured by term, while the income statement is prepared using the function of expense method. the statement
                        of comprehensive income is issued in two related presentations. where the balance sheet and income state-
                        ment items are summarised to improve clarity of presentation, they are shown separately in the notes.
                         the accounting and valuation methods applied in the consolidated financial statements on 31 december
                        2013 are in line with those of the previous year with the exception of the new ifrs requirements applied for
                        the first time in the 2013 financial year. these are explained under note 3.
                         the management board on 20 february 2014 authorised the presented consolidated financial statements for
                        the year ended 31 december 2013 for submission to the supervisory board.
                         the consolidated financial statements will be published in the electronic federal gazette (bundesanzeiger)
                        under number hrb 202.

                        and valuation methods
                        the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative
                        financial instruments and available-for-sale financial assets that have been measured at fair value.


                        principles of consolidation
                        the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of leoni ag and of all subsidiaries that are either
                        directly or indirectly controlled by leoni ag. there is control when leoni ag holds, either directly or indi-
                        rectly, the majority of the voting rights or in other ways has the power to govern the financial and operating
                        policies of the enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

                                                                                             consolidated financial statements     | notes                                    |   131

                                                                                                                                 2 | principles of consolidation as well as
                                                                                                                                     summary of key accounting and
                                                                                                                                     valuation methods




subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the time of acquisition, i.e. from the time when the group has ac-
quired control over the subsidiary. inclusion in the consolidated financial statements ends as soon as leoni
no longer has control. a change in the ownership share of a subsidiary is, without loss of control, accounted
for as an equity transaction. losses are allocated to the non-controlling interests even when this results in a
negative balance.
  the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared using uniform accounting policies on the same
balance sheet date as the financial statements of the parent company. all intercompany balances, income,
expenses as well as unrealised profits, losses and dividends from intercompany transactions are eliminated in
full.
  all business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method based on applying the require-
ments of ifrs 3. the cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred,
measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. for
each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair
value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
  acquisition-related costs are expensed.
  any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acqui-
sition date. subsequent changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an
asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive
income. if the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally
settled within equity.
  if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously
held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
  goodwill arises and is upon initial consolidation measured at cost if the consideration transferred and the
amount recognised for non-controlling interest exceeds the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities as-
sumed. if this transferred consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired,
the difference is recognised in profit or loss. after goodwill is first accounted for, it is tested for impairment
according to ias 36 at least once a year, which may lead to an impairment loss (impairment-only approach).


shares in associated companies and joint ventures
it is an associated business when leoni can exert significant influence over its operating and financial poli-
cies, which is the case in principle when between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights are held.
  a joint venture involves the establishment of a separate company in which each venturer has an interest. a
joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that
is subject to joint control.
  shares in associated companies and in joint venture companies are accounted for under the equity method.
the shares are valued with their purchase price on the acquisition date, which is increased or reduced respec-
tively in the subsequent periods for any changes in net assets of the company such as the proportionate share
of net income or loss and by received dividends. the proportionate net income or loss is determined using
the accounting policies described in this note. in line with the treatment of fully consolidated subsidiaries, the
goodwill included in the carrying amount of companies accounted for under the equity method are no longer

                        amortised either. instead of a test for impairment of equity method goodwill, the whole investment account-
                        ed for under the equity method is reviewed for impairment according to ias 36, provided there are indications
                        of additional impairment loss. the group determines on each balance sheet date whether there are objective-
                        ly discernible indications that the investment in an associated company or joint venture might be impaired. if
                        this is the case, the difference between the fair value of the investment and the carrying amount is expensed
                        as an impairment loss.
                         the financial statements of the associates and of the joint ventures are prepared using uniform accounting
                        policies on the same balance sheet date as the financial statements of the parent company.


                        foreign currency translation
                        these consolidated financial statements are prepared in the presentation currency, the euro, which is the
                        functional currency of the group parent company, leoni ag. the financial statements of the foreign subsid-
                        iaries included in the consolidated financial statements with a functional currency other than the euro, are,
                        under ias 21, translated into the group currency, the euro, according to the functional currency concept.
                        the functional currency of the individual subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment
                        in which the company operates. the financial statements prepared in the respective functional currency of
                        the subsidiary are translated using the closing rate method, i.e. the assets and liabilities are translated from
                        the functional currency to the presentation currency at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date,
                        while the statements of income are translated using annual average exchange rates (arithmetic average of
                        the monthly average exchange rates). any differences arising from the translation of assets and liabilities
                        compared with the previous year’s translation as well as translation differences between the income state-
                        ment and the statement of financial position are recorded in other comprehensive income. on the disposal of
                        a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of the exchange differences in the other comprehensive income
                        relating to that foreign operation is recognised in the income statement when the gain or loss on disposal is
                        recognised.
                         a foreign currency transaction, i.e. a transaction entered into by a consolidated company in a currency other
                        than its functional currency, is recorded, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the
                        foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency
                        at the date of the transaction. in the subsequent periods monetary assets and liabilities are revalued using
                        the closing rate at each balance sheet date. the resulting currency differences are recorded in the income
                        statement. non-monetary items are still carried at the transaction rate, or, if they are measured at fair value
                        in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
                        exchange gains or losses that arise from measurement of monetary, principally intra-group items are allocated
                        to operating income (ebit) to the extent that they involve exchange gains or losses directly related to an
                        operating transaction.

measurement of fair value
the group measures various assets at their fair value on each balance sheet date. fair value is the price that an
entity would receive to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. when measuring fair value, it is assumed that the business transaction
takes place either on the principal market or, if there is no principal market, on the most advantageous market
for the asset or the liability. the group must have access to the principal market or the most advantageous
market.
  the fair value of an asset or a liability is measured on the assumptions on which market participants would
base their pricing of the asset or the liability. this assumes that the market participants act in their best busi-
ness interest.
  a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes account of the market participant’s ability, through
the asset‘s highest and best use or through its sale to another market participant who finds the asset‘s highest
and best use, to generate economic benefit.

                        the group applies valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
                        available to measure fair value, maximising the use of observable inputs and minimising the use of unobserv-
                        able inputs.
                             all assets and liabilities for which fair value is ascertained or presented in the financial statements are cate-
                        gorised into the fair value hierarchies described hereinafter, based on the lowest level input that is significant
                        to the entire measurement of fair value:

                        ■■   level 1:
                             (non-adjusted) prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
                        ■■   level 2:
                             a valuation technique whereby the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement of fair
                             value is directly or indirectly observable on the market
                        ■■   level 3:
                             a valuation technique whereby the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement of fair
                             value is not observable on the market


                        in the case of assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the
                        group ascertains whether any reclassification of the hierarchy levels has taken place by, at the end of each
                        reporting period, reviewing the classification – based on the lowest level input that is significant to the entire
                        measurement of fair value.


                        the services of outside appraisers are used in some individual cases to value significant assets as well as such
                        significant liabilities as contingent considerations. the group analyses as at each reporting date the value of
                        assets and liabilities that must, in accordance with the group’s accounting policies, be remeasured or reas-
                        sessed. this analysis involves a review of the significant inputs that were applied to the previous valuation.


                        revenue recognition
                        revenues are generated mainly from the sale of products. pursuant to ias 18, sales revenues are generally rec-
                        ognised net of value added tax (vat) upon delivery of products to the customer or upon fulfilment of service
                        contracts. delivery has occurred when the risks and rewards associated with ownership have been transferred
                        to the buyer. provisions for customer rebates and discounts as well as for returns and other adjustments are
                        provided for in the same period the related sales are recognised. fulfilment of service contracts occurs when
                        substantially all performance obligations have been met. in the case of long-term development contracts,
                        revenues are recognised according to the stage of completion provided that the contracts meet the condi-
                        tions for applying the percentage-of-completion method pursuant to ias 11. this applies to the development
                        contracts described below.
                             interest income is recognised as interest accrues. by using the effective interest rate method this means that
                        the interest income recognised is the amount produced by using the effective interest rate. this is the rate
                        that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial instrument to the
                        net carrying amount of the financial asset.
                             dividend income is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment is established.

research and development costs
research costs are expensed as incurred.
 development costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to customer-specific development contracts
accounted for pursuant to ias 11, or they meet the criteria of ias 38 for capitalisation as an intangible asset.
pursuant to ias 11 for customer-specific development contracts that meet the corresponding conditions the
percentage-of-completion method is applied. the capitalised amount, where payment is expected after more
than one year, is disclosed under trade receivables from long-term development contracts. the current pro-
portion is contained in trade receivables. the percentage of completion is determined according to the ratio
of total costs to costs incurred (cost-to-cost method). the income from development contracts is reported
under sales in the income statement.


government grants
a government grant is recognised when there is sufficient assurance that the grant will be received and that
the enterprise will comply with the conditions attaching to it. expense-related grants are recognised as in-
come on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match them with the associated costs. grants for an
asset are deducted from the cost of the asset.


inventories
inventories encompass raw materials, production supplies and goods purchased as well as work in progress
and finished goods. they are stated at the lower of cost and the net realisable value. raw materials, produc-
tion supplies as well as goods purchased are evaluated at cost using the weighted average cost formula or
at the lower net realisable value on the balance sheet date. the net realisable value is computed based on
the estimated selling price in the normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale. costs of conversion of work in progress and finished products
comprise, alongside the direct costs of production material and production wages, proportionate material and
production overhead costs based on standard capacity.


non-current assets held for sale
a non-current asset, or a disposal group, is classified as held for sale if the related carrying amount is realised
mainly by a sale transaction and not by continued use, and if the criteria pursuant to ifrs 5 in this regard are
met. if non-current assets or a disposal group are classified as held for sale, depreciation is ceased and the
company determines the fair value of such assets. if the fair value of the assets held for sale or the disposal
group, less the selling costs, is less than the net carrying amount of the assets, a write-down is made on the
fair value, less the selling costs. if the disposal plan changes and the criteria pursuant to ifrs 5 for an asset or
disposal group that were classified as held for sale are no longer met, they are no longer presented separately
but reclassified to the balance sheet item where they were originally recorded. they are valued at the lower
of the carrying amount before the asset or disposal group was classified as held for sale (as adjusted for any
subsequent depreciation, amortisation or revaluation that would have been recorded without classification as
held for sale) and their recoverable amount at the date of the decision not to sell.

                        property, plant and equipment
                        property, plant and equipment is, upon initial recognition, valued at cost. attributable borrowing costs
                        are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset pursuant to ias 23. a qualifying asset is an asset that
                        necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. government grants for capital
                        investments reduce the cost of those assets for which the grant was awarded. in the subsequent periods,
                        property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. it is depreciated over its prob-
                        able economic life. immovable assets are mostly depreciated on a straight-line basis and movable assets are,
                        depending on their type of use, depreciated using either the straight-line method or, if so required by their
                        actual use, the declining method. when carrying out larger-scale maintenance, the costs are recognised in the
                        carrying amount of the item of property, plant or equipment, provided that recognition criteria are met.


                        the following useful lives are assumed for depreciation:
                        buildings and facilities                                   max. 50 years
                        machinery and equipment                                    3 – 15 years
                        factory and office equipment                               2 – 10 years
                        computer hardware                                          3 – 5 years



                        leased installations are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the respective shorter period of the term of
                        the lease or the estimated ordinary useful life.
                         a property, plant or equipment is derecognised either when it is disposed of or when no further econom-
                        ic benefit is to be expected from either the use or disposal of the asset. the gains or losses resulting from
                        derecognition are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount
                        and are, in the period in which the asset is derecognised, recorded in the income statement.
                         the residual values of the assets, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of the finan-
                        cial year, and if necessary adjusted.


                        leases
                        leases are classified as either finance or operating. leasing transactions whereby leoni is the lessee and bears
                        all substantial risks and rewards typical of ownership from use of the leased asset are accounted for as finance
                        leases. accordingly, the lessee capitalises the leased asset and records the corresponding lease obligation in
                        the statement of financial position at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of
                        the minimum lease payments. the leased asset is depreciated over its economic life. if there is no reasonable
                        certainty at the beginning of the lease that the group will obtain ownership, the leased asset is depreciated in
                        full over the shorter of the two periods of the expected useful life and the term of the lease. lease payments
                        are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant

                                                                                            consolidated financial statements     | notes                                    |   137

                                                                                                                                    summary of key accounting and
                                                                                                                                    valuation methods




rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. finance charges are recognised in the income state-
ment. all other leasing agreements entered into by leoni, as a lessee, are accounted for as operating leases.
the lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
 whether an arrangement contains a lease is determined on the basis of the arrangement’s economic sub-
stance at the time it was concluded and requires an assessment whether meeting the contractual arrange-
ment depends on the use of a certain asset or certain assets and whether the arrangement gives the right to
use the asset.


intangible assets
intangible assets comprise patents, software, licenses and similar rights, as well as customer relationships,
brands, technology and production know-how acquired in the context of business combinations. an intan-
gible asset that results from development expenditure is capitalised if a newly developed product or process
can be clearly defined, is technically feasible and is intended for either own use or for sale. capitalisation also
assumes that the development expenses can with a sufficient degree of likelihood be covered with future
inflow of cash and cash equivalents and the other ias 38.57 criteria are met.
 intangible assets acquired separately are, upon initial recognition, valued at cost. the costs of intangible
assets acquired as part of business combinations equal their fair values as at the date of acquisition. in the
subsequent periods, intangible assets are carried at their cost less any accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. measurement in the subsequent periods should differentiate between intan-
gible assets with a finite useful life and with an indefinite useful life.
 according to ias 38, intangible assets with a finite useful life must be amortised over their useful life. the
company therefore, in accordance with these requirements, amortises development costs capitalised as assets
on a straight-line basis and amortises other intangible assets with a finite useful life on a straight-line basis
over their useful lives to their estimated residual values, which is normally nil. other intangible assets with a
finite useful life are mainly software licenses with an estimated useful life of three years as well as customer
relationships with useful lives of six to 23 years as well as technology and production know-how with a useful
life of five to 15 years, in both cases acquired in the context of business combinations. the amortisation meth-
od and the amortisation period for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed, at least, at the end
of each financial year. any changes to the amortisation method and the amortisation period due to revision of
the expected useful life or the expected use of the asset’s future economic benefit are treated as changes in
estimates.
 according to ias 38, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life have no longer been amortised; instead
such intangible assets must, according to ias 36, be reviewed for impairment at least annually and written
down to their lower recoverable amount. the review is carried out as at 31 october of each year according to
the same principles as in the case of goodwill. the remarks below therefore apply accordingly.

                        intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed once a year to determine whether the estimate of as-
                        sessment of an indefinite useful life is still justified. if this is not the case, the assessment is prospectively changed
                        from an indefinite to a definite useful life. leoni records brands acquired in the context of business combinations
                        as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.
                         intangible assets are derecognised when they are disposed of or when no further economic benefit is to be
                        expected from either their use or disposal.


                        goodwill
                        goodwill from a business combination is, upon initial recognition, measured at cost calculated as the excess of the
                        transferred consideration over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. after initial recognition,
                        goodwill is measured at the acquisition cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
                         goodwill is not amortised; instead it is in line with the requirements of ias 36 reviewed for impairment at least
                        once a year. the group reviews the goodwill for impairment annually as at 31 october. a review also takes place if
                        events or circumstances indicate that there might be an impairment loss. for the purpose of the impairment test,
                        goodwill acquired in the context of a business combination is, from the acquisition date, to be allocated to the
                        group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. this applies
                        regardless of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquired business are allocated to these cash-generating
                        units. goodwill is tested at the level of the cash-generating unit to which it is allocated by comparing the carrying
                        amount of the cash-generating unit or units with the recoverable amount. impairment has occurred if the carrying
                        amount exceeds the recoverable amount, requiring a write-down to the recoverable amount. the recoverable
                        amount corresponds to the higher of the two amounts from the fair value less cost to sell and value in use. the
                        value in use of a cash-generating unit is defined as the present value of projected cash flows to the company from
                        the cash-generating unit. to determine the value in use, the projected cash flows are discounted the their present
                        value based on a discount rate before tax that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
                        and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. an appropriate valuation model is applied to determine the fair
                        value less cost to sell. this is based on valuation multiples, discounted cash-flow valuation models, stock market
                        prices and other available indicators of the fair value.
                         later reversal based on disappearance of the reason for a goodwill impairment recorded in previous financial
                        years or interim reporting periods is not permitted.


                        impairment testing of intangible assets with a finite life and of property, plant and equipment
                        an assessment is made at each balance sheet date whether there are any indications that an impairment loss may
                        have occurred. if there are such indications, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and compared
                        with its carrying amount. if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is
                        recognised on the lower recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of the two amounts from the
                        fair value less cost to sell and value in use. the latter is the present value of future cash flows that can probably
                        be derived from the asset. to determine the value in use, the projected cash flows are discounted to their present
                        value based on a discount rate before tax that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
                        and the risks specific to the cash-generating unit. an appropriate valuation model is applied to determine the

                                                                                               consolidated financial statements     | notes                                    |   139

                                                                                                                                       summary of key accounting and
                                                                                                                                       valuation methods




fair value less cost to sell. this is based on valuation multiples, discounted cash-flow valuation models, stock
market prices or market values and such other available indicators of the fair value as estimates by appraisers
and historical data.
     if specific cash flows generated largely independently from other assets or groups of assets cannot be
allocated to the individual assets, they are tested for impairment based on the smallest, overriding cash-gen-
erating unit of assets.
     if the reasons for applying the impairment charge have disappeared, the write-down on the asset is re-
versed. such reversal is limited to the amount that would have resulted when taking amortisation or deprecia-
tion into account.
     regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment, a corresponding test for impairment is applied once
a year to both intangible assets that are not yet ready for use and intangible assets with an indefinite useful
life.


financial instruments
a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial
liability or equity instrument of another enterprise. financial instruments recorded as either financial assets
or financial liabilities are as a matter of principle presented separately. they are reported on a net basis only
where a right of set-off with respect to the amounts exists at the present time and it is intended to settle net.
     financial instruments are recognised as soon as leoni becomes a contracting party to the financial instru-
ment. in the case of regular way purchases or sales in the context of a contract whose conditions provide for
the asset to be delivered within a period of time that is normally determined by the rules or conventions of the
respective market, the settlement date, i.e. the date on which the asset is supplied to or by leoni, is pertinent
to initial recognition as well as derecognition.
     financial assets comprise in particular cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables as well as other orig-
inated loans and receivables, financial instruments held to maturity as well as both primary and derivative
financial assets held for trading purposes.
     financial liabilities normally provide a claim for return in cash or another financial asset. these comprise
particularly bonds and other securitised liabilities, trade liabilities, liabilities to banks, liabilities under finance
leases, borrower’s note loans and derivative financial liabilities.


financial assets are derecognised when one of the three following conditions is met:
■■   the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from a financial asset are extinguished.
■■   although the group retains the rights to receive the cash flows from financial assets, it assumes a contrac-
     tual obligation to immediately pay the cash flows to a third party in the context of an agreement that meets
     the requirements of ias 39.19 (“pass-through arrangement”).
■■   the group has transferred its contractual rights to receive the cash flows from a financial asset and substan-
     tially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of the financial asset have thereby been transferred, or
     alternatively when control of the financial asset has been transferred.

                        cash receipts from the sale of receivables that were not yet passed on to the buyer of the receivables on the
                        balance sheet date are reported under other financial liabilities.
                             financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation underlying the liability has been met, terminated
                        or extinguished.
                             financial instruments are initially recognised at their fair value. the assumption or issue of directly attributa-
                        ble transaction costs is considered when determining the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not
                        measured at fair value through profit or loss.
                             for subsequent measurement the financial instruments are allocated to one of the measurement categories
                        listed in ias 39 to which they are designated at the time of their initial recognition.


                        financial assets
                        financial assets are divided into the following categories:

                        ■■   financial assets remeasured to fair value through profit or loss
                             this category comprises financial assets held for trading (fahft) and financial assets that were, upon initial
                             recognition, designated as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl). financial assets are
                             classified as held for trading if they are acquired and held with a view to disposal in the near future. deriva-
                             tives, including embedded derivatives recognised separately, are also classified as held for trading with the
                             exception of such derivatives that were designated as a hedging instrument and are effective as such.
                               gains or losses on financial assets of this category are recognised in the income statement.
                               neither in the 2013 financial year nor in the previous year did the company classify any primary finan-
                             cial assets as held for trading, nor did it make use of the option to designate financial assets at fair value
                             through profit or loss upon their initial recognition.

                        ■■   held-to-maturity investments
                             held-to-maturity investments (htm) are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable pay-
                             ments and fixed maturity that an enterprise has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. they
                             are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. gains or losses are recognised in
                             net profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation
                             process.
                               the group had financial assets of this category in neither fiscal 2013 nor the previous year.

                        ■■   loans and receivables
                             loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
                             quoted in an active market. following initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised
                             cost using the effective interest rate method less any impairment.
                               valuation allowances are made when receivables are uncollectible or probably uncollectible and a reliable
                             estimate of the valuation allowance can be made. there is need for valuation allowance when there are
                             objectively discernable indications such as receivables overdue for a prolonged period, initiation of foreclo-
                             sure measures, looming default or overindebtedness as well as insolvency proceedings having been applied
                             for or commenced. trade receivables with usual payment terms, which normally do not exceed twelve

                                                                                                consolidated financial statements     | notes                                    |   141
                                                                                                                                    2 | principles of consolidation as well as

     months, are therefore recognised at the nominal amount, less appropriate allowances. receivables that do
     not bear interest or bear below market interest rates and have an expected term of more than one year are
     discounted with the discount subsequently amortised to interest income over the term of the receivable.
       impairment of trade receivables as well as receivables from long-term development contracts is rec-
     ognised in separate impairment accounts. impairment losses of all other financial assets are recognised
     directly.
       gains or losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised
     or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.

■■   available-for-sale financial assets
     available-for-sale financial assets (afs) are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available
     for sale and are not classified in one of the aforementioned categories. they must be measured at their
     fair value. the gains or losses resulting from valuation at fair value are recorded separately as accumulat-
     ed other comprehensive income within equity. if there are significant loss events or, in the case of equity
     instruments, losses ongoing over a longer period, this will be expensed accordingly in the income state-
     ment. the group assumes there to be a significant loss event involving impairment of more than 20 percent
     and prolonged decline in value of equity instruments to be probable when there has been continued loss
     in value over a period of twelve months. later reversals of impairment on available-for-sale financial assets
     are as a matter of principle recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income. only in the case of debt
     instruments are reversals recognised in the income statement up to the original amount of impairment,
     with any amounts above that recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income. provided that there
     is no quoted market price in an active market for investments in equity instruments and that their fair value
     cannot be reliably measured, they are carried at acquisitions cost. a write-down to the present value of the
     future cash flows is made in the case of a decline in value other than temporary.


financial liabilities
financial liabilities that fall into the category of “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” are also
carried at fair value in the subsequent periods with the resulting gains or losses recognised in the income
statement.
     this category comprises financial liabilities held for trading (flhft) as well as liabilities that were, upon initial
recognition, designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl). financial liabilities are
classified as held for trading if they are acquired and held with a view to disposal in the near future. deriva-
tives, including embedded derivatives recognised separately, are also classified as held for trading with the
exception of such derivatives that were designated as a hedging instrument and are effective as such.
     neither in the 2013 financial year nor in the previous did the company classify any primary financial liabilities
as held for trading, nor did it make use of the option to designate financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss (fvtpl) upon their initial recognition.
     all financial liabilities that do not fall into this category and are not derivative financial instruments are meas-
ured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method (financial liabilities at amortised cost – flac).
in the case of current liabilities, the amortised cost corresponds to either their repayment or settlement value.
gains or losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised or amortised.

                        cash and cash equivalents
                        cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cheques and immediately disposable bank deposits with an
                        original maturity of three months or less. cash is recognised at par value.


                        derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
                        derivative financial instruments entered into by the leoni group are recorded at their fair value on the bal-
                        ance sheet date. depending on their maturity, derivatives with a positive fair value are reported as current or
                        non-current other financial assets and derivates with a negative fair value are reported as current or non-cur-
                        rent other financial liabilities. in general, the group recognises the changes in fair value of derivative financial
                        instruments as earnings. however, the group records changes in fair value of foreign currency derivatives used
                        to hedge anticipated foreign currency-denominated cash flows on firm commitments and forecast transac-
                        tions in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognised in earnings when the
                        requirements of the standard to apply cash flow hedge accounting are met. the reclassification from accu-
                        mulated other comprehensive income into earnings occurs in the same period as the underlying transaction
                        takes place and has effect on net income. the ineffective portions of the fair value changes of those deriva-
                        tives are recognised in earnings immediately. the fair value changes of interest rate derivatives designated
                        to hedge non-current liabilities subject to interest rate fluctuation are also recognised in accumulated other
                        comprehensive or directly in equity if they meet the requirements to apply cash flow hedge accounting. the
                        amounts recorded in other comprehensive income subsequently lead to the interest expenditure from the
                        relevant underlying transaction recorded in the income statement being balanced.
                         where interest-rate derivative contracts are concluded to hedge the fair value of a hedged item measured at
                        amortised cost, the hedging instrument is measured at the fair value and any changes in fair value are recog-
                        nised in the income statement under either finance costs or finance revenue.
                         commodity future transactions that are settled in cash are recognised as derivatives, changes in the fair
                        value of which are recognised in the cost of sales.
                         contracts entered into for the purpose of receipt or supply of non-financial items according to the group’s
                        expected purchase, sale or usage requirements and held as such (own use contracts) are reported not as deriv-
                        ative financial instruments but as pending transactions.
                         if contracts contain embedded derivatives, such derivatives are reported separately from the host con-
                        tract when the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the
                        economic characteristics and risks of the host contract. the review whether a contract contains an embedded
                        derivative that must be reported separately from the host contract is made at the time when the company
                        became a contracting party. a reassessment is made only when there are major changes to the terms of the
                        contract that result in a significant change to the cash flows.

accruals
accruals are also reported under liabilities. accruals are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been
received but have not been paid or invoiced by the supplier.


pension and other post-employment benefits
the valuation of defined-benefit pension obligations is based upon actuarial computations using the project-
ed-unit-credit method in accordance with ias 19. changes due to the actuarial assumptions or differences
between the actual development and the original assumptions as well as gains or losses on the pension plan
or plan assets (actuarial gains or losses) as a difference between the return on plan assets recorded in net
interest expenses and the actual return are recognised in other comprehensive income. past service costs are
recognised in the income statement at the time of the change to the plan.
 the amount recognised as a defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined
benefit obligation, less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. the
value of a defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form
of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
 the interest costs relating to the net obligation are presented under finance costs.


other provisions
other provisions are recorded when a present legal or constructive obligation to a third party has been
incurred from past events, the payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. so far as
the group expects repayment for an accrued provision at least in part for example from an insurance policy,
such repayment is recognised as a separate asset provided the inflow of the repayment is virtually certain.
the provisions are valued according to ias 37 with the best estimate of the amount of the obligation. where
provisions do not become due until after one year and a reliable estimate of the payment amounts and dates
is possible, the present value for the non-current proportion is determined on a discounted basis. accrued
interest is recognised under interest expense.
 obligations to dispose of an asset and to re-cultivate its site or similar obligations must be recognised as a
component of acquisition and production costs and simultaneously recognised as a provision. in the subse-
quent periods this amount added to the asset is to be depreciated over its residual useful life. the best possi-
ble estimate of the payment obligation or provision is accreted to its present value at the end of each period.
 restructuring provisions are recognised when the constructive obligation has arisen according to the criteria
under ias 37.72.
 accruals are not reported under provisions, but rather under liabilities.


restructuring cost
costs incurred in connection with restructuring measures are presented in other operating expenses because
such costs do not pertain to the general operating activity of the functional areas and this provides a trans-
parent picture of the group’s restructuring activity. a breakdown of this cost according to the functional areas
shown on the income statement is contained in note 6.

                        income taxes
                        the current tax assets and tax liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expect-
                        ed to be recovered from the taxation authority or paid to the taxation authority. calculation of the amount is
                        based on the tax rates and tax laws in force on the balance sheet date.
                         deferred tax is, pursuant to ias 12, formed according to the balance sheet liability method. this provides
                        that tax assets and liabilities for all temporary differences, apart from the exceptions under ias 12.15,
                        ias 12.24, ias 12.39 and ias 12.44, between the carrying amount in the statement of financial position and the
                        amount for tax purposes as well as for tax loss carryforwards are recognised (temporary concept). deferred
                        taxes are measured using the currently enacted tax rates in effect during the periods in which the temporary
                        differences are expected to reverse. the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is
                        recognised in the period that the law is enacted. deferred tax assets are applied only to the extent that it is
                        more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realised. the deferred tax assets and those not recognised are
                        reviewed in this regard on each balance sheet date.
                         deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation author-
                        ity and the group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities.
                         income taxes referring to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income are also recognised in
                        other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.


                        earnings per share
                        earnings per share are computed in accordance with ias 33, earnings per share. the basic earnings per share
                        are computed by dividing consolidated net income due to the leoni shareholders by the weighted average
                        of the number of ordinary shares outstanding during the relevant period. the diluted earnings per share are
                        computed by dividing consolidated net income attributable to the leoni shareholders by the total of the
                        weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, plus the weighted average number of securities
                        that can be converted into ordinary shares. there was no dilution in the reporting periods presented.


                        statement of cash flows
                        the statement of cash flows is classified by operating, investing and financing activities in accordance with
                        ias 7. this involves cash flows from operating activities being determined by the indirect method whereby
                        net profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of
                        past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing
                        or financing cash flows. undistributed income from entities valued under the equity method and from other
                        comprehensive income in the income statement is principally reported under “other non-cash expenses
                        and income”. interest paid and interest and dividends received are classified as cash flows from operating
                        activities. dividends paid are classified as a financing cash flow. the cash holdings comprise cash and cash
                        equivalents. these include cash in hand, cheques and immediately disposable bank deposits with an original
                        maturity of up to three months. the effect of exchange rate-related changes in value on cash and cash equiv-
                        alents is presented separately so that the cash and equivalents at the beginning and end of the period can be
                        reconciled.

segment reporting
segment reporting is based on the accounting standard ifrs 8, operating segments, following the manage-
ment approach contained therein, which provides for reporting based on the internal organisational and
reporting structure as well as what management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. the
segment reporting and designation therefore follows the internal organisational and reporting structure of
the group. the group is organised into business units by products and services for the purpose of corporate
governance. the group therefore has two segments subject to reporting: wire & cable solutions and wiring
systems. management monitors the earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) separately to take decisions on
allocation of resources and to determine the profitability of the segments. the ebit is ascertained in line with
the accounting and valuation principles of the consolidated financial statements. it also contains the earnings
from measurement under the equity method of joint ventures and associates.


key judgments, estimates and assumptions
when preparing the consolidated financial statements management makes judgments, estimates and as-
sumptions that influence the amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as well as the expense and
income reported on the balance sheet date. the uncertainty that these assumptions and estimates involve
can, however, in future periods cause outcomes that result in major adjustment to the carrying amounts of
the assets and liabilities concerned.
 the most significant assumptions concerning the future as well as other key sources of estimation uncer-
tainty at the balance sheet date, which present a risk that material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the
assets and liabilities will be necessary within the next financial year, are explained hereinafter.
 testing of the goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life is based on their value in use.
non-current assets with a finite useful life were also tested for impairment based on their value in use. to
estimate the value in use the group must estimate the probable future cash flows of the cash-generating
units to which the non-current asset or goodwill relates, and moreover choose a reasonable interest rate to
compute the present value of these cash flows (discounted cash flow method). the cash flows are extrapolat-
ed from the business planning for the next five financial years, excluding any restructuring measures to which
the group has not yet committed and material, future capital expenditure that would raise the performance
of the cash-generating units tested. the business planning is prepared on a bottom-up basis, meaning that
the budgeted figures are prepared in detail for each business unit or business group and subsidiary and
condensed to the segments and the group as a whole. key planning assumptions are based on the unit-sales
projections issued by the carmakers. accordingly, the recoverable amount or value in use is heavily depend-
ent on the projections for quantities sourced. the recoverable amount is, furthermore, heavily dependent
on the discount rate applied under the discounted cash flow method. goodwill amounted to € 148,417 k on
31 december 2013 (previous year: € 149,353 k). although in the case of two items of goodwill in the wiring
systems division the test for impairment produced positive results of € 3,101 k and € 6,157 k, the value in use
of the underlying cash-generating units would, all other parameters being equal, correspond to their carrying
amounts when increasing the discount rate before taxes by 0.57 of a percentage point and 1.73 percentage
points, respectively. a further increase in the interest rate could therefore entail need for write-down. the

                        size of the write-down would depend on the specific test finding and could possibly also mean, alongside
                        impairment of the item of goodwill, impairment of intangible assets as well as property, plant and equipment.
                        further details of the tests for impairment of goodwill are to be found in note 17. in the case of intangible
                        assets with an indefinite useful life this exclusively involves brands acquired in a business combination. their
                        carrying amount on 31 december 2013 was the same as in the previous year: € 2,128 k. in the case of one
                        brand, the test for impairment of these assets found that an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by just 0.28
                        of a percentage point could, all other parameters equal, entail a need for write-down that could also, depend-
                        ing on the specific test findings, affect other non-current assets along with this brand. further details of the
                        tests for impairment of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are to be found in note 16. intangible
                        assets with finite useful lives involved a carrying amount of € 80,128 k on 31 december 2013 (previous year:
                        € 88,964 k). property, plant and equipment came to a carrying amount of € 709,782 k on 31 december 2013
                        (previous year: € 677,246 k). in the case of one cash-generating unit in the wiring systems division, the intan-
                        gible assets with a finite useful life, which involved mainly the acquired customer relationships, as well as the
                        property, plant and equipment, were tested for impairment because of the declining amount of business. the
                        test was based on the value in use, with the projected cash flows extrapolated from the current five-year plan.
                        the pre-tax discount rate applied was 14.78 percent. the test did not find any need for write-down. from an
                        increase in the pre-tax interest rate by more than 35.58 percentage points the value in use would, all other pa-
                        rameters being equal, drop below the carrying amount and there could be write-downs on intangible assets
                        as well as property, plant and equipment.
                         management must, with respect to accounting for capitalised deferred taxes relating mainly to unused
                        loss carryforwards, make estimates and judgments concerning future tax planning strategies, the expected
                        timing and the amount of taxable profit available in the future for use of the loss carryforwards. deferred tax
                        assets are recognised to the extent that deferred tax liabilities in the same amount and with the same term
                        applicable to them are expected. furthermore, deferred tax assets are recognised only if future taxable in-
                        come is with high probability expected that is sufficient to use the deferred tax assets from loss carryforwards
                        and temporary differences. for this judgment the taxable income is extrapolated from the business planning
                        that has been prepared according to the principles described above. due to the mounting uncertainty about
                        the future, the period under consideration is normally three years. in the case of entities in loss situations,
                        deferred tax assets are not recognised until there are signs of a turnaround or it is highly probable that the
                        future positive results can be generated. on 31 december 2013 the carrying amount of deferred tax assets
                        was € 56,999 k (previous year: € 52,158 k). further details are presented in note 9.
                         the pension expense pertaining to defined benefit plans post employment is determined based upon
                        actuarial computations. these measurements are based on assumptions and judgments with respect to
                        discount rates applied to the net obligation, future wage and salary increases, mortality and future pension
                        increases. due to the non-current nature of such plans, such estimates are subject to material uncertainties.
                        details of these uncertainties and sensitivities are presented in note 24. pension provisions amounted to €
                        113,261 k on 31 december 2013 (previous year: € 113,888 k).

reclassification of pre-year amounts
a change was made to the deferred income reductions as at the reporting date in the consolidated statement
of financial position for improved presentation of the asset situation. the proportion of deferred items that
will only be realised after more than one year was in the consolidated statement of financial position present-
ed under non-current assets and not as before within current assets. the corresponding figures of the previ-
ous year as at 31 december 2012 and 1 january 2012 were adjusted accordingly. due to the reclassification as
at 31 december 2012, other current assets are lower by € 9,073 k than previously presented and now amount
to € 80,588 k; conversely, other non-current assets amount to € 22,519 k after the reclassification. due to the
reclassification as at 1 january 2012, other current assets are lower by € 5,274 k than previously presented and
now amount to € 71,581 k; conversely, other non-current assets amount to € 19,036 k after the reclassification.
     apart from this reclassification, changes were made to corresponding figure of the previous year due to ap-
plication for the first time of the amended requirements under ias 19, employee benefits (ias 19 r). this also
affected the item other non-current assets. details of the impact of ias 19 r on the presented earlier periods
are contained in note 3, where the reclassifications described above have already been taken into account.




3 | new accounting requirements

new accounting requirements applied for the first time in the financial year

■■   in june 2011, the iasb issued an amendment to ias 1, presentation of financial statements – presentation of
     items of other comprehensive income, which is to be applied for the first time to financial years beginning
     on or after 1 july 2012. the new requirements involve changed grouping of items presented in other com-
     prehensive income. items that could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to profit or loss at a future point in time
     are to be presented separately from items that will never be reclassified. the new requirements therefore
     resulted in a corresponding change to presentation of the items in other comprehensive income in leoni’s
     consolidated financial statements.

■■   also in june 2011, the iasb issued numerous amendments to ias 19, employee benefits (ias 19 r). this
     amended standard is to be applied for the first time to financial years beginning on or after 1 january
     2013. the adjustments made range from fundamental changes such as removing the corridor mechanism,
     which served to spread or smooth the volatility arising from retirement benefit obligations over time, and
     the concept of expected returns on plan assets to simple clarifications and re-wording. the removal of the
     corridor mechanism and the associated recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive
     income as well as the use of a uniform net interest component for the expected return on plan assets and
     the interest expense on retirement benefit obligations have the greatest impact on leoni’s consolidated

                        financial statements. however, the amendments to ias 19 r also concern termination benefits and therefore
                        affect the accounting for partial retirement obligations. the most important changes in this respect concern
                        the accumulation of liability to pay top-up amounts. unlike previously, the opinion is that top-up funding
                        does not normally involve payments relating to termination benefits, but rather other benefits due to em-
                        ployees in the long term. the top-up amounts must be accumulated based on consideration of past service
                        cost. these changes to partial retirement obligations did not have any notable impact on the consolidated
                        financial statements.
                            the tables below present the effects of the amended accounting policies. the effects on the opening

     keeping the previous arrangements under ias 19 in the 2013 financial year would in principle have had a
     similar impact on the balance sheet items concerned and on profit or loss as in the preceding period pre-
     sented above. especially the amortisation of actuarial losses with a maintained corridor mechanism would
     thus in turn have had the greatest influence on earnings before interest and taxes.

■■   in december 2010, the iasb issued an amendment to ias 12, deferred taxes: recovery of underlying assets.
     the amendment clarifies the determination of deferred tax on property measured at fair value and intro-
     duces a rebuttable presumption that deferred tax on investment property using the fair value model in
     ias 40 should be determined on the basis that its carrying amount will be recovered through sale. it
     includes the requirement that deferred tax on non-depreciable assets that are measured using the reval-
     uation model in ias 16 should always be measured on a sale basis. the amendment is effective in the eu
     for financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2013. this change to ias 12 had no effect on the leoni
     group’s financial position or performance.

                        ■■   in may 2011, the iasb issued ifrs 13, fair value measurement, which must be applied for the first time to
                             financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2013. the standard establishes guidance for measuring fair
                             value and defines comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures on measurement of fair value.
                             ifrs 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair value, but rather provides guidance on how
                             to measure fair value under ifrs when fair value is required or permitted. ifrs 13 defines fair value as the
                             price that an entity would receive to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
                             between market participants at the measurement date. the new requirements resulted in additional
                             disclosure obligations (cf. note 28) and had no further, material effect on the group’s financial position or
                             performance.

                        ■■   in december 2011, the iasb issued an amendment to ifrs 7, financial instruments: disclosures. this change
                             is to be applied for the first time to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2013. disclosures on
                             offsetting of financial instruments were necessary due to the amended requirements (cf. note 27). the new
                             requirements resulted in additional disclosure rules for leoni’s consolidated financial statements and had
                             no effect on the group’s financial position or performance.

                        ■■   in may 2012, the iasb issued improvements to ifrss 2009-2011. the requirement clarifies several existing
                             standards and is to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2013. it had no material
                             effect on presentation of the leoni group’s financial position or performance.

                        ■■   in may 2013, the iasb issued amendments to ias 36, impairment of assets. these amendments restrict
                             the scope of the disclosure obligations concerning the recoverable amount for all cash-generating units
                             to which a significant item of goodwill is allocated. a disclosure is required for assets and cash-generating
                             units only if any impairment has been recognised or reversed during the current period. these require-
                             ments are to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014. earlier application is permit-
                             ted. leoni applied the requirements early to its 2013 financial year.


                        future, new accounting requirements


                        a) the following accounting requirements endorsed by the european union (eu) were not applied be-
                             cause application will only become obligatory in future periods:

                        ■■   in may 2011, with ifrs 10, consolidated financial statements, ifrs 11, joint arrangements, ifrs 12, disclo-
                             sure of interest in other entities, as well as consequential amendments to ias 27, separate financial state-
                             ments, and ias 28, investments in associates, the iasb issued updates and improvements to the accounting
                             and disclosure requirements concerning consolidation, joint arrangements or jointly controlled entities as
                             well as off-balance sheet activities. these requirements must each be applied in the eu for the first time to
                             financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014, though the eu does permit early application from
                             1 january 2013 in accordance with the iasb’s date of initial application.

                                                                                              consolidated financial statements     | notes                         |   151

     –– ifrs 10, consolidated financial statements, replaces the requirements under the previous ias 27, consol-
       idated and separate financial statements, on consolidated financial statements and sic-12, consolidation
       – special purpose entities. ifrs 10 establishes a single control model that applies to all entities including
       special purpose entities.
     –– ifrs 11, joint arrangements, replaces ias 31, interests in joint ventures, and the interpretation sic-13,
       jointly-controlled entities – non-monetary contributions by venturers. ifrs 11 removes the option to
       account for jointly controlled entities (jces) using proportionate consolidation. instead, jces that meet
       the definition of a joint venture must be accounted for using the equity method.
     –– ifrs 12, disclosure of interests in other entities, includes all the disclosures that were previously in ias 27
       related to consolidated financial statements, as well as all of the disclosures that were previously included
       in ias 31 and ias 28. these disclosures relate to an entity’s interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements,
       associates and structured entities.
     –– the scope of ias 27, separate financial statements, (as revised in 2011) was, with adoption of ifrs 10
       and ifrs 12, limited to accounting for subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates in separate
       financial statements.
     –– as a consequence of the new ifrs 11 and ifrs 12, the scope of ias 28, investments in associates and joint
       ventures (as revised in 2011), was extended, in addition to associates, also to application of the equity
       method to investments in joint ventures.

■■   in june 2012, the iasb issued a transition guidance in addition to ifrs 10, ifrs 11 and ifrs 12, which is also
     to be applied for the first time in the eu to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014, while the eu
     permits earlier application from 1 january 2013 in accordance with the iasb’s date of initial application.

■■   a further addition or amendment to ifrs 10, ifrs 12 and ias 27 with respect to investment entities was
     issued on 31 october 2012, which is to be applied from 1 january 2014. entities that qualify as an invest-
     ment entity as defined in this amended version of ifrs 10 are exempt from certain consolidation obliga-
     tions. rather, they must account for their subsidiaries at fair value through profit or loss pursuant to ifrs 9,
     financial instruments.

■■   in december 2011, the iasb issued amendments to ias 32, financial instruments: presentation. the amend-
     ments contain a clarification in the offsetting rules. furthermore, additional application guidelines on
     offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities were adopted in the standard. these changes are to be
     applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014.

■■   in june 2013, the iasb issued amendments to ias 39, financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
     under the amendments there would be no need to discontinue hedge accounting if a hedging derivative
     was novated, provided certain criteria are met. these changes are to be applied to financial years beginning
     on or after 1 january 2014.

                        application of ifrs 10, ifrs 11 and ifrs 12 as well as the two revised standards ias 27 and ias 28 on account-
                        ing for investments in subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates will not have any material effect
                        on presentation of the group’s financial position, performance or cash flows.
                             with respect to the other amendments and updates described above, the group does not expect any ma-
                        terial effect on its financial position or performance. additional explanatory notes might become necessary,
                        however.


                        b) the european union (eu) has not yet endorsed the following accounting
                             requirements issued by either the iasb or ifric:

                        ■■   in november 2009, the iasb issued ifrs 9, financial instruments: recognition and measurement. ifrs
                             9 initially introduces only new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets. under this
                             requirement financial assets must be accounted for either at amortised cost or at fair value through profit
                             or loss depending on their characteristics and taking into consideration the business models for managing
                             financial assets. equity instruments must always be accounted for at fair value, but changes in value of
                             equity instruments may be recorded in other comprehensive income so far as this option was established
                             upon their acquisition.
                               in october 2010, the iasb issued the second part of ifrs 9 with the new requirements for classifying and
                             measuring financial liabilities. in particular, these new requirements change the measurement of financial
                             liabilities that are measured through profit or loss by applying the fair value option. all other requirements
                             with respect to classifying and measuring financial liabilities were adopted in the new ifrs 9 unchanged
                             from ias 39.
                               in november 2013, the iasb issued additions to ifrs 9, which contain new requirements for hedge
                             accounting and replace the corresponding requirements in ias 39. these additions adopt a new general
                             hedge accounting model in the standard, which extends the scope of eligible hedged items and hedging
                             instruments. a fundamental difference to the previous ias 39 hedge accounting model is the lack of the
                             80 – 125 % per cent bright line threshold for effective hedges and the requirement to perform retrospective
                             hedge effectiveness testing. under the ifrs 9 model, it is necessary for there to be an economic relationship
                             between the hedged item and hedging instrument, with no quantitative threshold. however, the additions
                             to ifrs 9 include the accounting policy choice to account for all hedges under either the existing ias 39
                             requirements or the new ifrs requirements. the iasb has furthermore removed the date for mandatory in-
                             itial application from 1 january 2015 that was hitherto contained in ifrs 9. a new date for initial application
                             will not be set until the standard is available in full. the iasb has already decided, however, that ifrs 9 will
                             come into force at the earliest for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2017.

                        ■■   in november 2013, the iasb issued amendments to ias, employee benefits. the requirements under
                             ias 19 were revised with respect to contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to the peri-
                             od of service. provided the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of employee
                             service, the contributions can be recognised as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the

                                                                                             consolidated financial statements     | notes                         |   153

                                                                                                                                 4 | scope of consolidation




     related service is rendered. where the contributions depend on the number of years of employee service,
     ias 19.70 requires the contributions to be attributed to the periods of service. these changes are to be
     applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 july 2014.

■■   in december 2013, the iasb issued improvements to ifrss 2010-2012. the requirement clarifies seven exist-
     ing standards and is to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 july 2014.

■■   likewise in december 2013, the iasb issued improvements to ifrss 2011-2013. the requirement clarifies four
     existing standards and is to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 july 2014.

■■   in may 2013, the iasb issued ifric 21, levies. the interpretation clarifies for levies that are imposed by
     governments and do not fall within the scope of another ifrs how, and especially when, such liabilities
     according to ias 37, provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, are to be recognised. these
     requirements are to be applied to financial years beginning on or after 1 january 2014.


application of the above requirements will be binding in the future so far as they are endorsed by the eu.
the group is analysing the impact of these amended and new requirements. the current status of analysis
does not yet permit comment concerning the probable impact of the amended requirements on the group’s
financial position and performance.




4 | scope of consolidation

along with leoni ag, the consolidated financial statements account for 20 companies in germany and
63 companies outside germany in which leoni ag is entitled, either directly or indirectly, to a majority of the
voting rights. the scope of consolidation does not include any special-purpose entities pursuant to sic 12
because leoni does not control any companies that were established for a special purpose without or with
only limited equity interest.

                        as a result of a segment-overarching merger of our three slovakian subsidiaries into one legal entity, namely
                        leoni autokabel slowakia spol. s r.o., which was renamed leoni slovakia spol. s.r.o., two legal entities – leoni
                        slovakia spol. s r.o. in nová dubnica and leoni cable slovakia spol. s r.o. in stará turá – were absorbed. how-
                        ever, all of the facilities continue to exist within the single legal entity, meaning there was no material change.
                        likewise as a result of a segment-overarching merger of our wire & cable solutions division’s italian subsidiary
                        leoni silitherm s.r.l. based in monticelli d’ongina into leoni wiring systems italy s.r.l. of the wiring systems
                        division based in felizzano, the former was deconsolidated. following the merger, the latter was renamed
                        leoni italy s.r.l. with its base in felizzano. both operating facilities continue to work for their respective
                        segment. the chinese subsidiaries leoni wiring systems (liuzhou) co. ltd., weihai dk electronic co. ltd. and
                        weihai deakyeung electronic device assemble co. ltd., which have no longer been operational for some time
                        already, were deconsolidated following their removal from the commercial register. two wiring system plants
                        established in china during the financial year, namely langfang leoni wiring systems co. ltd. and leoni
                        wiring systems (tieling) co. ltd., were newly included within the scope of consolidation, as was the serbian
                        company leoni wcs southeast europe d.o.o., which was included within the wire & cable solutions division.
                         a complete list of the fully consolidated subsidiaries as well as of the associates and joint ventures on
                        31 december 2013 is shown at the end of these notes.



                        5 | acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries

                        fiscal 2013:
                        there were no business acquisitions or disposals during the current reporting period. the lyonese wares op-
                        erations of the wire & cable solutions division in italy were sold in july 2013 in the context of an asset deal for
                        € 120 k. the group received this consideration in the third quarter. there was no outflow of cash or cash equiv-
                        alents. the sale reduced balance sheet assets by € 1,376 k. this involved primarily machinery and inventory.
                        there was furthermore a reduction in liabilities of € 374 k. the transaction incurred a loss on disposal of
                        € 882 k.


                        fiscal 2012:
                        on 4 january 2012, leoni acquired the outstanding 50 percent of the shares in the south korean joint venture
                        daekyeung t&g co. ltd. based in busan at a price of 39,000 million korean won (krw), of which krw 20,000
                        million, or € 13,532 k, was paid on the takeover date and krw 19,000 million, € 13,562 k, was paid in december
                        2012. the consideration for the outstanding shares was € 24,301 k. taking the acquired cash and cash equiv-
                        alents totalling € 2,074 k as well as the payments of € 1,543 k received from hedging the exchange rate into
                        account, the cash consideration was € 23,477 k. transaction costs in the amount of € 248 k were expensed in
                        administrative costs. the south korean company including its four chinese subsidiaries is allocated to the wir-
                        ing systems division and manufactures wiring systems particularly for customers general motors, ssangyong
                        and volvo. the purpose of this full takeover was to tap into the south korean automotive market more quickly
                        and to forge ahead with incorporating the production facilities into leoni’s global production network.

                                                                                                 consolidated financial statements     | notes                           |   155

the company was first consolidated upon gaining control over it at the time of acquisition, i.e. on 4 january
2012. upon initial consolidation, the sum of consideration and the fair value of the existing shares in the
amount of € 48,602 k exceeded the acquired net identifiable assets and liabilities, which were likewise measu-
red at their fair value. this resulted in goodwill amounting to € 6,359 k, which pertained to synergies, the staff
and new customer potential. the goodwill is not tax deductible. the overview below shows the fair value of
the acquired assets and liabilities on the date of initial consolidation.

consolidated net income in fiscal 2012. measurement of the already existing shares at fair value resulted in
income of € 2,721 k. furthermore, an exchange gain, recognised in other comprehensive income until the
takeover date, on the existing shares in amount of € 2,232 k was recognised in the 2012 income statement.
both aforementioned factors were recognised in other operating income.

                        the context of an asset deal. leoni took a significant strategic step towards systematically enhancing its plug
                        and connector systems expertise with this purchase. along with the specific development know-how, the
                        company gained a team of eleven specialists and experts for setting up its business unit connectivity, which
                        is allocated to the wiring systems division. the acquired business operation was first consolidated upon ob-
                        taining control on 1 may 2012. the overview below shows the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities
                        on the date of acquisition. the purchase price, i.e. the transferred cash consideration, in the amount of
                        € 1,023 k exceeded the above figure by € 330 k, which meant reporting of goodwill that pertained to the
                        acquired staff and synergies.

                        the grants related to income of € 5,951 k pertained almost exclusively to the wiring systems division as in the
                        previous year (€ 7,670 k). more detailed explanation of this is to be found in note 7. the book profits from the
                        disposal of assets break down to € 974 k (previous year: € 3,075 k) for the wire & cable solutions division and
                        € 218 k (previous year: € 1,921k) for the wiring systems division. as in the previous year, the reversal of provi-
                        sions involved also exclusively restructuring provisions, with € 445 k (previous year: € 1,905 k) pertaining to the
                        wiring systems division and € 9 k (previous year: € 249 k) to the wire & cable solutions division.
                          the previous year’s income in the amount of € 2,721k from revaluation of the business units already held
                        resulted from measurement at fair value of the shares already held in daekyeung t&g co. ltd. prior to the
                        takeover (cf. note 5). the previous year’s positive currency result in the amount of € 8,168 k was attributable
                        mainly to the exchange gains on this transaction and from the sale of all the shares in switzerland-based
                        leoni studer hard ag reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement.
                          the other operating expenses in the amount of € 31,315 k (previous year: € 16,955 k) contained the following:

the restructuring expenses pertained in the amount of € 8,894 k (previous year: € 907 k) to the wire & cable
solutions division and in the amount of € 12,648 k (previous year: € 8,636 k) to the wiring systems division.
this involved primarily spending on severance, which also includes the additions to restructuring provisions
(cf. explanations in note 23 in this regard). in the wire & cable solutions division this involved measures
almost exclusively at our german facilities, primarily at our facility in stolberg. in the wiring systems division,
these expenses pertained almost entirely to production facilities in north africa and there involved particu-
larly closure of the plant in bouznika, morocco. the restructuring expenses related to the cost of sales in the
amount of € 17,401 k (previous year: € 8,801 k), to selling expenses in the amount of € 1,713 k (previous year:
€ 80 k), to general administrative costs in the amount of € 2,045 k (previous year: € 424 k) as well as to research
and development costs in the amount to € 383 k (previous year: € 238 k).
 the losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment as well as intangible assets in the amount of
€ 2,475 k (previous year: € 1,791 k) included the loss of € 882 k from the sale of the lyonese wares operations in
italy (cf. note 5).
 details of the fine incurred due to the competition proceedings are to be found in note 26.
 the exchange losses amount to € 606 k (previous year: exchange gains of € 8,168 k). combined with the ex-
change losses on financing activity in the amount of € 1,716 k (previous year: a gain of € 3,457 k), which were
included in finance income, there was an exchange loss totalling € 2,322 k (previous year: an exchange gain of
€ 11,625 k).



7 | government grants

the group obtained government grants related to income totalling € 12,970 k in fiscal 2013 (previous year:
€ 10,114 k). in the amount of € 1,768 k (previous year: € 2,444 k) this involved mainly allowances for part-time
working for older employees and grants for research and development work. this income was directly offset
in the income statement with the expenses incurred. in the amount of € 5,951 k (previous year: € 7,670 k) this
involved grants related to income primarily to promote export business in egypt and china. this includes
€ 800 k in government grants from 2010 for building a plant in serbia, which was tied to the creation and
three-year retention of jobs. the aforementioned income of € 5,951 k was recognised in other operating
income (cf. note 6) and pertained, as in the previous year, almost entirely to the wiring systems division. in
the 2013 financial year, the group received further grants related to income amounting to € 5,251 k in serbia
for building a second plant to produce wiring systems. these grants were presented under current liabilities
and will be recognised in profit or loss as soon as the corresponding costs for building the plant are incurred.
these grants are also tied to the creating and three-year retention of jobs.
 government grants for capital investment in property, plant and equipment in the amount of € 74 k
(previous year: € 485 k) were recognised in fiscal 2013. these were deducted from the costs to purchase and
manufacture the related property, plant and equipment.

                        8 | finance revenue and costs

                        the finance revenues involved entirely interest income in the amount of € 543 k (previous year: € 4,729 k).
                        alongside interest income of € 1,272 k, this item included exchange gains of € 3.457 k in the previous year. as
                        in the previous year, all interest income was computed on the basis of the effective interest rate method.

                        in the 2013 financial year, the group recorded tax expenses of € 25,324 k (previous year: € 42,777 k) in the
                        income statement. tax expense of € 2,614 k (previous year: € 1,139 k tax income) was recognised in other
                        comprehensive income.
                          deferred tax assets and liabilities should be measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the peri-
                        od when the asset is realised or the liability is settled. for the group’s german companies, the deferred taxes
                        on 31 december 2013 were calculated using a corporate tax rate of 15 percent, unchanged from the previous
                        year, for all temporary differences. again included was a solidarity surcharge of 5.5 percent (previous year:
                        5.5 percent) on the corporate tax plus an average trade tax rate of 13.8 percent (previous year: 13.0 percent).

including the impact of the solidarity surcharge and the trade tax, the tax rate applied to calculate deferred
taxes for german companies thus amounted to a combined 29.6 percent (previous year: 28.9 percent). for
non-german companies the country-specific, respective tax rates were used.
  in the financial year, changes in the average corporate tax rate in germany as well as changes in foreign
tax rates were recognised in the income statement in the amount of € 1,572 k (previous year: € 2,209 k). the
changed foreign tax rates involved primarily mexico and the united kingdom. in the previous year the amount
recognised in the income statement concerned mainly a subsidiary in china. the reconciliation below takes
the impact of each of these tax rate changes into account.
  the table below reconciles the statutory income tax expense or the expected tax expense at the reported
tax rate to the effective income taxes presented in the financial statements for the respective financial year. to
calculate the projected income tax expense we multiplied the pre-tax earnings by the combined income tax
rate in germany of 29.6 percent (previous year: 28.9 percent) applicable to the financial year.

the change in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in the negative amount of € 1,064 k (previous year:
negative € 2,697 k) in the fiscal year involved tax assets not deferred in the amount of € 7,400 k (previous
year: € 1,604 k). as in the previous year, these valuation allowances concerned primarily deferred tax assets
from loss carryforwards to the extent it is considered more likely than not that such benefits will be used
in future years. in determining the valuation allowance all factors including legal factors and information
available were taken into account. deferred tax assets, which in preceding periods we applied primarily to loss
carryforwards, were written down in the amount of € 1,137 k (previous year: € 1,236 k). the change in valua-
tion allowances included reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets with effect on the income
statement in the negative amount of € 6,963 k (previous year: a negative amount of € 5,482 k). these reversals
were applied mainly to deferred taxes for loss carryforwards that are expected to be used in the future due
to the merger of two italian subsidiaries and a case of restructuring in china. the item included a negative
amount of € 2,638 k (previous year: negative € 55 k) for the use of loss carryforwards for which no tax assets
were recognised in the previous years.

on the balance sheet date the group had mainly foreign income tax but also german corporate tax loss
carryforwards totalling € 222,225 k (previous year: € 185,959 k), of which € 121,677 k (previous year:
€ 70,358 k) may, based on legislation applicable on the respective reporting date, be carried forward indefi-
nitely and in unlimited amounts. however, losses carried forward in germany from the 2004 tax-assessment
year and in france from the 2011 tax-assessment year may be deducted from income without restriction up
to € 1,000 k only. any remaining amount of income may be offset by loss carryforwards by up to 60 percent.
the remaining tax losses eligible for limited carryforward pertained exclusively to foreign subsidiaries and will
expire by 2033 at the latest if not utilised. the table below shows the usability of the loss carryforwards:

amortisation of intangible assets with a finite useful life was included in the cost of sales in the amount of
€ 14,167 k (previous year: € 14,510 k), in selling expenses in the amount of € 677 k (previous year: € 668 k), in
general and administrative expenses in the amount of € 4,283 k (previous year: € 4,298 k) as well as in research
and development costs in the amount of € 514 k (previous year: € 681 k).
  intangible assets with an indefinite useful life were, just as the goodwill, tested for impairment as at
31 october. this involved two brands in the wire & cable solutions division, specifically in one cash-generat-
ing unit in each of business group communication & infrastructure and business group industry & healthcare.
the impairment tests based the recoverable amount of the respective cash-generating unit on the value in
use. the underlying cash flow forecasts are in each case based on the five-year business planning as approved
by the management board. the cash flow planning was as a matter of principle on a bottom-up basis from
the individual planning of the operating units. it took into account price agreements based on experience and
anticipated efficiency enhancements as well as a sales trend based on the strategic outlook. the cash flows
after the five-year period were, in the case of the brand in business group communication & infrastructure,
as in the previous year extrapolated by applying a zero growth rate. the pre-tax discount rate applied was
13.48 percent (previous year: 13.29 percent). in the case of the brand in business group industry & healthcare,
a pre-tax discount rate of 12.17 percent (previous year: 12.07 percent) was applied for the five-year detailed
planning period and thereafter one of 10.67 percent (previous year: 11.07 percent), which corresponds to a
growth rate of 1.5 percent after the five-year planning period. neither impairment test resulted in any need
for write-down. in the case of the brand in business group industry & healthcare, the value in use of the
cash-generating unit exceeded the carrying amount of € 13.2 million by just € 0.3 million. an increase in the
pre-tax discount rate by more than 0.28 of a percentage point would, all other parameters being equal, take
the value in use of the cash-generating unit below its carrying amount.
  as in the previous year, no write-downs on intangible assets were recognised in the 2013 financial year.
  there was no appreciation either in this financial year or in the previous year.

                        the goodwill shown on 31 december 2013 broke down to € 69,586 k (previous year: € 69,970 k) for the wire
                        & cable solutions division and € 78,831 k (previous year: € 79,383 k) for the wiring systems division. the
                        goodwill existing in the wire & cable solutions division as at 31 december 2013 stems from the following key
                        acquisitions: € 17,960 k leoni schweiz ag (formerly studer ag), € 12,841 k leoni special cables gmbh,
                        € 8,992 k leoni silitherm s.r.l., € 7,530 k leoni kabelsysteme gmbh (formerly klink & oechsle gmbh and
                        neumatic elektronik + kabeltechnik gmbh & co. kg) and € 6,899 k leoni elocab gmbh. in the wiring systems
                        division the largest amount of goodwill, € 67,394 k, stems from the acquisition of valeo connective systems,
                        while € 6,157 k pertains to the purchase of daekyeung t&g co. ltd.
                         the previous year’s additions in the amount of € 6,689 k pertained to the south korean daekyeung t&g
                        co. ltd. company as well as the development operation acquired from the fct electronic gmbh company.
                        the disposals in the previous year involved the sold subsidiary leoni studer hard ag in the amount of
                        € 10,320 k and closure of the plant in weihai, china in the amount of € 253 k (cf. also note 5 on the additions
                        and disposals).
                         in addition to the obligatory impairment tests of all goodwill that must be carried out at lease once a year,
                        the company carries out additional impairment tests during the financial year where there are indications of
                        impairment.
                         the obligatory impairment test of all goodwill that must be carried out at least once a year was executed as
                        at 31 october.
                         for the purpose of the impairment test, all goodwill was allocated to the cash-generating units or groups
                        of cash-generating units that benefit from the synergies of the business combination. the principal goodwill
                        allocations were as follows:
                         in the wiring systems division, the largest item of goodwill in the amount of € 67.4 million (previous year:
                        € 67.4 million) was allocated at segment level.
                         in the wire & cable solutions division, goodwill totalling € 36.9 million (previous year: € 37.0 million) was
                        allocated to business group industry & healthcare. goodwill totalling € 28.5 million (previous year: € 28.8 mil-
                        lion) and of € 4.2 million as in the previous year was allocated to business group communication & infrastruc-
                        ture and to business group automotive cables, respectively.
                         in all the goodwill impairment tests, determination of the recoverable amount was based on the value in
                        use. the underlying cash flow forecasts are in each case based on the five-year business planning as approved
                        by the management board. the cash flow planning is as a matter of principle on a bottom-up basis from
                        the individual planning of the operating units. the planning is based among other things on the unit sales
                        announced by the carmakers. furthermore, it takes into account price agreements based on experience and
                        anticipated efficiency enhancements as well as a sales trend based on the strategic outlook. as in the previous
                        year, cash flows after the five-year period were in each case extrapolated by applying a zero growth rate.
                        the pre-tax discount rates applied were as follows: for the wiring systems division 13.38 percent (previous
                        year: 13.71 percent), for business group automotive cables 14.72 percent (previous year: 14.97 percent), for
                        business group industry & healthcare 12.60 percent (previous year: 12.81 percent) and for business group
                        communication & infrastructure 12.08 percent (previous year: 12.46 percent).
                         the test for impairment of goodwill found no need for write-down.

                                                                                             consolidated financial statements | notes                             |   171

the group’s management holds the basic view that, by prudent judgment, any fundamentally possible change
to basic assumptions for determining the value in use of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generat-
ing units to which goodwill has been allocated would not lead to the carrying amounts of the cash-generating
units exceeding their recoverable amount. in the wiring systems division there are exceptions in the cases of
two cash-generating units to which relatively small amounts of goodwill of € 3.1 million and € 6.2 million were
allocated. the discount rates were 14.18 percent and 12.48 percent. when testing the goodwill of € 3.1 million,
a discount rate of 12.68 percent was applied to the time after the five-year detailed planning period, which
equated to a 1.5 percent rate of growth after the five-year period. in the cases of these cash-generating units,
the carrying amounts could exceed the values in use as a result of an increase in the discount rates or if projec-
tions of earnings were to worsen. based on the assumptions made for these cash-generating units, the values
in use exceeded the carrying amounts of € 65.6 million and € 113.7 million by € 2.8 million and € 20.1 million,
respectively. from an increase in the discount rates by 0.57 of a percentage point and 1.73 percentage points,
respectively, the values in use would, all other parameters being equal, be below the carrying amounts.

                        on 31 december 2013, the joint ventures had lease payment obligations amounting to € 335 k (previous year:
                        € 536 k). due to purchase order commitments there were financial obligations amounting to € 38 k (previous
                        year: € 20 k). € 168 k and € 19 k of these respective amounts applied to leoni in line with its shareholdings in
                        these joint ventures (previous year: € 268 k and € 10 k).



                        19 | other non-current financial assets

                        the other non-current financial assets amounting to € 1,065 k (previous year: € 1,313 k) comprised investments
                        classified as available-for-sale securities. they were valued at cost because there was no quoted price in an
                        active market and their fair value could not be reliably measured.
                         the item also included primarily loans to third parties and staff in the amount of € 1,355 k (previous year:
                        € 2,535 k) and collateral, pertaining mostly to rental deposits for office and warehouse buildings as well as staff
                        residential units, in the amount of € 2,375 k (previous year: € 2,643 k).



                        20 | financial debts

                        the financial liabilities comprised liabilities to banks, notes payable and other loan obligations. they totalled
                        € 454,964 k on 31 december 2013 (previous year: € 547,493 k). current financial liabilities and the short-term
                        proportion of long-term loans amounted to € 41,279 k on the reporting date, whereas the item showed an
                        amount of € 270,845 k on 31 december 2012. the decrease is due mainly to having repaid as planned the bond
                        in the nominal amount of € 200 million that leoni ag had issued in july 2006 and a borrower’s note loan in
                        the nominal amount of € 24 million. the repayments were made from available cash and cash equivalents.
                         non-current financial liabilities rose from € 276,648 k on 31 december 2012 to € 413,685 k in the period
                        under report. this is attributable to having drawn on the loan taken out with the european investment bank in
                        the nominal amount of € 100 million, to having issued a new borrower’s note loan in the nominal amount of
                        € 25 million and to having taken out foreign currency loans totalling close to € 12 million.

                                              the personnel-related provisions involved mainly long-term provisions for partial retirement agreements in
                                              germany in the amount of € 7,037 k (previous year: € 7,091 k) and provisions for anniversary bonuses in the
                                              amount of € 9,243 k (previous year: € 9,067 k). the provision for anniversary bonuses is paid out according to
                                              the age structure of the workforce upon the employees’ respective anniversaries of service. based on the cur-
                                              rent workforce, payments will mostly become due in the next 20 years. the payments relating to provisions
                                              for partial retirement will probably be spread over the next 6.5 years.
                                                the product warranties were determined on the basis of past experience, with goodwill concessions also
                                              taken into account. provisions were added in the amount of € 4,809 k (previous year: € 6,480 k) for claims
                                              under warranty and/or for compensation in fiscal 2013. these provisions for claims under warranty and/or for
                                              compensation were offset by claims against the insurer in the amount of € 4,428 k (previous year: € 3,785 k).
                                                there were also provisions for purchasing and distribution to cover onerous contracts.
                                                the restructuring provisions in the amount of € 12,124 k (previous year: € 9,654 k) pertained to the wire
                                              & cable solutions division in the amount of € 6,576 k (previous year: € 1,283 k) and to the wiring systems
                                              division in the amount of € 5,548 k (previous year: € 8,371 k). the non-current proportion of the restructuring
                                              provisions involved mostly severance costs in italy in the wiring systems division, payment of which stretches
                                              into the year 2016. use of restructuring provisions involved the amounts set aside in previous years for
                                              severance costs pertaining to the wiring systems division in italy, slovakia and morocco as well as to the wire
                                              & cable solutions division in germany. the additions totalling € 7,242 k pertained in the amount of € 5,831 k
                                              (previous year: € 289 k) to severance costs in the wire & cable solutions division, primarily for our facility in
                                              stolberg, germany.
                                                the other provisions amounting to € 4,273 k (previous year: € 4,874 k) included an addition of € 1,500 k for
                                              soil rehabilitation at the wire & cable solutions division’s facility in roth.

24 | pension provisions

at leoni there are in various countries pension commitments that provide for benefits in the event of disable-
ment, retirement or death. these principal commitments are limited to our companies in the united kingdom,
germany and switzerland, and are set up as defined benefit plans. the obligations and the plan assets of the
pension plans in these three countries accounted for 97.0 percent and 99.5 percent, respectively, of the group
total. the pension plans in the united kingdom and switzerland are managed by legally independent entities,
namely the leoni uk pension scheme and vorsorgestiftung leoni schweiz. there were no commitments in
the group to assume costs or pay contributions in connection with healthcare expenses incurred after termi-
nation of the employment.


germany
in germany, leoni grants defined benefits to most employees for the deferral of compensation. amounts of
deferred compensation earn interest at a rate of about 6 percent per year and on occurrence of the insured
event entitle the insured to payout of a specified lump sum. these benefits are covered by capital insurance.
the reinsurance policies are qualifying insurance policies and are therefore recognised as plan assets. the
terms of the insurance policies are in line with the dates when the benefits become due.
 the pension plan of leonische drahtwerke ag, which in the past covered all employees, was closed to
people joining the company after 31 december 1981, was replaced by the pension plan of leoni ag in the
past financial year. furthermore, the pension plan’s assets, from which payments of pension benefits that
had already started at the time of the closure were made, were transferred to leoni ag. this transfer of the
pension plan did not entail any change to benefits for either people now in retirement or for future benefi-
ciaries. the amount of pension benefit payments is based on years of service and the salary of the last year of
employment.
 pension obligations of acquired german companies are generally based on eligible compensation levels
and/or ranking within the company hierarchy and years of service, or on a fixed amount per year of service. all
defined pension plans of acquired companies are closed to new staff.
 the plans in germany are exposed to risks relating primarily to interest rates, longevity and partly also salary
increases.


united kingdom
in the united kingdom there is a defined benefit plan that was set up in the year 2000 and replaced the
pension plan in place until then. until it was closed to new staff joining in 2008, all employees were able to
participate in this plan. the pension plan is administered by a trust whose board comprises both employer
and employee representatives. there are also outside experts consulting on asset management and actuarial
matters. the trust determines the contributions to be paid in by leoni and decides on the additional contri-
butions to be paid by leoni in the event of any plan deficit. the current deficit at the end of the financial was
€ 45,473 k, equating to 29.3 percent of the defined benefit obligation. the amounts to be paid in to clear the
current deficit were agreed between leoni and the trust and span a period of 15 years.

                        the amount of committed benefits is based upon the salary of the last year of employment as well as years of
                        service and contributions of the participants to the fund. pension adjustments are linked to an inflation index,
                        reflecting increases in the cost of living.
                         leoni is exposed due to these plans in the united kingdom to risks involving primarily interest rates, invest-
                        ment, inflation and longevity as well as salary increases.


                        switzerland
                        in switzerland there is, alongside the state pension, a statutory obligation to provide employees with pension
                        insurance, which pays benefits in the event of retirement, disablement and death. this involves a defined
                        benefit plan that, at leoni, is managed by the legally independent ‘vorsorgestiftung leoni schweiz’ (leoni
                        switzerland pension trust). the trust’s management is incumbent upon the board of trustees, which com-
                        prises an equal number of employer and employee representatives. the risks relating to longevity, interest
                        rates and investment are borne exclusively by the trust. the savings contributions to the trust are paid in
                        equal amounts by the employer and employees. a variety of measures can be applied in the event of any plan
                        deficit. alongside the options of reducing the pension payments or increasing the savings contributions, there
                        is a statutory obligation on companies to pay recapitalisation contributions.
                         the size of benefit payments is, in the event of disability or death, geared to the amount of income insured,
                        or, in the case of retirement, depends on the credit balances in nominal savings accounts (old-age credit).


                        other countries
                        in france there are defined benefit plans in accordance with the country’s legal requirements and other agree-
                        ments. the collective agreement of the french metal-working trade union determines the size of the benefit.
                        it is linked to monthly wages and salaries and depends on years of service.
                         at the italian subsidiaries there are pension plans in accordance with the local legal requirements. these

the assumptions for interest rates, rates of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets on
which the calculation for defined benefit obligations is based were established for each country as a function
of their respective economic conditions. the discount rate was determined on the basis of top-tier, fixed-in-
come corporate bonds. this involved referencing bonds that on the reporting date had maturities in line with
the pension obligations and are quoted in the corresponding currency. aa-rated bonds were used as the basis
for data to determine the discount rates.

                                                 the assumed mortality is based on published statistics and historical data in the respective countries. the
                                                 valuation of the retirement benefit obligations in the united kingdom was based on the s1na mortality table.
                                                 in 2013, this mortality table was adjusted with the cmi 2011 core model index. this took account of the current
                                                 trend in the life expectancy projection. the effect is contained in the revaluation of net liability under the item
                                                 ‘change in demographic assumptions’. in germany the mortality tables used were the ‘heubeck-richttafeln
                                                 2005 g’, while in switzerland it was the ‘bvg 2010 generationentafel’.


                                                 the discount rate is the key determinant for the amount of net pension obligations. an increase or a decrease

benefit obligation of the plans as follows: in the united kingdom by 2.32 percent, in germany by 2.54 percent
and in switzerland by 1.20 percent.
  the calculation of sensitivities was, as part of an observation performed on a ceteris paribus basis, based on
changing an assumption, whereas all other assumptions remain unchanged, whereby dependencies between
the assumptions are ruled out. the method for calculating sensitivities is identical to that for calculating the
net pension obligation.
  the defined benefit plan expense recognised in comprehensive income comprises the amounts contained in
consolidated net income and in other comprehensive income:

                        at leoni the key benefit commitments are, in accordance with the company’s articles of association,
                        furnished with a benefit reserve that is suited in its nature to funding the benefit payments when they are
                        due and in the required amount. in the case of the german pension plan this is done exclusively by means
                        of qualifying life insurance policies that are synchronised in their terms and amounts with the expected
                        benefit payments. in the case of the pension plans in the united kingdom and switzerland, the boards of the
                        independent trusts ensure adherence to the investment strategies. these strategies are aimed at minimising
                        potential investment risk, having sufficient funds available at short notice to serve the benefit payments due
                        and at generating a return that is in line with the market over the long term. assessments of the investment
                        portfolio are regularly conducted together with independent, outside specialists in the fields of asset invest-
                        ment and actuarial policies to review the attainment of strategic targets and for the boards on that basis to
                        take investment decisions.

contingent capital
shareholders at the annual general meeting on 6 may 2010 authorised the management board to issue
convertible bonds and/or warrant-linked bonds until 5 may 2015. this involved a contingent increase in share
capital by up to € 14,850 k. the contingent capital increase is only to be performed to the extent that conver-
sion and/or option rights have been utilised or that the holders and/or creditors obliged to convert have met
their conversion obligation and provided that no cash settlement has been granted or company shares or
new shares from the utilisation of approved capital are utilised for the exercise of rights.


dividend payment
a dividend for the 2012 financial year of € 49,004 k was paid out in fiscal 2013. this corresponded to a dividend
of € 1.50 per share entitled to dividend.


dividend proposal
the management board will propose to shareholders at the annual general meeting to pay out from the fiscal
2013 distributable profit of leoni ag, amounting to € 33,559 k as determined under the german commercial
code and the german public companies act, a dividend of € 32,669 k and to carry the remainder of € 890 k
forward. this corresponds to a dividend of € 1.00 per share entitled to dividend.

                        litigation and claims
                        as reported, leoni was affected since the end of february 2010 by international investigations under com-
                        petition law in the automotive supply sector and the european commission commenced proceedings in this
                        regard on 3 august 2012, against leoni ag among others. as part of these proceedings, the commission
                        investigated whether competitors breached competition law in the sale of cable harnesses in europe. as
                        also reported, the eu commission imposed a fine of € 1,378 k on leoni ag and one of its french subsidiar-
                        ies, which are jointly and severally liable. the eu commission’s proceedings under competition law against
                        leoni as a manufacturer of cable harnesses were thus completed in the past financial year. leoni cooperated
                        extensively with the authority and contributed to resolving the matter, and reached a settlement in july 2013.
                        a french subsidiary was in one single instance involved in a breach of the law between may and december
                        2009. although not itself involved in this violation, leoni ag as the group holding company assumes joint
                        liability for this violation as determined under the stipulations of european law. the customer did not suffer
                        any damage due to the alleged conduct. the possibility cannot be ruled out, however, that this or another
                        customer or a third party might attempt to assert claims. leoni believes that it would be able to successfully
                        defend itself against any such claims.
                         since october 2011, several civil proceedings in the form of class action lawsuits against major wiring
                        systems manufacturers that operate internationally have been initiated in the united states and canada. the
                        claimants allege that they paid excessively for wiring systems and thus their vehicles equipped with them
                        because of alleged breaches of us and canadian antitrust law. the court decision as to whether and to what
                        extent leoni continues to be included in the proceedings is still pending. leoni will continue to defend itself
                        in these civil proceedings and believes that it will be able to refute the allegations and to bring the proceed-
                        ings in both the united states and canada to a successful conclusion.
                         other than the above, there have not been any and there are currently no pending lawsuits or court pro-
                        ceedings that might have a major impact on leoni’s business.
                         in addition to the legal disputes described above, there are, in the context of leoni’s business activity, pend-
                        ing claims for damages under warranty and product liability for compensation in amounts normal for the
                        sector, some of which are covered by insurance. the insurers are currently examining the cases. appropriate
                        amounts with respect to claims for damages and, where applicable, claims against the insurers have been
                        recognised. possible future liability for damages under warranty and/or for compensation may arise in an
                        amount usual for the field of business the company is dealing in.

credit risk
all customers that conclude business with the group on a credit basis are subject to credit screening. regular
analysis of receivables and the structure of the receivables facilitates ongoing monitoring of the risk. accounts
receivable management is organised in a decentralised way but is controlled by head office, which sets condi-
tions by means of the existing guideline for group-wide accounts receivable management.
  there were no indications on the reporting date that trade receivables, which are neither impaired nor
overdue, would not be settled.
  the table below shows the breakdown by region of receivables from customers.

information on the due dates of trade receivables is presented in note 11.
  34 percent (previous year: 26 percent) of all receivables were covered, with insurance limits, by a group
master policy with a credit insurer or other local credit insurers. insurance excess amounts were disregarded
in determining the total amount insured. the amount actually insured was consequently slightly below this
percentage. 51 percent (previous year: approx. 51 percent) of the non-insured receivables involved customers
that are exempt from contractually compulsory cover. the customers exempt from contractually compulsory

                        the insured subsidiaries must apply for credit insurance limits to the credit insurer for all receivables from
                        customers that are not exempt from compulsory cover and that exceed the limits specified on the existing
                        guideline. the following specific conditions apply: leoni has an obligation to declare exposure to the credit
                        insurers for all receivables from customers greater than € 50 k. a cover limit can also be obtained for smaller
                        receivables. consignment stores and manufacturing risks are covered by blanket insurance. the credit
                        insurance policy reimburses 90 percent of the insured amount. measurement and monitoring with respect to
                        impairment of the non-insured receivables is supported among other things by the credit screening carried
                        out by the credit insurer and other service providers.
                         the subsidiaries that were not insured will be integrated in the master policy so far as this makes sense from
                        the aspect of the principal customer base and provided there are no regional or political reasons on the part
                        of the credit insurer against inclusion. the subsidiaries that cannot be integrated are to be covered via local
                        credit insurers. internal credit limits are set for major customers that are exempt from mandatory cover and
                        other non-insured customers. limits are applied for without delay, on a decentralised basis and are moni-
                        tored by head office accounts receivable management.
                         factoring, or true sale factoring for selected customers, serves as a further tool to reduce the risk of default.
                        customers with good credit ratings are also included.


                        liquidity risk
                        the group monitors its current liquidity situation on a daily basis. monthly, currency-specific, rolling liquidity
                        planning for respective periods of at least twelve months is used to control future liquidity requirement.
                        the planning takes into consideration the terms of investments and financial assets (e.g. receivables, other
                        financial assets) as well as the expected cash flows from business activity. in addition, we analyse our existing
                        finance based on our medium-term planning, which we revise annually. we initiate suitable measures in good
                        time so far as there is any change in borrowing requirement.
                         the group’s objective is to ensure funding in the respectively required currency. flexibility is maintained by
                        using overdrafts, loans, leases, factoring and capital market instruments. a wide variety of financial instru-
                        ments is available to leoni on the capital market, from banks and among suppliers without the need for an
                        external rating, financial covenants or other collateralisation.
                         to ensure liquidity and to cover required guarantees, there were on the balance sheet date credit lines from
                        first-rate banks amounting to € 478,735 k (previous: € 485,975 k) with terms up to 28 months. these credit

                        all instruments held on the respective balance sheet date and for which payments were already contractually
                        agreed were also included. foreign currency amounts were in each case translated at the spot rate on the
                        reporting date. the variable interest payments pertaining to the financial instruments were determined on
                        the basis of the interest rates fixed most recently prior to the respective balance sheet date. financial liabilities
                        repayable at any time are always allocated to the earliest time period. in the case of the currency derivates,
                        both the cash outflow and the cash inflow are presented in the table above for the purpose of transparency.
                         non-deliverable forwards (ndfs) were signed to hedge amounts in currencies that are not freely converti-
                        ble. this form of foreign currency transaction involves fulfilment upon maturity being based not on handling
                        the cash flows in the corresponding currencies, but in the form of a settlement payment.


                        interest rate risks
                        we use interest rate derivatives, among other means, to avoid the risk of changes in interest rates. such con-
                        tracts are signed exclusively by leoni ag. on 31 december 2013, there was one interest rate derivative matur-
                        ing in one year and three months. the agreed reference interest rate was the euribor for three months. due
                        to the early refinancing measures in fiscal 2012, this interest rate derivative no longer fulfilled the conditions
                        for hedge accounting. the changes in market value that occurred up to the date on which the hedge rela-
                        tionship was ended were recognised within accumulated other comprehensive income. they remain in other
                        comprehensive income and will be reclassified pro-rata over the remaining term of the respective derivative
                        to finance costs in the income statement. the residual value recognised in other comprehensive income as at
                        31 december 2013 amounted to negative € 2,779 k. the reclassification to finance costs amounted to
                        € 3,218 k. changes in market value occurring after the hedge relationship has ended are recorded in the
                        income statement.
                         an interest rate swap was entered into for the borrower’s note loan in the amount of € 25,000 k newly taken
                        out in november; in the same amount and with the same term to hedge the risk of changes in values. leoni
                        ag receives fixed interest on the nominal amount for the interest rate swap and pays a variable interest rate
                        including a margin. the interest rate swap hedges the fair value of the borrower’s note loan. the residual
                        term is six years and ten months, and the euribor was agreed as the reference interest rate for one year. the
                        reduction in the interest rate swap’s fair value excluding accrued interest (clean fair value) by negative € 8 k
                        (previous year: € 0 k) was netted as an expense in the financial result with the corresponding positive amount
                        from measurement of the borrower’s note loan. there was no ineffectiveness.


                        the changes in market value of the interest rate derivatives totalled € 2,420 k in the financial year (previous
                        year: € 4,905 k), which were recognised in full in the income statement whereas, in the previous year, € 1,767 k
                        was recognised in the income statement and € 3,138 k in other comprehensive income.
                         we regard the counterparty risk as being very small because all derivative contracts were signed with na-
                        tional and international commercial banks that have first-class ratings. counterparty risk is subject to regular
                        monitoring.


                        interest rate sensitivity
                        consolidated earnings depend on the level of market interest rates. any change in this level would impact on
                        the group’s earnings and equity. the analysis we carry out covers all interest-bearing financial instruments
                        that are subject to the risk of changes in interest rates. at the end of the 2013 financial year, the interest rate

derivatives either no longer met the conditions for hedge accounting or the effects were recorded directly in
the income statement, meaning that the risk of changes in interest rates did not affect other comprehensive
income in equity.
  when calculating the sensitivity of the interest rates we assume a parallel shift in the yield curve. the up-
ward shift comes to 50 basis points; the downward shift comes to just 25 basis points because of the currently
low level of interest rates. a rate of zero interest is applied as the floor. with respect to the currencies that are
key to us in this respect, the impact of the shift is as follows:

as at 31 december 2013, there were no primary financial assets held in the category at fair value through
profit or loss that would have to be included in the presentation. the primary financial assets in the availa-
ble-for-sale category as at 31 december 2013 comprise exclusively non-interest-bearing equity instruments.
they are consequently not at risk of changes in interest rates are not included in the assessment. nor are
fixed-interest financial instruments at risk of changes in interest rates and are thus disregarded in our assess-
ment. neither in the current year nor in the past year were cash flow hedges entered into to hedge interest
rates. there was consequently no effect in other comprehensive income.


currency risks
although we conduct business mainly in euros or in the local currency of the respective country, we are
increasingly faced with currency risks due to the globalisation of the markets.
  in the group’s holding company, leoni ag, the corporate finance department deals with the resulting cur-
rency risks in collaboration with and based on the conditions set by the currency committee with respect to
limits and terms. hedging transactions are executed in line with the existing underlying transactions as well
as the planned transactions.
  selection of the hedging instrument to be used is based on regular, in-depth analysis of the underlying
transaction to be hedged. most of the hedging transactions are in pounds sterling, mexican pesos, polish
zloty, romanian lei, swiss francs and us dollars. the objective is to limit the impact of exchange rate variation
on net income. apart from the actual hedging transactions, we primarily take advantage of the option of
netting foreign currency items within the group to hedge our operating business activity. as a further curren-
cy-hedging measure, as a matter of principle we finance our foreign subsidiaries in their respective functional
currencies by way of refinancing in the corresponding currency.
  on the balance sheet date, there were currency-hedging transactions amounting to € 462,404 k (previ-
ous year: € 484,353 k), maturing within 14 months. the total market value of foreign exchange transactions
existing as of the balance sheet date was € 3,030 k (previous year: € 105 k). foreign exchange transactions
amounting to € 179,123 k (previous year: € 188,108 k) met the conditions for hedge accounting (cash flow
hedge). the ones that met the conditions for hedge accounting were all completed in the 2013 financial year.
their total fair value of € 503 k (previous year: € 105 k) was recognised in other comprehensive income. the
cash flow from the underlying transactions is expected in the 2014 and 2015 financial years. the changes in
fair value recognised in other comprehensive income are derecognised via the income statement at the time
the underlying transaction takes effect.

                        the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income in the context of hedge accounting came to
                        € 2,970 k in the financial year (previous year: € 4,734 k). an amount of € 2,677 k (previous year:
                        € 687 k) was derecognised via the income statement as shown in the table below.

                        the currency hedging transactions, as well as our interest-rate-hedging transactions, were signed with first
                        rate commercial banks, meaning that there was no significant counterparty risk either. this area is also subject
                        to regular monitoring.
                          there were no risks related to financial instruments on the balance sheet date that resulted in any notewor-
                        thy risk concentration.


                        exchange rate sensitivity
                        changes in exchange rates that are by prudent judgement essentially possible would affect consolidated
                        earnings due to the fair values of the monetary assets and liabilities. additional factors would arise that would
                        affect equity due to change in fair value in the context of cash flow hedge accounting. we consider the risk of
                        changes in interest rates arising from the currency derivatives to be immaterial, which is why it is not included
                        in the assessment.
                          the table below is based on the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. it illustrates the impact arising,
                        from the perspective of the group companies concerned, from appreciation or devaluation of the foreign
                        currencies to be taken into account by 10 percent either way versus the respective functional currency. com-

risks related to raw material prices
business within the wire & cable solutions division is sensitive to changes in raw materials prices, especially
of copper, but also gold and silver. for this reason, purchase prices for gold, silver and especially copper are
hedged by way of future transactions to cover the usual future procurement volume. such commodity future
transactions are signed within ordinary business activity and as part of purchasing activity for required raw
materials and therefore need not, in line with ias 39, be accounted for as financial derivatives. commodity
future transactions that are settled in cash are recognised as derivatives, changes in the fair value of which are
recognised in the cost of sales. the risks arising from these derivatives are of minor significance to the group.


capital management
the primary objective of leoni’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating, a
good equity ratio and appropriate gearing to support its business and increase shareholder value.
  the group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments based on the change in underlying eco-
nomic conditions. to maintain and adjust its capital structure, the group can make adjustments to dividend
payouts to shareholders, repay capital to shareholders or issue new shares. in order to have as broad a range
of funding options as possible, leoni aims to seek approval during its annual general meeting for all anticipa-
tory resolutions. no changes to the fundamental guidelines or processes were made in either the 2013 or 2012
financial years. leoni controls its capital with gearing. gearing is defined as the ratio of net financial debts to
equity.
  leoni expects a sustained equity ratio of at least 35 percent. due to fluctuation in elements of other com-
prehensive income that cannot be influenced, and which is even stronger because of the changed require-
ments under ias 19 to retirement benefit obligations (cf. note 3), the equity ratio could temporarily also drop
below this figure. with respect to gearing, a figure below 50 percent is the target to be met on a lasting basis.
during periods of acquisition this ratio may be temporarily exceeded. in principle, the aim is that capital
spending on organic growth that exceeds the market average can be generated from operating cash flow and
that reducing financial liabilities is possible.

at the end of fiscal 2013, gearing stood at 31 percent (previous year: 32 percent), which is attributable
primarily to the increase in equity due to the 5.6 percent earnings growth accompanied by an increase of just
3.1 percent in net financial liabilities.

due to the short terms of the cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other current receivables, the
fair values largely correspond to the carrying amounts.
  the fair values of other non-current receivables maturing after more than one year correspond to the pres-
ent values of payments relating to the assets, in each case taking into account the current interest parameters
that reflect market and partner-related changes in terms.
  trade liabilities and other liabilities usually mature in the short term; the amounts on the balance sheet
represent approximations of the fair value.

                        the fair values of liabilities to banks, the borrower’s note loans and the other non-current financial liabilities
                        are determined as the present values of the payments relating to the liabilities based on the respectively
                        applicable yield curves and taking into account the group-specific margins. for this reason the fair values are
                        to be allocated to hierarchy level 3.

offsetting of financial instruments
leoni had derivative assets and derivative liabilities vis-à-vis various financial institutions that do not fulfil the
offsetting criteria under ias 32.42. accordingly, these derivative financial instruments were presented sepa-
rately in the statement of financial position. however, the concluded master contracts do contain offsetting
agreements in the case of insolvency. the overview below presents the corresponding figures:

29 | segment reporting

the group is organised into business units by products and services for the purpose of corporate governance.
the segment reporting follows the internal organisational and reporting structure of the group. the group
has two segments subject to reporting:


wire & cable solutions
the wire & cable solutions division covers development, manufacture and sale of wires, strands, tapes
and optical fibers for cable production and electrical as well as electromechanical components, of lyonese
wares for textiles as well as cables, conductors and cable systems for the automotive and electrical appliance
industries, data and communications technology, the professional multimedia segment, the healthcare sector,
automation and process technology, machinery and plant engineering, major industrial plants, the solar
industry, infrastructure projects as well as services in the field of irradiation crosslinking. the products meet
both german and international standards as well as customer specifications. the conductive material most
commonly used is copper, but the division also produces fiber optic cables based on both glass and polymer
fiber.


wiring systems
the activity of the wiring systems division is focused on the development, production and sale of complete
wiring systems and ready-to-install cable harnesses for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. in addition
to conventional cable harnesses, the division also manufactures pre-formed cable harnesses, plastic moulded
components, electronic wiring system components as well as ready-to-connect single cables with matching
connectors and fixings.


management monitors the earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) to take decisions on allocation of re-
sources and to determine the profitability of the units. the ebit is ascertained in line with the accounting and
valuation principles of the consolidated financial statements. it also contains the earnings from measurement
under the equity method of joint ventures and associates.
 the roce (return on capital employed) is a key return figure on the basis of which management monitors
the profitability of the segments. it is derived from the ratio of ebit to average capital employed (ce), which
comprises the non-interest-bearing assets less non-interest-bearing liabilities. the calculation uses the
amount of capital employed at its average quarterly levels. the quarterly returns add up to the roce on an
annual basis.
 intersegment sales and revenues are generally recorded at values that approximate sales to third parties.

                        independent auditor’s report


                        translation of the german language audit opinion concerning the audit of the financial statements prepared
                        in german:


                        we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of leoni ag, nuremberg, and its sub-
                        sidiaries, which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive
                        income, the consolidated statement of cash flows, the consolidated statement of financial position, and the
                        consolidated statement of changes in equity, notes to the consolidated financial statements for the business
                        year from january 1 to december 31, 2013.


                        management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
                        the management of leoni ag is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
                        this responsibility includes preparing these consolidated financial statements in accordance with interna-
                        tional financial reporting standards as adopted by the eu, and the supplementary requirements of german
                        law pursuant to art. 315a (1) hgb [“handelsgesetzbuch“: german commercial code], to give a true and fair
                        view of the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the group in accordance with these
                        requirements. the company’s management is also responsible for the internal controls that management
                        determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from
                        material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.


                        auditor’s responsibility
                        our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
                        we conducted our audit in accordance with art. 317 hgb and german generally accepted standards for the
                        audit of financial statements promulgated by the institut der wirtschaftsprüfer [institute of public auditors
                        in germany] (idw) as well as in supplementary compliance with international standards on auditing (isa).
                        accordingly, we are required to comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain
                        reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstate-
                        ment.
                         an audit involves performing audit procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclo-
                        sures in the consolidated financial statements. the selection of audit procedures depends on the auditor’s
                        professional judgment. this includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
                        financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in assessing those risks, the auditor considers the internal
                        control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true
                        and fair view. the aim of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the given circum-
                        stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control
                        system. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasona-
                        bleness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
                        consolidated financial statements.
                         we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
                        audit opinion.

                                                                                         consolidated financial statements   | independent auditor’s report   |   209




audit opinion
pursuant to art. 322 (3) sentence 1 hgb, we state that our audit of the consolidated financial statements has
not led to any reservations.
 in our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the consolidated financial statements comply in all mate-
rial respects with ifrss as adopted by the eu and the supplementary requirements of german commercial law
pursuant to art. 315a (1) hgb and give a true and fair view of the net assets and financial position of the group
as at december 31, 2013 as well as the results of operations for the business year then ended, in accordance
with these requirements.
