statement by the ceo
the real estate industry is making excellent progress and the profit from property management is at the
same high level as before. klövern has succeeded in raising rental levels, reducing costs and retaining
its customers at the same time as there is considerable turbulence in the business environment. at the
beginning of march, we announced that klövern is going to complete the offer for the listed property com-
pany dagon, which prepares the way for a big step forward towards the stock exchange’s “large cap” list.

                                                      after two cold winters with heavy snow, it has been
                                                      gratifying, as klövern’s newly appointed ceo, to see that
                                                      this year won’t be the third time running. sweden didn’t
                                                      have any snow before the year-end nor did it come until
                                                      late january 2012. this naturally contributed to a sharp
                                                      reduction in property costs, for a comparable portfolio,
                                                      during 2011. however, we also saw the impact of the
                                                      efforts we’ve made with energy saving, direct charging of
                                                      tenant costs and more efficient property caretaking.


                                                      it is even more satisfying to note that we have not only
                                                      succeeded in retaining customers in these turbulent
                                                      times but can moreover report a positive net moving-in.
                                                      not quite at the level that we’d hoped for but none the
                                                      less a number of millions on the plus side measured
                                                      in terms of annual rent. over and above this, our
                                                      rental levels are higher, regardless of whether we look
                                                      at renegotiated lease contracts, the whole lease stock
                                                      or newly-signed lease contracts in comparison with
                                                      existing leases. the improvement of both rental income
                                                      and property costs led to a positive development of the
                                                      operating margin, which was 63 per cent at year-end
                                                      (60), very close to our target of 64 per cent. much of
                                                      this result is due to committed and well-focused work by
                                                      klövern’s staff.


                                                      2011 started on an optimistic note. the economy still
                                                      looked good even if some slackening off was anticipated

                                                      rates, the figures appeared as if they were simply moving
                                                      back towards more normal levels. however, in the
                                                      early summer and, in particular, after the holidays, the
                                                      problems accelerated and the effects were increasingly
                                                      visible, in the financial market as well. the situation

personnel
klövern shall be an attractive employer with competent
and committed staff. the key words availability and com-
mitment permeate the flat organization with short deci-
sion-making paths. a large measure of independent work
and decision-making in all positions leads to commit-
ment and is a driving force. personnel are always close to
the customer, both at the business unit where the tenant is
the customer and at the service unit where the business
unit, investors and media, among others, are customers.

organization
klövern’s local ties are of crucial importance for the rela-
tionship with the customer. a decentralized organization
and committed staff who take good care of their custom-

klövern’s factors for success.

rent is due to higher rental levels for newly signed lease
contracts, renegotiations and the positive development of
cpi during 2010. the average rent varies between differ-
ent market areas depending on the type of property, the
location of the properties and the local rental market.
    the development of cpi up till the end of october
2011 will affect the contract value by sek 25 million (14)
from 2012. this increase is not included in the rental
value as at 31 december 2011.

property costs
property costs increased marginally, to sek 507 million
(498) at year-end 2011, despite a considerably larger port-
folio for the full year 2011. property costs decreased by
5 per cent (6) for a comparable portfolio. the mild winter
during november and december had a positive effect on
costs. for a comparable portfolio, costs amounted to sek
337 per sq.m. (356). heat consumption amounted to 94
per cent (114) of consumption adjusted for a normal year
resulting from a higher average temperature and energy
saving measures.
    rent losses continue to be very low, totalling sek 3.2
million on 31 december (3.1), or 0.2 per cent (0.2) of the
total income.

large industrial testing and demonstration environments.

although other industries have developed positively, for
example, industrial information technology.
    mälardalen university, with 7,000 students, has also
meant a lot for västerås’s development. with the expan-
sion of the out-of-town retail area, erikslund and
improvements to city shopping, the city has become one
of the most important places in mälardalen for shopping.
    västerås is now a city which has adapted to the gen-
eral development of society. the prospects are therefore
good for an active and positive property market. an indi-
cation of this is that investors have shown an increased
interest in the city for a number of years now.               västerås verkstaden 11.

uppsala




uppsala boländerna 33:2 – in september, klövern acquired the 18,500 sq.m. property, consisting of six buildings.



uppsala is one of the most rapidly growing municipalities
in sweden with a population of 200,000.
     work is primarily available in the public sector, in
particular in education and health care. the labour market
is thus less sensitive to cyclical fluctuations than in many
other places. uppsala’s labour market can be said to be part
of greater stockholm’s labour market. unemployment is
therefore relatively low.
     the market for rented offices is characterized by
stability. during almost the whole of the 2000s, rental
changes have been relatively moderate regardless of the
state of the economy. however, a gradual increase can be
noted, in particular for centrally located and modern
flexible offices.
     in central locations, rental levels for new lease
contracts are around sek 1,900–2,300 per sq.m.
     the level is slightly higher for newly produced offices.
the vacancy rate for the whole of uppsala’s office market
is estimated at eight per cent.                                                uppsala fyrislund 6:6.

“kista is a city of science – a creative melting pot where thousands of businesses, researchers and students work together to develop and grow.
in fact, few places in the world can show such a high concentration of competence, innovation and business potential in ict (information and
communications technology). there are now over 1,000 businesses, 6,800 university students and 1,100 phds in ict in kista science city. 90 per
cent of ict companies are export companies, a figure which is very high compared with other industries. this clearly demonstrates the great impor-
tance of kista science city and the ict industry for growth in the stockholm region”, says åke lindström, market director at kista science city.

rental income has been positively affected by a larger property portfolio but also by rising rental levels and positive net moving-in. the
increase in other income refers mainly to rental guarantees included in the acquisition in linköping among other cities at the end of
2010.
property costs only increased to sek –507 million (–498) during the year, despite a considerably larger property portfolio.
central administration costs amounted to sek –71 million (64), the increase being largely attributable to higher consultancy costs for
tax lawyers and acquisition costs in connection with the offer for dagon. the increase in financial expenses is attributable to higher inter-
est-bearing liabilities and higher average interest rates.
profit from property management decreased as a result of higher financial expenses.
the value of the properties increased as a result of rising rental levels, positive net moving-in, lower property costs and falling required
returns. decreasing long market rates have led to a reduction in value of derivatives.
net profit for the year decreased to sek 465 million (605) as a result of a deterioration in net financial income and negative changes in
derivatives. deferred tax refers to the change in the difference between fair value and residual value for tax purposes for properties and
derivatives.

note 15 shareholders’ equity
klövern manages capital consisting of the group’s shareholders’ equity with the aim of providing klövern’s shareholders with a return of at least
the risk-free rate plus nine percentage points, which is the goal set in klövern’s business plan. return on equity amounted to 10.1 per cent (14.0)
in 2011. during the past five years, the average return on equity has been 9.5 per cent (11.6), which is less than the long-term goal of 10.4 per cent.
   klövern’s aim is to maintain a well-balanced asset and capital structure adapted to the company’s real estate operations. the goal is for the
equity ratio to be in the interval 25–35 per cent. the equity ratio at year-end 2011 was 30.8 per cent (32.1). the goal for the equity ratio is a
simplified consequence of a more in-depth analysis where equity has been apportioned in relation to the different risk profiles that investment
properties have in the balance sheet.

cated through the company’s intranet. the main purpose
of the intranet is to provide staff with a structured holistic
picture of the activity and serve as an easily available plat-
form from which to obtain current information and docu-
mentation.

follow-up
financial follow-up shall take place quarterly by all busi-
ness units and companies and at group level. the follow-
up takes place in relation to the budget and forecast
according to a tried and tested model. the result is ana-
lysed by the business unit, the real estate and finance
departments and the market area manager responsible for
performance. reporting is made to the executive manage-
ment and auditors.

internal audit
klövern has a decentralized and transparent organization
where, among other things, financial activities, economic
and rental administration are taken care of by head office.
follow-up of the result and balance is made quarterly by
both the individual functions and by the business units,
the executive management and the board. clear docu-
mentation through policies and instructions accompanied
by recurrent follow-ups and regular discussions with audi-
tors ensure the correctness of the processes. management
and reporting are examined formally by the company’s
auditors twice a year and the outcome is reported to the
board. based on the above, it is not considered that there
is any need for internal audit.
    additional information on klövern’s risk assessment,
exposure and management is contained in the section
risk and sensitivity on pages 62–65 of the 2011 annual
report.
