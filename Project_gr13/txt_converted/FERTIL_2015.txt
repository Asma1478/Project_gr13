ceo statement
we at fertil are proud to present you with the executive summary of fertil’s 2014 sustainability performance.

for more than 30 years, fertil has been committed to producing sustainable products and contributing to the
global challenges of sustainable agriculture and availability of food security for fast growing populations with
limited land and resources. fertil has established a solid presence in more than 32 countries on five continents
to strengthen and expand the company’s position as a major player in the growing global industrial fertilizer
sector. we are in the process of developing a corporate sustainability strategy and roadmap that will align fertil’s
commitment with the united arab emirates’ 2021 vision and the abu dhabi 2030 vision, which will enhance
fertil’s contribution to the fertilizer industry and to society for many years to come.

addressing global and local fertilizer industry challenges, we at fertil believe that sustainability will enhance and
support our leadership commitment, business growth, marketing strategies, and operations & hse excellence,
and aid as a step forward in building long term partnerships with our stakeholders and society.

this report highlights the main performances, initiatives and achievements that fulfill fertil’s sustainability policy
and framework and also covers the three pillars of sustainability; social (people), environment (planet) and
economic (profit).

fertil continued to maximize its production volume in 2014, which was tripled through the combined capacity
of fertil-1 (f-1) and fertil-2 (f-2), along with increased reliability, operability, quality and efficiency to meet the
demands of our shareholders and customers.

with more focus on integration of f-1 and f-2, in terms of operational practices and maintenance strategy,
incorporating f-2’s new operation and maintenance specifications, asset integrity and process safety, will further
enhance performance. f-2 has been designed and built as a “zero effluents” plant with stringent environment and
safety rules, such as no emission of free ammonia by using flare systems for urea and ammonia plants. the non
process building has been designed and built according to estidama pearl rating requirements, with the aim to
promote the development of sustainable buildings and improve quality of life.

in addition, more emphasis and continued focus will be made on occupational health, safety, environment, energy
efficiency and reducing the operational footprint. it is worth mentioning that in 2014, we achieved 0 lost time
injury and 0.33 total recordable injuries. also, our specific energy consumption per metric ton of urea improved
by 35% after the f-2 plant expansion project.

consistent improvements in staff and customer satisfaction, as well as compliance with legal regulations and
standard requirements, including those of associates and certification partners, have been achieved.

fertil prides itself on being a company of social responsibility and has contributed to the community in several
ways. one of its main objectives is developing and integrating uae nationals into the workforce, with equal
opportunities for females. fertil has achieved 55% in its emiratization drive and is aiming this to achieve 75% by
2017.

this report demonstrates our commitment to transparent communication and maintaining open dialogues and
we would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders and stakeholders for their continued
trust, contribution and support of our endeavors to create a more sustainable society. we welcome your
feedback on this report in order for us to continually improve our sustainability performance and reporting.
