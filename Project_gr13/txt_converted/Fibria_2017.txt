the benefits of proper forest management

we have 633,000 hectares of eucalyptus
(in the states of bahia, espírito santo, mato
grosso do sul, minas gerais, rio de janeiro,
rio grande do sul, and são paulo), whose
productivity stands out in the brazilian and
global forestry industry.

the high yield of our forests results from
trees with high productive capacity and the
ability to withstand the climatic variations,
in addition to the correct fertilization of the
soil, prevention of diseases, and, of course,
constant monitoring of the water.

of water withdrawal and use in their lands;
tips for reducing consumption; simple and

the objective is to strengthen the dialogue

use by eucalyptus forests in the watersheds,
fibria intends to mitigate possible conflicts
related to overlapping of water use, in addi-

our value proposition includes developing
suppliers in the municipalities where we
operate, generating a virtuous cycle for the
local economy, , partners, society, and our
company. in 2016, fibria reached a volume
of 51% of local purchases in the regions
where it operates.

tangible and intangible aspects are among
the criteria for choosing a supplier. in
addition to cost and quality, we analyze its
human and social and environmental devel-
opment practices.

we share knowledge, our challenges, and
dilemmas, and we evolve together. our most
