annual
on the year 2015 and prospects
for deutsche börse group

our clear vision is to turn
deutsche börse into the
­global market infrastructure
 provider of choice, being
 ­top-ranked in all its activities.

this annual is the “accelerated” version of our corporate
report. key information, and to the point: the annual com-
prises an overview of deutsche börse group, and of our
“accelerate” growth strategy. we are looking at the present
state of the group – but of course we will also take a look
ahead to what we have planned for the near future, as well
as potential innovations over a longer period. we have thus
structured the report into three sections: status, ambition,
and innovation.

we accept responsibility in all of these areas. not only are
we determined to be the number one for our customers and
investors – we also take the needs and interests of all rel-
evant stakeholders into account. dialogue and transparency
are key aspects in this context. this is why we not only
expanded our stakeholder survey in 2015, but also further
developed our reporting, bringing it in line with the stan-
dards set by the global reporting initiative (gri): our annual
and our financial report 2015 have both been prepared in
accordance with the gri g4 framework for the first time.

we are looking back at a successful year. yet we have no
intention of resting on our laurels. we must grow much
faster in the future. we have called our strategy – designed
to achieve faster growth – “accelerate”. the purpose of
this strategy is to propel deutsche börse group into the
global number one or number two position – in all of its
business areas.

and we are making good progress. last year, we acquired
the remaining stake in index provider stoxx, and also took
over the foreign-exchange trading platform 360t, an enter-
prise that is a blueprint for entrepreneurial courage, client
proximity and innovation. you can read more about 360t
and its founder carlo kölzer on page 22.

talking about client proximity: we want our clients to be
our focus, throughout the group and for the long term.
under the leadership of our new global head of sales,
robert jolliffe, we have established a team of group
­relationship managers. you will find an interview with
 robert on page 32.

client relationships are one part of the equation – client-­
focused solutions are the other: they must go hand in hand.
this is why we have centralised our product development,
coordinated by ashwin kumar, our new global head of prod­
uct development. he talks about his plans on page 18.

we continue to focus on asia, and especially china – one
of the world’s most important growth regions. we founded
the china europe international exchange (ceinex) at the
end of october 2015, a european-­chinese cooperation that
is truly unique worldwide, with which we are preparing for
the future.

to ensure that “accelerate” is a success, we realigned exec-
utive board portfolios at the beginning of 2016. the goal
of all these steps is to act faster, and in a more focused and
client-oriented manner.

i hope you will enjoy reading our annual.
yours sincerely,
