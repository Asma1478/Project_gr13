east beginning with the nissho maru incident, wherein we challenged the seven sisters (the nickname given to the group
of western oil companies that dominated the market at the time) and imported petroleum products directly from financially
strapped iran. after the chiba refinery came on line in 1963, procuring crude oil for local refinement became our primary
focus. in 1973, with control over middle eastern crude oil shifting from the seven sisters to the oil-producing countries
themselves, we established offices in beirut, tehran and other locations in the middle east to strengthen our direct ties
with those countries and secure crude oil and petroleum products. even now, our network of offices in the middle east
functions as our principal point of contact with oil-producing countries. in fiscal 2014, we held ceremonies to celebrate the
35th year of trade with qatar and the 30th year of direct crude oil trade with oman.

seeking to form strategic partnerships with middle eastern oil-producing countries, with efforts oriented toward supporting
human resources through business investments, technical cooperation and personnel exchanges.

retail network. it was finally made possible thanks to the presence of retail outlets that shared our belief in respect for

wind power is limited by wind conditions, its esthetic impact on the
surrounding scenery, the noise it generates and other such factors.
however, it is relatively inexpensive compared with other forms
of renewable energy and is highly efficient–a single wind turbine
can operate for 20 to 30 years. in collaboration with japan wind

● coal mines
demand for coal, relatively inexpensive and found in regions with low geopolitical risk, is expected to continue to grow,
especially in asia.
   idemitsu currently owns interests in four australian coal mines: boggabri, ensham, muswellbrook and tarrawonga.
we expect production from the four mines to amount to 11 million tons in 2015. although the coal we produce is sold
mainly in japan, taiwan, korea and other parts of east asia, we also supply customers in india and southeast asian
countries. we market the coal produced at these mines mainly in such east asian countries as japan, taiwan and korea
in addition to promoting sales in india and southeast asia.
   to meet growing demand for inexpensive low-ash, low-sulfur coal for use in coal fired power stations, we have
acquired a 30% share of a coal company holding interest in the malinau mines in indonesia. we are also strengthening
relations with customers and reshuffling our coal asset portfolio by transferring part of our interest in the boggabri mine to
japanese electric power and steel companies—our principal trading partners.

     acquisition of iso 9001*1 certification


in fiscal 2007, our main domestic and overseas business departments completed the acquisition of                                      iso 9001
certification. when new business sites are opened we consider the need for certification and immediately acquire such
accreditation if necessary. in fiscal 2014, it was determined that a non-consolidated lubricant affiliate company in vietnam
needed such certification, which it was able to acquire in april 2015.


     initiatives to ensure product safety


based on the product safety action guidelines formulated in fiscal 2007, we conduct checks of product safety at each
product life stage from research and development through sales. the regulations of various countries concerning chemical
substances change significantly over time, and we are promoting management that can respond swiftly to these changes.
in fiscal 2014, in order to improve our safety check systems, we thoroughly examined the systems in place for managing
change.

     educational support for local staff (the idemitsu group)


since fiscal 2013, the idemitsu group implemented workshop-style training programs at seven companies to help local
staff fully understand its management philosophy, with the aim of enabling them to apply this philosophy as a yardstick
for their day-to-day operations. many local staff members remarked that by learning about the history and management
philosophy of idemitsu, they were able to firmly grasp the idemitsu identity they naturally assumed through the course of
their work. this led to a greater sense of belonging within the company and improved motivation.

                                              understanding of the idemitsu philosophy




in addition, with the august 2015 launch of the idemitsu global portal in
conjunction with the public relations & csr affairs office, we created
a system enabling local staff to easily access a wealth of information,
including the company’s history and management philosophy, stories and
best practices from employees around the world, and information regarding
personnel systems. we expect this global sharing of information to help
support the global business expansion of the idemitsu group as well as
foster understanding of the management philosophy.
    going forward, as we strive to enrich programs for local staff training,
we are also inviting executive candidates from overseas group companies
to join training in japan and helping establish training systems tailored to the
global grades of personnel at overseas group companies.

driving manners of tanker truck drivers and other matters that require verification, the center works in cooperation with
responsible departments, and, depending on the circumstances, the persons in charge may directly answer customers'
inquiries.
    with the aim of sharing the center's accumulated know-how across the entire group, we launched a skills training
program for departments and business sites in fiscal 2010 that focuses on handling calls. with the operators of the center
serving as lecturers, the training program was conducted at five business sites, including those of two affiliates, with 117
participants in fiscal 2014.

     initiatives undertaken by our refineries, petrochemical plant and tokuyama complex


     actively promoting the greening of factories since the construction of our first refinery

idemitsu's initiatives to promote the greening of factories can be traced back to the construction of its first refinery, the
tokuyama refinery in shunan city, yamaguchi prefecture, completed in 1957. these earliest efforts predated the factory
construction law by 17 years; it was not until 1973 that, faced with significant environmental pollution generated during
the country’s post-war period of accelerated industrial growth, japan passed a law requiring the creation of green spaces.        the importance of factory green spaces in terms of biodiversity

     recycling of catalysts*2

our refineries use approximately 2,000 tons of catalysts annually in the process that removes sulfur from heavy oil. used
catalysts with reduced desulfurization activity are regenerated by an outside contractor and used again at our refineries.
utilizing regenerated catalysts allows us to reduce the use of new catalysts by about 20%. moreover, these used catalysts
contain rare metals like molybdenum and vanadium. when used catalysts cannot be regenerated, we sell these as
valuable resources.

*2 catalyst: a substance that accelerates a specific chemical reaction without being modified (consumed) in the process. catalysts play an
     important role in the production process of petroleum products and petrochemical products.




     recycling of petrochemical products

departments handling plastic processed products are promoting the development of easily recycled products made from
single-plastic resins and from recycled materials. we have also established a recycling system for used plastic containers.
these containers are used as ink containers and for other purposes

                                                                                                     idemitsu unitech recycle products


     reducing waste at service stations

we distribute our service station industrial waste management manual to idemitsu service stations to ensure compliance
with relevant laws and regulations. among the waste generated at service stations, empty plastic lubricant pails are
collected by an outside specialist company for partial recycling into resources. used tires are collected for recycling by tire
sales companies and industrial waste hauling companies, while used batteries are collected for recycling by the lead acid
storage battery recycle association.

     managing cfcs

in accordance with the act for rationalized use and proper management of fluorocarbons, which came into effect on
april 1, 2015, the idemitsu group has been implementing steps to prevent the leakage of fluorocarbons. the safety,
environment & quality assurance department undertakes annual inspections on the progress of changeover to non-
fluorocarbon coolants throughout group facilities. although oil refineries, the petrochemical plant and the tokuyama
complex house a significant portion of the group’s large-scale processing equipment containing cfcs and hcfcs, which

damage the ozone layer, this equipment can be upgraded only during the performance of major shutdown maintenance
(sdm). with this in mind, we put priority on replacing all the more harmful ozone-damaging cfcs with alternative coolants,
setting the deadline for this task at the end of fiscal 2016.

     ground and groundwater pollution prevention

since fiscal 2002, the idemitsu group has been implementing autonomous surveys of ground and groundwater pollution
and undertaking purification measures. by fiscal 2009, the group completed on-schedule surveys at about 1,300 sites,
including refineries, petrochemical plants, oil depots, idemitsu-owned service stations and idle land. at those locations
where we discover any contamination, we place priority on preventing the impact of this contamination from spreading
beyond the business site and make ongoing efforts for the remediation of contaminated soil or groundwater.
