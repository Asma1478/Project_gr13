     first phase of transition                second phase of transition

            to achieve true globalization

            akebono brake industry co., ltd. was founded as japan’s first brake
            lining (friction material) manufacturer in january 1929, just at the
            dawning of the country’s motorization. since then, we have striven to
            best serve society by doing our utmost to ensure “absolute safety.”
            a look back at our more than 85 years of history shows that three major
            phases of transition have marked our transformation from automotive
            brake lining producer to comprehensive brake manufacturer providing
            brakes for motorcycles, rolling stock and industrial machinery.
                                                                                                                                (billions of yen)
                the first phase was marked by a technological alliance with bendix                                                        250
            corporation, then a world-leading brake manufacturer based in the
            united states. in 1960, when japan was on the brink of full-scale
            motorization, this alliance enabled us take that significant first step
            toward becoming a comprehensive brake manufacturer. the second
            phase came in 1986 when we established a joint venture in kentucky
            with general motors company, the world’s leading automaker. this                                                              200
            move secured our first overseas stronghold and marked the beginning
            of our global investments. in 2010 we entered the third phase of
            transition as, in a follow up to the acquisition of the north american
            brake business of robert bosch llc in 2009, we began tackling
            challenge of becoming a company capable of succeeding in the face of
            rapid globalization.                                                                                                          150
                while seeking out growth opportunities in markets overseas,
            akebono has solidified its domestic business foundation in a manner in
            keeping with its commitment to delivering “absolute safety.” today, the
            automotive industry is undergoing drastic changes. as a small-sized,
            specialized, independent manufacturer, akebono is poised to make
            further advances toward becoming a successful truly global player.                                                            100

   to summarize, akebono’s strengths as a manufacturer lie in its
specialization, and this allows it develop the knowhow and expertise
throughout the company. everyone, including our associates can
concentrate on improving their skills, knowing that their contributions
will enable akebono to win against larger competitors.
   so, i would like to encourage associates to embrace two mottoes
that will enhance akebono’s strengths. first, prioritize perfecting
human skills. second, work as a team to achieve objectives that might
be impossible if tackled alone. in line with these mottoes, we must
continue to build on our reputation as a reliable manufacturer capable
of doing things that no other companies can accomplish. that’s my
vision of akebono’s future.

bond yields set for each expected retirement benefit period. regarding the application of the accounting standard for retirement benefits, in accordance with the transitional treat-
ment stipulated in paragraph 37, the effect of the change in calculation methods for retirement benefit obligations and service costs arising from initial application has been recog-
nized in retained earnings at the beginning balance of the fiscal year ended march 2015.
                                                                                                                                                                                                      corporate information




    as a result, net defined benefit decreased by jpy526 million and retained earnings decreased by jpy343 million in the beginning balance of fiscal year ended march 31, 2015. the impact of
this implementation was to raise operating income, ordinary income and income before taxes and minority interests in the current fiscal year increased by jpy94 million respectively.
(adoption of accounting standard for business combinations)
the “accounting standard for business combinations” (asbj statement no. 21, revised on september 13, 2013), “accounting standard for consolidated financial statements”
(asbj statement no. 22, revised on september 13, 2013), and “accounting standard for business divestitures” (asbj statement no. 7, revised on september 13, 2013) could be
applied from the beginning of the consolidated fiscal 2014. accordingly, akebono has applied these accounting standards (excluding article 39 of asbj statement no. 22, revised on
september 13, 2013) from the current fiscal year. in accordance with these accounting standards, we recorded the differences caused by changes in the equity share of subsidiaries in
which we continue to control as capital surplus. in addition, acquisition-related costs as expenses in the fiscal periods in which the costs are incurred was also recorded. regarding
business combinations, from the beginning of the current fiscal year, we changed the method to reflect changes in the allocation of the acquisition costs arising from confirmation of
the provisional accounting treatment on the consolidated financial statements that includes the acquisition date. akebono has adopted these accounting standards from the begin-
ning of the current fiscal year, following transitional treatment based on article 58-2(4) of “accounting standard for business combinations,” article 44-5(4) of “accounting
standard for consolidated financial statements,” and article 57-4(4) of “accounting standard for business divestitures”.
    as a consequence, the impact on operating income, ordinary income and income before taxes and minority interests in the fiscal year ended march 31, 2015 increased by jpy49
million and capital surplus decreased by jpy1,210 million at the end of fiscal year ended march 31, 2015.

                                                     to understand the industry and the business well, and i draw on this knowledge to make serious suggestions
                                                     and ask difficult questions. in fact, in the past i have requested the reconsideration and resubmission of some
                                                     agenda items that had the potential to affect the future sustainability of akebono. i believe an outside direc-

                                             q3. as an outside director, do you have any suggestions for more effective governance?

                                                     ciple, the board of directors discusses predetermined agendas, but i would like meetings to be open to requests

                                             q1.	what is your evaluation on the governance function of akebono’s board of directors?
                                             a1.	in every board of directors meeting, discussions are very animated. although they aren’t fault-finders, outside
                                                     directors and outside audit & supervisory board members voice questions and make shrewd suggestions
                                                     whenever they have any doubt or problem regarding management proposals. given this, i believe that the
                                                     participation of such individuals facilitates cogent discussion, which is the cornerstone of corporate governance,
                                                     thereby ensuring that the board’s supervisory function remains very effective. i think “cozy” relationships
                                                     between outside members and internal directors and executive officers must be avoided. in this light, the
                                                     composition of the members of the two boards is appropriately maintained at a reasonable level of tension.

                                                     and investors. in particular, i would like to advise the company on how to proactively and appropriately disclose
                                                     corporate information and thereby better communicate the status of its current operations, future manage-
