polish-slovak interconnection is part of the north-south gas corridor. its implementation would help strengthen energy security and
competition in the gas market in central europe by increased capabilities to meet gas demand offered by the newly established
supply route and access to new sources of gas.

the project is now at the pre-investment stage. a business analysis of the investment was completed in october 2012, while a feasibility
study for the proposed investment is planned to be completed in 2013.

poland – czech republic interconnection

the company is also looking into the possibility of upgrading the poland – czech republic interconnection. in this regard,
gaz‑system s.a. is working with the czech operator – net4gas s.r.o. the connection between poland and the czech republic is
also a part of the north-south gas corridor. its development is of strategic importance as it will not only support further integration of
european gas markets, but also enable the diversification of import supply sources and routes.

the upgrade of the pipeline between poland and the czech republic will be of key importance for the development of a free and
competitive market for natural gas in the region. the project is at the pre-investment stage. a business analysis of the investment was         declaration of cooperation with plinacro d.o.o.

transmission tariff in 2012

efficient management and cost reduction coupled with well-structured financing of the company’s investment project largely
relying on non-returnable subsidies from the european union contributed to another reduction of the transmission tariffs applied by
gaz‑system s.a. in december 2012, the president of the energy regulatory office approved a new, reduced tariff for gas transmission
services.

under the new tariff of gaz‑system s.a., the cost of transporting 1,000 m3 (11 thousand kwh) of natural gas went down by 3.25% as
compared to the previously applicable tariff.

the design of the new tariff for gas transmission services is intended to support the process of energy market liberalisation and the
changes introduced in the new transmission network code (tnc).

similarly as in 2011, the tariff approved in 2012 is an entry-exit tariff, which means that the billing for gas transmission is aligned with eu
standards and based on charges applied at system entry and exit points. this tariff model results from the provisions of the third energy
package and regulation 715/2009 of the european parliament and the council.

the division into tariff groups no longer applies under the new tariff. the new regime also introduced a significant reduction of
adjustment coefficients applicable to fixed charge rate for short-term contracts (semi-annual, quarterly and monthly), which will
result in lower cost of such services for the transmission network user. furthermore, the charges for gas transportation to and from
underground gas storage facilities have been substantially decreased. the tariff no 6 for transmission services has been effective as
of 1 january 2013 and will remain in force until 30 september 2013.

  liquidity in the eu member states. the implementation of the project will also help minimise the risk of differences in capacity on
  both sides of the lasów interconnection point.
  did the project generate interest from the market?
  both operators were pleased to see considerable interest of market participants, both in the product itself and the consultation
  process. the feedback received from stakeholders during the consultation process has been taken into account when finalizing
  the work on the auction rules.

  i would like to emphasise that the cooperation between gaz‑system s.a. and ontras and the involvement of national
  regulatory authorities throughout the process of creating the concept of the pilot project adhered to the best practice standards.
  this, in turn, translates into the highest quality of services provided by operators to market participants.


new product at polish-czech interconnection in cieszyn

in early september 2012, gaz‑system s.a. in agreement with the czech transmission system operator – net4gas, started to offer
day-ahead capacity to market participants, in response to the expectations of the market and as a next step in the process of
adapting the services to the eu guidelines. the availability of this type of capacity will result in optimised utilisation of the technical
capabilities of this interconnection.

in order to make the investment decision concerning this project possible gaz‑system s.a. and the czech transmission system operator
net4gas carried out coordinated and non-discriminatory capacity allocation procedures at the turn of 2009/2010. the adopted
approach ensured compliance with the third party access (tpa) rules in accordance with the guidelines of ergeg (the european
regulators’ group for electricity and gas). following the procedures, transmission agreements were concluded for a term of 15 years.

          gas market liberalisation

implementation of eu regulations

the european union is pursuing the process of building a common energy market, which is expected to connect all the member
states. the implementation of subsequent elements of eu legislation affects the business and regulatory environment in which the
company operates.
                                                                                                                                                                           network code
the main task before european legislation is to liberalise the natural gas market. the measures aimed at this direction are set forth in
the legislative acts comprising the third energy package. they are implemented, inter alia, via network codes, common balancing                                            major changes to tnc
platforms and capacity allocation platforms, which will contribute to the harmonisation of practices and increase the liquidity and
integration of national markets.

it is expected that the next steps for the liberalisation of energy markets in europe will also result from the proposals made by the
european commission in its november 2012 communication on the internal energy market.

one of the conditions of a liberalised and well-functioning gas market in the eu is a well-developed infrastructure enabling gas
transmission between the national and regional markets, according to the demand of the participants.                                       contract execution process and contracting of the services provided by gaz‑system s.a.

moreover, gaz‑system s.a. representatives are continuously involved in the development of european network codes which address
such areas as capacity allocation, system balancing, interoperability and tariffs.                                                            the network code has introduced a virtual point in the high-methane gas system, i.e. a point without a physical location in the

the year 2012 was a crucial period for creating the conditions for a liberalised gas market in poland. the new transmission network           enable otc trading and transactions with gaz‑system s.a. on the balancing services market.
code (tnc) developed by gaz‑system s.a. has introduced significant changes that will enable the liberalisation and development
of the polish gas market and the harmonisation with the standards applied among european transmission system operators. the
network code implements operational instruments for the development of an exchange-based gas market in poland and transposes               auction-based capacity allocation

the new version of the tnc has introduced a considerable number of new systemic solutions which were extensively consulted
upon with the market. following a decision of the president of the energy regulatory office, the tnc was approved in july 2012 and            they are based on the solutions developed by the european network of transmission system operators for gas (entsog) and
entered into force on 1 january 2013.                                                                                                         meet european standards and the guidelines of the european commission.

        gas market liberalisation

                     president of the energy regulatory office




last year was a time of intense and fruitful cooperation between the transmission system operator and the market regulator.
our work in 2012 focused on the harmonisation and refinement of the rules for a new model of the gas market, and on the
implementation of provisions of the transmission network code. the conceptual and analytical work done by gaz‑system s.a.
was of fundamental importance.

as a result of this work, gaz‑system s.a. submitted the new transmission network code to the regulator for approval. the
code introduced a number of improvements for market participants, while creating the conditions for the development of
competition and liquidity in the domestic gas market. with the introduction of the so-called virtual point, which creates the
conditions for the purchase and sale of gas in isolation from its physical location, the rules on the use of the transmission system
were simplified and access was facilitated for new market entrants. these changes enabled the launch of gas trading on the
polish power exchange and exemption from the obligation to submit wholesale tariffs for gas for approval by the president of
ero, as of the beginning of 2013. new solutions introduced under the tnc contribute to the harmonisation of rules on the polish
gas market and enhance the cooperation between the transmission system operator and other operators at both national and
european levels.

  what changes to the network code are most significant from the customer perspective?
  the network code has introduced a new model for contracting services with gaz‑system s.a. the execution of a new framework
  transmission contract has been limited to a formal registration of the customer, and specific entry and exit points may be added
  to the contract at any time and according to customer’s needs by the means of capacity and transmission ability allocation.
  for each customer, we have consolidated all their previous contracts into one so as to ensure consistent and uniform principles
  and portfolio balancing.
                                                                                                                                                                  joanna kijas
  the new tnc creates the possibility of transporting gas from physical entry points to a virtual point and from a virtual point to                               president of the management board of the storage system operator in 2012
  physical exit points by two separate entities. owing to this arrangement, the customer of gaz‑system s.a. may purchase gas at
  an otc virtual point or at a dedicated point for the gas exchange.

  in order to enhance the flexibility of the balancing system we have provided for a balancing services market in the network                   the signing of the agreement is an important step towards the liberalisation of the gas market in poland. the sso is one of the
  code, which enables physical balancing of the system by gaz‑system s.a. the users have been afforded the possibility of                       few operators in europe offering combined storage and transmission services. the terms of cooperation agreed between the
  offering system services to gaz‑system s.a. (in particular, by declaring the delivery or reduced off-take of gas at a specific                operators will allow the implementation of integrated services in accordance with the customers’ requirements and ensure safe
  physical location), which will help them balance their portfolios while allowing us to balance the gas demand and ensure stable               operation of the transmission and storage systems.
  operation of the system.

  another important element of the network code concerns the supplier switching process whereby transmission capacity may be
  used directly by gas customers. under the network code, capacity is separated from gas volumes and, accordingly, customers
  may choose at their discretion where they wish to source the gas, or purchase the commodity, e.g. at the exchange, and
  transport it through our system. this creates the conditions for real competition between suppliers to attract the customer. the
  capacity that follows the customer enables the optimisation of supply portfolio by such means as purchases at the gas exchange
  or the otc market. we have indications that these new solutions have been welcomed by our customers and we are pleased to
  see positive reactions of the market to the changes we proposed.



cooperation with the polish power exchange

in january 2012, gaz‑system s.a. started the cooperation with the polish power exchange with a view to creating a gas exchange
market in poland. under the cooperation scheme, the companies established working groups responsible for the preparation of
legal, organisational and technical solutions to enable gas exchange trading. detailed terms of the cooperation were set forth in the
agreement signed between gaz‑system s.a. and the polish power exchange on 11 october 2012.

management from a perspective of sustainable development

in line with gaz‑system s.a.’s business strategy, sustainable development underpins the company’s operations. for effective
implementation of the activities under the fifth dimension of our business strategy, i.e. management from a perspective of sustainable
development, we have implemented the “regulations for sustainable development management structure” within gaz‑system s.a.

of and accounting for projects in the field of corporate social responsibility. it also allows the effective implementation and monitoring
of sustainable development indicators across the business.

the principal solutions that facilitate employees’ decisions on ending their careers and retiring are contained in relevant regulations,     the package offered to newly hired employees is an example of good practice and includes:
and specifically in the “corporate collective labour agreement”. according to its provisions, an employee who has worked for the
company for at least 15 years and now wants to retire or receive a pre-retirement benefit is entitled to an extra severance pay on top
of the one provided for under the labour code.

in addition, an employee who elects to retire despite the approaching anniversary award date (less than 12 months), is still eligible to
the award which will be paid upon termination of employment.

furthermore, retirees retain the option to continue to use the non-public medical care at a discounted rate, and may benefit from
the company social benefits fund. the company also takes care of maintaining relationships with retirees giving them a sense
of belonging to the organisation by inviting them to the official corporate meetings (festive meetings, celebrations) and through
organising meetings of retirees.

an approaching date of acquisition of pension rights is not an obstacle to furthering once education. until termination of employment,
employees have the right to use all available forms of in-company education, despite the fact that they will use the knowledge
acquired or established at their discretion after termination of employment.

the personnel of gaz‑system s.a. have a guaranteed social package, which covers a partial reimbursement of the costs of holidays,

one of the harmful and hazardous factors having a direct impact on the health of employees is the noise emitted by the technical
facilities used for gas transmission. therefore, in order to improve the safety performance and ergonomics, the company took the
initiative to equip the teams performing hazardous jobs exposed to high noise levels with the latest generation of hearing protectors
with built-in two-way communication. in addition, gaz‑system s.a. is working to improve the safety of workers involved in work at
height and inside trenches. to this end, an educational meeting was organised together with a demonstration of personal and
collective protection measures for the purpose of work at height, including work in explosion prone areas.

the company also provides assistance to employees in the event of occupational diseases and accidents at work. each employee
is entitled to a healthcare package and additional assistance is available upon the decision of a committee which examines each

in 2012, the company continued to deliver robust financial results. both the balance sheet and cash flow clearly demonstrate
an acceleration in the implementation of the investment programme. this resulted in increased total assets (especially tangible
fixed assets), higher depreciation and capital expenditures. increased capital expenditures in 2012 were financed mainly from
cash generated in past financial years. it should be noted that in 2012 the company made use of debt financing for the first
time by taking out about eur 75 million loan from the european investment bank in december 2012. bank loans in addition to
efficiently obtained eu funds are becoming a significant addition to cash generated from operating activities in the financing of
gaz‑system s.a.’s investment plan. we no longer generate such high interest revenues on deposits as in previous years, on the
contrary, we began to pay interest on our loans. in the coming years, we expect to further increase both the total assets and our
indebtedness. the company is a very intensive investment phase due to the construction of the lng terminal and expansion of
the transmission network.
