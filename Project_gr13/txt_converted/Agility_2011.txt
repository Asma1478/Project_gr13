incorporating sustainability features in warehousing

a notable portion of our greenhouse gas emissions comes from electricity use in warehousing facilities. throughout the middle east, where some of our largest facilities are located, we have worked to
incorporate sustainability features into warehousing design and management. the diagram below shows some of the features we track, and the operations where they are in use.

1 double glazed windows (kuwait, dubai, saudi arabia, oman, turkey, pakistan)
2 filon skylights to stop uv and reduce heat by 85% (kuwait, dubai, saudi arabia, oman, egypt)
3 factory made aluminum sandwich walls and roof panels for better insulation (kuwait, bahrain, dubai, saudi
  arabia)
4 xeriscaping incorporated with planting draught resistant trees with drip irrigation system (dubai, saudi
   arabia)

and increasing the use of webcasts from senior leadership. for
example, agility has an annual leadership conference that brings
the top 200 leaders of the company together to discuss strategy
going forward. in 2009, rather than meeting in person, we con-
ducted this conference virtually instead. the company plans to
alternate between virtual and in person meetings going forward.

offering more efficient logistics solutions

agility strives to create efficient supply chains, and the process of optimizing supply chains for customers often creates reduced environmental impact. this is best illustrated by example.

case study: dubai container freight station

over a period of two years, agility’s dubai operation noticed that there was increase in the number of less-than-full-container loads being shipped from dubai. in response, agility developed a container freight
station (cfs) at the jebel ali free zone, the country’s largest man-made terminal and a major hub for freight movements throughout the middle east. the 1,000 square meters station is a major consolidation and
redistribution service center that enables agility to consolidate cargoes originating from ports worldwide and redistribute them throughout the arabian gulf region and africa. by using a centralized distribution
center, agility is able to reduce costs and improve environmental performance because shipments from multiple customers can be consolidated into a single container moving to a single destination. where cargo
was once being moved on four or ﬁve different containers, today they can be consolidated into only one freight move. the container freight station also eliminates the need for a third party consolidators, and
eliminates the trucks and trips required to transport containers to and from the third-party consolidators.
