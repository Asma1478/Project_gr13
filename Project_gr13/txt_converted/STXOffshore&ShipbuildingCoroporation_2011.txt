about this report


introduction to the sustainability report
stx offshore & shipbuilding(stx o&s) practices sustainability management to increase
corporate value as well as in hopes to experience growth alongside that of society. in or-
der to share corporate efforts and performance with those affiliated with the company, the
first sustainability report was published in june 2010, and this is the second sustainability
report. this report is to be used as a means of communication with stakeholders, and stx
offshore & shipbuilding promises to disclose performance transparency through an annu-
ally published sustainability report.

reporting scope and period
the focal time period covered in this report is from january 1st to december 31st, 2010
and to provide evidence of progress, the report also includes three-year(2008-2010) per-
formance data. variable data such as human resources are based on book-closing date
(december 31st), and in cases where data collection period requires further clarification,
such has been stated accordingly. furthermore, for certain ongoing projects, issues and/or
challenges, data from the first half of 2011 are reflected in the report. as was with the 2009
report, this report’s regional scope includes domestic as well as certain overseas opera-
tions. in particular, with regards to the environmental sector, the report focuses on jinhae
shipyard, where production takes place and its environmental effects are greatest. where
overseas data have been included, it has been noted separately. for systems of the same as
last year’s, content from the 2009 report have been quoted.

principles
the sustainability report is based on “gri g3 guidelines,” which helps explain perfor-
mance transparency by reference as an index. report statuses of topics recommended by
the gri guideline are available on the gri chart. the gri guideline presents 79 performance
indexes, and recommends that a report contain topics of sustainability that suit the orga-
nization, and report them in accordance to the reporting principles with the organization’s
situation under consideration. thus, materiality tests on internal employees and external
experts have been conducted.

message from the ceo

                                  stx offshore & shipbuilding sustainability report 2010                                                 2|3




dear respected stx offshore & shipbuilding stakeholders,


as our vision is to be “the world’s best company, with big dreams and a prosperous future,” stx offshore & shipbuilding has been contrib-
uting to the advancement of korea’s shipbuilding industry through its outstanding shipbuilding technologies and world-class productivity.
as one of korea’s leading shipbuilders striving to realize its stakeholders’ dreams and futures, we hope that the 2010 sustainability report
will convey our sincere efforts and performance in sustainability management to the stakeholders.


although the global economy is slowly recovering, the world still faces inevitable issues of climate change and energy depletion. corpora-
tions face higher expectations to fulfill their social and environmental responsibilities as a corporate citizen.


stx offshore & shipbuilding undertakes various activities to meet the desires of today’s generation, without compromising the needs of
the future generations. to achieve this, we actively engage communication with various stakeholders including customers, shareholders,
employees and suppliers.


in the economic aspect, following the declaration of “vision 2020” we have been placing various efforts to accomplish these goals, enhanc-
ing competitiveness through strategic leadership. in particular, owing to the continued efforts of all our employees to improve operational
efficiency, we have achieved operating profits of over krw 180 billion for 2010. stx offshore & shipbuilding will continue to pursue higher
goals, preparing for the coming decade by expanding production capacities, enhancing offshore businesses, and expanding into new mar-
kets to secure a firm basis for future growth, building the foundation for sustainable growth.


in the environmental aspect, in tandem with the global movement to respond to climate change, we are steadily implementing low-carbon,
green growth management practices. in particular, in response to the government’s keynote for green growth, we now actively participate
in greenhouse gas reduction and energy conservation policies, while undertaking various activities to enhance hse (health, safety, envi-
ronment) implementation capacities while fostering an environmentally-friendly corporate culture.


in the social aspects, based on firm trust between labor and management, we place our efforts in fostering a basis for win-win cooperation
and fair trade, while internally innovating corporate culture and taking the initiative for environmental management, as well as spearhead-
ing activities to improve local communities. due to such, active sustainability management measures, stx offshore & shipbuilding has
received the most respected enterprise award as well as the grand prize for labor-management cooperation, and has entered the dow
jones sustainability index, widely recognized throughout the world.


although the shipbuilding market is taking an upturn, the business conditions of 2010 are still full of uncertainties due to the low growth-
rate. despite such difficulties, stx offshore & shipbuilding will place its utmost efforts in becoming the world best enterprise, through
activities that enrich the lives of all the constituents of society, fulfilling its social responsibilities and pursuing sustainable growth and
development.


we hope for your continued interest and support for this year, as well.


thank you.

                                     size the importance of ethics to executives and employees. the company exercises disciplinary actions when
                                     a member commits sexual harassment, corruption, or other acts against the code of ethics, and offers training
                                     to any employee implicated in a case where there had been lack of awareness. as unfair acts are often a result
                                     of a lack of a manager’s responsibility or awareness of the problem, stx o&s is attempting to strengthen inter-
                                     nal structures to prevent unfair behavior; stx o&s will establish systematic improvement measures in order to
                                     heighten ethics awareness and sense of responsibility in all our employees.

the world is a single market for the shipbuilding industry and the technological impacts related to businesses are great. the global economic crisis and the rise of competi-
tors such as china can act as a risk factor to the domestic shipbuilding industry. however, with increasing traffic owing to the growth of brics countries such as south
america and india, rising demand to replace ships due to tightening environmental regulations, and increasing demand for deep-sea energy development, the shipbuilding
market is expected to steadily recover. due to rising oil prices, demands for large high-efficiency ships, lngc and offshore plants are expected to increase as well.
