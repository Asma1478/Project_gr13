governance
chapter three provides an overview of the city’s
democratic and corporate governance arrangements.



// 3.1

democratic governance
council is empowered by the local government act 2009 [the act], to make
decisions informed by the priorities of the community. the act empowers
the city to define and enforce local laws, regulations and policies
necessary to effectively manage and govern the local area. the local
government regulation 2012 [the regulation] supports the implementation
of the act by providing more detailed guidance.


// 3.1.1
role of council
councillors represent the interests of the community and through the
city’s decision making processes, translate the community’s needs and
aspirations into the future direction of our city to ensure that the gold
coast is the best place to live, visit, work and conduct business.

the mayor, councillors, local government employees and any other person
with a responsibility within local government must act in accordance with
the principles outlined in section 4 [2] of the act, ensuring:
•   transparent and effective processes and decision-making in the
    public interest
•   sustainable development and management of assets and
    infrastructure and effective service delivery
•   democratic representation, social inclusion and meaningful
    community engagement, as well as good governance of and by local
    government
•   ethical and legal behaviour of councillors and local government
    employees.

election of mayor and councillors
queensland local government elections are held every four years, where
voters elect a councillor to represent each of the 14 divisions and a mayor
for the city. the most recent election occurred 19 march 2016 with six
newly elected councillors and the re-election of the previous mayor.

    delegated power and authority
    in accordance with the act, council has delegated to the chief executive officer [ceo], a broad range of powers that the
    city has responsibility to administer and enforce. under section 259 of the act, the ceo is able to delegate powers to
    nominated positions within the city’s staff establishment, enabling them to efficiently perform the responsibilities of their
    roles. the corporate delegations register which records these details is open for public inspection in accordance with
    section 260 of the act.

    each complaint is assessed to determine whether it is about misconduct, inappropriate conduct, corrupt conduct or another
    matter. if the complaint is not frivolous, vexatious or lacking in substance, it is then referred to the appropriate individual,
    panel or tribunal for further action. orders and complaints about councillors during the financial year are shown in table 12.

// 3.1.5
mayor and councillor remuneration
as prescribed by section 86 [a] of the regulation, the remuneration of the mayor and councillors for the financial year is shown
below. this remuneration is determined independently by the local government remuneration and discipline tribunal.
superannuation contributions of up to 12 per cent are made on behalf of councillors in accordance with the terms of the lgia
superannuation scheme. under this scheme, councillors may elect not to make an after tax contribution to superannuation.
in such cases, they receive a basic contribution of 9.5 per cent.
in 2014, the mayor elected to freeze his salary for the life of that council. as the regulation requires the salary determined by
the tribunal to be paid to the mayor, arrangements were put in place whereby the mayor repaid $2869 to council, which was
the amount equivalent to the salary increase determined by the tribunal.

    the total amount of waste processed by gcwm during 2015-16 increased overall by ten per cent compared to 2014-15.
    this relates to a significant increase in construction and demolition waste [27 per cent]. due to this material being recyclable
    and other small gains in recyclables across most waste streams, the overall diversion rate has improved by three percent.
    the solid waste strategy 2024 sets an intermediate target of 45 per cent diversion by 2019.

    the domestic waste stream accounts for 54 per cent of all waste received. this indicator was added to the gold coast waste
    management performance plan 2015-16 as part of the improvements relating to measuring the solid waste strategy 2024.
    in 2015-16, domestic waste and recycling have both increased. two domestic programs were expanded during the year, namely
    the whole-of-city kerbside clean-up [waste to landfill] and the green waste collection service [green waste diverted and recycled].
    these programs collected a similar tonnage of materials, contributing to an unchanged diversion rate. the solid waste
    strategy 2024 sets an intermediate target of 35 per cent diversion by 2019.

    to be consistent with the new performance indicators adopted in the gold coast waste management performance plan
    2015-16, the ‘kilograms of waste per household per week’ measure has been replaced with ‘kilograms of domestic waste
    disposed to landfill per household per year’. this measure will directly relate to solid waste strategy 2024 programs that will
    be implemented in the next eight years.
    in 2015-16, the initial year of the strategy, the data shows very little change in householders’ waste disposal behaviours for
    either collection services or self-hauled waste.

the number of domestic waste and recycling wheelie bin services has increased, in keeping with residential property
growth. domestic recycling bin figures have been boosted by the addition of the optional green waste bin services
[19,655 services at 30 june 2016].

there has been modest growth in commercial bin services, both wheelie and bulk bins, probably due to businesses
increasing their weekly services to manage increased waste generation. use of large compactor bins has decreased, as
some large waste disposers have added recycling bulk bins and subsequently reduced their waste servicing frequency.

    report by the manager corporate finance
                                                       the results for 2015–16 indicate a

                                                       this is an excellent achievement given that the city continues to keep
                                                       rates for owner occupied residential properties, below the brisbane

                                                       the improvement in the financial sustainability performance indicators
                                                       can largely be attributed to an increase in revenue from development
                                                       activity, a reduction in debt levels, a focus on value for money savings
                                                       and a reduction in depreciation following a review of the useful lives of
                                                       city assets.

                                                       key financial outcomes and strategies
                                                       the primary objective of the city’s financial planning is to deliver the
                                                       vision and strategies outlined in the corporate plan while ensuring the
                                                       city’s continued financial sustainability. to achieve this, council adopts
                                                       an annual plan that includes the long term financial forecast and
                                                       identifies the key financial outcomes and strategies.

                                                       •   fund the city’s commitment to gc2018
                                                       •   fully fund renewal requirements in order to maintain
                                                           infrastructure assets
                                                       •   fund stage 1 of the cultural precinct
                                                       •   increase funding for key initiatives included in the city’s key
                                                           corporate strategies
                                                       •   continue to achieve value for money savings to assist in keeping

                                                       the city has delivered on these strategies as highlighted in this report.

overview of the 2015–16 community financial report

the community financial report is a plain english explanation of our financial statements and covers the
following five components:

1.	statement of comprehensive income: shows information on our financial performance including our
    revenue, expenses and net profit or loss.

2.	statement of financial position [balance sheet]: shows the monetary value of our assets, liabilities
    and equity.

3. statement of changes in equity: shows the changes in our net wealth.

4.	statement of cash flows: shows movements of cash and cash equivalents [highly liquid investments
    that can be readily converted into cash].

5.	financial ratios: shows common comparisons between financial statement amounts to allow readers
    to compare our results with other organisations.




                                                                                                           chapter four – finance   12 0

    // 4.2.2
    statement of comprehensive income
    the statement of comprehensive income [refer page 140] shows whether our operations were in surplus or deficit during the
    2015–16 financial year, calculated using the formula:

    total revenue – total expenses = net result

    the net result shows a surplus of $329.2 million. this surplus is largely a result of the cash [$142.6 million] and physical
    assets [$204.9 million] contributed by developers throughout the year associated with new development in the city.
    developers construct local roads, parks, water pipes and many other assets that are handed over to council at the completion
    of the development. they also provide cash contributions towards shared infrastructure that services new development such
    as sewerage treatment plants, major roads, sporting grounds and more. these contributions are restricted in use and are
    therefore not available to fund day to day operations of the city.
    the net result also shows some expenditure that does not contribute toward the daily running of the city. when assets are
    decommissioned or disposed of, the remaining net value of those assets shows as an expense, but does not need to be funded by
    revenue raised through rates and levies. a net loss on disposal of $57.3 million was recorded in 2015–16 [0.4% of total assets].


    expenses against revenue: five-year trend
    the graph and table below show the trend in our revenue, expenses and net result for the past five years.

              and expense figures during those years. expenses are exclusive of reimbursements of allconnex withdrawal costs. prior year adjustments
              were made to 2012-13 relating to the derecognition of non-current assets to the value of $36.7 million as outlined in note 37 of the 2013-14
              financial statements.

    statement of financial position
    calculating our net worth
    the statement of financial position [refer page 141] shows what we own [our assets], what we owe [our liabilities]
    and our net worth.

    assets: what we own
    the major components of our assets include:
    •                 property, plant and equipment [land, buildings, roads, storm water drainage]
    •                 capital works in progress
    •                 cash assets [mainly short-term investments].

    as at 30 june 2016, we held $14.2 billion of assets, an increase of $356 million from 2014-15. our cash assets have increased
    by $196 million from 2014-15 and the value of our property, plant and equipment increased by $145 million in 2015-16.

      associated with stage 1 of the light rail project.
                          these payments were treated as an operating expense in the 2013-14 financial statements.

liabilities – what we owe
our liabilities include debt, amounts owed to suppliers and amounts owing to employees for leave entitlements.

our total liabilities were $915 million as at 30 june 2016 which had decreased from $918 million in the previous year. of the
total liabilities, $736 million relates to loans drawn from queensland treasury corporation [qtc], which have decreased by
$32 million [4 per cent] from 2014-15 resulting from scheduled debt repayments.

amounts owing to suppliers have increased by $25 million from 2014-15 [35 per cent]. this includes invoices received in june
2016 that were not due for payment until july 2016. for example we received a bulk water supply invoice for $13.6 million in
june 2016 which we paid when it was due in july 2016.

managing our debt
when appropriate, we use debt funding to provide for capital works. when used to fund assets that provide a benefit to the
community over many years, debt funding enables us to spread the cost of those assets over the life of the asset.
debt must be managed prudently to ensure repayments can be met. our debt policy restricts the use of debt funding to capital
expenditure only and we also ensure that debt service payments do not exceed 20 per cent of total recurrent revenue in any
one year.
to keep rate increases to a minimum, we seek to minimise borrowings where repayments must come from general rates
funding. instead, we borrow against other established revenue streams, such as specific levies and utility charges, to ensure a
sustainable financial future.
a more detailed explanation of debt management is provided in the document ‘debt management public statement’. this
document is available on council’s website at the following link.

financial ratios
financial ratios use figures from financial statements to demonstrate relationships between key numbers. ratios which focus
on financial sustainability are particularly relevant for government organisations.
the regulation requires all queensland councils to report on three specific financial sustainability ratios, the operating
surplus ratio [osr], the net financial liabilities ratio [nflr] and the asset sustainability ratio [asr]. the results of these
ratios, calculated in accordance with the financial management [sustainability] guidelines 2013 are shown in the current year
and long term financial sustainability statements that follow this community financial report. they are not reproduced here
in that same format.
we prepare detailed asset management plans [amps] which specify how much we should spend on renewing our assets. we
believe that it is more relevant to use these figures in calculating the osr and asr rather than using accounting depreciation.


operating surplus ratio [amps]
this ratio measures the extent to which revenue raised covers operational expenses, based on renewal requirements identified in the
amps rather than using accounting depreciation. a positive ratio indicates that a surplus may be available to use for future expenditure
or debt repayments. surplus funds are being placed into reserves to fund major works in the future.

our operating surplus ratio is forecast to remain strongly positive.

adjusted operating surplus ratio
this ratio is required by [qtc] for loan approval purposes and is calculated as the operating result excluding capital items and
depreciation divided by operating revenue. this ratio is a more accurate representation of our ability to cover operating costs
from operating revenues. the following graph shows the adjusted operating surplus ratio for the current and future years.

    asset renewal funding ratio
    this ratio measures the extent to which our 10 year financial forecast includes required asset renewal expenditure as
    identified in our amps.
    a ratio of greater than 90 per cent indicates that we have capacity to fund our projected infrastructure asset renewals without
    needing to increase operating income, reduce operating expenditure or increase debt.
    our asset renewal funding ratio is forecast to remain above the 90 per cent target.

 notes:    1.	basis of preparation – the current year financial sustainability statement is a special purpose statement prepared in
                accordance with the requirements of the local government regulation 2012 and the financial management [sustainability]
                guideline 2013. the amounts used to calculate the three reported measures are prepared on an accrual basis and are
                consistent with the council's audited general purpose financial statements for the year ended 30 june 2016.

           2.	the operating surplus ratio and asset sustainability ratio use accounting depreciation as the measure for the decline in value of
               assets and therefore the required renewal expenditure. the council of the city of gold coast has embraced asset management
               as a key component of long-term financial sustainability. the council places heavy reliance on its asset management plans for
               the maintenance, renewal and replacement of infrastructure assets to meet the service delivery needs of the community, now
               and in the future. the asset management plans set the optimal schedule of proposed maintenance, renewal and replacement
               to achieve specified service levels while minimising asset life cycle costs. the council uses its asset management plans to
               determine appropriate funding for the replacement and renewal of its long term infrastructure assets rather than rely on
               funding depreciation. as such council does not believe the operating surplus ratio and asset sustainability ratio should be
               viewed in isolation

city of gold coast’s financial management strategy
detailed service financial forecasts [ten year financial plans] are maintained for major service areas including city transport,
parks natural areas & recreation, major sporting & aquatic centres, library services, community centres, gold coast
water, waste management, tourist parks, flooding & drainage and beaches & waterways and incorporated into the long
term financial forecast with the remainder of council’s financial information. the forecast is consistent with council’s total
asset management plan.
in preparing the long-term financial forecast council has sought to ease the burden on ratepayers by keeping rates at a
reasonable level and borrowings to a minimum whilst continuing to invest in infrastructure asset renewal and key services.
financial decisions are guided by corporate policies, strategies and principles of effective financial management.
council regularly models financial performance, financial position and cash flow forecasts to monitor the long term
sustainability of financial decisions. a comprehensive analysis of the long-term financial outlook is undertaken between july
and december each year, which sets the context and financial boundaries for the development of the annual budget.

    19.2 gold coast light rail asset handover
    the gold coast light rail project is the biggest transport infrastructure project undertaken
    within the city and the first light rail system installed within queensland. stage 1 of the project
    was delivered as a public-private partnership between the queensland government, the council
    of the city of gold coast, the commonwealth government of australia and goldlinq with council
    providing cash and in-kind contributions up to $120 million. commercial operation of stage
    1 commenced on 20 july 2014 along a 13 kilometre route from broadbeach to the gold coast
    university hospital.
    council's cash contribution towards the project included $89.014 million for infrastructure
    works that involved a significant number of council controlled assets being either partly or totally
    replaced and/or upgraded as well as a number of new assets being constructed and transferred
    to council's control. it is on this basis that the $89.014 million was recognised as capital works
    in progress.
    the carrying amount of each asset removed, replaced or upgraded during the light rail project
    has been removed from council's books and treated as a disposal [refer to note 14]. the fair
    value of the new portion of each upgraded or replaced asset and the fair value of any newly
    constructed asset is recognised as a transfer from capital works in progress when these assets
    are handed over to council and reliable as-constructed information provided. fair value is based
    on replacement cost principles.

objective were to make a profit. the council provides funding from general revenue to the business activity to cover the cost
of providing non-commercial community services or costs deemed to be csos by the council. details of csos relevant to
activities subject to the code of competitive conduct are presented below:

    description: the graph shows the average annual grading of gold coast waterways [based on
    south east queensland healthy waterways report card].
    commentary: the environmental condition of waterways are rated from a-d.
    the average grading for gold coast waterways in 2015 was b-. this represents a minor downward
    trend potentially attributable to a significant dry period impacting freshwater environments followed
    by intense rainfall events following this dry spell. this leads to significant run off from the land [and
    roads] being washed into the waterways worsening water quality. similarly in drier periods this also
    means that regular flushing of waterways out to sea is reduced and nutrients can build up in the
    waterways leading to poorer water quality and sometimes algal blooms to form.
    latest data as at december 2015.

description: the graph shows the percentage of the 22
outcomes included in the corporate plan that are on track to
be achieved by 2020.
commentary: an improvement in outcomes on track has
been demonstrated since 2014, with 77 per cent of outcomes
currently identified as on track. while this is below the
current checkpoint, gold coast 2020 has only been in
implementation for 2 of its 6 year lifespan.
