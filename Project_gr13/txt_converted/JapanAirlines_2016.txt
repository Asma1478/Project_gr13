                                                other businesses



                                               we strive to enhance customer convenience and maximize
                                               the jal group’s corporate value.
                                               the financial results for the main two companies in this segment were as follows:




                                               jalpak co., ltd.
                                               jalpak co., ltd. endeavored to increase revenues by developing
                                               and offering products in a timely manner in response to changing
                                               demand.
                                                     in fiscal 2015, jalpak handled 243,000 passengers traveling
                                               to overseas destinations, down 11.7% from the previous year,
                                               partly due to uncertainties in europe. this downturn was offset,
                                               however, by increased sales of the jal dynamic package, which
                                               boosted the number of domestic travelers to 2,429,000, up 5.6%
                                               from the previous year.
                                                     as a result, operating revenue (prior to elimination of
                                               intercompany transactions) increased by 1.4% from a year earlier
                                               to 172.2 billion yen.
                                                     in fiscal 2016, we are continuing to listen to customer
                                               feedback to enhance our ability to respond accurately to
                                               diversifying needs and provide a pleasant travel experience
                                               customers can enjoy only with jalpak.

                                               in planning new products, our
                                               personnel in many departments
                                               take advantage of their expertise
                                               to identify the varying needs of
                                               customers precisely and develop
                                               an offering of high-quality trips
                                               that assure peace of mind
                                               through rigorous quality control.
                                                      we distributed “white
                                               pamphlets” introducing our
                                               domestic and overseas products
                                               at the beginning of the fiscal year, and are continuing to provide customers
                                               with special product pamphlets for different destinations and seasons as the
                                               year goes by. we also prepare special pamphlets for jmb members only.
