our 2004 global corporate citizenship report is organized so that our readers will be able to easily ﬁnd topics of greatest interest to them. we
lead off with a list of our major accomplishments, each of which is described in greater detail elsewhere in the report. the “corporate citizenship
at citigroup” section outlines our citizenship vision and strategy—how we fulﬁll our role as a corporate citizen, the importance we place on
dialogue with our stakeholders relating to community issues and how we report on our citizenship activities. we organize our citizenship efforts
into three categories—community, environment and workplace. each contains data that we use to quantify and identify results on speciﬁc
programs, excerpts from our policies and code of conduct, and personal statements by our senior management, employees and various individu-
als from the ngo (nongovernmental organization) community. in the “community” and “environment” sections, we show how good corporate
citizenship is embedded in our operations, with examples of how our businesses are making a difference. and the “workplace” section focuses on
how we achieve an environment in which diversity and a work/life balance are embraced and nurtured through speciﬁc employee and recruitment
programs. in all sections, we also try to identify challenges that we face.

                                           citigroup developed the 2004 citizenship report with reference to the guidelines developed by the global reporting
                                           initiative. these guidelines are intended to enhance the quality, rigor and utility of sustainability reporting and to provide
                                           standardized deﬁnitions. this year, we have reported on a number of guidelines from the 2002 sustainability reporting
                                           framework as well as the financial services sector supplements for social performance and environmental performance.
