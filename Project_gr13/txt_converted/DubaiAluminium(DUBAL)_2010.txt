     and agree that it is not just about the financial performance of
     our organization. instead, economic sustainability should reflect
     the degree to which the wealth generated and resulting financial
     resources are used to contribute to society.

     energy-intensive process that also yields certain

 the red tide events, we conducted a
 six-month marine ecological study in
 2009 (april to september). the study
 was undertaken along the shoreline,
 close to the intake and outfall of our
 power and desalination plants.

 the findings indicated that increased
 development along the coastline is
 changing the conditions of the marine
 environment and that algae is more
 likely to bloom under these altered
 conditions — hence the red tides.

 in light of the results, dubal
 has installed a real-time, marine
 monitoring system, which will allow
 us to monitor early indicators of red
 tides and notify local authorities.
 we are also considering additional
 measures to protect dubal’s intake
 systems.
