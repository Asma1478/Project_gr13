 thriving with communities,
 growing globally

 in october 2012, we formulated our fifth medium-term management plan,“jr east group management vision v –
 ever onward.”under the slogan“thriving with communities, growing globally,”this plan renews our commitment
 to the twin pillars of our business: continuing to work to“fulfill our eternal missions”and striving to succeed in our
“pursuit of unlimited potential.”
 the experience of the great east japan earthquake reminded all our employees of our ties to local communities
 and the great expectations that society places on our railway company. as a company responsible for maintaining
 social infrastructure, the disaster brought home to us how vital it is that we work with a sense of mission to meet
 the public’ s expectations. today, the jr east region and the entire country face a number of serious problems.
 our motto,“thriving with communities, growing globally,”is also a pledge: we will come together with local
 communities to think about the kind of future we want, and will do everything we can to use our unique position to
 build vibrant communities and open a way to the future for our railway.


  continuing to fulfill our“eternal missions”
 as a group dedicated to“thriving with communities,”our fundamental duty is to contribute to the development of
 those communities by providing safe and high-quality services. we must work to meet the expectations that local
 communities place in us and reinforce the trust that is the foundation of everything we do. we must never forget that
 a single accident is enough to destroy this trust. this is why safety has always been our number-one priority. ever
 since the jr east group was formed, we have constantly worked to improve our safety standards. fy2015 marked
 the start of our new five-year safety plan: the jr east group safety plan 2018, under which we will work to cultivate
 the highest levels of safety awareness among all our employees. by striving to improve safety through the actions we
 take on a daily basis, our aim is to achieve“ultimate safety levels”in which the individual efforts of every employee
 are solidified by teamwork. the importance of these efforts was brought home to us again in february 2014 when
 one of our trains derailed and caused an accident at kawasaki station on the keihin tohoku line. we must ensure
 that there is no further repetition of this kind of event. in addition to redoubling our accident prevention efforts, we
 are determined to learn the lessons from past accidents. we will carry out a thorough investigation to locate any
 weaknesses in our safety procedures and find
 measures to resolve them.
 we are also continuing to improve our
 preparedness for natural disasters. in addition to
 the 300 billion yen we have invested in seismic
 reinforcement to prepare for the eventuality of
 a major earthquake directly beneath the tokyo
 metropolitan area, we are also taking steps to
 guard against natural disasters and extreme
 weather events including major snowfall, heavy
 rain, and strong winds, all of which have occurred
 with increasing frequency and caused substantial
 damage in recent years, as we work to build a
 railway that can withstand natural disasters of
 all types. we will also continue work to install
 automatic platform gates in our stations. as
 well as the ongoing work to install these gates
 in stations along the yamanote line, we are
 considering expanding this measure to other
 lines.
 alongside safety, another of our major missions
 is service quality reform. in a context where a
 decline in the productive working-age population
 in the jr east area seems unavoidable,
 stimulating demand for our railway will be an
 important issue for the group in the future. one
 approach will be to expand our rail network. we
 will use the opportunities presented by major

projects like the new hokuriku shinkansen to kanazawa and the ueno tokyo line that will open in 2015 to increase
customer use. in addition to these new infrastructure developments we will work to build a reliable and comfortable
railway service and keep passengers better informed through information and communications technology (ict).
every single group employee will help to create“jr east service quality”that will be second to none in the industry,
to achieve our goal of becoming no. 1 in customer satisfaction in the railway industry.
we will work to harness the potential of tourism, which is an area in which our strengths can be brought most
fully to bear. this will help us to cement the ties that bind us to local communities as well as helping to promote
and revitalize those communities. we have joined with local communities to develop destination campaigns that
highlight the unique attractions of a particular area. as another resource for attracting visitors to the tohoku region
and helping to revitalize the communities there will be our growing number of“concept”trains that people ride for
the sake of enjoying the onboard experience. these include the“sl ginga”steam locomotive hauled train on the
kamaishi line and the“toreiyu”resort train on sections of our shinkansen. the number of tourists visiting japan
from overseas has increased dramatically in recent years, and increasing demand in this sector will be particularly
important. accordingly, we are redoubling our efforts to promote an inbound tourist strategy. in order to attract
as many people as possible to the region, we will establish a“golden route for travel in east japan”and work
together with our travel partners in taiwan and other places to drive demand for tourism in japan among overseas
visitors.
as part of our ongoing efforts to rebuild infrastructure in tohoku, we are continuing to restore rail lines along the
coast that were damaged by the tsunami, providing a substitute for damaged railway lines by operating bus rapid
transit (brt) services along the kesennuma and ofunato lines, and reducing travel time between sendai and
ishinomaki by constructing the senseki-tohoku connecting line.
as part of our focus on“thriving with communities,”we are actively working to develop attractive towns centered on
railway stations. as well as ongoing large-scale renovations and development of major terminal stations in the tokyo
metropolis, we plan to develop“one-stop smart stations”in core regional cities. these will concentrate in one place
vital services and functions including medical, childcare, care facilities for the elderly, and local government services.
in particular, we have announced a new station to be built on the yamanote line between tamachi and shinagawa
stations, which is tentatively scheduled to open in 2020. to coincide with the large-scale development this will
involve, we have developed plans to transform the area into an international hub where people can come together
and exchange ideas. at the same time, we will continue to join together with local communities and help to energize
local economies by facilitating the creation of new businesses that integrate agriculture, fishing and forestry with
secondary and tertiary industries.


 pursuing unlimited potential
the second pillar of“group management vision v”is our determination to grow globally. railway companies,
because of their sheer scale, are at risk of becoming self-absorbed and inward-looking. a corporate culture that is
satisfied with the status quo will not survive in an age of dramatic change. we must develop and harness the skills of
every one of our employees and grow as a group, building a corporate culture that gives all of our employees belief
in their“unlimited potential”and the confidence to pursue it.
globalization will be key to this strategy. we are considering many railway projects in overseas markets, which we
expect will be worth 22 trillion yen by 2020. our aim is to harness our skills in manufacturing rolling stock, as well as
our maintenance and operations knowhow, to develop our business in global markets. although these efforts are in
their infancy, the group is already responsible for providing rolling stock and maintenance services for the mrt purple
line in bangkok, thailand, which is due to begin operations in 2016. we are also actively dispatching employees to
a wide variety of countries to provide consulting and technical assistance in areas around the world.
another key will be technological innovation. our plans for this include several priorities: energy and environmental
strategies, innovations using information and communication technology (ict), and further increases in shinkansen
operational speed. we encourage our employees to pursue open innovation. rather than focusing exclusively on
the technologies of jr east or the railway industry alone, we encourage them to seek out technologies from other
companies and industries that can help the group to achieve breakthroughs that go beyond the values we have had
in the past.


 pursuing energy and environmental strategies
responding to global environmental problems is a priority for our business. our environmental efforts, which include
introducing energy-saving railcars and leds for lighting, have produced substantial results, reducing the total amount
of co2 emissions produced by our railway operations and lessening the burden on the environment. rail travel
enjoys a reputation as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation, but the automotive industry has achieved
remarkable developments in energy-efficient and environmentally friendly technology in recent years, including hybrid
vehicles, electric cars, and fuel cell vehicles.
for this reason, as mentioned above, we have made energy and environmental strategies one of the pillars
of our plans for technological innovation. we are making concerted efforts to achieve a more evolved railway
environmentally, concentrating on three aspects: energy creation, energy conservation, and the introduction of smart

grid technologies.
in energy creation, we are actively introducing renewable energy including solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass
energy. in particular, we have plans to develop northern tohoku into a renewable energy base, making full use of
its natural environment and also encouraging economic revitalization. surveys have already begun in many areas.
as part of our work to ensure a stable power supply, we opened a new no. 4 generator at the kawasaki thermal
power station, and have begun renovations on the no. 1 generator at the same plant.
on energy conservation, we continue to develop facilities at our“ecoste”ecological model stations, which bring
together a variety of environmental innovations, and we are moving ahead with plans to replace conventional
lighting and electronic display devices with leds. in march 2014“accum ev-e301,”a hybrid railcar train using an
accumulator system, was introduced on the karasuyama line. we have further plans to build on this technology
to develop railcars through service between alternating current (ac) electrified railway lines and non-electrified
segments. this will permit electric railcar operations without installing catenary (overhead power lines). we are
also moving ahead with r&d on new railway cars equipped with ict-driven“automatic power-saving operation
functions.”
in terms of smart grid technologies, we have plans in place to introduce energy management systems (ems) into
stations. in fy2015 we started automated demand control of the power used at kokubunji and nishi-funabashi
stations. we are also continuing to research effective uses of regenerative power and aim to develop viable practical
applications as soon as possible.
through these measures, by fy2021 we aim to reduce energy usage in railway operations by 8% (compared to
fy2011), and to improve the co2 emissions coefficient of jr east power stations by 30% (compared to fy1991). in
april 2014, we established new three-year targets to be achieved in fy2017. we will implement these efforts with a
plan and further continue to collect the result data.

going forward, the entire jr east group will continue to work together to fulfill our“eternal missions”of providing
safe and high-quality services and contributing to local communities. at the same time we will continue our pursuit
of“unlimited potential,”working together with the rest of the community to open up new possibilities for the future.

 jr east group management vision v — ever onward—
 jr east was established as a result of the reform and privatization of japanese national railways (jnr) 25
 years ago, and the group is now at a crossroads of moving on into the next quarter century. with this as
 an impetus, and in light of major changes in our operating environment, for instance as a consequence of
 the great east japan earthquake, jr east in october 2012 formulated a new management vision entitled
“jr east group management vision v - ever onward.”this fifth management vision since the company was
 established aims to once again renew the courses of action for the group going forward.
 having set the continual fulfillment of“eternal mission”and of growth through“pursuing unlimited potential”
 as two important pillars, the vision was drawn up to set forth management’                                s

 eternal mission and pursuing unlimited potential
 under“jr east group management vision v — ever onward,”jr east has set“eternal mission”and
“pursuing unlimited potential”as two important pillars and has established six basic courses of action for
 the group.

 ◆eternal mission
the jr east group’  s fundamental mission is to provide safe and high-quality services that customers
expect of the jr east group and conduct railway and life-style businesses, with the aim of contributing
to the growth and prosperity of communities. this fundamental mission will never change through the
years. we have once again positioned this mission as a key tenet of management. at the same time, we
will make relentless efforts to ensure that the content and quality of our services properly answer the
expectations of society.

 ◆pursuing unlimited potential
the jr east group must achieve sustained growth in order to continue to fulfill its three-part eternal
mission in the years ahead. in a fast-changing environment, maintaining the status quo will only mean
falling behind. unless we constantly take on the challenge of reaching new goals, we will be unable
to achieve growth. the jr east group and each and every group employees will pursue the group’       s
unlimited potential.

       aiming to achieve
special topic 1




      “extreme safety levels”

group safety plan 2018
since its foundation, jr east has been formulating five 5-year safety plans which place safety as our most
important management issue.
this year, jr east formulated its 6th and newest 5-year safety plan, group safety plan 2018, which
endeavors to encourage each one of us to expand our capabilities in order to realize safety through team
work. each one of us involved in the railway business endeavors to improve upon the current levels of
safety and to continue our challenge to achieve“extreme safety levels”across the entire group.
in group safety plan 2018, together with redefining the direction we are taking as a company, we outline
specific measures aimed at preventing accidents resulting from internal factors. additionally, through
our ongoing efforts to pass on technologies and promote measures to comprehensively understand the
severity of accidents, we aim to further enhance safety management through the fostering of safety-
conscious personnel.
in its sixth 5-year safety plan, jr east plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen over the five years for
safety equipment.


   major features of group safety plan 2018
a safety plan focusing strongly on the jr east group
                     s railway business is firmly supported through the various coalitions and efforts of its
the safety of jr east’
railway employees and its group and partner companies. additionally, as more and more work continues
to require the cooperation of the jr east group as a whole, the sixth 5-year safety plan has focused more
on our strength as a group, and we have chosen the name for this plan to reinforce our unity as a group.


reaffirming our directions
as its primary goal, group safety plan 2018, which is the successor to the 2013 safety plan, endeavors
to realize zero accidents involving passenger injuries or fatalities and zero accidents involving employee
fatalities (including the employees of group and partner companies). to achieve this goal, we will focus
on specific measures while targeting three directions.


preventing the occurrence of all accidents due to internal factors
through improvements to our railway operations and maintenance, we aim to prevent all accidents due
to preventable internal factors. these include such accidents as those resulting from failures within the jr
east group to confirm signals or errors in maintenance work procedures.


reducing the risk of accidents resulting from predictable external factors
to minimize damage from accidents due to external factors such as natural disasters, we are working to
reduce risk through the planned strengthening of our railway facilities.


cooperating with the community to implement comprehensive measures against
accidents that are closely related to society
together with our customers and members of the local communities, we are taking comprehensive
measures to counter accidents at level crossings and passengers falling onto platforms. through the
sharing of information on measures such as combining and eliminating level crossings and developing
people’ s awareness of the risks involved in railways, we aim to implement specific initiatives which will
steadily eliminate these accidents.

a focus on passing technologies down to new generations
as the time is rapidly approaching for many skilled veteran employees to enter into retirement, we
position the next five years to be their last chance to pass on their technological abilities to their
successors. we aim to take specific measures in improving our safety management by actively and
deliberately passing down these technologies, and through measures to thoroughly understand the gravity
of accidents.




 the four pillars of group safety plan 2018
pillar 1: ingraining the cultures of safety
with the cultures of safety at the foundation of our safety measures, we aim to further ingrain this
mentality in our employees.


pillar 2: improving safety management
we aim to foster safety-oriented personnel through the passing on of safety-related technologies and
knowledge. additionally, we will work on measures to comprehensively understand the gravity of
accidents and the importance of minimizing human error.


pillar 3: steadily reducing risk
we aim to greatly reduce risk from accidents resulting from internal factors. additionally, we endeavor
to reduce risk from accidents due to external factors such as large scale earthquakes and other natural
disasters, such as those caused by atypical weather. furthermore, for risks from accidents closely related
to society and for safety measures for places like level crossings and platforms, we will cooperate with
our customers and the people of local communities to implement comprehensive measures.


pillar 4: priority improvement plan for safety equipment
in group safety plan 2018, jr east plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen in safety equipment.
specifically, we will continue our countermeasures against large scale earthquakes and those against
level crossing accidents, and to further improve our safety equipment. we will install platform doors at
23 stations on the yamanote line and have plans and priorities for introducing them at other stations on
other lines.

                   toward restoration from the
special topic 2




                   earthquake and revival of communities
measures against earthquakes
learning from the experiences of the great hanshin-awaji earthquake of january 1995, the sanriku
minami earthquake of may 2003, and the mid niigata prefecture earthquake of october 2004, jr east
has introduced emergency train stop measures, seismic reinforcement measures to its elevated bridge
columns, bridge piers, tunnels and station buildings, taken preventive measures against derailments, and
increased the number of seismometer locations.
thanks to these and other measures, nobody on board our trains was killed or injured at the time of the
great east japan earthquake of march 11, 2011.
since fy2010, jr east has expanded its countermeasures and initiated the 2nd phase of its seismic
reinforcement measures, including further seismic reinforcement of elevated bridge columns. in addition,
jr east has designated the five years from fy2013 as a priority improvement period and is striving to
provide disaster-resilient railways through the introduction of the following measures:



      ① seismic reinforcement measures for embankments, earth cuttings, brick arch elevated bridges
         and power poles, and measures to prevent the collapse of station platform ceilings and walls
         if an earthquake directly strikes the tokyo metropolitan area. jr east will also accelerate the
         implementation of its plans for continuing the seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns and
         bridge piers.
      ② seismic reinforcement measures for station buildings where the number of boarding and alighting
         passengers exceeds 3,000 persons per day, and for shinkansen power poles, many of which were
         damaged during the great east japan earthquake.
      ③ strengthening of anti-disaster telecommunication functions, including an increase in the transmission
         speed of seismometer measurement data, and the reinforcement of emergency power sources for
         our communication network.

measures for protection against tsunami
prior to the 2011 great east japan earthquake, jr east had already designated tsunami hazard areas and
set operational restrictions for each of its branch offices, formulated manuals and conducted drills in the
guidance of passengers evacuating from trains. after the earthquake, jr east has further reviewed all of
its tsunami-related rules, manuals and drills. based on the reviewed rules and established policies, jr east
carried out the following actions in fy2013:



 ・ establishment of tsunami warning zones in each of our branch offices after reexamination based
   on hazard maps of municipalities and tsunami flooded areas resulting from the great east japan
   earthquake.
 ・ systemic improvement of displays showing evacuation route maps and signage at and between
   stations.
 ・ working together with local municipalities to install emergency stairs to evacuation shelters, and
   providing signs to indicate escape routes in places where evacuation is difficult.
 ・ establishment and review of tsunami response manuals in all workplaces that could be at risk.
 ・ implementation of regular education and training around march 11 in all workplaces that could
   suffer from a tsunami, based on tsunami evacuation principles, the tsunami response manual, and
   other sources.

drills and support provision for people facing difficulties getting home
when train services were interrupted during and after the 2011 great east japan earthquake, stations
were crowded with passengers. in the future, after confirming the safety of our facilities, jr east will
strive to keep passenger restrooms open and public phones available at stations throughout the tokyo
metropolitan area, provide customers with as much information as possible, and offer temporary shelter in
concourses and elsewhere at approximately 200 stations. these designated stations have been listed on
the jr east website since march 5, 2013 and the information on temporary shelter spaces and requests
to customers has been widely publicized as station initiatives that would follow large-scale earthquakes.
at approximately 30 major terminal stations, including tokyo and shinjuku, jr east has been stockpiling
supplies including drinking water, blankets, and first-aid kits for children and the elderly. by the end of
fy2014 this project has been expanded to approximately 170 stations within a 30-km radius of tokyo.
jr east also has conducted joint drills with the local municipalities to increase our ability to support
people who have difficulty returning to their homes in the event of a disaster affecting major terminal
stations. together with local municipalities, jr east is working to improve evacuation guidance methods in
the event of disasters, and to be generally better prepared.

measures to support the restoration of disaster-damaged areas in fy2014
the areas affected by the great east japan earthquake are still in the process of reconstruction, and their
revitalization with the power of tourism is an important mission of jr east. in fiscal 2014, we conducted
the sendai - miyagi destination campaign (dc) over the months april - june and the akita dc over the
months october - december. throughout the same year, we promoted the go! tohoku campaign,
which we launched in fiscal 2013 as a symbol of our efforts to assist recovery, and publicized travel to
the tohoku region on a continuous basis. in addition, we commenced sales of bus tour plans to support
recovery and emphasized transportation of visitors to coastal communities such as minamisanriku and
kesennuma, which incurred tremendous damage from the tsunami. we also marketed a tour plan to
support the affected areas that was linked with an aid project of the tokyo metropolitan government
under the banner "go! fukushima! nice price in summer! fukushima" and a bus tour for support of
recovery in iwate prefecture, with a guided tour of disaster sites. the latter included financial aid for the
affected areas. in these and other ways, we strove to assist recovery and revitalize communities in these
areas.

                                   areas: tourism campaigns




during restoration support events in sendai station, dila nishifunabashi, and dila mitaka, jr east provided
concrete assistance by offering sales channels for products from disaster-affected area where production
has been resumed and sales outlets for residents of disaster-affected areas.
at ueno and akihabara stations in tokyo, jr east continuously hosted events such as farmers’markets
and“nomono”local produce shops, which focused on eastern japan including disaster-struck areas.
we also launched a new event titled "sanriku marketplace," which focused on communities in the sanriku
district. at this event, customers were able to buy seasonal foods and sake directly from sanriku farmers
and sake brewers.

tsunami-damaged railway lines—basic policy & restoration status
jr east has been carrying out post-tsunami reconstruction with the goal of resuming train operations on
line sections where safety can be guaranteed along the pacific coast, which incurred tremendous damage
from the tsunami. services have now resumed along the entire hachinohe line and on most sections of
the joban, senseki, and ishinomaki lines.
on the joban line between soma and hamayoshida, the senseki line between takagimachi and
rikuzenono, and the ishinomaki line between urashuku and onagawa, we are laying track for restoration
of railway service in step with community reconstruction. we are aiming for resumption of service in the
spring of 2017 on this section of the joban line, by june 2015 on the senseki line, and the spring of
2015 on the ishinomaki line.
there are many factors that we must consider regarding the resumption of operations on the joban line
section between hirono and haranomachi, which runs partially within the 20-km radius exclusion zone
around the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station. before making any decisions, we will consider all
aspects of reconstruction, including reviews of line sections, decontamination activities implemented by
the ministry of the environment, the condition of infrastructural redevelopment, the situation regarding the
return of former residents, and requests from local governments. track restoration on the section between
hirono and tatsuta began early enough for us to restore service when the residents of communities along
the line were permitted to return, and service was resumed on june 1, 2014.
on the kesennuma and ofunato lines, we started a bus rapid transit (brt) program so that we
could provide safe, convenient service at an early date. this has been improved by measures such as
lengthening the exclusive brt roadways and introducing "odeca," an ic boarding card system.
for the yamada line section, we made a proposal to local government organizations for integrating its
operation with the north and south rias lines, which are operated by the locally based sanriku railway
company. this proposal, which is now under discussion, was raised from the perspective of encouraging
service use through operation rooted in the area, which would be sustainable and responsive to local
needs.
the suspension of train operations along line sections badly damaged by the earthquake and tsunami
has now been reduced from the initial 400 km to approximately 240 km as of july 1, 2014. jr east will,
of course, continue to cooperate with both national and local government authorities to bring about
restoration of damaged railway lines, as well as in plans to rebuild the area as a whole and further
develop towns, while at the same time ensuring the paramount safety of customers.

basic philosophy and basic policies for promoting ecological activities
(established may 1992, partially revised in september 2012)
the jr east group formalized its basic philosophy and policies in 1992 and established activity guidelines
in 1996. our specific environmental protection measures are based on these.
【basic philosophy】
・the entire jr east group, as a member of society, will diligently strive to balance global environmental
  protection with our business activities.
【basic policies】
・to contribute to creating a global environment for the future through our business activities for our
  customers and local communities.

・to maintain our concern for the global environment and raise the global environmental awareness of
  our employees.


activity guidelines for the promotion of ecological activities
(established march 1996 and partially revised in february 1998 and september 2012)
1. while working to reduce total energy consumption by enhancing energy efficiency and introducing
    cleaner forms of energy, we endeavor to reduce co2 emissions, a cause of global warming.
2. we ensure the proper management and processing of environmental pollutants and ozone-depleting
    substances, in compliance with laws and regulations. moreover, we do our best to reduce generation
    of such substances and adopt environmentally responsible substitutes as much as possible.
3. w e ensure the appropriate processing of various types of waste generated at our offices,
    establishments, stations, trains, and other locations. we strive to recycle waste and to reduce its
    generation, and to use more recycled and resource-saving products to minimize the burden we place
    on the environment.
4. w e respect the natural environment, which nurtures diversified life, and endeavor to reduce noise and
    vibrations caused by train operations, thus achieving harmony with the environment along railway lines.
5. w e are looking carefully at the impact of railways on the environment once again, in order to enhance
    the environmental superiority of railways and to spread that awareness throughout the world.

 waste disposal
 ・waste includes salable waste.
 ・recycling includes thermal recycling* where general and industrial wastes are incinerated with heat recovery.
 * thermal recycling is a recycling method in which the heat arising from the incineration of waste is used to create steam and hot water, which in turn are used to generate electricity
   and to produce heat.

evaluation of fy2014 goals
electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume
for reducing energy used for train operation, we have developed and introduced energy-efficient trains
and electricity storage devices. when the tohoku shinkansen was extended from hachinohe to shin-
aomori in 2010, however, this increased the proportion of electricity consumption accounted for by the
shinkansen – which requires more electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume
(kwh/car-km) than conventional lines. as part of our targets for fy2017, we will establish objectives
for conventional lines as well as for the shinkansen, as we prepare to begin operation of the hokuriku
shinkansen.

environmental targets for fy2015 and beyond
since 1996, the jr east group has undertaken environmental preservation activities based on concrete
targets. with the implementation period of environmental targets set in fy2012 having come to an end in
fy2014, and toward our targets for fy2021 (an 8% reduction in the volume of energy consumed through
railway operations), continuous efforts are required, and for this we have established environmental
targets with the aim of achieving them during fy2017.

concept for establishing fy2017 targets
of“environmental targets for fy2015 and beyond”(page 23), the targets that have been newly
established as targets to be met by fy2017 are based on the following concept.



[fy2017 target] electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume: 5.9%
reduction on both shinkansen and conventional lines (kwh/car-km:relative to fy2011 level)
shinkansen: 2.71 → 2.55 (kwh/car-km) conventional lines: 1.65 → 1.55 (kwh/car-km)

approximately 80% of the energy consumed by jr east is accounted for by energy used in railway
operations. a significant portion of that is electricity required to operate trains, and in order to achieve a
reduction in energy consumption, we must steadily achieve a reduction in this area. in the case of fy2014
targets, shinkansen and conventional lines were managed collectively; however, in anticipation of the
opening of the hokuriku shinkansen at the end of fy2015, shinkansen and conventional lines will be
managed independently with respect to fy2017 targets. based on the concept of the energy saving act,
we have set the target at 1% reduction for each consecutive year.




[fy2017 target] energy consumption per unit of floor area at branch offices, etc.: 15% reduction
(kl-crude oil equivalent/m2:relative to fy2011 level) 0.0467 → 0.0397 (kl-crude oil equivalent/m2)
while reducing energy consumed through railway operations, it is also necessary to work to reduce
energy consumed at branch office buildings. as a result of the introduction of high-efficiency devices
and electricity conservation following the earthquake, we succeeded in achieving a reduction of 12% in
fy2013. the goal established this term, based on planning for energy-efficient facilities and continuation
of existing electricity-conservation measures, is to continually reduce energy intensity at an annual rate of
1% in line with the idea of the energy saving act.


[fy2017 target] implementation of more ecoste model stations – total of 8 stations
as of march 2014, there are 3 ecoste model stations in our network (yotsuya, hiraizumi, kaihinmakuhari).
going forward, through studies and design, we will aim to develop 5 more stations.



[fy2017 target] change to led for platform illumination
(2015 – within fy2017); more than 50% of the lightning equipment is switched to led at
60 stations
based on the assumption that the replacement schedules for platform illumination can differ based
on direction, we will establish 50% or more as the standard. going forward, through the steady
implementation of replacement, we will aim to introduce led lighting at more than 50% of an additional
60 stations.



[fy2017 target] optimization of large-scale air-conditioning systems
(2015 – within fy2017); 5 locations
as the energy-reduction effect of the optimization of large-scale air-conditioning systems is significant, we
will aim to conduct studies and design, and to achieve optimization at 5 locations.



[fy2017 target] reduction rate of energy consumption intensity established by each jr
east group company; continuous reduction at an annual rate of 1% on average groupwide
in accordance with the energy saving act, we have established a target of an average annual reduction
of 1% (fy2015 – fy2017). each jr east group company is required to establish its own energy intensity
indicator, which should be closely related to the indicator already established under the energy saving
act.

[fy2017 target] recycling rate for all waste
with regard to the recycling rate for all waste, in accordance with the achievement of the desired
recycling rate in fy2014, the numeric value will not be reduced – we have decided to set the numeric
target increasingly higher and continue to conduct activities centered around the 3rs toward the
realization of a recyclable society.




[fy2017 target] implementation rate of recycling by group companies-100%
for trash and industrial waste generated by all group companies, we intend to achieve this objective
through various means of recycling. we aim to achieve a 100% recycling rate by fy2017.




[fy2017 target] setting of numeric targets by all group companies
all group companies, in accordance with the characteristics of their operations, will establish their own
targets and conduct activities toward their achievement.

measures to prevent global warming
energy conservation and co2 reduction☆
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at
stations and in offices is supplied by jr east’s own power plants and by electric power companies.
besides electricity, we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and for air conditioning
at stations and in offices. we will strive to save energy for train operation, which accounts for about 80%
of our total energy consumption, and reduce co2 emissions in various ways.

        * regarding change in method of computation
          until fy2006, computation concerning co 2 emissions and energy consumption volume through the use of
          electricity and fuel was based on the keidanren voluntary action plan on the environment. beginning in fy2007,
          the computation method was revised based on the energy saving act and the act on promotion of global warming
          countermeasures.

        * the energy consumption is converted to joules according to the energy saving act, except for the electricity
           generated by jr east’  s own hydroelectric plant, which is converted to joules using 9.76 mj/kwh as the conversion
           factor. jr east uses 0 mj/kwh as the conversion factor for our own hydroelectric power in our report submitted to
           the government, as required by the act.

 trends in jr east’
 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2014 totaled 2.15 million tons, a decrease of 0.18
 million tons over the previous fiscal year. this is the result of a decrease in the co2 emission coefficient of
 electricity generated by jr east. beginning this fiscal year, we also report co2 emissions in scopes 1 and
 2 in accordance with the definition of the ghg protocol.

reducing energy consumed for train operations☆
as of the end of fy2014, jr east had 11,631 energy-efficient railcars in operation. this accounts for 91.3%
of our railcar fleet. we are putting into service more new-generation energy efficient railcars, with features
such as regenerative brakes, which can convert kinetic energy during deceleration into electric energy, and
variable voltage variable frequency (vvvf) inverters, which control motors without wasting electricity.

diesel-powered, electric-motor-driven hybrid railcars and the accumulator railcar train
the kiha e200 type cars, which entered service on the koumi line in july 2007, are the world’       s first
diesel-powered, electric-motor-driven hybrid railcars. compared with the current trains, fuel consumption
rate has been reduced by about 10% and the noise level of the trains idling at stations and accelerating
on departure has been lowered by 20–30 db. also, starting from the october to december 2010, we
began operating the hb-e300 series, a new type of resort train equipped with a hybrid system similar
to the kiha e200 type, in the nagano, aomori and akita areas. additionally, as a new measure toward
reduction of the environmental burden in non-electric zones, we are proceeding with the development
of an accumulator system, which debuted in march 2014 with the ev-e301 accum railcar train, put into
service on the karasuyama line. the introduction of the ev-e301 has enabled an elimination of emissions,
as well as a reduction in co2 and noise emissions associated with diesel engines.

utilization of renewable energies
we also promote use of renewable energies, including solar and wind power. solar panels have been
installed at tokyo station, takasaki station, the general education center and r&d center. in march
2004, the number of panels at takasaki station was doubled. panels on the largest scale in jr east were
installed at tokyo station in february 2011 above the platform for tracks 9 and 10, which serve tokaido
line trains.

starting full operations as the first ecoste “
of solar panels in march 2012. hiraizumi station on the jr east tohoku main line, the second ecoste,
began to use solar panels in june 2012, to“generate and use energy locally”and to achieve“zero
emissions,”i.e., no co2 emissions on fine-weather days. additionally, the largest solar panels employed
anywhere at our company have been installed at the keiyo rolling stock center. these have been in use
since february 2014.
we will continue to endeavor to introduce technology using renewable energies efficiently.

greening rooftops
we have been promoting the planting of greenery on jr east station and office building rooftops with the
aim of reducing the heat island effect and decreasing the need for air conditioning. as of the end of march
2014, we had completed 73 greening projects (including some cases of moss planting) encompassing a
combined rooftop area of approximately 25,173 m2.

rooftop greening by jr group companies
we have been promoting rooftop greening to make station buildings in the metropolitan area a place of
relaxation for community residents as well as for office workers. the“soradofarm”  , which is a vegetable
farm rented to subscribers and built alongside the gardens, serves to create a local community, and
provides education in farming and environment through people’      s experience in cultivating vegetables.
these are popular among many customers and have also been built in ebisu, ogikubo, takasaki and
hachioji.

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions of laws and regulations, saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important. we work hard on reducing energy consumption through physical measures, including the
introduction of highly efficient equipment and facilities, and operational measures, including temperature
management of air conditioning and diligently turning off lights.
in addition, given the concerns about energy supply and demand since the great east japan earthquake,
we have been actively introducing led lighting apparatus, which is particularly effective as a physical
measure.




environmentally friendly and energy efficient office buildings
construction was completed in fy2013 on the jr minami shinjuku building, jr kanda manseibashi
building, and jp tower, which are all environmentally friendly and energy efficient buildings. the jr kanda
manseibashi building and jp tower have acquired a class s rating, the highest rating under the casbee
environmental labeling system, an initiative of the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism.
moreover, last fiscal year the jr kanda manseibashi building earned both leed-cs gold and leed-ci
gold certification, widely recognized building performance standards in the u.s. six other buildings - gran
tokyo south tower, gran tokyo north tower, jr shinagawa east building, sapia tower, jr tokyu meguro
building and tokyo building – have received praise for proactive efforts for highly efficient equipment
performance and operations management relating to energy conservation. they have also earned
recognition as offices taking excellent specific global warming countermeasures (top-level office building
or quasi top-level office building) under the tokyo metropolitan ordinance on environmental preservation.

visualizing the power consumption in stations
jr east is introducing monitors that display the energy consumed in stations to encourage employees to
be more conscious of energy saving. the visualization system measures the total electricity consumed in
the station at the power-receiving location and displays it on a monitor every hour. it was introduced in
about 30 stations by fy2013, and in 170 stations during fy2014.

 measures to create a sound material cycle
 waste reduction and recycling
 jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations, including daily trash removed from
 trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers. in addition, restaurants
 and retail stores in our life-style businesses produce garbage and general waste.
 in order to reduce all these various forms of waste, jr east actively supports the approach known as
“reduce, reuse, recycle.”for recycling in particular, goals are set for each type of waste.



                                                                            ☆
 recycling waste collected from stations and trains
 in the fiscal year ended march 2014, 94% of the trash collected from stations and trains was recycled.
 since trash from stations and trains contains recyclable materials, we first placed separation bins
 in stations. we then established recycling centers in ueno, omiya and shin-kiba for more rigorous
 separation. in october 2010, to further improve recycling rates, we consolidated the recycling centers in
 ueno and shin-kiba and built the jr east tokyo materials recycling center (operated by east japan eco
 access co., ltd.).

recycling at general rolling stock centers
jr east group is recycling waste generated during the manufacture and maintenance of rolling stock.
at our regional general rolling stock centers, waste is sorted into 20 to 30 categories to reduce waste
generation and promote recycling. starting in fy2006, we have been collecting data on the volume of
retired railcars that are sold as scrap to be recycled so as to monitor the progress.

reducing waste at offices
in departments at the head office and branch offices, we strive to reduce waste by promoting elimination
of paper and by recycling, including the use of creative, employee-designed trash cans. in fy2014, we
recycled 2,302 tons out of a total of 2,621 tons of waste (88%).

efficient use of water resources
as a consumer of 11.48 million m3 of water annually, jr east actively promotes the use of recycled waste
water*, using, for example, rainwater and water already used for washing hands to flush toilets. at the
head office building, 25 thousand m3 out of 36 thousand m3 of water was reused in fy2014.
* recycled waste water: defined as water of a quality level between clean water and sewage water. it is used for limited purposes as a
  recycled resource.

reducing and recycling tickets
collected used tickets are sent to a paper mill. after the iron powder has been separated from the backs
of the tickets, the paper is recycled to make toilet paper and corrugated cardboard. in fy2014, all of the
345 tons of collected tickets were recycled. collected magnetic season tickets were recycled into solid
fuel.




                                           used tickets collected at stations are recycled into

promoting green procurement
jr east is developing ecological promotion activities compatible with both business activities and
environmental preservation, and in promoting as part of those efforts the procurement of products
with lower environmental impact, formulated the“jr east green procurement guidelines”in 1999 –
outlined within these guidelines is our philosophy with regard to materials, conservation of resources,
and packaging. additionally, when considering selection of a new material supplier, we investigate that
company’   s environmental and csr activities, and this information is used to help evaluate potential
suppliers.
furthermore, toward promoting the procurement of environmentally friendly office supplies, the jr east
group has established the goal of“100% green procurement”    , and successfully achieved this objective in
fy2014. through activities toward green procurement, jr east promotes the formulation of a recycling-
oriented society.

recycling trash within the company
jr east promotes in-company recycling of trash generated at stations.
magazines, newspapers and similar paper items collected from our segregated trash boxes at stations
and trains are being recycled into coated paper and stationery and used in our offices.




          newspapers and other papers collected in stations and elsewhere are recycled into office paper used by our
          company.




recycling waste pet bottles into civil engineering materials
jr east has constructed a recycling system that produces resin weed-barrier sheets (product name:
nakusa r-pet) by recycling the pet (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles discarded in stations and trains.
the main ingredient for resin weed-barrier sheets used to be polyethylene, but jr east has developed and
commercialized a weed-barrier sheet composed mainly of waste pet bottles after tests were successful.

biodiversity
hometown forestation program
in 2004, in order to protect biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society, while cherishing our
sense of gratitude to nature, we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native to each
region and revitalize the forests.
we undertook these programs with the cooperation of fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and with
the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the towns of tsunanmachi and tokamachi in 2010. in addition,
in other areas served by jr east, we are planting trees that are native to the areas and we shall continue
to do the same in the future.

forest development along railway lines
beginning in 1992, we have been organizing tree planting activities along jr east railway lines. by fy2014
a total of approximately 47 thousand people had participated in planting about 324 thousand trees.
today, planting has gone beyond the trackside and is done in cooperation with local communities.



development of railway trees
along some jr east railway lines, we have planted railway trees to shield the tracks from blowing snow
and wind. the first railway trees were created in 1893 for disaster prevention. as living disaster prevention
facilities, railway forests are playing their roles.
jr east now owns approximately 5.8 million railway trees on a total of about 4,000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1,200 locations. the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2 , equivalent to 0.6% of
the co2 that jr east emits. in this way, they also contribute to preserving the environment.
in 2008, after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints of both disaster
prevention and environmental preservation, we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years.

railway trees─from single to multi-variety forests
traditionally, railway trees were of a single variety, primarily cedar trees, because another function, in
addition to protecting against natural disasters, was to generate profits through the production of timber.
this has recently been less successful, however, as the demand for domestic timber has declined. in
future tree replacement, we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient.

planting new railway trees
ceremonies for the planting of new railway trees were held in the kakizaki no. 1 railway forest between
kakizaki and yoneyama on the shin-etsu main line on september 27, 2008, in the oitama no. 2 forest on
the ou main line between oitama and takahata on july 26, 2009, in the jinguji no. 2 railway forest on
the ou main line between jinguji and kariwano on may 22, 2010, and in the okama no.1 railway forest
on the tazawako line on september 29, 2012, and in the sekine no. 1 railway forest on the ou main line
between sekine and yonezawa on september 28, 2013. with kind advice and guidance from ecologist
and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university, several varieties of native trees
(potential natural vegetation, or pnv) were selected and planted. many local residents and participants
from organized tours took part in the ceremonies, and discovered how the trees they planted would grow
to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities.

basic thoughts on noise reduction
improvement of the environment along railways: basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains, noise is created by the train cars moving through the air, by the wheels
travelling on the rails, by the motors, and by other sources. in order to reduce noise, we are working in
various ways to improve both the trains and our ground equipment.
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the lineside environment.



measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government’         s environmental quality standards for shinkansen
superexpress railway noise, jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise, such as the installation
of soundproof walls and sound-absorbent materials, rail grinding*1 and the modification of our railcars to
operate more quietly. we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels
to 75 db or lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines, and we plan to take
further steps by expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower.
also, with the introduction of e5 series railcars, which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansen“fastech”test train, jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed, including further reduction of noise and micro-pressure waves in tunnels*2.
*1 rail grinding: a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them. this reduces noise by controlling car
   vibration.
*2 micro-pressure waves in tunnels: an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced.




                                         e5 series trains have low-noise pantographs




measures for conventional lines
we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise, installing long rails*1 and
performing rail-grinding and wheel-truing*2. we also comply with the japanese government’      s policy on
noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or large-scale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines.
*1 installing long rails: rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters. with fewer rail joints, these
   rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass.
*2 wheel truing: a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear, to restore their circular shape.




measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night, we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas. we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment that produces lower noise. furthermore, by using track that is designed to
resist deformation, jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work.




                                                                       38

improvement of the environment along railway lines
restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines. while we generally remove
them manually, we also use a certain amount of herbicide. we keep the usage of herbicides to a
minimum in both volume and range of use. when selecting herbicides for use, we select those from the
safest of the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals, and from category a, the safest of the five
levels of toxicity to fish.
we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding environment
to a minimum, as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on the
scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying.



harmony with the landscape
given that construction of a large-scale railway facility or its remodeling greatly affects the local area
and surrounding environment, jr east endeavors to harmonize its completed facilities with surrounding
landscapes and natural environments. in the fiscal year ended in march 2012, agatsumagawa bridge no.
3 received the tanaka award (for excellent bridge work or bridge engineering) from the japan society
of civil engineers, in recognition of a landscape in harmony with the surrounding environment and the
national road parallel to the bridge. our efforts are indeed well recognized outside of the company.

chemical substance management
compliance with laws and regulations and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances, the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered. the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values, but sets its
own ambitious targets as well. as much as possible, we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
substitutes that have less impact on the environment.



                                                                                                               ☆
reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment.
・ large heat exchangers (large cooling units)−having steadily replaced air conditioning units using
  specified chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) with systems that do not use them, we completed the removal of
  such units from buildings by the end of fy2008.
• rolling stock−except for some diesel railcars, all of our cars use cfc substitutes. as of the end of
  fy2014, we were using 1.2 tons of cfcs and 88 tons of cfc substitutes. we routinely check for gas
  leaks, and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws
  and regulations.
• fire-extinguishing agent−although 66 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fire-extinguishing agent as of
  the end of fy2014, we have it under proper control and are replacing it with non-halon agents (such as
  powder agents and co2) when building new facilities or renovating existing ones.




                                                                    ☆
chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars, we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent spills. we are a company that handles a certain
amount of specified chemical substances, and 15 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the
release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in fy2014, pursuant to the prtr system.*
we have also been introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting. at the end of fy2014,
as many as 83% of the 10,894 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars.
beside their use for railcars, we used 575 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in fy2014.
* prtr system: a system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the prtr law. it
  encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative
  impact on the environment.

 creating an environment-conscious culture
 jr east believes that it is important to promote environmental activities with clear goals established for
 the entire jr east group, and to have every employee actively involved. to build a culture in which all
 employees participate voluntarily, we are expanding the scale of our environmental activities by promoting
“jr east eco activities”at each work place, developing leaders through environmental education, and
 sharing recognition of outstanding environmental efforts through the presentation of awards.




                                                                     42

in-house environmental education
for effective environmental management, it is essential that all employees have appropriate knowledge
on environmental issues. we provide environmental education lectures to our employees in training in
order to develop environmental activities in jr east and group companies. through these lectures, we
aim to expand the scale of our environmental activities. in fy2007, to enhance environmental activities at
each group company, we began an“environmental management training”program for people in charge
of environmental matters in those companies.

thorough management of chemical substances
jr east is working to establish a system to prevent environmental accidents by more rigidly managing
chemical substances. we prepared emergency response manuals for on-site locations such as our thermal
power plants and general rolling stock centers that handle chemical and hazardous substances. we are
also preparing ourselves to respond properly to any contingencies by holding workshops and training
sessions on how to handle these substances, and ensuring that related information reaches all concerned
personnel.


compliance with environmental laws and regulations
there were no major violations of environment-related laws and regulations resulting in penalties in
fy2014.

environmental accounting and management indicators

using environmental management indicators
in fy2014, our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately 130 billion yen in
investments and 12.7 billion yen in expenses.
of these investments, costs for global environmental conservation, which accounted for a large portion,
were at the same level as the previous year because we continued acquiring new railcars.
by introducing these new cars, we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 249 thousand tons during
their service lives.
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts. these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions, which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts, by operating profits, which represent our economic value added.
a smaller value of the indicator means that we are making a smaller impact on the environment to create
the same economic value added. for fy2014 the value of the indicator was 6.55t-co 2 /million yen,
compared with 9.45t-co2 /million yen for fy1991.

yokohama branch office
in fy2014, the yokohama branch office introduced led lighting on platforms at stations along the
yokohama line, encouraged environmental awareness by exhibiting eco-cap art (art made from used
plastic bottle caps), and undertook other activities to enhance the environment and service quality, mainly
at workplaces along the yokohama line. we are looking ahead for additional ways to draw attention to
environmental protection and improvement, both internally and externally.



overview of key activities
・ the ecological promotion committee of the higashi kanagawa operation section and conductor’     s office
  led efforts to create a new yokohama line train design featuring eco-cap art, and to conduct ecological
  pr. (art using pet bottle caps was created at a public event about the e233 series on the yokohama
  line).
・ the yokohama line became the model for introduction of led platform illumination. （all platforms along
  the line are scheduled to receive led illumination, a higher standard that will increase value along
  the line, and by the end of fy2014, 2,837 bulbs had been installed at 13 stations between higashi
  kanagawa and hashimoto.)
・ at higashi kanagawa station, the introduction of led illumination on the platform made it possible to
  create signs to ensure that passengers board the correct train.（the sign is in green on the yokohama
  line side of the platform, and in blue on the keihin tohoku line side.）

accumulator system
as a new measure toward reduction of the environmental burden in non-electric zones,
we developed an experimental train, ne train smart denchi kun, featuring a battery
drive train system. the result of our efforts was the start of operation of the ev-e301
(accum) train on the karasuyama line in march 2014. the ev-e301 series cars have an
accumulator for the main circuit, enabling them to operate in non-electrified zones. on
electrified sections, the train raises its pantograph to receive power for operation and for
charging the accumulator. when the train enters a non-electrified zone, the pantograph
is lowered and the train operates on accumulated power alone. when the brakes are
applied, regenerated power is used to charge the accumulator, which can also be
recharged at terminal stations where rapid-recharging facilities have been installed.
the introduction of the ev-e301 series has made possible the elimination of exhaust
emissions and reductions in co2 and noise emission levels from those generated by
diesel engines.

large-scale solar power generation facility
jr east launched operation of its first large-scale solar power generation facility – with
an output capacity of 1,050kw – on the grounds of the keiyo rolling stock center on
february 28, 2014. the electricity generated will be used at the center, and will also
help to operate trains by sending power to overhead lines, with the aim of reducing our
co2 emissions. the mega-solar plant will generate about 1,000 mwh per year, and is
expected to reduce co2 emissions by about 500 tons annually.
we will begin operation of a 4mw-class large-scale solar power generation facility
between tomobe and uchihara on the joban line within fy2015. going forward, we will
look at the establishment of additional solar power generation facirities on our own sites
while contributing to the spread and promotion of renewable energy.

promoting the introduction of renewable energy
taking advantage of the beautiful natural environment of northern tohoku, while
endeavoring to reduce co 2 emissions on a broad scale through the generation of
environmentally friendly renewable energy such as solar, wind power, geothermal and
biomass, we hope to contribute to regional areas through economic revitalization as well.
we have been conducting a study of wind conditions since march 2014 between
michikawa and shimohama stations on the uetsu main line in akita prefecture, and are
currently investigating the viability of wind power generation.
also, we are a member of the hakkoda regional geothermal power study group, which
comprises hirosaki university, aomori prefecture, the city of aomori and several private
companies. the aim is to develop aomori prefecture’    s first geothermal power plant, and
to that end we are currently conducting a viability study in northwestern hakkoda.

 pursuing“extreme safety levels”
 our concept of safety
 since the establishment of jr east, safety has been our top management priority, and we have worked
 relentlessly to heighten our levels of safety. our earnest efforts to learn from unfortunate accidents in the
 past have enabled jr east to further the prevention of future accidents with our continued developments
 both in physical and operational terms.
 pursuit of safety measures can never end. we will continue to work tirelessly to improve safety by
 pursuing a goal of“zero accidents involving passenger injuries or fatalities and zero accidents involving
 employee fatalities (including employees of group companies and partner companies).”



 safety initiatives in our medium term management plan
 in the jr east group management vision v - ever onward, jr east sets its eternal mission to pursue
“extreme safety levels,”and build a railway capable of withstanding natural disasters. in order to achieve
 this, we will continue our ceaseless efforts to increase the safety of our railways.
 when the great east japan earthquake occurred, the earthquake countermeasures that jr east had
 already been steadily implementing proved effective to a great extent. however, the earthquake also
 revealed issues that we must address to ensure a higher level of safety. based on this experience, we
 have worked to implement earthquake countermeasures in preparation for events that are conceivable
 such as an earthquake directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area, and are focusing on both tangible
 and intangible aspects. in these ways, we are working to build a railway capable of withstanding natural
 disasters.
 we are also further promoting initiatives to prevent train collisions, derailments and rail crossing
 accidents. at the same time, we are installing automatic platform gates for the yamanote line and
 exploring the possibility of installation for other lines. in these and other ways, we continue to promote
 the development of railways that passengers can use reliably. from fy2015, we will also bolster activities
 aimed at achieving“extreme safety levels”based on our newly formulated group safety plan 2018.



 group safety plan 2018: our 6th 5-year safety plan
 since our establishment, jr east has continued to create and implement medium term safety plans. with
 the installation and further development of our safety equipment, along with companywide advancements
 in safety awareness and skill, we have succeeded in reducing the frequency of railway accidents
 drastically from levels at the time of the company’ s establishment. fy2015 begins our 6th 5-year safety
 plan, group safety plan 2018, aimed at expanding the individual capabilities of each employee in order
 to realize top levels of safety through teamwork. each of us involved in the railway business remains
 committed to improving safety and our group-wide challenge to achieve“extreme safety levels.”
 in group safety plan 2018, together with redefining the direction we are taking as a company, we outline
 specific measures aimed at preventing accidents resulting from internal factors. additionally, through
 our ongoing efforts to pass on technologies and promote measures to comprehensively understand the
 severity of accidents, we aim to further enhance safety management through the fostering of safety-
 conscious personnel.

in fy2014, it is regrettable that one of our related-company employees was lost in a fatal accident.
accordingly, as set out in group safety plan 2018, we will continue our efforts to ensure that safety systems
and rules are clearly defined and complied with across the entire jr east group in our aim to achieve zero
passenger accidents involving injury or fatality, and zero employee fatalities* (for both group and partner
companies).

ingraining the cultures of safety
jr east will further strengthen, deepen and broaden the cultures of safety we have been fostering as the
foundation of our safety efforts.


                            s 5 cultures of safety
ingraining the jr east group’

  ① a culture of proper reporting
    the prompt and proper reporting of accidents and incidents, and the prevention of the recurrence
    of accidents.
  ② a culture of noticing
    the recognition and sharing of information regarding the potential sources of accidents in order to
    prevent accidents and incidents.
  ③ a culture of direct meeting and discussion
    the open and honest discussion and exchange of opinion in investigating the causes of
    accidents and incidents in order to identify the causes of accidents and to take truly effective
    countermeasures against their recurrence.
  ④ a culture of learning
    the continuous awareness of others, learning from accidents and incidents which occur in all places
                            s own workplace, and the implementation of appropriate countermeasures.
    of work, not just in one’
  ⑤ a culture of action
    safety can be ensured only by taking safe actions. think and act by yourself. this is at the core of
    our safety.




further promoting the“sangen principle: three actualities principle”
accidents and incidents always occur at the genba.* this means that the sources of accident prevention
can also be found at the genba. jr east continues its search for answers which cannot be found from
desktop theories, based on the“three actualities principle”as its standard for action: actual locations,
actual objects, and actual people.
* genba:“genba”means a field or workplace, where employees actually do their physical work in construction, production, maintenance,
  operation, etc., as distinguished from management or office work, in industrial sectors, such as construction and manufacturing.




promoting the challenge safety campaign with the concerted effort of all
since the company’     s foundation, jr east has continued to shift from a passive stance of merely
maintaining safety to one that actively takes on the challenge of bringing further improvements to safety
levels through the development of our challenge safety campaign. the campaign aims to encourage each
one of our employees to actively endeavor to improve safety levels, think and discuss specific measures
with each other and act upon them. some of these measures include:
・learning from accidents and from other companies in order to heighten risk awareness of dangers and
  to improve our sense of safety.
・sharing awareness and findings such as individual experiences regarding nearly missed incidents.
・visiting actual sites and image training in order to expose matters of concern.

enhancing safety management
fostering integral safety leaders and professionals
through the fostering of key safety leaders and safety professionals, jr east aims to pass on its safety
technologies and knowledge to the next generations of workers. furthermore, we endeavor to pursue
measures which allow us to deeply comprehend the gravity of accidents and to minimize human error.

director general from railway operations headquarters. the committee reviews the organization’        s
basic policies to respond to and prevent accidents, and promotes safety measures within the railway
business. there are also regional safety promotion committees at each branch office and the shinkansen
transport dept., chaired by the general managers of the branch offices and the department. these

head office safety campaign
every year, jr east operates a head office safety campaign. the campaign provides the president and
executive officers from the head office with a chance to visit field offices and hold direct discussions with
front-line employees, including those at partner and cooperating companies.
in fy2014, executive officers from the jr east head office inspected nighttime maintenance work as
observers, and participated with front-line employees in impassioned discussions on the theme of
protecting the lives of customers and employees through the strict management of every part of every
job: referencing past measures in deciding upon what was necessary for the consistent implementation of
each basic task. through these activities, jr east was able to reconfirm issues and areas of concern with
field staff in order to steadily conduct the basic work at field organizations.
based on the outcomes of these activities, jr east was able to identify specific measures to protect the
lives of its customers and employees, encouraging each employee to think and to act independently and
flexibly.



collaboration with group companies
the jr east safety network (jes-net) was established in fy2005 as a safety promotion network among
jr east group and partner companies that are engaged in work directly affecting train operations.
as of april 1st, 2014, the number of companies in this network had expanded to 36. each year, through
observation and inspection, jr east holds a safety review for the exchange of opinions and a confirmation
of the safety measures at jes-net member companies. in the safety reviews, jr east recognizes the
positive measures of each of the companies, and introduces these successful measures to other
companies so that they can also benefit from the success. jr east is committed to improving the levels of
safety throughout the jr east group.

safety education and training
to improve the skills of train crews, accident prevention simulator training is conducted regularly in
the general training centers in each of our branch offices. at the jr east general education center in
shirakawa city, fukushima prefecture, we train both drivers and conductors, and provide human resource
development in the form of knowledge and technical proficiency. the accident history exhibition hall was

in fy2015, we will newly construct a train accident preservation center for the preservation of actual
trains damaged in accidents or disasters in order to comprehensively understand the events.

chroniclers of safety (narrators of oral history)
in fy2010, we organized a group of ex-employees of jr who possessed an abundance of knowledge and
applied skills in railway safety to act as our“chroniclers of safety (narrators of oral history).”currently,
chronicler of safety seminars are being conducted by a group of eight of these chroniclers at head office
and branch offices, in the hope that they will pass their accumulated experiences and skills down to
future generations.

railway safety symposium
the theme for the railway safety symposium was based on the concept that“each one should expand
our capabilities to create safety through teamwork.”the symposium was attended by approximately 430
people, and served as the venue to introduce jr east’  s group safety plan 2018. the company presented
its road map for steadily executing its new safety plan and illustrated how the plan reflected its activities
based on the 2013 safety vision.

 promoting the priority improvement plan for safety equipment
 investment in safety equipment for“extreme safety levels”
 to achieve a more assured level of safety in railway operations, weak points in the current systems
 must be identified and reviewed from a safety standpoint. furthermore, safety equipment must undergo
 intensive and effective assessments in order to prevent the occurrence of accidents in the future. jr east
 analyses and evaluates all potential areas of risk and takes appropriate measures to ensure that these
 risks do not become reality, placing priority on facility investments in order to avert any major damage in
 the case of a major earthquake in the tokyo metropolitan area.
 for improvements to safety equipment, under our five previous 5-year safety plans leading up to fy2014,
 jr east invested more than 3 trillion yen during those 27 years following the company’      s establishment.
 in our group safety plan 2018, jr east’   s sixth 5-year safety plan which began in fy2015, jr east has
 planned to invest approximately 1 trillion yen on safety measures during the five years from fy2015 to
 fy2019.

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains, jr east has installed ats (automatic train stop) and atc (automatic
train control) systems on all of its railway lines. to heighten the current safety level of train operations
even further, we are installing ats-p and ats-ps systems, which employ continuous speed monitoring
functions. the number of installations is steadily increasing; most are in the tokyo metropolitan area.
by the end of march 2014, the ats-p system had been installed on 2,406.1 km of railway line. the ats-
ps system is currently installed on 210.5 km of line in the sendai and niigata regions and at 64 stations.
additionally, jr east replaced the ats-ps on the section of the senseki line between aoba-dori and
higashi-shiogama with its advanced train administration and communications system (atacs), a radio-
controlled train operation control system, in october of 2011.
in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006,
we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at curves, turnouts, and terminals, and on
descending grades. planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010.

introduction of the advanced train administration and communications system (atacs):
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions. by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and on-board facilities, the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by on-board equipment, permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals, connecting cables, and track circuits, which are currently used for the detection of trains.
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions.
jr east began using the atacs system in october 2011 on the senseki line between aoba-dori and
higashi-shiogama. in december 2012, as one of our 2nd stage functions, jr east released a new function
for setting provisional speed limits. from 2014 onwards, we plan to release another new function for
controlling road traffic at level crossings.

systemization of maintenance work
when starting maintenance work on railway tracks, jr east works to ensure the safety of its trains and
maintenance workers by following procedures to set signals to red, so that trains do not enter sections of
railway where maintenance work is being conducted. in the past, this was done mainly via telephone from
maintenance workers to stations. however, in order to prevent any occurrence of error, including human
error, jr east adopted a method for maintenance workers to operate handheld devices to change signals
to red, and the devices have since been introduced to major railway sections in the tokyo metropolitan
area. in the future, jr east aims to continue its efforts to improve the safety of its operations through the
systemization of its maintenance work in other railway sections as well.

introduction of“effective rainfall”as a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall, we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and, when necessary, by suspension of operations. for operational restrictions on conventional
lines, we have been using hourly rainfall*1 and continuous precipitation*2 as our indices. since june 2008,
we have been using“effective rainfall”as a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall. effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes
over time in ground penetration and outflow. using this indicator, we can more precisely predict the
occurrence of landslide disasters, improving the safety and reliability of our train operations.
*1: hourly rainfall: the total rainfall over a one-hour period
*2: continuous precipitation: the total continuous rainfall over a 12-hour period

measures to prevent accidents at rail crossings
when the company was established in 1987, there were 247 accidents during the year at rail crossings
with roads. in fy2014, the number had been drastically reduced to 36. approximately 60% of all rail-
crossing accidents involve automobiles. we have installed devices such as obstacle detectors, which are
capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping trains, and
we have increased the number of crossing warning devices in a higher position for better visibility. larger
crossing gates have been installed; the barrier arms are thicker than usual. these are expected to provide
better visibility day and night. we are also promoting a wide range of public relations activities for the
prevention of rail crossing accidents, appealing to drivers for their cooperation and understanding.
in addition, for countermeasures against secondary accidents resulting from derailments at level crossings
with roads, derailment prevention guards have been installed at these crossings. the long-term solution
is to decrease the number of rail crossings, and we are cooperating with local governments, neighboring
residents, and the police to increase the number of overhead crossings.
as examples of our most recent efforts, in 2005 jr east began working to improve safety at the sojiji
temple rail crossing on the tokaido line near tsurumi station, where there had been more trouble than
at other rail crossings in the tokyo area, because it is on a curve with limited visibility. the overhead
pedestrian crossing was rebuilt to be barrier-free and in fy2011 the rail crossing was closed during
rush hours. closed hours were extended to between 6:00 and 21:00 in fy2012, and, as a result of our
agreements with concerned parties, from april 1, 2012, this rail crossing has been closed to road traffic at
all times.
learning lessons from an accident at a rail crossing on the iiyama line between morimiyanohara and
ashidaki on february 1, 2011, jr east has introduced a rule to stop trains at stations when the warning
signals at a crossing are being activated due to causes such as equipment failures, and when pedestrians
and automobiles are allowed to use the crossing, to ensure that train operations do not endanger
pedestrians or automobiles. jr east also formulated a procedure for field staff to prevent failures in safety
confirmation.

station platform safety
in fy2014, there were 88 accidents in which customers fell from platforms onto tracks or came into
contact with trains. jr east is installing protection-related devices, including emergency train-stop systems,
on our platforms to ensure customer safety. customer awareness and cooperation are also vital to safety
on our platforms, and we are implementing our“zero platform accident campaign”through posters, as a
measure to heighten this awareness.
as a major measure to prevent accidents involving customers on platforms, jr east is introducing
automatic platform gates on the yamanote line. in fy2014, we started the use of these gates at otsuka,
sugamo, komagome, shin-okubo, mejiro, takadanobaba, and tamachi stations. in fy2015, we plan to
install these gates at okachimachi, uguisudani, tabata, yurakucho, harajuku, gotanda, and nishi nippori
stations. with the exception of six stations, shinagawa, hamamatsucho, shimbashi, shibuya, shinjuku,
and tokyo stations, which require large-scale improvement work, we plan to complete installations at
all stations on the line by fy2016. for routes other than the yamanote line, we plan to install automatic
platform gates mainly at stations used frequently by visually challenged customers, while discussing these
matters with concerned organizations.
for stations where the daily number of passengers exceeds 100,000, jr east is currently working to install
an increased number of dot-braille blocks that indicate which direction is away from the edge of the
platform.

measures against earthquakes
measures learned from past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past, jr east has employed the following three anti-earthquake
measures:
① stopping trains immediately (emergency train stop measures)
② preventing structural damage (seismic reinforcement measures)
③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment (preventive measures against derailed trains
  leaving the track area)


① stopping trains immediately (emergency train stop measures)
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors (p-waves). our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected.
from august 2012, to be better prepared for possible earthquakes, jr east additionally installed and
started using seismometers at 30 locations for earthquakes with epicenters directly beneath the tokyo
metropolitan area and those in inland sections of its service area. in october 2012, jr east began using
earthquake early warning from the japan meteorological agency. for conventional lines, our early
earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan area in december 2007 and in all
other areas in april 2009. the system enables trains in any section of tracks to be stopped in the case
of a major earthquake, utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen seismographs and from any
advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency.


② preventing structural damage (seismic reinforcement measures)
in response to the 1995 great hanshin-awaji earthquake, jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures. by the end of march 2008, we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen
viaduct support columns and shinkansen bridge columns. on our conventional lines, by the end of march
2009 we had reinforced all other columns in the southern kanto and sendai areas except in places that
required additional construction work. currently, we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible
to failure due to bending by strong earthquake motion, aiming to further improve our safety levels
against earthquakes. beginning in fy2013, to prepare for a possible earthquake directly beneath the
tokyo metropolitan area, we have been making seismic reinforcement of embankments, cuttings, brick
arch viaducts, electrical poles and other infrastructure. other initiatives include countermeasures against
collapse of station ceilings and walls and platform roofs and preparing advanced plans for the seismic
reinforcement of viaduct support columns and bridge columns. based on experience derived from the
great east japan earthquake, we will proceed with the seismic reinforcement of railway station buildings
serving more than 3,000 passengers per day, along with the seismic reinforcement of shinkansen
electrical poles.



③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment
  (preventive measures against derailed trains leaving the track area)
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004, one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running. fortunately, this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crew.
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake, jr east has taken several measures for our
shinkansen trains and tracks. for our railcars, we have installed an l-shaped car guide on the bogies
to restrict lateral movement of the car body. by august 2008, we had completed the installation of
l-shaped car guides on all shinkansen railcars. for ground facilities, we are currently improving the shape
of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of derailment, and implementing
countermeasures to prevent the overturning and lateral movement of rails if metal rail fasteners are
damaged by a derailed train. we implemented all planned measures for all shinkansen sections in
fy2012.

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25, 2005, the limited express train inaho no.14 derailed between sagoshi and kita-
amarume stations near the no. 2 mogami-gawa bridge. we would like to report on the measures we
have taken since this accident.


increased number of anemometers (wind meters)
jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita-
amarume stations. in addition, for sections with operational restrictions when there are strong winds, we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed. by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions
on sections of railway lines, using information from front-line employees, topography, and wind conditions
of the areas, and adding new operation restriction sections, we are working to improve our safety
observation network to counter the effects of these strong winds. with this reinforcement, since the
accident, jr east has installed a total of 622 anemometers for its conventional and shinkansen lines,
and as of march 31, 2014 we had 939 anemometers installed: 781 on conventional lines and 158 on
shinkansen lines.

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds, but
also when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits. jr east has installed gale warning
systems in all of the 299 locations on its conventional lines with gale operational restrictions.


introduction of a method to properly assess the effect of wind force on railcars for
operational restrictions
the effect of wind force on railcars is constantly changing. for this reason, jr east has been studying
methods to properly assess the effects of wind on railcars and utilize the results to more accurately
impose operational restrictions for increased safety in train operations. together with consideration for
the opinions of experts in the field, jr east has been studying the following:
① more accurate methods of wind observation using anemometers.
② calculation methods for the yield strength of railcars against wind through consideration of track
   conditions and car body shape.
jr east introduced each of these new methods to some sections of the uetsu main line, the keiyo line,
and the echigo line, and the second measure to all sections of the ominato line.


utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena, and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers. through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar, and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds, we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of
local gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions. from fy2008, the system was
tested during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line
between niigata and shibata. on february 17, 2009, we added the system to sections of the uetsu main
line, shin-etsu main line, echigo line, yahiko line, and riku-u west line for additional testing. additionally
from fy2013, we have added the japan meteorological agency’          s nowcast that supports detection of
tornados as a condition for issuing alarms for our train operations.
during this 7 year period of testing, though we initiated train operational restrictions for a total of 20 days,
we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts.


research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts, as information to be used for operational restrictions. doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts.
since 2007, we have been conducting local gust observations using a doppler radar installed at amarume
station on the uetsu main line. in 2010, we constructed a prototype of the local gust detection system
and began real-time local gust detection experiments. we plan to continue our experimental monitoring
with this system, conducting validations and improvements, and further advancing our research on the
potential applicability of the system for train operation restrictions.

relationship with customers

                       service quality reform

service quality
jr east sets“service quality reform”as one of the eternal missions in its“jr east group management
vision v,”and views the reform as an important pillar in business management. in order to become a
group that is chosen by customers and local communities, jr east will strive to reform service quality with
a cross-divisional and cross-sectional teamwork to attain the highest customer satisfaction unequaled in
the railway industry. specifically, we will further improve our“transport quality”by preventing transport
disruptions, resuming train operation quickly after disruptions, minimizing the effects of disruptions and
enhancing information communication. we will also improve the economic situation of every lineside area,
will offer services which elderly customers can use comfortably, and ensure that we have a customer-
friendly railway service through various measures to prevent injuries and crimes.




    quality services that reassure customers

prevention of transport disruptions, early resumption of operations after transport
disruptions and prevention of disruptions to connecting lines
we are implementing various measures to improve transport quality by striving to prevent transport
disruptions and by stepping up early resumption of operations after transport disruptions, as well as
preventing disruptions impacting on connecting lines.
we continue to implement expanded introduction of railcars with dual systems* and installation of track
switches of next-generation design making equipment failure less likely, measures to prevent lightning
strike damage to electric facilities and other disruption countermeasures.
for early resumption of operations, we maintain efforts to enhance our post-disruption response abilities
by such measures as drills to deal with accidents resulting in casualties and rescuing passengers. notably,
concerning accidents resulting in casualties, cooperation with police and fire services is important and
we thus implement drills, etc. for employees jointly with police and fire services on a regular basis. in
addition, we try to turn trains back before they enter the disrupted section or operate other routes
wherever possible in an effort to minimize the impact on customers.
when a disruption has occurred, each worksite involved reflects on how it was dealt with, learns the
lessons from this, and uses the knowledge to study and implement measures to prevent recurrences,
which are then widely disseminated in-house to raise the level of each and every employee.
* railcars with dual systems: railcars with increased reliability through duplication of major equipment.

 information enhancement
 for better information provision in an emergency, jr east is taking steps to provide our customers with
 more accurate information by having the anticipated time at which operations should resume announced
 within ten minutes of a suspension of operations following an accident that caused casualties, and giving
 subsequent updates depending on the situation. in addition, as tools for providing transport information,
 we continued to install emergency information displays (installed at 186 stations as of march 2014), as
 well as enhancing display functions, such as displaying in four languages and showing information on
 turnback operations, disruptions on other lines and other events. we also provide information through
 various media, such as onboard led and liquid crystal displays, the jr east and other websites, and the
 contents of cell phone carriers.
 in addition, on our website, we commenced distribution of information on service suspensions of
 conventional line limited express trains, etc. and extended the time that delay certificates can be issued
 on major lines in the tokyo metropolitan area. furthermore, for smartphones, we commenced“jr east
 train operation information push notification,”a service for notifying information on train operations on
 our conventional and shinkansen lines. for 12 lines in the tohoku area, we started operating“doko-train,”
 a train operation information service that enables customers to confirm the operating status of individual
 trains by using their computers or smartphones.

 suicide prevention measures
 along with such measures as supporting npos in their efforts to prevent suicides, we handed out
 free pocket tissues, which contained a card with information about the“inochi no denwa”telephone
 counseling service, around major stations in the tokyo metropolitan area on september 10, 2013
 in conjunction with“suicide prevention week”set by the japanese government and“world suicide
 prevention day.”
 in addition, we carried out a suicide prevention campaign named“jr east ♥ life assisting month”in
 conjunction with the japanese government’       s“suicide prevention enhancement month”in march 2014.
 during this period, we informed people about consultation services, etc. through posters, operated
“support life trains,”introduced“inochi no hotline”(telephone counseling service in collaboration
 with the federation of inochi no denwa inc.) and conducted a“personal greeting”campaign, in which
 former jr east employees and consultants of japanese association of mental health services, a non-profit
 organization, jointly patrol stations and talk to customers.

  pursuit of customer-friendly railway services

baby stroller safety measures
to increase safety for customers with baby strollers who use our stations and trains, we have been
working to improve the detection ability of railcar doors in the event that baby stroller frames, etc. get
caught. in addition, supporting the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism’s baby stroller
campaign, we have been putting up posters, etc. from may 2014 to urge customers with baby strollers
to be careful, as well as asking customers with baby strollers and other customers to give way to each
other when boarding trains. we also collaborated with the tokyo metropolitan government and railway
companies in kanto region in holding a“safe use of baby stroller class in teppaku”at the railway
museum on may 20, 2014 in which about 1,000 visitors took part and enjoyed learning about safe
railway use of baby strollers.

escalator safety measures
to prevent injuries to customers when they use escalators, we are carrying out safety enhancements,
including measures that will prevent sandals from getting caught, prevent falls during emergency stops,
and prevent steps from descending when escalators stop. in addition, we are also working together with
other railway companies, retailers and other facilities to carry out campaigns in an effort to draw the
attention of customers through such means as posters and handing out free pocket tissues that call for
the safe and proper use of escalators.
campaigns have been underway since july 2014, continuing an ongoing effort, to concentrate people’       s
attention upon the proper use of escalators and upon caring for those customers who, due to injury or
various other reasons, are able to stand only on the right side of the escalator steps, which are normally
used by people who are walking while on the escalator. we are trying to make the content easily
understood by all ages from young to old. in addition to railway operators, this time those involved with
office buildings, shopping centers and the jr east group are collaborating in the production and use of
these campaign posters, due to the area coverage of corporate partners being expanded nationwide in
the campaigns.

personal greetings campaign
we have a campaign in which our employees personally greet all customers in need, including those
customers with disabilities, elderly customers and others who require particular attention, to make sure
that they can use our stations and other facilities safely and with a sense of security. the purpose of this
campaign is to inspire society as a whole to watch out for and support such people with special needs.
our employees are instructed to greet and support, to the extent possible, when they spot customers
who may need special care. this campaign is being expanded to include employees of other jr east
group companies as well as our own employees.




                                                   “personal greetings”campaign




service managers
jr east staff at major stations includes service managers who make rounds of stations and are in position
to assist elderly customers and those not used to traveling. they provide relevant and timely information
and guidance and other fine-tuned services, using tablet computer terminals, in times of emergency as
well as during regular operations. (as of april 1, 2014, we have 179 service managers, and they serve at
50 stations.)



hospitality
we have also encouraged our employees to qualify themselves for service assistance certification, with
the aim of instilling in them a spirit of hospitality. as of the end of march 2014, approximately 9,500
employees had received level two certification.



barrier-free stations
jr east has been working with local governments and other entities to install elevators at stations in
accordance with the barrier-free transportation law. as of the end of march 2014 we had completed the
installation of elevators in 517 stations.

barrier-free railcars
to improve accessibility for persons with vision impairments, in the fiscal year ended march 2006 we
installed braille maps and stickers indicating the passenger’ s current location and the locations of various
facilities on all shinkansen trains. on conventional lines we also are placing braille stickers identifying car
numbers and door locations.
in december 2006, the new universal design e233 series railcars started being introduced sequentially
to the chuo rapid, keihin-tohoku, keiyo, tokaido and saikyo lines. spacious toilet rooms capable of
accommodating advanced electric wheelchairs with handles were introduced on new narita express e259
series cars in october 2009; on the new high-speed shinkansen e5 series“hayabusa”in march 2011; on
the new limited-express e657 series trains on the joban line in march 2012; on the new akita shinkansen
e6 series railcars in march 2013; and on the hokuriku shinkansen e7 series railcar in march 2014.




placement of automated external defibrillators (aeds)
aeds are medical electroshock devices for the treatment of ventricular fibrillation caused by cardiac
arrest. the devices have been widely used in the united states and europe since around 2000. jr east
has been placing aeds near ticket gates at stations that have many customers, and, as of the end of
march 2014, 375 stations have been equipped with one or more aeds (528 aeds in total). in addition,
we started placing aeds on shinkansen trains in february 2009; on new narita express trains in october
2009; on nikko kinugawa trains in june 2011; and on new limited express trains of series e657 on the
joban line in march 2012. there were 181 aed units installed on trains as of march 31, 2014.




improvements in station toilets
in order to dispel the image of station toilets as dark, dirty, and malodorous and to enable customers to
be able to use them comfortably, since its establishment jr east has been steadily upgrading its toilet
facilities.
measures taken include a change to western-style toilets, improved ventilation and the use of larger floor
tiles. the upgrading also includes water-saving type toilets and automatic faucets in the washbasins, to
reduce water consumption.
during this fiscal year ending march 2015, we will renovate the toilets in approximately 10 more stations,
as a way to increase customer comfort and satisfaction.

measures against female molestation
in addition to adding women-only cars during certain hours, and with the aim of enabling female
passengers to travel stress-free, we have been installing sos buttons on major tokyo metropolitan area
lines that women can use to alert train crews if they are improperly touched or otherwise molested.
furthermore, in cooperation with police and other railway operators we are actively conducting a
campaign to eliminate on-train molestation and have significantly increased security surveillance on trains
and in stations. as a further step in the discouragement of female molestation, we have installed on-board
security cameras in the leading cars on all saikyo line trains.

women-only cars
in order to enhance the safety of female passengers we introduced women-only cars on the saikyo line
during late night operations (from july 2001), and then extended their use to morning rush hours (from
april 2005). currently women-only cars are also in operation during morning rush hours on the chuo
rapid line (from september 2005), the joban local line (from may 2006), the sobu local line (from
november 2006), and the keihin-tohoku and negishi lines (from april 2010).



improvement of onboard service in the new limited express trains, e657 series, on the
joban line and crime prevention measures
as part of improvement of onboard service, we are providing up-to-date information via wimax. inside
the new e657 series limited express trains that started commercial operation in march 2012, we have
installed led displays in full color showing newscasts through wimax as well as destinations and other
transport information. customers can also avail themselves of internet connections on these trains
through wimax and wifi.
as part of our crime prevention measures, in addition to car no.1 of each of the trains on the saikyo line,
surveillance cameras are installed in series e259 and e657 limited express trains on the conventional lines
and in the two-level green cars on the tokaido, tohoku, takasaki and joban lines, and in new railcars of
the e3 series in the 2000s and e5 and e6 series shinkansen railcars.



installation and usage of wimax base stations
since february 2009, uq communications inc. has been offering an internet connection service using
uq wimax. in conjunction with this service, we have been setting up wimax base stations that enable
internet connection in station concourses where connection had previously been difficult or impossible.
as of march 31, 2014, easy connections are now available at 162 stations. furthermore, taking full
advantage of the system’    s broadband capabilities, wimax is now being used to provide transport
disruption information to some station displays.



more comfortable on-board air conditioning
jr east is working on improvements to railcar air conditioning (cooling and heating) to make railway travel
more comfortable. fully-automatic air-conditioners are installed on e231, e233, e5, e6 and e7 series, etc.
on other cars, continuous efforts are being made to provide the most comfortable environments possible
by having conductors carry out frequent temperature checks, thermostat changes and other adjustments,
and by other actions appropriate for the different conditions on individual railway lines.

total smoking ban in tokyo metropolitan area stations and trains
for several years in line with customer requests and an increasing general public aversion to smoking,
jr east has worked to eliminate passive smoke. in april and october 2009 we removed all smoking
areas from platforms at major tokyo metropolitan area stations, and went one step further by initiating a
limited smoke-free station interior policy, which was widened in june 1, 2011, again in line with customer
requests. all smoking was banned on jr east’     s shinkansen and limited express trains from march 2007

transport services improvements
we are continuously striving to enhance the convenience of both shinkansen and conventional lines and
to reduce rush-hour congestion through increased frequency of operations and the introduction of wider-
bodied cars.
in march 2014, we enhanced the speed of the akita shinkansen by having all trains replaced with
the new e6 series and began operating at 320 km/h. we also enhanced convenience of the nagano
shinkansen by introducing the new e7 series ahead of the introduction planned for the opening of the
hokuriku shinkansen line to kanazawa, which is planed for spring 2015. on conventional lines,“swallow
akagi,”which has introduced a new seating service for commuters called“swallow service”to limited
express trains on the takasaki line, made its debut. we also increased the frequency of operations during
the daytime for local trains on the joban line, increased the frequency of operations during the morning
commuting hours and expanded sections of rapid express operations during the daytime on the nambu
line in the tokyo mega loop*, and implemented other measures to reduce congestion and enhance
convenience.
in the fiscal year ended march 2014 the average level of in-train congestion during morning commuting
hours was 177%, 61 percentage points below the rate in the fiscal year ended march 1988. we will
continue our efforts for reliable transport by reducing transport disruptions and by other means, to meet
customer needs.
* tokyo mega loop: the loop formed by the musashino, keiyo, nambu and yokohama lines in the tokyo metropolitan area that have many
  connections with other jr lines and lines of other railway companies.

                            customer comments
                            the core of improved quality of service in jr east has been our constant attention to customer comments,
                            and we will continue to monitor customer desires and quickly introduce service quality reforms in line
                            with their expectations. to constantly improve our services it is vital for us to listen carefully to customer
                            comments, including their interests and complaints, and then promptly respond to their requests through
                            service improvements.
                            jr east has various methods of collecting large numbers of customer comments on a daily basis, including
                            those passed directly to front-line employees, those posted on the internet, and those given over the
                            telephone. all of these comments are quickly shared and analyzed on a companywide basis, and form the
                            core of our improvements. we believe that each and every individual customer comment contributes to
                            the core of improved customer satisfaction.

prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments are considered at various levels within the company. initially, a decision as to
whether or not some action of improvement is possible is made at the level that initially received the
original customer comments. the action will reflect this decision. if action is difficult to take at that level,
then the comments are passed on to higher levels, where potential improvements can be discussed.
at the very top level, we have also established the customer comments committee, chaired by the
president, which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected
customer comments. through this system, we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved
customer services.

customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction. the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures.


railway line wayside monitors
we instituted a wayside monitors system beginning in fy2012 to gain a more specific understanding
of the needs of our customers and of the way they use our services on each of our railway lines. this
is in addition to customers’comments we receive daily and our jr east customer questionnaires. we
have recruited the monitors from among our customers who live along our railway lines, and sought their
views through questionnaires on the internet and interviews to understand their needs from different
perspectives, so that we can increase the attractiveness of living alongside or near our railway lines.
(surveyed sections: the yokohama, saikyo and keiyo lines in the fiscal year ended march 2012, the
musashino line in the fiscal year ended march 2013, the joban line in the fiscal year ended march 2014,
and the takasaki line in the fiscal year ending march 2015)


projects for improving service quality
the“service quality improvement project,”designed to identify customer needs and to promptly improve
service quality and transmit information, has begun on the musashino line and saikyo line in march 2013
and on the yokohama line in june. we will continue to work to improve service quality in light of the
needs and characteristics of each area along our railway lines, and provide information about our service
quality reforms via various media.

two-way communications
jr east considers it necessary not simply to wait for information from customers, but also to be active in
ascertaining what they really need. we therefore strive to discover their potential opinions by making use
of social media. the“jr east official facebook”  , launched in may 2012, provides information about our
various campaigns and proposals.
as the times and environment change, customers’demands change constantly. to address such changing
needs, we learn about customers’demands from their comments and use this information to develop
specific improvements. it is through such two-way communications with our customers that we endeavor
to upgrade our service quality.



sq network
due to prompt improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments, with the
entire group working as a single team, our company and group companies closely involved in transport
service established the sq (service quality) network in october 2011. the sq network holds meetings
of representatives of jr east and group companies at stations, branch offices and the head office, to share
customers’comments and devise solutions and improvements through teamwork, that goes beyond
individual departments or group companies. in this way the jr east group as a whole can dedicate itself
to enhancing customers’satisfaction.



service quality coordinator
for overall improvement of railway service quality focused on team efforts for service improvement and
for providing reliable railway transport, we stationed service quality coordinators in district and branch
offices beginning in october 2011. the coordinator’    s job is to supervise the area-wide improvement of
service quality, as well as to support and promote solution of cross-organizational problems. in this way
efforts will be made to improve service quality rapidly from the front-line field operations.



service quality meetings
to improve our service quality further with field operations, branch offices and the head office working
as a team, we instituted service quality meetings, in which senior executives from our head office visit
field operations and exchange views with field supervisors. in the fiscal year ended march 2014, with
improvement of satisfaction by each area along our railway lines set as the main theme, each branch
      s tasks were selected as sub-themes and discussions were underway on the sub-themes’status quo
office’
and problems as well as goal setting. jr east identifies the problems faced by each railway section and
area and strives to improve quality of service by means of teamwork, without being constrained by the
organizational framework of the company.

sessions and symposiums, and are working to create a workplace environment in which employees think
and act by themselves.

with the widespread use of smartphones and to be able to give timely information to meet individual
customer needs, we released the smartphone app“jr east app”on march 10, 2014.“jr east app”
allows customers to view information on our train operations, all our stations and real-time information
on the location of keihin-tohoku line trains. the app also allows customers to easily and quickly access
information on lines and stations they frequently use. in addition, customers using the yamanote line can
view their boarding position (car number), information on stops for the section (transfer routes, platform
map and station map), and the congestion status and temperature of each car of the yamanote line train
they have boarded or that is in operation.

                      appealing to overseas visitors

 products that appeal to overseas visitors
 we offer the“jr east pass,”which allows unlimited travel within the jr east service area, and the“jr
 kanto area pass,”which allows unlimited travel within the kanto area. in january 2014, we began to offer
“n’ ex tokyo direct ticket (one-way)”as a product providing access from narita airport to tokyo. in
 addition, we offer the“mt. fuji round trip ticket”to promote demand for trips to mt. fuji, and the“gala
 option ticket”as an option that can be added to the“jr kanto area pass”for customers to enjoy snow
 in winter. with these highly convenient seasonal travel products, we can give visitors suggestions and
 recommendations for different train trips in our service area.



 free public wireless lan service for overseas visitors
 as overseas visitors feel that the free public wireless lan environment in japan is inconvenient, we
 provide and have installed free public wireless lan services at 15 stations (mainly on the yamanote line)
 and at the“jr east travel service centers”which are used by many overseas visitors. this service is
 provided in four languages: english, chinese, korean and japanese.

and“amazon.”
as of the end of june 2014, suica cards are usable in about 256,220 shops and the maximum number of
uses per day had reached approximately 4.21 million.



responding to diverse needs
in december 2012, there were more than 3 million users of“mobile suica,”which combines the functions
of a suica card and a smartphone or cell phone. as a result of our efforts to increase the membership
shops and companies with which points can be exchanged, the membership of“suica point club”
reached around 1.87 million as of the end of june 2014.“view suica,”combining the functions of suica
and view cards, was issued to enrich functions so as to meet a wide range of customer needs. we have
also embarked on new, mainly in-house initiatives in which, based on suica and view cards and other
information, the consumption patterns by customer attribute and such are utilized as marketing data.

  topic 4

toward opening of the hokuriku shinkansen
in preparation for the opening of the hokuriku shinkansen line, we set up“hokuriku sales
center,”our first domestic office outside of the jr east service area, in kanazawa in april 2013.
here, we are mainly working on promoting development of community-based tourism and
creating products for travel from the tokyo metropolitan area to hokuriku. specifically, we
are joining forces with local governments, jr west, other transportation business operators,
business facilities along railway lines, to prepare secondary transportation services and to find
and refine the region’ s tourism aspects. we are also making efforts to promote the development
of tourism routes covering a wide area, including niigata, nagano and gifu prefectures. by
enhancing tourism and other attractive aspects of the region, we can generate more travel and
exchange“from tokyo to hokuriku”and“from hokuriku to tokyo,”leading to the development
of win-win relationships.



ueno-tokyo line (tohoku through line)
the ueno-tokyo line is a project to add two tracks to the section from ueno station to tokyo
station, which will allow trains from the utsunomiya and takasaki lines and the joban line,
which terminate at ueno station, to continue to tokyo station for direct service to the tokaido
line. the level of in-train congestion between ueno and okachimachi on the keihin-tohoku and
yamanote lines during morning commuting hours is about 200%, a level that leaves no room
to move during rush hours, but the opening of the ueno-tokyo line is expected to ease the
congestion to 180% or lower. in addition, travel time will also be shortened because transfers
at ueno station and tokyo station will no longer be necessary for many passengers. in terms
of economics, enhancing the transport network connecting the tokyo metropolitan area to
the north and south will stimulate mutual exchange between the areas along the utsunomiya,
takasaki and joban lines and the areas along the tokaido line, leading to regional revitalization.
the opening of the ueno-tokyo line is planned at march 2015.

−utilization of tablet computers−
 serving a useful purpose in smooth operations and
 guiding customers
 takashi koyama                              masato yoshino
 assistant depot chief                  ×    senior chief conductor (conductor coach)
 chiba conductors depot                      chiba conductors depot

 yoshino allowing train crew to carry tablet computers means regulations, emergency manuals, etc. can now
         all be managed on tablets, making updating and management very easy. this is a great advantage.
 koyama i think it’
                  s also a great advantage that with regulations, etc. all available via tablets, the materials
        are now easily portable and we can retrieve, search and browse them immediately when needed.
        however, from a manager’     s perspective, we were very careful to take measures against possible
        loss of the tablets because some of the information in them is confidential. as we are now
        preparing for their use in field operations, we are thoroughly reviewing management methods so
        we can instantly identify to whom tablets have been lent out.
                                  yoshino among us in charge of instruction, too, we sorted out the
                                          materials to install by discussing what kind of information should
                                          be input and what kind of apps would be effective.
                                  koyama i would like to see that train crew are thoroughly informed, and kept
                                          up to date through training, on what kind of information is in the
                                          tablets and what kind of impact may arise in the event of loss.
                                     yoshino our use of tablets is viewed positively by many in that it broadens
                                                the scope in which we can serve our customers and allows us
                                                to provide increasingly enriched services. there have already
                                                been cases where problems experienced on-the-job have been
                                                documented in a manner that
 takashi koyama                                 is easily understood by train
 assistant depot chief                          crew and shared on tablets, and
 chiba conductors depot                         the tablets are proving useful in
                                                serving customers.
            furthermore, based on feedback from train crew on the front lines,
            transfer advice, disaster information and translation are three kinds
            of applications that were introduced after hearing“having such apps
            would help.”most staff probably feel the increasing potential of
            using tablet computers.
 koyama indeed. young employees in particular are continually asking,“can
        this be done?”so our intentions are to increasingly incorporate
        ideas from the field.                                                    masato yoshino
                                                                              senior chief conductor
 yoshino on the day that the kanto region was hit by heavy snowfall,
                                                                               (conductor coach)
         there was an incident where bamboo had fallen on and partially
                                                                              chiba conductors depot
         blocked the railway tracks. if we had just told this to customers,
         they would still be wondering about“when will operations resume?”we found that distributing
         on-site photos to the tablets of conductors on stalled trains so that conductors could then show
         customers,“this is what’s happened”gave those customers more assurance.
 koyama that is a good example of improving customer service quality in the field through quick thinking
        and utilizing tablets.
 yoshino i’
          ve heard there have been other cases using tablets, such
         as researching tokyo disney resort admission restrictions
         and other information, alerting customers to things like
         this by in-train announcements, or using tablets to inform
         customers about connections to other railways and about
         the weather.
 koyama looking ahead, our intentions are to keep improving
        the quality of information provided. for example, we
        are considering whether information can be transmitted
        via tablet email. on-site photos and messages, planned
        operations on days following major transport disruptions
        and rain and wind forecasts are some of the various
        kinds of information. we want to continue considering ways we can serve our customers more
        specifically by having such information mailed to tablets for viewing by the train crew in charge so
        that they can use the information to better serve customers.

 relationship with society

                       with communities

 as a member of the local community, jr east has a strong interest in the community’     s future and works
 for its improvement by enhancing the areas along our railway lines, through developments such as our
“station renaissance”program.
 at tokyo station, on the marunouchi side, the work to preserve and restore tokyo station’     s marunouchi
 station building was completed in october 2012. on the yaesu side, in addition to grantokyo north
 tower and south tower, the granroof pedestrian deck, with its large roof, opened in september 2013
 and a square will be completed in front of the yaesu exit in fall 2014. together with the in-station
 commercial zone, gransta, these developments are called tokyo station city and form part of the
 concept of developing tokyo station into a complete city. our goal is to create a station that will serve as
 a center that represents new cultures, while also serving as a spectacular gateway to metropolitan tokyo.
 we are also cooperating with local governments in the creation of new stations, in line with their city
 planning, and the improvement of existing station buildings with free passages and other facilities,
 based on requests from local authorities. in the fiscal year ended march 2012 we opened a new
 station, yoshikawa-minami, on the musashino line, and we improved fujisaki station on the gono line
 by building a community space (local government facility) in the fiscal year ended march 2014. since
 our establishment in 1987 we have introduced local government facilities into a total of 85 stations (as
 of march 31, 2014). sashiougi station on the kawagoe line, nagaura station on the uchibo line and
 hakusan station on the echigo line were also improved by construction of free passages in the fiscal year
 ended march 2014.

 participating in the program to support migration to regional cities
 in the“jr east group management vision v,”we are supporting programs that local community
 encourages people to move to regional cities from the tokyo metropolitan area, with the aims of
 contributing to the revitalization of those local communities and of encouraging such migration. in the first
 of these projects, we are cooperating in promoting migration and exchange with nagano prefecture and
 saku city as well as with aomori prefecture, hirosaki city and towada city.


 seminar on migration & trial migration tour
 this tour gives people interested in moving away from the tokyo area an opportunity to take part in
 seminars and visits in order to dispel their misgivings about migration. by combining local community
 activities (seminars on living conditions, agricultural experience) with information about shinkansen trains,
 we can support local government migration policies through our sales channels and media activities
 (membership, homepage, and others).


 post-migration support
 we are examining the possibility of offering support for relocation to sakudaira from the tokyo
 metropolitan area by making it easier for travel to tokyo.

 people moving to regional cities or making short stays there sometimes need support, especially in the
 aspect of mobility. we offer support using group resources, such as long-term car rental discount plans
 for members of the otona no kyujitsu club.

contribution of railway overpasses to unifying towns and eliminating traffic congestion
jr east continues to cooperate with local governments in projects for railway overpasses near inagi-
naganuma station on the nambu line and niigata station on the shin-etsu line. these projects aim to
unify towns that are split by railway tracks, eliminate traffic congestion, and improve the safety of both
road and rail transportation.
in the project to construct a series of railway overpasses near inagi-naganuma station on the nambu
line, all 15 level crossings in the section subject to the project were removed by placing the railway on a
viaduct in december 2013, thereby eliminating traffic congestion, unifying towns and contributing to city
planning and smoother traffic.




                                                                 railway overpass construction project near inagi-

enhancing convenience of multi-mode travel through improving and developing transfer
nodes functions at stations
large numbers of people pass through stations where different transport services meet. to reduce urban
area congestion and to make travel more convenient, we have been increasing the number of through
services and improving our connections with other means of transport, in cooperation with national and
local governments. we are also improving transfer nodes to other transport, such as to bus terminals
and taxi loading areas. one example is constructing a bus terminal above the railway tracks at shinjuku
station, in collaboration with the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism, which contributes
to the convenience of the entire multi-mode transportation system.

                 rediscover local areas project

development of the rediscover local areas project
under the "create together" strategy, which specifies enhanced cooperation between jr east and local
communities, we are promoting the rediscover local areas project. the aim is to create new potential
markets that bring increased circulation between the tokyo metropolitan area and other regions and
also attract overseas visitors to japan. the jr east group has railway networks that link japan's various
regions, stations that serve as centers of local communities, business know-how, sales channels and
advertising power that all radiate out from the tokyo metropolitan area, along with employees who
continuously make social contributions as members of local communities. the strategy utilizes jr's unique
abilities to make full use of traditional cultures, festivals, local produce, and other tangible and intangible
tourist resources, expand sales channels, and promote the interactive exchange of information between
the tokyo metropolitan area and local communities.
in the tokyo metropolitan area, in collaboration with tabi-ichi travel packages through which local
residents both propose and guide tours of recommended tourist spots, destination campaigns, and
other marketing tools, we are hosting a number of farm fresh markets for selling local produce and giving
information on local tourism. we opened“nomono,”a shop selling local products (mainly food) and
designed to communicate local information, at ueno station in january 2012 and akihabara station in
march 2014. nomono shops emphasize products that are typical of the season, region and traditions.
through these, we are working to communicate local information in cooperation with local people.
in regional areas, we opened a-factory, a complex that consists of a craft center and market for
processing aomori-grown apples, in front of aomori station in the fiscal year ended march 2011. we
are pursuing regional revitalization by deepening ties with the local people through various events and
other means. in addition, in september 2013, we launched nomono 1-2-3, a manufacturing project for
expansion of agriculture, forestry and fisheries to include food processing, logistics and marketing. our
pursuit of such expansion of industries to improve regional economies have included selling burgers made
with shinshu venison and opening a sweets shop specializing in tokyo-grown ingredients in ecute tokyo.
we are working to revitalize the local food industry by holding farm fresh markets and through
encouraging the expansion of agriculture, forestry and fisheries to include food processing, logistics and
marketing.

 “nomono”akihabara store−
 −
 communicating the attractiveness of eastern japan to
 everyone in the tokyo metropolitan area
 the store name“nomono”is based on the concept of introducing and communicating local produce,
 mainly food that typify the season, region and traditions of each eastern japan region. it is a store that was
 born from a desire to deliver new discoveries and surprises to everyone in the tokyo metropolitan area by
 gathering specific regional products. of areas in tokyo, the akihabara station area is in particular a“place
 that communicates new culture”and was thus thought to be the most suitable location for“nomono.”
 at“nomono,”we gather products that have been carefully selected by our staff in collaboration with

 be purchased just by stopping by after work,”
       s nostalgic to find products that are a specialty of the
 and“it’
 prefecture where i was born.”
 the ultimate goal of this store is to communicate the attractiveness
 of eastern japan through local food found at“nomono,”have
 people in the tokyo metropolitan area feel that they“want to visit
 the site firsthand”and then actually travel to that region.
 as store manager, it is my desire to have staff themselves increase
 their knowledge of the products and become“concierges for
 eastern japan”who can confidently suggest and introduce
 products to customers. in addition, i also think it is my role to
 mount efforts to nurture staff so that manufacturers and farmers
 can feel at ease in entrusting their products with us.
 there are still many food and local delicacies in each eastern
 japan region waiting to be found that we have yet to discover
 and introduce in the store. intentions are to keep searching
 for products characteristic of regional areas that are yet to be
 found to form a unique selection of products so that we can
 communicate the attractiveness of eastern japan more and more
 to everyone in the tokyo metropolitan area.                            hiroko mizuno

   childcare support services happy child project

jr east group is striving to develop communities along its railway lines in which people can live in comfort
and can benefit from adequate childcare support, as envisaged by the happy child project. more
specifically, these communities will benefit from elements of social infrastructure such as nursery schools
near stations for supporting childcare and community cafés for parents and children. it is hoped that these
may contribute to the development of local communities and be used as venues for various events that
both parents and children can enjoy.
we will respond actively to various needs associated with childcare, contribute to the local community
and upgrade the value of areas adjacent to the railway lines.



childcare support facilities ─ support for working parents
jr east has opened childcare support facilities such as“nursery schools near stations”located in easily
accessible areas that are usually within a five-minute walk from the station, to support the combination
of childcare and commuting to work. a total of 79 childcare support facilities were opened from 1996
through april 2014, and jr east is continuing to increase the number of these facilities. these nursery
schools near stations have the advantage that parents can drop and pick up their children on the way to
and from work. as evidenced by the scene that children come to the nursery with fathers, our childcare
support encourages fathers’participation in childcare as well.

parent-child community cafés - facility to encourage parents to go out
jr east is working to open parent-child community cafés that provide space where families can enjoy
spending time together. the parent-child community cafés incorporate functions and services to help
meet this goal, and are not only for families with children, but also for all members of the community and
all generations.
for example, the“kizuna 937”parent-child community café operated by jr east is on the second floor of
e’site kagohara, in front of kagohara station on the takasaki line.

development of environmental education by delivering lectures on request
in the fiscal year ending march 2010, to contribute to the development of a sustainable society, jr east
initiated environmental education programs for children. they will lead the next generation and they need
to understand environmental issues and their relationship to society. the program aims to help children
understand the environment and life through materials related to railways. in fy2014, the program was
implemented at 32 schools, primarily elementary schools, in the jr east area. we will continue it.

   special         initiatives to enhance the value of areas along
   topic 5         our railway lines

 chuo line mall
 we are promoting the chuo line mall project for utilization of the space under elevated railway
 tracks between mitaka and tachikawa stations on the chuo line. this is part of an overall aim to
 develop lineside area brands that will be chosen by customers, as part of a project constructing
 a series of railway overpasses that will unify towns. looking at a railway line and the area
 alongside it as a unit rather than just as“points”(stations), we are promoting development that
 is based on the concept of“connecting greenery, people and towns”       . by doing so, we aim to
 establish a lineside“brand”as an area where customers want to live, and this will enhance the
 value of areas along the railway line.




 suicle
 the jr east group operates“suicle,”a bicycle sharing system using suica, with goals such as
 increasing the flow of people in towns, regional revitalization and contributing to becoming a
 low carbon society. bicycles are based at facilities under the elevated chuo line tracks adjacent
 to musashi-sakai station and higashi-koganei station, and ports have been installed outside
 the station area, where bicycles can be dropped off. in this manner, the bicycles have become
 community bicycles.
 this system run by east japan marketing & communications, inc. began on november 3, 2013
 and has already been expanded to serve three locations.




 cotonior
“cotonior”is a facility providing both child and senior citizen care under one roof as
 recommended by the jr east group. we hope that cotonior operations will nurture children
 to be considerate of and respect the elderly, while allowing senior citizens to enjoy interacting
 with children and feel comforted and rejuvenated by them.“cotonior kichijoji,”which is
 the first of such facilities, serves both as a nursery school certified by the tokyo metropolitan
 government and an outpatient day long-term care facility.

                                   culture

east japan railway culture foundation
in order to continuously utilize its management resources for social contributions, in 1992 jr east
established the east japan railway culture foundation, an organization that has successfully promoted
local culture, studied and researched railways, and taken part in international cultural exchanges through
our railway business. the foundation’   s major activities include operating the railway museum, tokyo
station gallery, the old shimbashi station building and old manseibashi station, sponsoring local cultural
activities and accepting trainees from railway operators in asian countries. the foundation provides
information on its website (http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/english/index.html). it became a public interest
incorporated foundation in april 2010.



the railway museum
on october 14, 2007, the railway day, the railway museum was opened in saitama city, and it is based
on three major concepts. it was designed to be a museum that systematically conducts surveys and
research using railway-related heritage and reference materials, a history museum that depicts the history
of railways focusing on exhibits of locomotives and cars, and an educational museum where visitors
can learn about railway principles, systems and technologies through hands-on experience. since its
opening, the railway museum has proved to be a great success, attracting about 800,000 visitors in the
fiscal year ended march 2014. in november 2013, the railway museum held the“first world railway
museum meeting,”a gathering ten railway museums in seven countries, promoting mutual understanding,
information sharing and cooperation among railway museums.

the children’s railway association is managed by the traffic manners association, with the aim of raising
children’s awareness of proper manners on public transportation. in japan, there are approximately 1,000
active members, with 400 of them in our service area. jr east has established related facilities in each
of our branch offices and actively supports the association as a way to contribute to the improvement of
manners on public transportation by the next generation, and provides opportunities for such activities as
clean-up work in railway stations and field trips to railway facilities and branch offices.

jr east is actively involved in international cooperation through dispatching railway experts to asian
countries in order to explain our technologies and provide the expertise we have nurtured over the
years, taking in trainees from developing countries to provide tuition in professional fields, and meeting
requests from agencies such as the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism and the japan
international cooperation agency (jica).
jr east also receives inspection visits by overseas visitors involved in railway operations. during the fiscal
year ended march 2014, for example, we had 892 visitors from 54 countries. the visitors have included
government officials from each country, people engaged in railway operation and researchers from
universities and research institutes. these visits help to promote mutual understanding.

global contribution through international institutions
jr east is a member of the international union of railways (uic), the international association of public
transport (uitp), community of european railway and infrastructure companies (cer), the association of
american railroads (aar), the american public transportation association (apta), and other international
railway organizations. in addition to collecting and providing information through international conferences
and publications organized by these institutions, we strive to constantly work toward the resolution of
railway-related issues around the world.
we are also working hard to host international conferences, when we can show overseas railway
operators the features of japanese railway systems. in april 2014, we co-hosted the uitp asia-pacific
assembly in tokyo with tokyo metro co., ltd. in october, we will host the uic asia-pacific region
meeting in tokyo. in addition, in july 2015, we will be holding the“uic world congress on high speed
rail,”the world’ s largest international conference and exhibition focusing on high-speed railway, in tokyo
in collaboration with uic.
jr east executives have also served as chair of the asia-pacific regional assembly (apra) since january
2013 and vice president and director of the uitp policy board since may 2013. through the activities in
such international organizations, we will contribute to the development of railways throughout the world.

  topic 6

participation in overseas railway projects
amid an increasing awareness of global environmental issues and the economic growth of
emerging economies, interest in railways as environmentally friendly public transportation
systems is on the rise globally, and this has resulted in the current consideration of many railway
projects around the world.
in november 2011, jr east established japan international consultants for transportation co.,
ltd. (jic), a company that provides consulting services to overseas railway companies. the
company was formed jointly with west japan railway company, tokyo metro co., ltd., and
other domestic railway operators with good records of performance achievements and know-
how regarding all kinds of rail transportation, including high-speed railways, urban railways, and
freight railways.
with jic at the head, we have several overseas railway consulting projects under way, including
feasibility studies and design work. we will, furthermore, cooperate with both japanese and
foreign companies to participate in overseas railway projects, including both operational
and maintenance aspects (planning, instructing, and supporting train operations and facility
maintenance). our first priority is asia, where growth is remarkably strong, but we are involved
in railway projects in all regions and are contributing to global railway development.
in addition to the previously established new york and paris offices, we established the brussels
office, belgium in november 2012, followed by the singapore office (our first in asia) in march
2013, for such purposes as gathering information on these overseas railway projects. these
offices were followed by the establishment of the london office in an aim for further cooperation
and collaboration between japan and europe.

expansion of railcar manufacturing operations and overseas business expansion
as part of our plan to establish railcar manufacturing as the fourth pillar of business
management, making full use of the synergic effects of the entire jr east group, we transferred
our jr east railcar manufacturing operations in niitsu rolling stock factory to our japan
transport engineering company (j-trec) subsidiary and our niitsu rolling stock factory became
j-trec’  s niitsu plant in april 2014.
the jr east group will continue to improve our comprehensive technological capabilities, which
range from manufacturing to operations and maintenance, with an aim to expand the global
market share of japanese railcars. j-trec in particular is pursuing a business strategy that
demonstrates the advantages, such as high reliability and low lifecycle costs, of its stainless steel
railcars, which are marketed under the brand name“sustina.”
concrete achievements in overseas business expansion include the decision to take part in
railcar and ground equipment maintenance projects for bangkok’    s purple line, which is currently
under construction in bangkok, and for j-trec to manufacture and supply 21 three-car train sets
for this service.

global human resources development program—ever onward
aiming for the nurturing of human resources capable of playing a part in overseas business
expansion, jr east is promoting its global human resources development program—ever
onward, which provides such options as overseas study, overseas dispatch to public institutions
and companies, and overseas railway consulting work on-the-job training (ojt).
continuing from the previous year, in the fiscal year ended march 2014, 18 people selected
through open application as overseas railway consulting work ojt trainees were dispatched to
delhi (india), jakarta (indonesia), ho chi minh (vietnam) and yangon (myanmar). we also added
a new overseas experience program (short-term overseas study) designed to foster an open
perspective and mind. in this overseas experience program, about 100 employees selected
through open application were dispatched to 14 cities around the world to encourage them
to acquire a broad perspective and the language skills required for future globalization through
such means as lessons at language schools, home stays and problem solving programs.

relationship with employees

   demonstrating the power of human resources

in order to ensure safe and reliable rail transport and provide services that will satisfy customers, it
is vitally important for us to create an environment where jr east’     s personnel can fully exercise their
abilities. our success in enabling our people to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve
and then act on their decisions will determine the future of our entire organization.
we also have to face the fact that society is in a continual state of change, and this includes both
the awareness of working people and their working environments. as a result of this, we believe that
jr east must constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their
responsibilities, and thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction.
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while
constantly striving to attain even higher goals. to that end, we are determined to face the challenge of
creating a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to
the motivation of each employee to meet challenges, how to ensure a suitable work-life balance, and how
to make full use of the diversity of our human resources.
in“jr east group management vision v- ever onward”        , the company advocated reforms to its culture,
including opening up our organization to young employees and giving increased opportunities for
motivated people to apply for inclusion in training and other new projects, exchanging people with
other companies, passing on technical knowledge and skills to the next generation, and participating in
technological innovation and overseas railway projects.



recruitment
jr east’ s main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee. our basic philosophy is to
employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then to steadily nurture them
until they reach the full flowering of their abilities. because of the large number of employees reaching
retirement age in the fiscal year ending march 2015 and the constant necessity for human resources
development and the transfer of knowledge and technologies to the next generation, we have recruited
about 1,800 new employees.

employing persons with disabilities
as of june 2014, 2.4% of our workforce consisted of employees with disabilities. these members of our
staff work alongside other employees in a broad range of positions. we further increased our ability to
employ people with disabilities in april 2008, when we established jr east green partners co., ltd. which
was charged with the task of promoting their employment and helping us meet our social responsibility to
improve the work environment for such employees. the company was certified as a special subsidiary in
may 2009.

skills development
the development of human resources and the steady and continuous introduction of new technologies
and skills are vital to the sustainable growth of the jr east group. based on a perspective of nurturing
quality through work, we are striving to enhance the organizational power of the group and to develop
human resources capable of shouldering the burdens of the future.
with this in mind we constantly conduct training programs at our general education center and in branch
offices and many kinds of seminars at our head office. and as part of our support for all employees to
set their own challenges for self-education and to thereby heighten their abilities, we offer both internal
and external correspondence courses. the internal courses are aimed at the acquisition of knowledge
and skills directly connected to our employees’duties, while the external courses are connected to
indispensable business skills and knowledge, including management know-how, qualifications acquisition,
languages, and office automation.


my project
in order to encourage our employees to face the challenges of taking the next steps in their careers, in
january 2011 we upgraded our small groups and proposal activities and initiated the my project program.
this program is comprised of three aspects: self-starting, freedom of method and importance of process,
with the fruit being the employee’ s personal growth. the project is based on the belief that working
for personal improvement is an opportunity for the fostering of human resources, and, thereby, aims to
nurture employees capable of thinking and acting independently.


jr east technical academy
in order to motivate our young employees and encourage them to develop into professionals capable
of playing leading roles in all fields of railway technology, we established the jr east technical academy
in march 2009. in the 6th year class that started in march 2014, we added lectures on safety systems in
order to nurture engineers with comprehensive knowledge, skills and philosophy on railway safety. the
present class includes 60 employees from 12 technological fields; 5 of them are from group companies
and partner companies, and 7 are participating only in some programs as listeners. they will be working
together as a group for one year to improve their technical capability and strength. the program has
been designed to enable participants to thoroughly learn the theory and structure of their individual
professional fields as well as to provide them with a comprehensive overview of railway technologies and
systems in general. through research at universities and from practical training sessions at manufacturers,
furthermore, we hope to enable all participants to acquire a broad range of knowledge.

skills training centers:develop engineers for future railway transportation
integral to our efforts to ensure that experienced employees pass on their technologies and skills to
the next generation of technical staff, who will carry the responsibilities for railways in the future, is our
establishment of skills training centers designed to support the continuity of railway-specific technologies
and skills in individual workplaces. we have established 104 centers by also making use of existing
training facilities. in our skills training center for rolling stock maintenance, for example, railway car
component mockups (power collection equipment, door opening-closing devices, and braking equipment)
have been set up, while in our facilities maintenance section, railway facilities (tracks, turnouts, platforms,
overhead line equipment, signals, etc.) have been installed, so training sessions can take place in virtually
real environments.

                         promotion of diversity

jr east believes that employees who derive satisfaction from doing challenging work and who can
maximize their skills are able to enhance the company’s competitiveness.
we have initiated a "work-life program" whose aim is to encourage all employees, both male and female,
to participate independently.




                               we are encouraging employees to be well aware of the work-life program
                               and are using a program nickname, "wara-pro", and a logo.

specifically, individual organizations hold seminars and forums and operate a diversity portal. they
also participate in the various activities of a work-life network, upon which the work-life program in
the workplace is based, with the aims of encouraging employees to revise their way of thinking and of
creating a new corporate culture. for enhancing the employees’awareness of work-life balance, the
company invites its employees’families to come to its family day event.

support the balance between work and childcare/nursing responsibilities
based on the concept of increasing the options for achieving the balance between work and childcare/
nursing, regardless of occupation, jr east introduced“working with childcare/nursing a”in fy2011.
in this program, all employees are eligible for shorter working days (six daytime hours) until their child
reaches three years of age.
in addition, with the desire to continue to provide support thereafter as much as possible, we also
introduced“working with childcare/nursing b.”in this program, employees with children who have not
reached the third elementary school grade are entitled to four days a month as days off for childcare/
nursing. furthermore, working with childcare/nursing a and b both also apply to“nursing”(care of other
family members). we also revised programs, such as extending the availability of childcare leave to the
time when the child reaches three years of age and expanding the scope of coverage of“parental leave”
(entitled to take up to five days off a month for taking care of a child) and“sick/injured child care leave”
                                                                                                s sickness or
(entitled to take up to five days off a year for looking after a child in the event of the child’
injury; ten days permitted for those with two or more children), which also applies until the child reaches
the third grade of elementary school. in this manner, there is a growing range of options for ways of
working during childcare/nursing periods.

year. for example, about 40% of the train crew members on the yamanote line are female employees.

positions such as head office and branch office managers, chiefs of field offices (stationmasters) and
board members of group companies.

mental health care
in order to maintain and improve the mental health of our employees, we believe it is vitally important
for all our employees to recognize stress in their everyday lives and deal with it promptly. as a result, we
are taking various support measures, such as the distribution to all employees of a pamphlet about self-
care to increase their awareness of this problem. we have also set up a counseling service in conjunction
with a jr east medical facility and, through this, respond individually to our employees’needs. in order
to promote front-line care in the workplace, beginning in the fiscal year ended march 2008, we also
organized training programs for on-site supervisors.


elder employee system
during the fiscal year ended march 2009, jr east introduced the elderly employee system that
encourages employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for group companies that
can benefit from their individual capabilities and skills. this is done by 90% of the eligible employees.
through this plan we hope to enable retired employees to stabilize their lives until they reach their
fully pensionable ages, as well as to encourage them to continue to contribute to our group-wide
accumulation of know-how.

human rights enlightenment
in order to educate our employees in the necessity for enhanced human rights, we have established a
human rights enlightenment promotion committee in the head office. specifically, the activities of this
committee include human rights seminars for officers and employees of jr east group and for those in
charge of human rights enlightenment in organizations and group companies. to propagate human rights
awareness, it also conduct lectures on human rights enlightenment in training sessions attended by new
recruits, new train crews, work-implementation managers, and new managers. furthermore, human rights
education both for our employees and for their families has been promoted through articles, spotlighting
human rights problems that could occur in our environment, that appear in our newsletter“jr higashi.”
we have also joined the industrial federation for human rights, tokyo, and are conducting human
rights enlightenment activities externally along with information exchanges and mutual enlightenment
discussions with member companies of the federation.

 －user of maintenance master nurturing academy program－
 now able to see own work from objective perspective
 thanks to the nurturing academy
 i was employed after having worked at a household appliance manufacturer where i was in charge of design
 work. since joining jr east, i have been involved in mainly railcar inspection and track maintenance work.
 the age composition of the workplace included only the baby boomer generation and young employees,
 with no employees in between to act as intermediaries, and this made me feel slightly concerned as an
                                                              engineer. notably, the technical management

                                                              veteran employees, increasingly raising doubts
                                                              about whether younger employees could manage to

                                                              remained.
                                                              it was at that point that a“maintenance master

                                                              and i was eager to apply for the program. now

                                                              at the nurturing academy, the required skills are
                                                              basically learned through ojt, but there are also
 many programs that one would not be able to experience other than with the nurturing academy. these
 included group training at the head office and visiting the plants of non-railway companies. through such
 experience, i sense that i can now see things from various angles. even in the daily ojt at the general rolling
 stock center, by going though each work division in a short period of time, i can now objectively look at
 my own work and workplace from the perspective of a different
 department. i can now understand better the movements of those
 people around me that i had been watching vaguely and see things
 i could not recognize before. another advantage is that many
 participants of the nurturing academy have clear, high goals, which
 is extremely inspiring and i, too, am kept highly motivated.
      s railways, especially jr east, constantly place safety first,
 japan’
 have extremely low delays in train operations and such a high
 level of punctuality is well recognized around the world. this
 would be impossible without excellent railcar management and
 maintenance. in fact, once i have gone through acquiring railcar
 maintenance and management skills at the nurturing academy, i
 dream of participating in overseas projects and put such skills to
 good use. i see the way jr east takes a comprehensive approach
 in overseas projects to encompass not only railcar manufacturing
 but also maintenance and other aspects, too, as a strength.
 therefore, i hope to be able to make at least a slight contribution
 to infrastructure development in emerging countries, based on the          takayuki onodera
 know-how acquired at the nurturing academy.                                education group planning division

csr management
basic concept of csr
the jr east group is based on railway businesses that are involved in a broad range of our customers’
lives and that are vital to society and local communities. with such a public responsibility, we are
committed to meeting our social responsibilities by carrying out our business activities in a way that will
ensure railway safety and reliable transportation services.
in terms of our social mission, our group philosophy states:“we aim to grow continuously while meeting
our social responsibilities as a trusted life-style service creating group.”we are determined to remain a
corporate group capable of meeting social expectations and maintaining stakeholders’trust by pursuing
our business activities in line with that philosophy.



       s basic corporate governance philosophy
jr east’
to continue to be a company trusted by all of our stakeholders, jr east has made the strengthening of its
corporate governance a top-priority management task. specifically, for improving management soundness,
efficiency and transparency, jr east is augmenting its systems for management decision-making,
operational execution and overseeing, group management, information disclosure, and other important
matters.



execution of duties, supervision and audit system
our 18-member board of directors, including two outside directors (as of june 30, 2014), normally meets
monthly to decide key operational matters relating to statutory requirements and other matters, and to
supervise overall operations. under the board of directors is the executive committee, which includes all
directors with executive functions. usually meeting every week, this committee deliberates on matters to
be decided by the board of directors and other important management issues. in addition, meetings of
the group strategy formulation committee, which consists of all directors with executive functions and
others, are held as required to discuss major issues affecting the group as a whole, including management
strategy for each business field.
jr east has established an internal auditing system involving approximately 100 full-time employees in the
inquiry & audit department at the head office and inquiry & audit divisions in branch offices, and these
units work to ensure that corporate operations are executed appropriately and efficiently. the inquiry &
audit department also undertakes the auditing of group companies.
our board of corporate auditors usually meets every month and the audit by corporate auditors is
supported by approximately 10 specialized staff. they oversee executive actions carried out by directors,
with a focus on full-time directors, in accordance with the rules established by the board of corporate
auditors by investigating their attendance at the board of directors, the executive committee and other
important in-house meetings, their financial situations, and other items.
jr east financial statements are audited under contract by an independent auditor (accounting auditor),
kpmg azsa llc., in and at the end of each fiscal year.

compliance

                basic concept of compliance

jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the group’        s
corporate activity guidelines. concomitantly, we established compliance hotlines, both inside and outside
the company, for internal reporting, and have promoted efforts on compliance.
in addition, we continue to implement a program of education for all group employees every year and
strive to raise their awareness of the need for compliance.
other approaches to further promotion of compliance-minded management throughout the group may be
exemplified by our confirmation of the proper execution of our business through general checks of legal
and regulatory requirements concerning all aspects of it and activities using a“basic matter confirmation
support sheet”that should be periodically checked in each location.



formulation and revision of the compliance action plan
in 2005, jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the
group’ s activity guidelines. to heighten the efficacy of these guidelines, we also prepared the compliance
action plan, which sets forth advisable modes of conduct for all employees of the jr east japan group.
we are distributing the plan to all employees, in the form of the compliance action plan handbook.
in 2013, with the formulation of jr east group management vision v, we revised the 2005 policy together
with the compliance action plan handbook, taking into consideration the social changes surrounding the
company. we will continue to ensure that all employees of the jr east group completely understand
and follow the compliance action plan and review it according to ongoing environmental and societal
changes.



strengthening mechanism for proper business conduct
we conducted full inspections of our compliance for all our operations, including group companies.
starting with the inspections, jr east group is promoting continuous reviews of all its operations based
on laws and regulations, internal rules, and social norms.
in 2011, jr east created the“basic matter confirmation support sheet”listing matters subject to regular
checking and requiring heads of departments to personally ensure that business is carried out properly.
we endeavor to achieve thorough implementation at each workplace.



ensuring information security
with the advancement of the information society, ensuring the security of our information systems has
become an important issue.
jr east has designed and introduced an information security management system and carries out
necessary measures to ensure safe and secure information system operations. we have also established
a contact system in the event a problem should occur and we conduct problem response drills.
all employees are kept aware of the importance of information security and the strict handling of
information through our group rule book and internal magazine. all employees also receive information
security education with the aim of raising awareness about how they should guarantee workplace
information security.

education of all employees
we began providing compliance education for all employees in 2009, in order to heighten awareness of
the need for compliance among each and every one of them. in fiscal 2014, we carried out a program
of education including a case study, which prompted employees to consider cases that could occur
in their workplace, for the purpose of tightening adherence to guidelines for conduct based on the
revised compliance action plan handbook. we will follow this in fiscal 2015 with continued education
to enhance compliance awareness that centered around cases and topics based on the recent social
situation and actual conditions in workplaces.
in addition, in fiscal 2014, besides conducting a questionnaire in conjunction with our compliance
education for all employees, we surveyed employee awareness of compliance by means of the group
company compliance questionnaire, which was conducted mainly with employees of the management
and planning divisions at the member firms of our group.
we are committed to continued compliance education based on the social responsibility our company
must discharge and the changes in the mindset of our employees.

shinanogawa power station incident
in march 2009 jr east received an administrative sanction because the company’        s water intake had
exceeded the maximum allowed quantity at our hydroelectric plant, shinanogawa power station (the
collective name for the senju, ojiya and ojiya daini power plants in ojiya and tokamachi cities, niigata
prefecture). the sanction was issued in accordance with the river act and included the revocation of
a permit to draw water from the shinano river. subsequent to receipt of this sanction, we have taken
corrective actions in accordance with the directions in the sanction and have endeavored to implement
measures to prevent recurrence and to cultivate close cooperation with the local communities.
in june 2010, having obtained a permit from the director of the hokuriku regional development bureau
of the ministry of land, infrastructure, transport and tourism to again take water from the shinano river,
we resumed operation of the shinanogawa power station.
we are redoubling our efforts at compliance management to prevent occurrence of similar incidents and
we are sincerely committed to fostering harmony with the river environment and enhancing co-prosperity
with communities.



personal data protection
in 2005, the jr east group published the regulations for the management of personal information and
appointed chief privacy officers who have the responsibility of strictly protecting personal data. through
pamphlets covering the subject exclusively, articles in our internal magazines and compliance education,
we are also working to ensure that all employees remain fully aware of the necessity of the strict handling
and management of personal data. in order to ensure proper usage and strict control of personal data,
the group conducts regular internal workplace audits.



risk management
the crisis management headquarters was established in 2002 to centrally collect and manage
information, and to make prompt initial responses in the event of major crises affecting the business
operations of the jr east group. in 2004, we added the crisis management office, a full-time section
that has taken responsibility for headquarters’secretarial work. we are striving to be prepared for any
potential risks jr east group may face. we have established a system enabling us to respond to various
emergencies—terrorist threats, pandemics such as influenza, and other possibilities.



information disclosure
jr east has a wide range of relationships with many stakeholders, including the 17 million customers using
our railway services each day, as well as our shareholders and investors, business partners, employees
and their families, and local communities.
we actively disseminate information about group initiatives through public and investor relations activities
to these stakeholders. we also strive to disclose key corporate information on our website in a swift and
appropriate manner. jr east also is working to create wide-ranging opportunities to listen to and learn
from the views and requests of our stakeholders.

independent assurance report (website version)




the complex process of calculating energy use and co2 emissions on a non-
consolidated basis has been reorganized over the past few years. starting
from this year, co2 emissions are disclosed by categorizing emissions into
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, and other improvements are being made
toward aligning with global trends in the disclosure of information on co2
emissions. in addition, we believe working on the data survey sheet format
and clarifying data definitions are also improving the accuracy of data
collection year by year. we believe that introducing an information system
for data collection with such initiatives at the core will not only reduce
human error but also improve the efficiency of calculation work.
with jr east businesses other than the railway business growing in presence,
we also believe it is becoming difficult to convey the environmental and
social aspects of the jr east group as a whole when disclosure is only
                                                                                 naomi sugo
being made for the railway business on a non-consolidated basis. we              kpmg
suggest future consideration of the volume of information and how detailed       azsa sustainability co., ltd.

disclosure should be made on the environmental and social aspects of the
non-railway businesses. in addition, we also believe that preparing csr
reports in accordance with the gri guidelines has become a global trend
that the jr east group, which is accelerating overseas business expansion,
cannot ignore. the gri g4 guidelines released last year require that
information disclosure be focused on material information with clarification
of‘materiality’for the corporate group. we suggest jr east proceed
systematically toward preparing reports in accordance with the gri guidelines.

 summary from the general manager of the management planning department
 circumstances surrounding energy and environmental issues are drastically
 changing daily both domestically and abroad. in response, at the global
 level, all countries participating in the 19th session of the conference of
 the parties (cop 19) held in november 2013, including the us and china,
 agreed to voluntarily set targets and to take measures toward the reduction
 of greenhouse gases from 2020. domestically, the government of japan
 indicated in april 2014 the fundamental direction of its mid- and long-term
 energy policy with the formulation of its 4th strategic energy plan which
 specified its policy for energy sources such as coal, petroleum, nuclear
 power, and renewable energies.
 in accord with these developments, the jr east group is continuing to
 exercise various countermeasures against issues surrounding global warming
 from a long-term perspective. these proactive efforts include such measures       kiwamu sakai
 as the introduction of renewable energies like solar power, improvements to       executive officer and general
“ecoste”model stations based on a diversity of environmental conservation          manager
                                                                                   management planning department
 technologies, and the introduction of energy management systems (ems) to          corporate planning headquarters
 its stations. moreover, in offering safe and high quality services, the jr east
 group remains steadfast in its commitment to help realize a sustainable
 society for the future through the fulfillment of its corporate social
 responsibility.
 the jr east group csr report 2014 details the various measures the group
 is taking from the fundamental perspectives of environment, safety, and
 society. this year’s report, as evident in the abundance of quantitative data,
 photos, and figures included to help illustrate the group’    s environmental
 performance data, has also been formulated for ease of understanding.
 we have prepared the report so that readers can appreciate the specific
 measures of the jr east group. to help realize this goal, we have featured
 six major issues related to the jr east group management vision v – ever
 onward as special topics, and included interviews of our forefront field staff
 in the voice sections of the report. moreover, in line with recent global
 trends regarding the disclosure of information, in this year’s report we have
 newly included scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to indicate the group’      s co2
 emissions.
 based on the jr east group management vision v — ever onward, the
 jr east group remains committed in its ongoing efforts to address the
 expectations of society and to the trust of our stakeholders while remaining
 fully conscious of global trends.
