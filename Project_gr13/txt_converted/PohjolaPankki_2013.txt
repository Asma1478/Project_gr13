review by the chairman of the board of
directors
dear pohjola shareholders

2012 was a good year for the entire op-pohjola group in terms of both growth and financial performance. pohjola
accounted for a significant share of op-pohjola group’s financial performance. pohjola’s banking improved its earnings
over the previous year despite the challenging operating environment and low interest rates. in the meanwhile, the
favourable investment environment boosted the financial performance of non-life insurance and asset management. in
addition, banking and non-life insurance businesses continued their integration success story.

growth in corporate banking proved once again that we bear responsibility for economic growth in finland in more
difficult times too. pohjola plays a major role in this respect.

the operating environment will remain unstable. in particular, the burden of the new regulatory environment and
decisions on taxation will affect profit performance in the financial sector. nevertheless, we at pohjola are well prepared
for these challenges. we have strong financial buffers. the reorganisation programme launched last year will
substantially slow growth in expenses in 2013 and in the next few years.

one of the key points in our updated strategy is to continue to adhere to the stable dividend policy.

president and ceo’s review
for pohjola, 2012 was a year of success and a record year in many respects. although our operating environment was
characterised by uncertainty, the european sovereign debt crisis still persists and the weaker-than-expected economic
growth has dampened corporate capital spending, last year was a period of growth for pohjola. we made progress in
our business at operational level in line with our expectations and made headway according to our strategy.

with a favourable investment environment, we also did an excellent job in investment operations. restored investor
confidence in capital markets was supported by the ecb’s announcement to buy the sovereign bonds of crisis-ridden
countries in secondary markets.

our consolidated earnings before tax amounted to eur 374 million and at fair value to almost eur 800 million.

we made progress in all of our business lines. banking reported the best performance for the second year in a row. we
continued to increase our market share of corporate loans. our firm and calculated choice to stand by finnish companies
through thick and thin and support their growth and business development lie behind this increase in our market share.
we still boast a good quality loan portfolio. our good progress is also shown by the fact that deposits increased by up to
92%. we achieved number-one position as an arranger of syndicated loans and bonds in finland. a smooth start of
government payment transfers for which we act as the primary intermediary as a result of competitive tendering and a
new corporate branch office opened in latvia number among our successful accomplishments.

non-life insurance reported strong growth in insurance premium revenues. we have recruited heavily for policy sales
and last year we broke sales records among both private and corporate customers. successful cross-selling with op-
pohjola group cooperative banks increased the number of loyal customer households by a record of around 47,000 to
almost 570,000. despite the large volume growth, the quality of our claims service remained good. non-life insurance
recorded a good operating combined ratio although it was saddled with larger claims than a year earlier. opening
omasairaala oy, a hospital for outpatient surgery specialising in orthopaedic diseases and injuries, in early 2013 will
ensure comprehensive customer service all the way from personal injury until recovery.

our asset management too reported record earnings and improved investment returns considerably. intensified
cooperation within op-pohjola group was reflected, for example, in better customer satisfaction among major internal
customers.

last year was also characterised by the information and consultation of employees process related to the reorganisation
programme initiated within op-pohjola group central cooperative consolidated. as a result, the number of our
employees will reduce considerably. although this process was painful for our personnel, it was necessary because the
reorganisation will enable significant improvements in the group’s cost-efficiency. this is how we will ensure our
competitiveness and service capabilities in the future too.

last autumn, we published our updated strategy, its theme being entitled “value and efficiency through integration”. the
updated strategy highlights the following: seeking more targeted growth in order to improve the return on capital,
especially in banking, and increasing capital adequacy ratios. enhancing group efficiency and keeping costs at the 2012
level for the next three years also play an important part of our strategy. we have placed customer experience at the
core of our operations, with the aim of exceeding customer expectations. making more efficient use of op-pohjola
group’s competitive advantages and strengths also play an important role in the strategy.

2012 was a good year in terms of financial performance, sales and customer relationships. the group had a strong
liquidity and capital base at the end of the year. accordingly, the board of directors will propose to the annual general
meeting that a dividend of 0.46 euros be paid per listed series a share, and 0.43 euros per unlisted series k share. this
proposal corresponds to a 51% dividend payout ratio.

i look ahead to 2013 with confidence. we may see a gradual recovery of the euro-area economy from recession towards
the year end. confidence indicators are already suggesting such a revival. we expect our earnings before tax to be higher
in 2013 than in 2012. we have a solid foundation for such an earnings improvement. we now have a stronger market
position than ever before and have made decisions that have provided us with a basis for greater operational efficiency.

i should like to take this opportunity to express my warmest thanks to our shareholders and customers for their trust
and op-pohjola group cooperative banks and other partners for their constructive cooperation. i also wish to express my
gratitude and thanks to our employees who did an excellent job last year during the sometimes tough moments.

operating environment
global economic growth slowed down in 2012, showing a slower growth rate than the last decade’s average. economic
development was characterised by great uncertainty and was uneven. the us economy grew at a moderate pace and
employment improved, whereas the euro area headed for a mild recession.

the european sovereign debt crisis continued to weigh on financial markets. in the early summer, uncertainties mounted
as a result of greece’s parliamentary elections. during the second half, the greatest worries about the crisis faded after
the european central bank (ecb) announced its government bond-purchase programme.

the ecb cut its key interest rate to 0.75% and in the first half increased market liquidity significantly through its
extraordinary long-term refinancing operations. market interest rates fell to record low during 2012.

economic growth in finland remained weak in 2012. following the favourable first quarter, economic growth faded
towards the year end. economic growth was supported by consumer spending, whereas exports and capital spending
were subdued. the slower economic growth made unemployment increase during the second half of the year. home
prices rose by a few per cent but home sales and residential building decreased slightly.

the global economic growth outlook for 2013 is still weaker than on average. economic growth in the euro area will
remain weak. the finnish economy will at its best grow slowly. the ecb will keep its key interest rate low and, if
required, take extraordinary measures to support financial stability. euribor rates will remain record low.

last year, total loans in the finnish banking sector increased by 7%, which was markedly above the average growth rate
in the euro area. loans to households continued their relatively steady growth, supported by lower market rates,
whereas demand for corporate loans subsided in the second half as a result of the weaker economic outlook. growth
prospects on total loans for 2013 are dimmer than last year.

as a result of favourable developments in financial markets, mutual fund and insurance assets grew during the second
half of 2012. stock prices in finland rose by an average of around 10% in 2012. mutual funds’ net asset inflows
increased. the growth rate of deposits slowed down slightly towards the year end as a result of a decline in market
interest rates and the restored risk appetite. the year-end total deposits were 6% higher than the year before.

the total premiums written by the non-life insurance sector still grew at a steady annual rate of around 6%. claims paid
increased by 4%, which is a slower rate than previously. this can be specifically attributed to the better weather
conditions than the year before.

financial sector in the face of major
transformation
the financial sector is undergoing major transformation in many respects. the authorities are considerably tightening
regulations on banks’ capital adequacy and liquidity. for example, the key regulatory changes of the basel iii reform for
financial institutions will impose more stringent capital adequacy requirements, introduce new regulatory requirements
on bank leverage and involve increased regulation in the field of financial risk exposure. moreover, finland has adopted a
temporary bank tax since early 2013. the regulatory framework for insurance companies will also undergo changes
through solvency ii. however, uncertainties are still associated with the content and implementation schedule of these
international regulatory frameworks.

today’s low interest-rate environment coupled with tighter regulation and a higher tax burden will increase profitability
pressures in the financial sector. the outlook for low growth and concerns about the euro-area economy are still
reflected in prospects in the financial sector. the sector is also currently undergoing structural changes. it is developing
electronic services and reshaping distribution channels.

supervision of financial and insurance conglomerates. pohjola group’s capital adequacy ratio under the act, measured
using the consolidation method, showed an improvement, standing at 1.70 (1.41) on 31 december.

major risks and risk exposure
pohjola group’s major risks include credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and underwriting risk. strategic and operational
risks, such as changes in the operating environment, competition or customer behaviour, are inherently related to all
group business lines.

a description of the risk management principles can be found in note 2 “pohjola group’s risk management and capital
adequacy management principles”.

the group’s risk exposure has remained stable despite the weak economic development in the euro area. the group has
a good risk-bearing capacity sufficient to secure business continuity even if economic growth remained weak.
investment-grade exposures remained high while doubtful receivables and past due payments declined. impairment loss
and final loan losses decreased slightly year on year. the group kept market risks moderate throughout the financial
year.

the funding and liquidity position remained strong. the group had good access to short-term funding. the year 2012
saw improved long-term wholesale funding markets. in particular, the ecbs long-term refinancing operations bolstered
the market in the first half. pohjola bank plc was not involved in such operations.

as op-pohjola group’s central bank, pohjola maintains a liquidity buffer which consists mainly of deposits with central
banks and notes, bonds and loans eligible for central bank refinancing. the liquidity buffer maintained by pohjola plus
other items based on op-pohjola group’s contingency funding plan can be used to cover wholesale funding for at least
24 months in the event wholesale funding becomes unavailable and total deposits decrease at a moderate rate. the
liquidity buffer amounted to eur 14.6 billion (15.0) on 31 december 2012.

● claims services had a busy year, as evidenced by the over 450,000 loss reports received by pohjola, which is some

  treatment of orthopaedic diseases and injuries, which began to operate in early 2013.




earnings before tax for 2012 improved over the previous year to eur 92 million. this improvement had its root in the
