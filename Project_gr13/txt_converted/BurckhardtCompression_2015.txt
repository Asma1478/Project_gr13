to our shareholders



                                   dear shareholders
                                   market trends remain positive burckhardt compression group profited from ongoing positive
                                   developments in its markets during the fiscal year 2014, despite global economic uncertainties
                                   and geopolitical tension. overall order intake was held at the high 2013 level. compressor sys-
                                   tems (cs) received fewer orders compared to the previous fiscal year but order intake of the com-
                                   ponents, services and support (css) business area was sharply higher. the group’s operating
                                   profit margin was with 15.7% basically at the same level as last year, despite the decision of the
                                   swiss national bank to abandon the minimum exchange rate of the swiss franc to the euro.

                                   full-year order intake passes the half billion mark again burckhardt compression’s full-year
                                   order intake of chf 514.1 mn (previous year chf 517.1 mn) surpassed the chf 500 million mark
                                   for the second time in the company’s history. css’s contribution to overall order inflow was sig-
                                   nificant as its order intake surged 21.2% from chf 130.8 mn to chf 158.5 mn. this growth at css
                                   was primarily driven by orders for spare parts. the cs business did not quite reach the level of
                                   orders reported for the prior year, which, however, was very high. its order intake declined by 7.9%
                                   to chf 355.6 mn (chf 386.3 mn) and this is mainly attributable to customer decisions to postpone
                                   some large projects.

                                   renewed sales growth thanks to compressor systems at chf 473.6 mn (plus 6.4%, plus 6.8%
                                   at constant exchange rates), burckhardt compression’s sales hit another all-time high, beating
                                   the previous record high set in 2013. sales at the css business area dropped to chf 146.5 mn, a
                                   reduction of 3.7% from chf 152.1 mn in the previous year primarily because no major revamp and
                                   engineering orders had been placed in fiscal years 2013 and 2014. consequently, the renewed
                                   increase in group sales can be traced to the cs business area (plus 11.7% to chf 327.1 mn). gross
                                   profit of chf 152.8 mn surpassed the previous year’s figure by 9.8% or chf 13.6 mn and the
                                   resulting gross profit margin edged higher to 32.3% (31.3%). both business areas increased their
                                   gross profit margins compared to prior-year levels.

                                   operating profit above prior-year level operating profit increased by 6.3% from chf 70.2 mn
                                   to chf 74.6 mn. this amount includes significant foreign exchange losses of net chf –6.4 mn
                                   mainly attributable to the negative static currency impact on various items in euro in the balance
                                   sheet. this negative impact is a direct consequence of the swiss national bank’s decision to aban-
                                   don the eur/chf exchange rate floor of chf 1.20, as announced on january 15, 2015. on the other
                                   hand, a positive contribution of chf 5.9 mn from the adjustment of defined benefit pension plan
                                   obligations had to be recognized in the income statement mainly as a result of the decision by
                                   the independent board of trustees to gradually adjust the conversion rate. net income of 57.6 mn
                                   was 6.9% above prior-year level which corresponds to a net income margin of 12.2%. net income
                                   per share amounted to chf 16.93 (previous year chf 15.87).

                                   solid balance sheet total assets on the balance sheet rose by 5.5% to chf 681.4 mn in fiscal
                                   year 2014. the negative adjustment of defined benefit plan obligations to be recognized within
                                   the group’s consolidated equity amounted to chf 36.5 mn (net of taxes) in the wake of a signifi-
                                   cantly lower discount rate. as a result of this negative effect, total equity declined by chf 19.9 mn
                                   during the year under review, which, together with the increase in non-current assets and work-
                                   ing capital, led to a lower equity ratio of 49.7% (previous year 55.5%). expansion projects in sev-
                                   eral countries, higher working capital and the increase in the dividend resulted in a 8.7% decline
                                   in the net financial position to chf 151.3 mn (previous year chf 165.8 mn).

                                                                  to our shareholders | annual report 2014 | burckhardt compression   5




further expansion of market reach burckhardt compression has been steadily expanding its
global market presence in recent years to improve the local services it offers to customers
around the world. after establishing two new subsidiaries with service centers in singapore and
south africa in 2013, another subsidiary with a service center was established in saudi arabia
and construction work on two new assembly facilities in south korea and the us commenced
during the year under review.

successful entry into new application areas during the past year burckhardt compression sold
its first-ever compressor for an lng export terminal in the us. further significant orders were
also received for propulsion systems for lng tankers, which are increasingly using boil-off gas as
fuel for their propulsion systems.

board of directors and executive board at the annual general meeting on july 4, 2014,
dr. stephan bross was elected to the board of directors. as announced earlier in february, ­sandra
pitt will assume the position of head of human resources management on june 1, 2015 and take           valentin vogt
a seat on the executive board at the same time.

outlook for fiscal year 2015 the markets addressed by burckhardt compression continue to
show a positive trend, despite some economic uncertainty and geopolitical tension. from today’s
standpoint, burckhardt compression expects order intake for fiscal year 2015 to be around the
same level as in the previous year while sales should exceed chf 500 mn. operating and net
income are expected to be higher compared to the levels of fiscal year 2014 at similar profit
margins.

unchanged dividend the board of directors will propose an unchanged dividend of chf 10.00
per share at the annual general meeting. this corresponds to a payout ratio of 59.1% (previous
year 63.0%) of net income, which is in the middle of the targeted payout range of 50% to 70%.

a word of thanks the board of directors and the executive board express their sincere grati-
tude to the nearly 1’400 employees worldwide who work for burckhardt compression. their out-
standing motivation and untiring efforts are greatly appreciated. we thank our shareholders for
their trust, which strengthens our determination as we steadfastly implement our corporate
strategy. we also wish to thank all our customers and suppliers with whom we share valued and          marcel pawlicek

innovation
research & development, switzerland

systematic product development strengthens our competitive position. growing demand for solutions that reduce the energy
consumption and emissions of reciprocating compressors operating at partial load led us to develop a mechatronic system that
offers advanced power control and maximum energy savings.


reliability
manufacturing, switzerland

efficient machining of top-quality compressor components is a demanding task and that is why almost all of our component
production lines use modern cnc machining centers. these multifunctional machines combine several steps in one operation,
thus enabling a reduction of throughput time and an increase in dimensional stability.




safety
lng receiving terminal, canada

these terminals receive liquid gas at temperatures as low as –160 °c (–250 °f). laby® compressors are used to reliquefy
the gas vapors because their compressor cylinders are non-lubricated. thanks to the design without piston rings and gas-tight
casing, these compressors offer the highest availability, maximum operating safety and minimal gas leakage.




reliability and endurance
redura® compressor components

the redura® product line consists of rings and packings for reciprocating compressors. these reliable, robust sealing
elements were developed and designed in-house and are patent-protected. the heterogeneous combination of different
ring types redura® sealing systems ensure an ideal sealing performance and maximum service life.

68       compensation report | annual report 2014 | burckhardt compression




the aggregate amount of fixed compensation for the period
under review is chf 21’000 less than in the previous period. this
is because the compensation of dr. stephan bross for the year
under review was paid on a pro rata basis only following his
election to the board of directors at the annual general meet-
ing on july 4, 2014. the annual general meeting of july 4, 2014
approved in a consultative vote aggregate fixed compensation
in the amount of chf 400’000 (net, excl. social insurance con-
tributions) for the board of directors (five persons) for fiscal
year 2014. the amount approved in the consultative vote was
not fully expended, primarily due to the pro rata compensation
of the new director dr. stephan bross, who joined the board on
july 4.

5.2 compensation paid to the executive board

to year-end 2013 following a very high invoicing volume towards
the end of the reported fiscal year. the maturity profile of trade
receivables improved in terms of long term overdue positions
(overdue more than 90 days), which amounted to 10.3% of total
accounts receivable (last year 17.8%). the percentage of
accounts receivable not due decreased by 4.2 percentage
points to 64.3%.
    work in progress and advance payments to suppliers as per
fiscal year end 2014 were fully financed by advance payments
from customers, leaving a positive balance of chf 10.0 mn (prior
year –1.3 mn). shareholders’ equity declined by chf 19.9 mn to
chf 338.6 mn, mainly as a result of the defined benefit costs for
the swiss and german pension funds in the amount of
chf 36.5 mn (net of taxes) that had to be charged to the other
comprehensive income under ias 19 accounting rules. this signi­
ficant amount is a consequence of the very low discount rates
applied for actuarial calculation of defined benefit plans as a
consequence of the interest environment in switzerland (nega-
tive prime interest rate). the resulting equity ratio subsided to
49.7% (fy 2013: 55.5%), whereby the aforementioned ias 19
impact alone accounted for 5.4 percentage points in the reduc-
tion of the equity ratio.



cash flow
cash and cash equivalents decreased by chf 23.5 mn and
short- and long-term borrowings were reduced by chf 9.1 mn.
the resulting net financial position per end of fy 2014 amounted
to chf 151.3 mn (fy 2013: chf 165.8 mn). cash flow from oper-
ating activities decreased in fy 2014 by chf 11.4 mn to
chf 46.8 mn, mainly due to the change in other net current
assets as a result of the high production workload. the cash
outflow from investing activities during the period under review
amounted to chf –26.6 mn (prior year –14.2 mn) and included
the cash-out for the addition of intangible and tangible assets
in the context with two smaller acquisitions (samr and
espresso). financing activities generated a cash-out of
chf –43.0 mn (fy 2013: –30.5 mn) mainly comprising 8.0 mn
repayment of mortgage loans on the building in winterthur and
chf 34.0 mn dividend payment (last year chf 30.6 mn).

– currency risks burckhardt compression hedges all major
   usd-denominated sales transactions of its swiss entity
   (burckhardt compression ag). eur-denominated sales and
   purchase transactions of the swiss company are fairly evenly
   balanced when viewed over a period of 1–2 years and are
   therefore, to a certain extent, naturally hedged at the net
   profit level over said period. these foreign-exchange flows are
   regularly monitored by the group treasury; if there is evidence
   of a sustained shift in these flows, major sales and purchase
   transactions will be hedged on a case-by-case basis. for this,
   the group treasury normally uses forward exchange con-
   tracts. the decision of the swiss national bank announced on
   january 15, 2015 to abandon the minimum exchange rate
   eur/chf effective immediately, had a significant negative
   one-time impact on eur-denominated positions on the group’s
   balance sheet that could not be avoided by the existing natu-
   ral hedge policy. given the unique character of this historic
   decision there is no need to adapt the existing policy. the
   other companies belonging to burckhardt compression group
   may, after consultation with group treasury, hedge the for-
   eign-exchange risks of their sales and purchase transactions
   through local qualified institutions or group treasury, the
   objective being the optimization of the net profit of each
   group company as reported in its functional local currency.
   the group management regularly monitors the changes in the
   most important currencies and may adjust hedging policy
   accordingly in the future.
       as a globally active corporation, burckhardt compression
   is also exposed to currency risks resulting from the transla-
   tion into swiss francs of items in the balance sheets of the
   foreign group companies. based on income and invested cap-
   ital, the following currencies are primarily relevant: eur,
   usd, cny and inr. burckhardt compression holding ag does
   not hedge these translation risks.

100    financial report | annual report 2014 | burckhardt compression




impairment tests for goodwill goodwill is allocated to the
identifiable cash-generating units of the burckhardt compres-
sion group (crosshead piston compressors and standard high
pressure compressors). the recoverable amount of a cash-gen-
erating unit is determined by calculating its value in use. these
calculations are based on cash flows projection. for this pur-
pose five planning years are taken into consideration, applying
the parameters listed below as well as a terminal value with no
growth at all. management estimated the planned gross profit
margin based on past developments and the expectations
regarding future market developments. growth rates were
adjusted where necessary. historical data were used to make
cautious assumptions. the assumptions listed below were used
in the analysis of each cash-generating unit. no impairment
losses were recognized for fiscal years 2014 and 2013. sensitiv-
ity analyses were done using parameters such as growth rate
and pre-tax discount rate.
    for the cash-generating unit “crosshead piston compres-
sors” the sensitivity analysis indicated that an impairment can
be reasonably considered unlikely. for the cash-generating unit
“standard high pressure compressors” an increase of the pre-
tax discount rate from 9.9% to 11.3% or a reduction of the
growth rate from 3.2% to –1.7% would result in a value in use
that would be equal to the goodwill amount.

the test is based on the following assumptions:
– growth rate for sales                                                   3.2%                                 1.5%

the test is based on the following assumptions:
– growth rate for sales                                                   5.8%                                 4.8%

the discount rate for discounting projected cash flows equals
the rate which is used for similar purposes in the day-to-day
business. the discount rate applied in the previous fiscal year
for discounting projected cash flows was 9.5%.
