       report

                                    2016 was a tremendous year of celebration for idaho power.
                                    on august 1, we rang the closing bell® at the new york stock
                                    exchange (nyse) to commemorate our 100th year of service in
                                    southern idaho and eastern oregon. generations of idaho power
                                    employees came together to look back at our accomplishments
                                    and forward to the next 100 years of fair-priced, reliable
                                    electrical service.

                                    hydroelectric projects along the snake river and its tributaries
                                    remain the core of our diverse generation portfolio. we are
                                    buying more energy from renewable-energy projects than ever
                                    before. in 2016 alone, 170 megawatts (mw) of capacity from
                                    solar projects came on-line, contributing to a current total of
                                    more than 1,000 mw from 47 independent solar and wind
                                    projects. this trend, along with increased use of cleaner-burning
                                    natural gas, has helped carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from our
                                    company-owned generating resources continue to fall. the co2
                                    emissions from our company-owned generating resources during
                                    2016 were approximately 12.6 percent lower than they were in
                                    2015, and we beat our co2 emissions intensity reduction goal,
                                    ending the year with 28 percent total reduction.

in october 2016, to further our commitment to our customers and as part of our glide
path away from coal, idaho power filed to accelerate the depreciation of our interest in
the north valmy power plant. in assessing resources in our portfolio, we’ve concluded
that valmy may not benefit customers electrically or economically if it continues to
operate beyond 2025. the filing requests an adjustment to customer pricing to reflect
an accelerated depreciable life for the plant.

idacorp again saw improvement in our ranking in the public utilities fortnightly 2016
top 20 financial performers, tying for fifth place. to identify the top 20, utilities are
ranked on six financial metrics. idacorp was also the recipient of the prestigious edison
electric institute (eei) index award at the 51st eei financial conference.

our snake river stewardship program takes an innovative approach to preserving
and improving the snake river’s ability to provide clean water and clean power to our
region for future generations. in 2016, the bayha island research project expanded
wetlands around a tiny island, increasing habitat for plants and wildlife while
deepening and strengthening a portion of our most vital resource.

our employees are at the center of idaho power’s innovative service, environmental
stewardship and community involvement. in recognition of our employees’ long-
standing dedication to the communities we serve, st. luke’s health system and saint
alphonsus health system, the two largest health care providers in our service area,
have presented idaho power with distinguished community service awards. this report
highlights our employees’ outstanding efforts to better serve customers, improve our
business and care for the environment. we are proud of our employees’ commitment to
our industry and our communities.

this year’s sustainability report details how our investments, commitment to
sustainability and innovative workforce drive idaho power’s positioning for the future.
we’re preparing for the next 100 years of service, and we can’t wait to show you how.

strengthening
the snake:                                       it takes a lot of time and hard work to reshape a river. in 2016,
                                                 idaho power took on that challenge, starting with a big project
bayha island                                     on a small island in the snake river.
research project                                 working with the freshwater trust, river design group, the u.s.
                                                 fish and wildlife service and a cooperative private landowner, idaho
                                                 power transformed a tiny, remote snake river island into an ambitious
                                                 experiment aimed at improving snake river water quality.

                                                   improving water quality is a primary goal of idaho power’s
                                                   snake river stewardship program. the snake river stewardship
                                                   program addresses water quality concerns downstream of hells
                                                   canyon as part of idaho power’s application for a new federal
                                                   license to operate its three hydroelectric dams in hells canyon.

                                                 in this section of the snake river, warm water, silted gravel on the
                                                 riverbed and heavy aquatic weed growth reduce water quality and
                                                 aquatic habitat. to improve river conditions, idaho power designed a
                                                 project that would use locally-sourced gravel material to narrow and
                                                 deepen the river channel to reduce warming from the hot summer
                                                 sun. a narrower, deeper river will facilitate increased water velocity
                                                 and reduced solar heating. this will allow more scouring flows, cooler
                                                 water and less aquatic growth. these improved conditions will provide
                                                 a healthier river system for fish, plants and local fauna.

                                                to create the improved conditions, silted gravel was dredged from the
                                                riverbed, and clean gravel was imported from an adjacent landowner’s
                                                property and placed on the newly formed channel. this was completed
                                                around the perimeter of bayha and nearby wright island, both part of
                                                the snake river islands unit of the deer flat national wildlife refuge.

                                               “we added about 50,000 to 60,000 cubic yards of material, or
                                                approximately 10 acres, to the islands,” said senior biologist stacey
                                                baczkowski. “the new acreage is below the ordinary high-water mark,
                                                so we planted the area with native species.”

                                                willows, cottonwoods, golden currant, dogwood, wild rose, sedges,
                                                cattails and other plants were planted as soon as the excavators and

              acres                             dump trucks moved out. the new vegetation also provides wildlife
                                                habitat and improves aquatic habitat. this, and additional in-river
                                                projects planned for the coming years, could make a big difference.
