to our stakeholders




                                      established in 1936, the ricoh group has spent the last 80 years leveraging innovative
                                      technologies, including optical and imaging equipment, to create new value. we now
                                      provide products, services, and solutions in offices and other environments in over 200
                                      countries around the world. the ongoing support of all of our stakeholders, including
                                      customers, shareholders, investors, business partners, employees and communities, has
                                      enabled us to achieve such growth.
                                            recent years have seen rising demand for social sustainability from solutions which
                                      positively impact climate change, poverty, human rights, and other issues. this demand has
                                      arisen due to economic globalization and the growth of emerging nations. at ricoh, we
                                      believe that tackling such challenges in the course of business is vital for us to capitalize on
                                      new opportunities, reduce operational risks and thereby enhance corporate value.
                                            in april 2014, we designed the mid-term management plan to ensure the group’s
                                      long-term progress. since then, we have worked tirelessly to implement the two
                                      fundamental strategies of this initiative, which are to reinforce and develop the earnings
                                      power of core businesses and achieve growth by creating new profit generators. in fiscal
                                      2016, we reformed the sales and services structures of our core businesses. at the same
                                      time, we are cultivating future core areas by reinforcing our inkjet businesses in the
                                      industrial printing market, entering the healthcare arena, and strengthening our
                                      environmental businesses.
                                            we are leveraging the collective talents of our people in keeping with our corporate
                                      tagline of “imagine. change.” in pursuit of our mission, which is to improve the quality of
                                      living and to drive sustainability. we will continue striving toward better tomorrows for
                                      our customers and the communities we serve by constantly creating new value that goes
                                      beyond their expectations and those of our other stakeholders.

leveraging core technologies to deliver new value in healthcare

we acquired the magnetoencephalography business of yokogawa electric corporation in april 2016. we will
combine the medical equipment development and business knowhow we secured through that acquisition with
the imaging technology, systems design capabilities, and production expertise of our core operations to help
prevent and swiftly identify and treat illnesses, helping resolve social issues through such value.

       environmental performance and usability of products
    we launched this initiative in april 2016 to evaluate products based on strict proprietary standards. the
    program assesses our offerings in two prime respects. the first is environmental friendliness, its criteria
    being energy and other resource efficiency and pollution prevention. the second is user friendliness,
    encompassing comfort, usability, and csr. we classify offerings that satisfy all six assessment criteria as
    “sustainable products.” the rating for industry-leading performers is “sustainable products-premium.“
      we have worked hard over the years to secure environmental performance certifications around the
    world. we have also continued to ensure that our products are easy and comfortable for all office work-
    ers to use, including the elderly and individuals with disabilities. we developed the ricoh sustainable
    products program because to this date, there was no external
