                     the shionogi group is pushing ahead with its
                     third medium-term business plan, with the aim
                     of achieving growth over the medium and long terms.
                     the shionogi group is in the midst of implementing its third medium-term business plan, spanning the period
                     from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2014. this plan is designed to enable the shionogi group to overcome the “crestor
                     cliff,” a phrase which refers to the expected drop in royalty income resulting from the expiration of patents for
                     the hyperlipidemia treatment crestor, a mainstay product, in 2016 and 2017, and so continue to grow with-
                     out this royalty income thereafter. we are working hard to bring innovative new drugs to market globally and
                     expand our earnings to realize our medium- to long-term vision.

fiscal 2012: the halfway point of our business plan
and a year of many accomplishments
in fiscal 2012, the year ended march 31, 2013, we secured stable earnings in the japanese market, absorbing
the impact of nhi drug price revisions with steady growth in our eight strategic products, particularly new
drugs. in overseas markets, stable operations produced improved profitability at our us subsidiary, shionogi
inc., while our chinese subsidiary, c&o*1, made its first full-year contribution to our net sales. we are thus
making steady progress solidifying our base for the shionogi group to grow globally.
    fiscal 2012 was a significant year in terms of development compounds that will underpin our future
growth. in anti-hiv drugs, in october 2012 we entered into an agreement that substantially revised our inte-
grase inhibitor relationship with uk-based development partner viiv*2, which has clarified future earnings
prospects. in december 2012, viiv filed new drug applications (nda) in the us, eu and canada for the anti-
hiv agent dolutegravir (generic name), and expects to gain approval and launch the drug in the us in the
summer of 2013. what’s more, our treatment for postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy osphenatm
(ospemifene) gained regulatory approval in the us in february 2013 and was launched the following june.
other compounds in late-stage clinical development on a global basis also made steady progress.
    on the earnings front, as part of efforts to improve our earnings structure ahead of the “crestor cliff,” we
worked to reduce costs even more across the company. as a result of these efforts, all income levels were
higher than the levels in any prior fiscal year. we are now working to ensure that we achieve our business plan
targets for fiscal 2013.




stepping up globalization to grow again
after the 2016 “crestor cliff”
we aim to secure stable earnings in japan, our mother market, and at the same time continuously launch
proprietary products through our subsidiaries in the us, the world’s largest pharmaceutical market, and the
fast-growing chinese market to grow steadily on a global basis. in terms of research and development, in
addition to priority therapeutic areas such as metabolic syndrome, we will take on the challenge of research in
new therapeutic areas with high unmet medical need*3, including central nervous system disorders. we are
determined to quickly develop future growth drivers globally, while also utilizing our uk subsidiary.
    the shionogi group will work as one to steadily execute the basic strategies of its third medium-term busi-
ness plan to meet the demands of society and develop continuously. in this way, we will realize the company
policy of shionogi globally, and deliver the tangible benefits of growth to all our stakeholders. we look for-
ward to receiving ongoing support and guidance from all our stakeholders.

10 shionogi annual report 2013

shionogi has positioned fiscal 2013 as the first
year of the group’s globalization, and we will
  work over the course of this year toward
    realizing our company policy globally.

    in the wake of realignment within the domestic pharmaceutical industry
    —a consequence of widespread m&a activity—and with multinational
    drugmakers pushing deeper into the japanese market, the shionogi group
    has established development and sales bases in the us, europe, and asia
    with a view to ensuring ongoing, steady, and independent growth as an
    r&d-oriented global pharmaceutical company. as a result of these efforts,
    we are now poised to move onto a higher growth trajectory.


    in fiscal 2013, the group as a whole will clarify priorities when determining
    cost allocation, putting the highest priority on new products launched on
    the us market, as a means of growing overseas sales. having identified
    fiscal 2013 as the first year of shionogi’s globalization, we will also seek to
    plant in our domestic employees the realization that shionogi is now a
    global company, requiring them to adopt a much broader mindset.


    continuous global development of breakthrough new drugs is required if
    the shionogi group is to survive fierce competition, overcome the “crestor
    cliff” that will occur between 2016 and 2017, and achieve further growth
    in the post-crestor era. to that end, our employees are working as one to
    realize the shionogi company policy globally, in the spirit of striving con-
    stantly to ensure that patients around the world have access to the best
    new drugs, as soon as humanly possible.




                                                                                      shionogi annual report 2013   11

       interview with the president




         question           first, could you outline the initiatives being taken to globalize
             1              operations as a means of overcoming the “crestor cliff,” and describe
                            the results seen in fiscal 2012?

                            as the domestic prescription pharmaceuticals market is not expected to expand further going for-
                            ward, shionogi must pursue a more significant presence in the large us and european markets, as
                            well as in china and other emerging economies that are expected to experience high growth. more
                            so than ever before, we must apply a global perspective to determining how best to utilize the
                            group’s limited resources in terms of manpower, goods, and capital in order to maximize the value
                            of pipeline products by bringing them to market quickly. it is essential to make timely decisions on
                            what products to prioritize in which markets, and on whether it is best in each case to go it alone,
                            or to develop the product jointly with another company, or alternatively secure a licensing agree-
                            ment. in this sense, fiscal 2012 was an important year in terms of laying the groundwork for further
                            globalization of the shionogi group.




                            we revised an agreement with viiv healthcare
                 1
                            concerning anti-hiv drugs, which we believe will
                            evolve into a key pillar of earnings.
                            in october 2012, we restructured an agreement with uk-based pharmaceutical company viiv
                            healthcare, partner in the joint development of anti-hiv drugs that we hope will become an

                 2          we have now launched osphenatm in the us,
                            as the shionogi group’s first global drug.
                            june 2013 saw the launch in the us (the world’s largest pharmaceutical market) of the shionogi
                            group’s first global drug, osphenatm, for the treatment of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atro-
                            phy (vva). right now, the entire group’s top priority is to quickly maximize the value of osphenatm,
                            which we believe has a significant role to play in improving patients’ qol (quality of life). in fiscal
                            2013, the group will strive as one to increase sales of osphenatm in the us market.


                            in march 2013, we also submitted a marketing authorization application (maa) to the european
                            medicines agency (ema), and we are now in the process of selecting commercialization partners in
                            the eu. we hope that we can also quickly deliver this drug to patients suffering from vva in europe
                            as well to contribute to treatment.


                            we believe that, with the aforementioned changes to our agreement with viiv regarding anti-hiv
                            drugs, the us launch of global product osphenatm and other developments, we have paved the
                            way for shionogi to overcome the “crestor cliff” and further grow its operations.


                            we are also working to enrich and accelerate our development pipeline to secure growth drivers
                            other than these two products. with an eye to further enhancing development efficiency, shionogi
                            will strengthen global portfolio management, redoubling efforts to develop and market proprietary
                            medicines across our entire network—in japan, the us, and europe, and also in china.




                                                                                     osphenatm was launched in june 2013

strategy for surmounting the “crestor cliff” (2)

 about global drug osphenatm
 osphenatm provides a new treatment option for the many women troubled by dyspareunia (painful intercourse)
 due to menopause.


 while approximately 32 million postmenopausal women in the us experience symptoms of vva, only around 2.3 million are
 being treated with a prescription medication. it seems the majority of women with vva are not being treated because
 women and their doctors are not proactively discussing the condition and its symptoms.

 n product profile

   • osphenatm, an estrogen agonist / antagonist with tissue selective
     effects, is the first oral alternative to existing vaginal estrogens
   • it binds to estrogen receptors, resulting in activation of estro-
     genic pathways in some tissues (agonism) and blockade of
     estrogenic pathways in others (antagonism)
   • clinical trials confirmed the efficacy and safety of osphenatm,
     which demonstrated significant improvements in dyspareunia
     relative to placebo, in the form of an increase in the propor-
     tion of superficial cells and a decrease in the proportion of
     parabasal cells and reduction in vaginal ph

       interview with the president




         question           please discuss the global development compounds that
             2              you believe can function as new growth drivers alongside
                            dolutegravir and osphenatm.

                            our pipeline includes a number of products that we believe hold the key to shionogi’s future
                            growth, among them cancer peptide vaccines, and late-stage development compounds such as
                            s-297995 for the alleviation of constipation and other opioid*-induced adverse effects, and the
                            allergic rhinitis treatment s-555739. furthermore, in october 2012, we expanded offerings in one
                            of our core therapeutic areas by entering into a license agreement with kotobuki pharmaceutical
                            co., ltd., for a hypercholesterolemia treatment that has a different mechanism of action from
                            crestor. in the same month, we inked an agreement with us-based janssen pharmaceuticals, inc.,
                            aimed at speeding up development and maximizing the value of drug candidates in the sphere of
                            alzheimer’s disease treatment, thereby enhancing our contribution to patients worldwide. under
                            the terms of this contract, a drug candidate for alzheimer’s disease discovered by shionogi and
                            employing a new mechanism of action was licensed out to janssen, which has a wealth of experi-
                            ence and expertise in development in this therapeatic area.


                            in r&d, our promotion of collaboration with japanese and international universities and research
                            institutions has contributed already to the discovery of innovative new drug candidates. it is also
                            significant, we think, that the vva treatment osphenatm has secured fda approval on schedule,
                            and under favorable conditions, in an era when new drugs for obstetrics and gynecology are fre-
                            quently knocked back. this is a source of pride, as we regard this as testament to the shionogi
                            group’s improved development prowess. at shionogi, we will continue striving to bring revolution-
                            ary new products to patients around the world as soon as humanly possible, maintaining our cre-
                            dentials as an r&d-oriented global pharmaceutical company by keeping r&d expenditure at around
                            20% of consolidated sales, while clearly defining the priority assigned to individual compounds.

         question           please describe the current state of, and future outlook for,
             3              the chinese business.

                            china’s pharmaceutical market is on track to overtake japan as the second largest in the world.
                            through c&o pharmaceutical technology (holdings) limited (c&o), a subsidiary since 2011, the
                            shionogi group has used its many years of experience in promoting the proper use of drugs for
                            infectious diseases in japan to garner a greater share of the chinese market, principally in antibiotics.
                            unfortunately, however, shionogi’s drugs still have not sufficiently reached chinese patients.


                            we aim to steadily grow the shionogi group’s china sales over the medium to long term and in the
                            process make a greater contribution to medical care in china. this will be achieved by having c&o
                            develop and launch new shionogi-brand products. we will also promote research and development
                            collaboration with chinese academic centers of excellence, largely through beijing shionogi phar-
                            maceutical technology limited, another china subsidiary launched in june 2013.

         question           what was your intention in restructuring the group’s production
             4              and supply chain organizations?

                            in april 2013, we undertook organizational changes aimed at improving the accuracy of our global
                            production set-up and supply chain management (scm). we will work to ensure a stable supply of
                            high-quality products globally by promoting greater collaboration between the manufacturing divi-
                            sion and the newly created global scm division, optimizing operations and reducing our cost of sales
                            through a global manufacturing management system spanning production strategy and planning,
                            procurement, manufacturing and inventory control. this new approach to scm got its first test in
                            june 2013, with the us launch of our new vva treatment, osphenatm.

question   finally, please discuss initiatives planned to increase corporate value
  5        and shareholder returns over the medium and long term.

           the shionogi group’s basic policy for profit distribution is to maintain stable dividends for share-
           holders while taking into account capital demands for future business development and profits
           earned in the relevant fiscal period.


           among the company’s major achievements in fiscal 2012 was the revision of our alliance with viiv
           concerning the development of anti-hiv drugs. we believe the new scheme clarifies the future
           earnings prospects of dolutegravir—which we expect will attain blockbuster status—and other
           franchise products. we further believe that with the us launch of osphenatm for the treatment of
           vva, we have succeeded in stabilizing the longer-term outlook for overseas operations, in doing so
           enhancing prospects for growth. because of these events, as of the end of fiscal 2012 shionogi has
           increased its consolidated dividend payout ratio target from 35% to 40% to return profits to its
           shareholders. based on this new dividend policy, shionogi will raise the year-end cash dividend for
           fiscal 2012 by ¥2 per share to ¥22. together with the interim cash dividend, we will therefore pay
           annual cash dividends of ¥42 per share.


           the shionogi group will continue to proactively undertake business activities with an eye to
           enhancing corporate value, our longer-term objective being to steadily increase the returns deliv-
           ered to shareholders.

   form, manufacturing method, and formulation. through such activities, shionogi
   filed approximately 110 patent applications in fiscal 2012, of which about 40%
   were filed overseas. with an eye to growth in emerging markets, the company has
   stepped up patent filings in such countries. the company periodically reviews its
   patent portfolio, taking cost into account. as of march 31, 2013, shionogi held
   approximately 190 patents in japan and about 120 patent families overseas.
        as part of its business strategy, the company takes every care to conduct intel-
   lectual property due diligence when in-licensing and out-licensing products, and to
   ward against potential patent infringement. shionogi is also engaged in brand
   design activities as a means of reliability assurance in the company and its products
   and combating counterfeiting. in fiscal 2012, the company filed 31 applications for
   trademark registration, and 13 applications for design registration.
        to further its evolution as a pharmaceutical manufacturer, shionogi will continue
   working as one to implement the intellectual creation cycle—which creates, pro-
   tects and generates earnings from intellectual property.

                                             fiscal 2012 was a year of significant progress for shionogi inc.  we achieved all of our financial
                                             targets, and we have now realized six consecutive quarters of on-target financial perfor-
                                             mance. this gives us a solid, stable base on which to build going forward.


                                             initiatives for expanding osphenatm
                                             for fiscal 2013, the most important event for shionogi inc. is the impending launch of osphenatm, a first-in-
                                             class oral drug for the treatment of dyspareunia (painful intercourse), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atro-
       shionogi inc.
                                             phy (vva) due to menopause.  approved by the fda on february 26, 2013, osphenatm represents the first
       president & ceo
                                             new chemical entity ever to be filed, approved, and launched by shionogi in the us in our 135-year history.
       john keller, ph.d.
                                             with an estimated 32 million women in the us experiencing symptoms of vva – over 90% of whom are not
                                             being treated with a prescription medicine – we have a tremendous opportunity to make a difference for
                                             patients and establish ourselves as an innovative new entrant in the underserved area of women’s health.
                                             osphenatm’s launch also represents the turning point at which shionogi inc. can become a major contributor
                                             to shionogi’s global growth.
                                                 as we began fiscal 2013, therefore, we were intensively preparing for the launch, finalizing our plans and
                                             strengthening and training our sales force for osphenatm. we have also begun outreach to women’s health
                                             groups who have expressed strong interest in this new therapy.


                                             efforts to develop the next proprietary drug after osphenatm
                                             even given our excitement about osphenatm, we have not lost focus on the numerous clinical studies initiating and
                                             progressing for the us development of our shionogi-discovered pipeline. perhaps the most important amongst
                                             these is the initiation of phase iii pivotal studies of naldemedine (s-297995) for the treatment of opioid-induced
                                             constipation. if we are successful, naldemedine will succeed osphenatm’s “firsts” by becoming the first internally
                                             discovered new chemical entity to be launched by shionogi in the us.


                                             my role as a corporate officer of shionogi & co., ltd.
                                             i was deeply honored to have been named a corporate officer of shionogi & co., ltd. in 2013. on reflec-
                                             tion, i fully realize that the progress we have made in the us is truly the result of a dedicated team effort
                                             across the global shionogi family, whose members work intensively and creatively to advance our pipeline
                                             and to support our business, so that together we can improve patients’ health and quality of life and thus
                                             realize shionogi’s mission every day. i hope i will be able to contribute more to the success of shionogi &
                                             co., ltd. globally, both within and beyond shionogi inc.



            voice                                       as i work with colleagues to successfully launch osphenatm in the us, i reflect back on the incredi-
          from the                                      ble collaboration with global shionogi partners that has enabled shionogi inc. to reach this mile-

                                                        production of the product. all of these groups also played critical roles in responding to questions
                                                        from the fda, which ultimately facilitated the on-time approval of osphenatm.
                                                             i am both proud and energized to be part of this team. it is my greatest hope that the collabo-

                                                        maximizing global opportunities for osphenatm and pipeline products that will follow.

                                          the company’s mainstay products are antibiotics, spearheaded by flumarin and amolin (amoxicillin). china

                                          at the same time, we will focus on r&d geared toward the launch of products discovered internally, striv-

                                      medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve—c&o will redouble efforts to develop

     voice                                        although c&o only joined the “shionogi family” in 2011, our employees are secure in the

                                 the global scm division approaches its business with three main goals: (1) to strengthen the

                                 production strategy, and (3) to cultivate human resources able to accomplish these. in order to
                                 achieve these goals we set three policies: (i) establishment of an aggressive gscm system
                                 through operational innovation, (ii) firm cost control toward cash flow maximization, and

                                 business in collaboration with related divisions.

                  the shionogi group has set forth the goal of its corporate activities as being “to strive constantly to
                  supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve” in the
                  company policy instituted in 1957. this eternal and unwavering corporate philosophy is a statement of
                  our vision and value to society. our operations as a pharmaceutical company inherently contribute to
                  society, and we believe that implementing this philosophy promotes the fulfillment of our social respon-
                  sibilities as a corporation.
                     we have also formulated the shionogi charter of conduct to guide our efforts in conducting corpo-
                  rate activities that are suited to a truly rich and vibrant civil society as a corporate citizen and as a phar-
                  maceutical manufacturer with awareness of social responsibility based on high ethical values. in recent
                  years, more and more has been expected of companies in terms of csr (corporate social responsibility)
                  activities. in line with this trend, shionogi is actively implementing csr activities such as creating inno-
                  vative pharmaceuticals and developing specialized human resources so as to fulfill its corporate respon-
                  sibility to the economy, environment and society, and to earn the trust and understanding of society as
                  a good corporate citizen.



                     shionogi charter of conduct
                     as a company that contributes to the maintenance and improvement of the health of people around the world as well as
                     their comfortable lives, shionogi formulated the charter of conduct in the hope that our activities can benefit all
                     stakeholders, including patients, shareholders and the general public, and lead to the growth of individual employees. all
                     shionogi employees pledge to act in the spirit of the charter of conduct, and senior management takes responsibility for
                     serving as role models themselves and for rigorously ensuring the charter of conduct is understood. at the same time, we
                     pledge to establish and refine effective internal systems for conforming with the company’s rules.

  messages from outside directors
                 akio nomura
                               since my appointment as an outside director, i have felt that shionogi is a pharmaceuticals manufacturer that conducts
                               corporate activities based on high ethical values and in accordance with the company policy which states “shionogi
                               strives constantly to supply the best possible medicine to protect the health and wellbeing of the patients we serve.”
                                   in order for a company to earn the trust of society and continuously develop, it must actively disclose information
                               while ensuring transparency in its own decision-making. shionogi’s board of directors makes open and fair manage-
                               ment decisions, always mindful of its accountability.
                                   i draw on my experience as a corporate manager and place importance on my neutrality as an independent direc-
                               tor, as i work to further increase corporate value from an objective perspective. i also work to ensure shionogi develops
                               further and contributes broadly to society.

                               as economic globalization gathers pace, it has been very important for japanese companies to comply with various
                               laws and regulations in countries around the world, such as anti-trust laws and the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act
                               (fcpa), and of course to observe laws and regulations in japan.
                                   shionogi’s management must be sufficiently aware of overseas laws and regulations before executing business as
                               the company develops business globally.
                                   i am using my experience related to international legal affairs to contribute as an outside director to the refinement
                               and operation of a global compliance and risk management system. at the same time, i offer appropriate advice with
                               a legal focus for management decisions.

                               the manufacturing industry, including the pharmaceuticals business, is a precious industry for a resource-poor country
                               like japan. the role it plays is an extremely large one indeed. however, amid increasing uncertainty surrounding the
                               global economy and escalating competition, there are greater demands for swift management decision-making that
                               weighs up both the risks and rewards.
                                   based on my management experience at a global manufacturing company and the objective, outside perspective of
                               shareholders and other stakeholders, i am determined to contribute to the even more objective and transparent man-
                               agement of shionogi while maintaining the overarching perspective of being a stakeholder myself.

   at the end of the fiscal year ended march 31, 2013, the company
and subsidiaries revised the discount rate of 2.0%, which was applied
at the beginning of the fiscal year. as a result, the company deter-
mined that a change in the discount rate would significantly affect the
amount of the retirement benefit obligation, and therefore changed the
discount rate to 1.2%.
