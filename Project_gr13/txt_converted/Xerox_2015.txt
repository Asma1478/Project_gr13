            our commitment

            ceo letter
            message from ursula burns, chairman and chief executive officer


            dear stakeholders:


            it is my privilege to introduce you to the 2015 xerox global citizenship report. it represents
            xerox’s ongoing efforts to challenge ourselves to be a role model for the positive contributions we
            make to the world around us.


            this year’s edition marks our 10th annual report and as such it has a new look and feel, designed
            to make it easier for you to find the information you’re seeking and to take a deep dive into areas
            of special interest to you.


            during the last few years, we’ve broadened the company with the expansion of our services
            capabilities and we are now better positioned and equipped than ever to help the world work a
            little better. at the same time, we have deepened our dedication to responsible global citizenship,
            which is an inextricable part of our heritage.


            since our founding over a century ago, we’ve been motivated to make positive contributions to
            the communities in which we operate and to the world at large. that motivation is driven by our
            values and highest ideals of integrity, innovation and excellence. you will see that philosophy
            running throughout this report. it’s organized around five themes that capture the essence of our
            citizenship efforts:


            in doing good business, you will learn why we believe that strong corporate governance is critical
            to long-term value creation, and how we strive to make certain that every aspect of our business
            — from supplier relations to financial practices — operates according to the highest standards of
            ethics and integrity. for example, we require all employees to complete ethics and compliance
            training annually. in 2014, xerox people completed more than 1 million hours of training on topics
            from ethics to anti-bribery.


            in evolving the workplace, you will find information about our continuing efforts to build and
            foster a strong, diverse and dynamic workforce with the experience, skills, passion and energy to
            deliver high performance. for example, we announced a new diversity policy called the “wilson
            rule.” it’s named after joe wilson — the first ceo of xerox and a champion of equal opportunity
            in hiring practices. the policy requires that women and minorities, when available, be interviewed
            as part of the pool of qualified candidates for an open management position in the u.s. outside
            the u.s., women, when available, will be interviewed as part of the pool of qualified candidates.


            in putting customers first, you will learn about our passion for customers and how our research
            and innovation helps them better serve their clients and our society. for example, our xerox maven
            solution works across the public health ecosystem supporting data sharing and coordination
            among epidemiologists and medical professionals on the front lines of preventing and containing


                                                                                                                  2/147

            90-plus communicable diseases. it was recently used by the new york city department of health
            and mental hygiene as part of the ebola preparedness and response, and is also used by 12 other
            public health agencies in the u.s. and australia.


            in preserving the planet, you will see how our environmental strategy spans the entire business —
            from internal operations, to the sustainability services we provide clients, to how we engage with
            partners, suppliers and employees. as one example illustrating the steps we are taking along those
            lines, we joined the sustainable electronic recycling international (seri) coalition to help launch a
            program that encourages companies to responsibly reuse and recycle electronics. by partnering
            with seri to support the u.s. environmental protection agency’s r2 leader program, we’re
            extending the reach of our sustainability practices to our customers and others in the industry,
            magnifying our positive impact on our world.


            in caring for communities, you will get an overview of how our people invest their time and
            talent in a wide variety of organizations to strengthen the communities in which they work and
            live. for example, as early as 1968, our scientists were encouraged to donate their time to teach
            elementary school students the wonders of science, motivate them to consider pursuing studies
            and careers in science and technology, and provide good role models to emulate. nearly 50 years
            later, that program is alive and well.


            those are just a few examples of the things we’re doing to nurture a holistic citizenship program
            that benefits people, communities and the planet, and also creates value for xerox employees, our
            customers and our shareholders.


            as a 35-year veteran of xerox, i have a great appreciation for what a force a global company can
            be for the betterment of mankind. the more we do, the more we discover what we must do. all of
            us at xerox embrace that challenge and are determined to continue to drive meaningful
            innovation and beneficial change to better the world community we all share. we invite you to
            join us on our journey.




                                                                                                                    3/147

            how we report
            this report describes xerox’s global principles, policies and programs through september 2015,
            unless otherwise noted. it provides in-depth information in broad areas of corporate social
            responsibility, including governance and ethics, customer privacy and satisfaction, employee
            diversity and development, environmental initiatives, corporate donations and volunteerism, and
            much more.


            we report yearly on our progress, including changes to our business and emerging issues. this
            report was prepared using the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 sustainability reporting
            guidelines and contains standard disclosures. a table linking the content of this report to the gri
            g4 standard disclosures follows can be found here. xerox did not seek external assurance for this
            report.


            much of the information in this report reflects the activities of xerox in the countries where we do
            business. some of our systems for collecting and reporting reliable social and environmental
            performance data, however, do not always cover all of our operations. where appropriate, we
            identify operations excluded from specific disclosures. fuji xerox publishes its own citizenship
            report. information about gri is available at www.globalreporting.org.


            as part of our ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, we welcome your feedback. for additional
            information, questions or comments on this report, please e-mail us at citizenship@xerox.com.

            our commitment

            materiality
            in 2015, we updated our materiality approach in alignment with gri g4 guidelines, company
            strategy and stakeholder feedback. we examined changing external factors including regulations
            and standards, social challenges people face around the world, our evolving business model, and
            environmental impacts of our products, services, processes and operations. our assessment
            included an array of fact-finding forums, including interviews and workshops with internal
            stakeholders and xerox leaders. it also included reviews of public and internal xerox documents,
            discussions with external stakeholders and feedback from our employees. we concluded:


                 managing operations responsibly across our value chain — from decreasing environmental
                 impacts to protecting customer privacy, to promoting diversity and ensuring ethical behavior
                 — remains a priority for xerox.
                 product, service and operations-related opportunities, such as improving energy efficiency and
                 expanding access to technology, represent the leading areas where we can create value for
                 society and for our business. enhancing health, safety and labor conditions in our global
                 value chain is among the most important ways we can drive sustainable development.

            with these findings, we developed a new set of environmental sustainability goals and priorities,
            expanded our governance structure and reaffirmed the importance of our partnerships with non-
            government organizations, customers, academia and regulatory agencies, and the code of conduct
            to which we hold our employees and global suppliers accountable.


            the following schematic summarizes the results of our materiality assessment for corporate social
            responsibility.

            preserving the planet

            goals and progress
            through our people, innovation and partnerships, we create solutions that reduce environmental
            impact and expand opportunities. we have conducted a comprehensive review of the
            environmental impact of our company and have identified four strategic commitment areas where
            we can make a significant positive impact:


            1. reducing energy use and protecting the climate
               we invest in technologies that reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and offer
               solutions to our customers that reduce energy use, cost and waste.

            2. preserving the world’s forests and biodiversity
               we work with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to support the development of a
               sustainable paper cycle through paper sourcing guidelines and environmentally sound paper
               offerings, as well as through products and services that decrease dependency on paper.

            3. preserving clean air and water
               we work to eliminate the use of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials throughout the
               supply chain. we look for ways to use water efficiently and to avoid the release of hazardous

            1 products end-of-life management: returns processed through xerox’s worldwide asset recovery centers and third-
            party recyclers. 2012 data adjusted to include units sold as used through new resale program introduced 4th
            quarter 2012. in 2014, xerox’s operation in itatiaia brazil sent surplus parts to landfill as part of a one-time clean-
            up. this resulted in a decrease in the reuse/recycle rate of products and consumables returned to xerox.


            2 in 2012, the supplies returns program changed the array of cartridges and bottles accepted. the weights of
            those containers also changed. the data was restated to reflect more accurate volumes. the 2013 supplies
            remanufacturing volumes were restated to reflect an error discovered in the total units returned.


            3 the greenhouse gas inventory is based on the new xerox energy goal, which began in 2013 using 2012 as
            baseline, and encompasses fleet and facilities for the technology business and services. note: the 2012 baseline
            has been restated. in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol, inventory adjustments are completed each
            year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and the use of more appropriate emission factors to make
            data and performance trends between years more comparable.
            * note: the new energy goal 2020 uses 2012 as baseline.


            4 direct emissions from natural gas and fuel used in fleet of xerox sales and service personnel and natural gas
            consumed in facility boilers for facilities both leased and owned by xerox. emissions for facilities are based on
            actual data as reported on utility invoices, with estimates for remainder of facilities in the inventory using
            commercial building energy consumption (cbec) energy use factors. emissions from fleet are based on actual fuel
            receipts and vehicle efficiency rates. note that 2012 data has been restated as new emission factors were used.


            5 indirect emissions of greenhouse gases include emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity and
            steam for facilities leased and owned by xerox. cbecs energy use factors were used to include estimated emissions
            for office and warehouse facilities where data is not readily available (u.s. and canada). hfc emissions were
            estimated based on square feet. note that 2012 data has been restated as new emission factors were used.


            6 indirect emissions for worldwide xerox services data centers, located in the u.s. and europe. based on actual
            data as reported on utility invoices in the u.s. and the u.k. estimates were used for the remaining data centers,
            based on the average energy consumption per square foot using power usage effectiveness (pue).


            7 renewable energy and renewable energy credits. it does not include the renewable energy available by default in

            preserving the planet

            environmental leadership
            as innovators who introduced two-sided copying in 1970, xerox has continued to participate at the
            forefront of environmental sustainability, from creating the first recycled grade of cut sheet paper
            to being the first to offer office equipment with an energy-saving mode — long before energy
            star® was established.


            in 2014, xerox again took the lead with nine other organizations, partnering with sustainable
            electronics recycling international (seri) on its r2 leader program in an effort to advance
            responsible reuse and recycling of used electronics.


            governance
            our corporate environment, health, safety and sustainability (ehs&s) governance policy, first
            adopted in 1991, supports our environmental leadership program. (to review this policy, visit
            www.xerox.com/environment.) our environmental governance model uses clearly defined goals, a
            set of worldwide standards and an audit process to validate compliance.


            the vice president of strategic partnerships & alliances and ehs&s is responsible for overseeing
            our environmental governance and for leading our corporate social responsibility (csr) council.
            the csr council is responsible for the materiality assessment process and establishment of
            associated goals and key performance indicators on all csr related issues. the council reports
            progress to the csr steering committee, corporate management committee and the board. for
            more on our csr governance model, go to our governance section of this report. the vice
            president of strategic partnerships & alliances and ehs&s reports to the president of corporate
            operations, who is a corporate officer and a direct report to the ceo.


            our enterprise risk management (erm) process, overseen by the xerox board of directors,
            strengthens our capability to assess, monitor and manage all categories of business risk, including
            climate change. vital strategic and operational risks identified are approved by the corporate
            management committee (cmc) and reviewed annually by the board.


            a risk mitigation plan, in which leaders are assigned to each identified risk, is developed and
            reviewed by the cmc and the board. the business ethics and compliance office and various
            internal control committees also monitor risk management and exposure. the board of directors
            regularly reviews the enterprise risk profile and monitors the effectiveness of management policies
            and decisions, including risk management activities.


            the office of global government affairs is responsible for tracking external developments,
            including climate change policy, and for determining if these developments are likely to affect
            xerox products and operations. through trade associations and partnerships, ehs&s tracks
            applicable regulations and also policy changes that may affect the company. we develop
            processes, new technologies and products to counter the risks associated with external changes.




                                                                                                                   37/147

            our major operating units and key corporate functions (e.g., risk management, real estate) also
            are responsible for evaluating, monitoring and managing, within their respective businesses, site-
            specific risks that potentially have an impact on xerox’s ability to achieve its overall business
            objectives. the business continuity assurance process ensures business units are prepared for
            environmental risks.


            standards and programs
            environment, health and safety standards guide employees and suppliers in complying with
            corporate policies. these worldwide standards apply across xerox and establish specific
            requirements for products, services, operations, product safety, materials safety, packaging, design
            for environment and environmental management. we also have established company-wide
            programs, such as zero injury, to engage employees worldwide.


            supply chain management
            as a critical element of supply chain governance, we extend environment, health and safety
            requirements across our supply chain. since 1998, we have asked our materials, electronics and
            component suppliers to meet specific environmental, health and safety requirements. these
            requirements were broadened in 2004 to better govern the use of chemicals in our products, parts
            and supplies throughout the supply chain. the xerox standard, “xerox environmental, health and
            safety supplier requirements: chemical bans/restrictions and part marking,” establishes
            requirements for regulatory compliance for parts and materials intended for use in electronic
            products. the standard also requires that suppliers utilize socially responsible supply chain due
            diligence practices in various operations, including but not limited to mining and smelting
            operations.


            further, by adopting the electronic industry citizenship coalition’s (eicc) code of conduct, we
            have strengthened our commitment to ensure that our technology suppliers are operating
            according to accepted industry standards for environmental management. in 2013, our vice
            president of ehs&s was selected by eicc as a member of the eicc senior executive advisory
            council.


            for more information, see the supplier relations section of this report.


            employee engagement and training
            employees and third-party contractors learn how our operations affect the environment and
            employee safety through training and internal communication. beginning with our new hire
            orientation, employees are made aware of company-wide environment, health and safety
            requirements. global programs such as energy challenge, zero injury, sustainable you,
            environmental faces of xerox and the xerox earth awards engage employees throughout the
            company. regional earth and safety fairs and green teams also help to communicate challenges,
            best practices and accomplishments.


            yammer, our internal social media network, allows our employees across the globe to connect with
            each other. through groups such as working green, living green and simply well, employees
            exchange information about the environment, safety and health. the xerox yammer network
            boasts nearly 25,000 employees worldwide.



                                                                                                                   38/147

            the formation of local “green teams” provides employees, who are part of a common work group
            or share a workspace, with the opportunity to work together to educate, support and seek process
            or site changes that will enable environmental improvements, cost savings or productivity
            improvements.


            as appropriate, employees receive training on topics such as hazardous waste management, spill
            prevention and response, recycling, iso 14001 and a variety of other topics. in addition to safety
            topics for which regulations require training, employees are trained on established safe job
            procedures based upon the job-specific hazards they may encounter and procedures and protective
            equipment they are expected to use. a significant number of procurement professionals
            participated in training on xerox corporate sustainability goals to re-emphasize our socially
            responsible purchasing policy.


            our environmental management policy is available on the xerox internal website. we
            communicate environment, health and safety goals to all our operations and integrate those goals
            into processes for product development and services. through our iso 14001 environment
            management system, employees identify the environmental aspects associated with their
            responsibilities. our services facilities management personnel are introduced to our environmental
            sustainability and compliance programs and trained to identify sustainability opportunities and
            perform regulatory applicability assessments. this training included both xerox facilities personnel
            and those from our third-party management company.


            stakeholder outreach
            we communicate with stakeholders about environmental health and safety programs, goals and
            performance. stakeholders include employees, customers, investors, universities, government
            agencies and environmental groups. we track inquiries and comments from customers and other
            stakeholders. customers provide input through focus groups, and we tap into the larger community
            through participation in external organizations.


            in june 2014, xerox and nine other organizations partnered with sustainable electronics recycling
            international (seri) on its r2 leader program in an effort to advance responsible reuse and
            recycling of used electronics. this also aligns us with both internal and external stakeholder
            expectations for environmentally responsible management of used and end-of-life equipment.


            the program includes a commitment from the participating companies and organizations to
            support r2 certified electronics refurbishment and recycling, as well as considering r2 certification
            when choosing a recycling partner. r2 leaders, including xerox, take a leadership role in projects
            for responsible reuse and recycling around the world. by vetting our recycling vendors for r2
            certification, we ensure they are responsible recyclers.


            in 2014 two xerox locations obtained r2 certification for their ongoing operations.

            preserving the planet

            sustainable services and products
            we consider environmental priorities in the design of each product and service solution; it’s better
            for our customers, our business and the environment. at the outset, we solicit feedback from
            clients and other stakeholders and take a forward-looking view of global trends in technology,
            regulations and eco-labels. we’ve developed a comprehensive sustainability program based on
            global standards and quantitative analysis.

            reducing environmental impact through our services and solutions
            our expanding services business offers solutions that reduce energy consumption and improve
            environmental performance.


            we also help businesses resume after catastrophic events. with locations around the world and a
            comprehensive business resumption plan, we enable businesses whose plants or offices may be
            closed or debilitated to continue to function.


            we provide an array of solutions to improve the productivity of transportation systems, it
            infrastructures and back-office processing. an added benefit of many of these solutions is the
            opportunity to decrease environmental impact through reduced electricity usage, reduction in
            paper waste and reduced consumption of gasoline. for example, xerox’s merge™ parking solution
            uses occupancy data from meters, sensors, and collection systems to enable rates to vary by
            location and time of day to create availability. this reduces time spent searching for on-street
            parking, reducing fuel usage and leading to associated air quality improvements. the merge™
            parking management system was recently recognized as a “product of the year” by environmental
            leader, a leading daily trade publication. read more about our work with the city of calgary, the

            solutions for the transportation industry.


            we work with customers to improve the efficiency of office document management by assessing
            printing needs and developing solutions. this leads to dramatically reducing stand-alone and
            networked office equipment devices, incorporating workflow tools, software applications and other
            technologically innovative equipment designs, as well as saving energy and associated greenhouse
            gas emissions while reducing solid waste.

            in 2014 xerox launched completeview™ pro, a tool in the managed print assessment process that,
            in part, provides customers with a sustainability analysis documenting the environmental impact of
            print output such as power consumption and co2 emissions by device and site. learn more at
            managed print services.


            standards
            our product standards encompass the following: energy efficiency, chemical management,
            packaging, parts reuse and recycling, electrical and mechanical safety, ergonomics, electromagnetic
            emissions, noise, fire resistance and materials safety. xerox business teams and the ehs&s
            organization review our products at each stage of the development process for conformance with
            environmental, health and safety standards, a requirement for the introduction of any new
            product. all xerox standards ensure our products have the appropriate labels and information
            needed to meet all safety and environmental label requirements allowing our customers to be
            appropriately informed. all products meet required industry labeling standards for each market.


            lifecycle assessment
            we integrate lifecycle thinking into all of our product and service development activities as well as
            our innovation activities. we conduct full lifecycle assessments (lca) — in accordance with
            appropriate iso standards — to compare products with a significant difference in technology and
            determine where in the product lifecycle the largest environmental impacts arise. full peer-
            reviewed lcas have been conducted on our solid ink products (8860, 8870, 8700 and colorqube
            9200 series). in addition, in 2013 we completed our first comparison of our toner cartridge system
            to a competitor’s all-in-one cartridge system. this study compared the xerox laser product (phaser
            6600) with a competitor’s laser device and the results helped drive design improvements for future
            releases of the product. peer-reviewed lcas are being conducted on an increasing number of our
            office products in order to provide our design teams with opportunities for future reductions in
            environmental impacts.


            in some cases, we utilize streamlined assessment methods in product development processes for
            equipment, materials (e.g., toner formulations) and our services offerings. an estimated 65 percent
            of our product categories have undergone full lca, with nearly all other hardware products and
            many services undergoing a more targeted evaluation. we encourage our customers to learn more
            about how their printing behavior affects the overall carbon footprint of their organization from a
            lifecycle perspective.


            product design
            xerox has long incorporated environmental considerations into product design. scientists in our
            materials research group evaluate aspects of safety, energy, materials and sustainability (sems)
            using a tool we developed that allows researchers to quickly compare the current design with a
            future proposed design. the tool challenges designers to think about the whole lifecycle of the
            product and recognize any positive or negative impacts to the environment. by using sems, we
            can quantify energy reductions, reduce risk of regulated materials and track progress over time.
            sems was designed to be used in early research and development stages to understand tradeoffs
            and help make decisions early in the product lifecycle.


            epeat®
            for office products, xerox uses the electronic products environmental assessment tool (epeat ®) as
            the foundation of our design for environment program. a comprehensive environmental rating

                                                                                                                    42/147

9/28/2015                                        xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            system, epeat® identifies electronic equipment that meets specific criteria. it combines
            comprehensive criteria for design, production, energy use and recycling with ongoing independent
            verification of manufacturer claims.


            epeat® criteria reflect several categories of environmental attributes that span the lifecycle of
            electronic products: material selection, design for end-of-life, product longevity/life extension,
            energy conservation, end-of-life management, corporate performance, packaging, consumables and
            indoor air quality. as of june 1, 2015, xerox had registered 118 products representing over 25
            product families with epeat®.

            reducing energy use through our products and technology


                 energy star®
                 more than 10 years before the inception of the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)
                 energy star® office equipment program, xerox introduced the first imaging product with
                 an automatic power-down mode. since joining with the epa as a charter partner in 1993, we
                 continue to introduce copier, printer, fax and multifunction products that have earned
                 energy star® status, even as the certification criteria have grown more stringent.

                 in 2014, 100 percent of all our new eligible product introductions achieved energy star ®.
                 this continued success in cutting the power consumption of our laser-based printing products
                 has been achieved by adjustments in the fuser design, changes to the properties of the toner,
                 more efficient electronic controls and the workings of the xerographic system as a whole.

                 the energy star® program introduces progressively more stringent requirements over time,
                 with the most recent revision having gone into effect january 1, 2014. while the new
                 standard is significantly more challenging to meet, our goal remains to have 100 percent of
                 new product introductions achieve this label.

                 multifunction devices
                 our multifunction systems further reduce the amount of energy required to copy, print, fax
                 and scan by combining the functions of multiple products into one machine. the annual
                 energy savings of replacing several individual energy star ®-qualified copiers, fax machines
                 and printers with one xerox energy star-qualified workcentre multifunction system is up to
                 one-half. energy savings would be substantially higher if a multifunction system replaces
                 individual products that have not earned the energy star ® rating.

                 xerox connectkey™
                 connectkey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the
                 cloud without the security risks that commonly exist. cloud computing is an alternative to
                 large data centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data
                 centers while generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. in addition, xerox connectkey™
                 and cisco energywise enable energy management by allowing for control, management, and
                 reporting of a device’s power consumption and the setting of power states and timeout
                 intervals.

            deinkability
            in recent years, deinkability has become an area of increasing concern, particularly among our
            graphic communications customers. ensuring that prints produced with our equipment and
            materials can be responsibly managed at the end of their useful life is an important consideration
            in our product development process. when appropriate, independent testing confirms that these
            prints pose no unique challenges to the recycling stream. while the deinkability of xerographic
            prints has long been demonstrated, a key milestone for a new technology came in 2010 when the
            cipress printer achieved a “good deinkability” rating from ingede, the international association of
            the deinking industry.


            paper use
            our equipment and software is designed to help customers operate efficiently. the “earth smart”
            feature, integrated into the xerox global print driver, brings several resource-saving settings
            together at the single click of a button. these features, such as duplex (two-sided printing), n-up
            (multiple pages per sheet), proof print and toner saving modes, make it easier for customers to
            make responsible print choices. xerox enterprise print services customers have access to
            sophisticated print management and reporting tools, such as xerox print agent, which provides
            additional methods of encouraging and tracking responsible print behavior. software products such
            as docushare® and freeflow® digital workflow collection help xerox customers reduce paper
            consumption by facilitating electronic data management, scan to email, print-on-demand and
            distribute-then-print workflows. xerox has also been exploring creative ways to engage employees
            in the sustainability effort. the xerox® print awareness tool is an innovative solution that allows
            employees to view graphical representations of print usage and take an active role in helping their
            organization reach print reduction targets.


            packaging and distribution
            packaging and distribution are integral parts of our product commercialization process. we strive
            to eliminate, reduce, reuse and recycle packaging. we document our expectations in our
            environment health and safety requirements for packaging standard — ehs-710, and also in our
            general packaging standard — 88p311. our commercial equipment is designed and tested
            extensively to be shipped without any requiring packaging. we strive to eliminate or reduce
            packaging wherever feasible, which conserves natural resources and decreases fuel use for
            distribution; a sustainability win for business and the environment.


            we also offer the xerox® automated packaging solution. this system uses the latest in document
            technology to print, finish and cut customized folding cartons in short runs. by creating packaging
            quickly and cost-effectively, this solution enhances materials efficiencies as well as decreasing
            obsolescence through the creation of customized boxes and containers. automated packaging
            reduces financial and environmental costs associated with warehousing, storage and disposal; an
            advantage for focused marketing campaigns and rapidly changing competitive markets.


            a few examples that illustrate our commitment to sustainability in this area:


            developer housing assembly — converting to use of molded pulp
            for many years our principal supplier shipped housing assemblies to us packed in foam. we moved
            production to the u.s. and redesigned the packaging to allow us to take advantage of readily
            recyclable molded pulp solutions.


                                                                                                                  44/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            the expanded polystyrene endcaps, weighing 68 grams each and measuring 5 inches in length, 6.5
            inches in width and 6 inches in height per side were replaced with molded pulp endcaps. the result
            was a decrease in our material footprint large enough to increase the amount of product per unit
            load from 77 units per pallet to 144, an increase of 87 percent. this eliminated 4,800 kilograms
            (10,575 lbs.) and 8,559 cubic feet of foam annually; reducing costs and also conserving natural
            resources.


            workcentre 7120 customer replaceable units (crus) — reducing our footprint
            as with our developer housing assemblies, we redesigned packaging provided to us by a large
            supplier of color workcentre 7120 crus by removing polystyrene end caps and reducing the size
            of the package. the result was a reduction of 4,725 kilograms (10,417 lbs.) or 27,756 cubic feet of
            polystyrene waste annually, and a 27 percent increase of product per unit load.


            xerox replacement cartridges (xrc) — reducing solid waste
            for xrc products, xerox packaging engineers replaced hot wire expanded polystyrene endcaps
            with inflatable air bags. upon receipt of the package, the air bags are easily deflated, producing
            far less solid waste by mass and cubic volume compared to polystyrene; an environmentally
            preferable alternative.


            materials
            we have made a long-term commitment to eliminate the use of persistent, bioaccumulative and
            toxic materials throughout our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and by tightly
            managing chemicals in our supply chain. we were the first in our industry to evaluate the health
            effects of toner and did so for over 30 years. we have re-engineered or eliminated processes to
            dramatically reduce the use of toxics and heavy metals and have made substantial progress in
            eliminating the use of mercury. mercury-containing lamps that scan images and backlight user
            displays are being phased out as alternatives become available.


            our requirements for minimizing toxic materials govern our product design and materials selection.
            toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of new materials in our products to ensure
            conformance with applicable global registration, hazard communication, and waste handling and
            disposal requirements. as a result of our stringent requirements, xerox toners and printing products
            are non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic. in addition, these products do not: cause adverse
            developmental or reproductive effects; pose a toxicity hazard to humans or aquatic species; cause
            a permanent adverse impact to the skin, eyes or respiratory system; or have the potential to
            generate federally regulated hazardous waste.


            our supplier requirements are periodically updated as regulations change and new information
            becomes available. all new product designs refer to these requirements, and suppliers are expected
            to verify their compliance with them. learn more at www.xerox.com/environment.


            our safety and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations governing chemical use.
            since 2007, xerox’s newly launched products have been designed to meet the european rohs
            requirements in all markets. however, where regulations allow, some products may contain parts
            with small amounts of rohs substances in order to avoid premature disposal of existing parts that
            continue to have usable life. similar types of legislation continue to be implemented in many other
            market regions. through our proactive regulatory tracking process, we expect to be fully compliant
            with all aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective and applicable.

            in early 2015, xerox was informed by a supplier that certain units of four product families shipped
            in the second half of 2014 may not comply with the european union’s restriction of hazardous
            substances directive (rohs) recast directive. tests showed that four small plastic parts in the
            affected units contained a small amount of cadmium, which exceeded permitted limits. xerox
            stopped shipment of the affected units within our control and inventory was reworked with
            compliant parts. affected product already placed at customer locations is being reworked on a
            ‘next service call’ basis. there is no customer or employee exposure or risk. in accordance with
            applicable regulations, xerox self-reported this nonconformity to the relevant authorities who
            assessed no penalties.


            third-party supplies sold by xerox
            in some cases, xerox sells supplies through its distribution network that are manufactured by other
            companies. we review these supplies to ensure compliance with appropriate regulatory
            requirements. in addition, we also assess against our own stringent standards. the results of these
            reviews ultimately determine which products carry the xerox brand. information is provided on
            safety data sheets (sds), which have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the
            globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals (ghs) as implemented
            through regulations in our various markets.


            end-of-life management
            our aim is to design products, packaging and supplies that make efficient use of resources,
            minimize waste, reuse material where feasible and recycle what can’t be reused. to meet this
            commitment, we developed several programs: xerox’s green world alliance initiative provides a
            collection and reuse/recycling program for spent imaging supplies; xerox’s product takeback and
            recycling program manages equipment at end-of-life; and we invest in technologies that reduce
            the creation of waste. our solid ink imaging process utilizes compact “cartridge-free” solid ink sticks
            with no plastic housings or casings, thereby reducing print-related waste by up to 90 percent
            compared with comparable color laser products. for laser-based products, materials innovation has
            extended the life of critical replaceable components by up to 50 percent.


            our approach to managing products at end-of-life translates into significant environmental and
            financial benefits. globally, our combined returns programs (equipment resale or remanufacture in
            conjunction with parts and consumables reuse and recycling) prevented over 38,000 metric tons of
            waste from entering landfills in 2014.


            consumables takeback and recycling
            xerox’s green world alliance (gwa) initiative provides a collection and reuse/recycling program for
            spent imaging supplies. gwa is central to our commitment to waste-free products.


            currently, more than 35 countries participate in the xerox green world alliance. each has its own
            gwa country website that describes the processes available to the customer or the appropriate
            points of contact for more information. worldwide, our customers returned over 3.9 million
            cartridges, toner containers and other used supply items in 2014, equating to 3,700 metric tons.


            although our consumables returns programs have been in existence for two decades, we continue
            to enhance them. major improvements in the u.s. program in 2010 were followed by similar
            changes in canada in 2011, including the north american ecobox program, enabling customers to


                                                                                                                      46/147

9/28/2015                                              xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            order a set of recycling boxes and return multiple used imaging supplies, such as toner bottles and
            cartridges, in one box. more information on xerox’s consumables returns program is available at
            the xerox green world alliance website: www.xerox.com/gwa.


            returned products are sorted, and items suitable for remanufacturing are cleaned, inspected and
            then remanufactured. remanufactured cartridges, containing an average of 90 percent
            reused/recycled parts, are built and tested to the same performance specifications as new
            products. items that are not suitable for remanufacturing are recycled or recovered through energy
            from waste. recycled waste toner and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualifies for reuse
            may account for 25 percent of the weight of new toner, without compromising toner functionality.
            reusing waste/reclaimed toner saves several million dollars in raw material costs each year. of the
            toner that can’t be reclaimed, 75 percent is recycled by our consumables recycling partner while
            the remaining volume is utilized at energy from waste facilities to generate steam and electricity.

            equipment and parts takeback and recycling
            in the early 1990s, we pioneered the practice of converting end-of-life electronic equipment into
            products and parts that contain reused parts while meeting new-product specifications for quality
            and performance. we have developed a comprehensive process for taking back end-of-life products
            and have established a remanufacture, parts reuse and recycling program that fully supports our
            waste-free initiatives.


            we design our machines with the minimum number of required parts and with high durability and
            reuse capability in order to encourage multiple product lifecycles. during the active phase of a
            product, all returned equipment is evaluated for reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain.
            finally, all parts are coded with disposal instructions, so they are easy to recycle in the most
            effective manner during the end-of-life/end-of-service phase of the product life.


                                                                                                                  47/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            xerox enables reuse according to the following principles:


                 reuse of complete end item. this requires the least reprocessing, transportation and energy
                 usage.
                 remanufacturing or conversion into a newer-generation product or part. product families are
                 designed with a high level of commonality to enable maximum reuse in this manner. this
                 allows us to remanufacture to “as new” performance specifications while reusing 70 to 90
                 percent of the machine components by weight without degradation of quality or
                 performance. nearly 65 percent of machines returned in the u.s. are given new life by being
                 sold as used or sent for remanufacturing of some sort.
                 reuse of major modules, subcomponents and parts for spares or manufacturing. many of our
                 machines that have outlived their useful life are stripped of usable parts and components
                 prior to the scrap/reclaim process. used spare parts returned from the field are also
                 considered for this reuse stream. xerox is continually looking to increase the number of
                 components that are reused in upstream and downstream processes after the original
                 machine has been designated for disposal.
                 material recycling. after the processes noted above have been followed, any remaining
                 portion of a machine is stripped of any recyclable material (e.g., plastics, copper wire) and
                 material requiring special disposal services, such as pwbs, batteries and lamps. the remainder
                 of the machine is then crushed and sent to a scrap metal reclaim facility.


            changes in volumes of waste diverted from landfills is due in part to changes in product mix,
            design of lighter-weight machines and growth of regulatory-driven local recycling schemes. for
            example, the transition to digital equipment and lighter-weight parts has reduced the weight of
            both office and production equipment by as much as 50 percent over the last 10 years. the
            decline also represents a decrease in the number of office machines returned for remanufacturing
            in europe due to participation in eu member state waste electrical and electronic equipment
            (weee) programs. in geographies where xerox exercises direct control over the end-of-life
            management of equipment, return rates are high. for example, approximately 60 percent of all
            u.s. equipment installs are ultimately returned to xerox for end-of-life disposition, a figure that
            rises to 100 percent for leased equipment.

            e-waste
            while xerox has long been committed to responsible end-of-life management of equipment, the
            proliferation of e-waste regulations has created a need for multiple programs in different countries
            and even states. the subtle differences in requirements among these regulations pose challenges
            from a process consistency and efficiency standpoint. for example, with the implementation of the
            european union’s waste electrical and electronic equipment (weee) directive, we continue to
            operate our european take-back program to enable equipment remanufacturing and parts reuse.
            we also participate, as needed, in european member states’ individual collection and recycling
            programs.


            in the u.s., xerox recently partnered with a large electronics recycler to ensure that our customers
            have a means to have their old imaging devices processed in a responsible manner. the program
            is consistent with the requirements defined in the various manufacturer take-back initiatives.


            we carefully manage suppliers who provide recycling and waste disposal services. a waste vendor
            approval process assesses the safety and environmental practices as well as compliance history of
            each vendor. where appropriate, we require these companies to document the final disposition of
            materials sent to their facilities, including electronic scrap. xerox does not allow its vendors to send
            electronic scrap to developing nations for processing. we strive to work with only those recyclers
            who have implemented voluntary programs that are certified by accredited organizations. the
            programs are u.s. epa’s responsible recyclers (r2) or the basal action network’s e-stewards
            standards. in addition, in 2014 xerox’s two u.s. equipment processing facilities achieved r2
            certification.


            paper
            we recognize our obligation to responsibly source paper and enable efficient paper use. our
            strategy begins upstream with the fiber source and continues on to processing and manufacturing,
            through use and end-of-life. we utilize a multi-pronged approach, through partnerships with our
            customers and suppliers, the nature conservancy and other stakeholders, including non-

                                                                                                                       49/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            government organizations (ngos), government agencies and academia. our long-term goal is to
            support a sustainable paper cycle and minimize environmental impacts while meeting our
            customers’ exacting business needs.


            in 2013, domtar signed an agreement with xerox for the acquisition of the xerox paper and
            media products business in united states and canada. this deal gives domtar exclusive rights for
            the marketing and distribution of xerox brand paper and print media. read more about domtar
            and sustainability. the same year xerox’s paper business in western europe was sold to antalis.
            read more about antalis’s sustainability charter. xerox maintains the paper business in its
            developing market operations.


            we apply stringent paper sourcing guidelines for companies that provide paper to xerox for resale.
            the requirements cover all aspects of papermaking, from forest management to production of
            finished goods. we supply papers that comply with sustainable forest management standards,
            including forest stewardship council (fsc) and program for the endorsement of forest
            certification (pefc). fsc-certified papers use raw materials from an fsc-certified source, controlled
            wood sources or post-consumer reclaimed sources. as a requirement for displaying the fsc label on
            our papers, we earned fsc chain-of-custody certification from the rainforest alliance’s
            smartwood program. xerox has also earned pefc chain-of-custody certification.


            we offer papers ranging from 80 to 100 percent post-consumer recycled content. our recycled
            papers use post-consumer waste and/or recycled fiber in place of new pulp. recycled products are
            required to meet the same strict performance specifications as virgin products and are designed
            for optimal performance in our equipment.


            our partnership with the nature conservancy
            through the xerox foundation grants of over $2 million since 2006, xerox and the nature
            conservancy have partnered to conserve and protect globally important forests through a variety
            of means — some maturing tools, such as forest certification and high conservation value (hcv)
            assessments, and other new tools and mechanisms for conservation, such as the alignment of
            forest carbon and certification. our partnership builds on the commitment of xerox to
            sustainability throughout its operations and corporate leadership on the world stage.


            xerox and the nature conservancy formed the forest conservation partnership in 2006 to bring
            tactical resources and assistance to the paper industry as it strives to improve forest management
            practices, as well as to help the conservancy meet its conservation objectives. during the third
            term of the partnership in 2014, xerox supported the conservancy’s efforts to:


                 develop and test a broadly applicable forest carbon methodology for improved forest
                 management that would allow landowners to achieve forest certification and serve as a
                 platform for potential carbon benefits
                 strengthen a key tool for identifying priority habitats — the high conservation value
                 approach — building consistency across projects, disseminating standards and training
                 assessors through global and regional hcv networks
                 promote responsible forestry through the implementation of forest management standards
                 by working with xerox suppliers and other land managers at two sites in north america:
                 central-western new york and across the canadian boreal forest (including a focused project
                 in northwest ontario)
                                                                                                                    50/147

9/28/2015                                       xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            these initiatives have improved forest conservation, helping to develop a sustainable paper cycle
            and advance sound forest management practices through market incentives, landowner investment
            and resource networks. most important, our work has and will continue to stem the tide of forest
            loss and degradation, a contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.

            preserving the planet

            responsible operations
            reducing our company-wide carbon footprint
            while our ultimate goal is to be climate-neutral, our first priority is to reduce our total greenhouse
            gas (ghg) emissions by lowering the energy intensity of our operations. xerox is finding success
            with the following approaches:


                 shifts toward energy-efficient technologies such as emulsion aggregation (ea) toner, which is
                 estimated to generate 28 percent fewer ghg emissions in the manufacturing process than
                 conventional toner
                 process improvements including using digital multifunction systems in our workplaces instead
                 of stand-alone printers, copiers, fax machines and scanners
                 energy management and equipment upgrades such as utilizing outdoor pipes to cool process
                 water in winter months (rather than powered industrial chillers) and replacing outdated
                 heating and cooling systems with energy-efficient and digitally controlled models
                 use of renewable energy sources to power our facilities (our u.k. facilities are entirely
                 powered by green energy) or to offset energy use (our webster, new york; wilsonville,
                 oregon; and dallas, texas, facilities in the united states voluntarily use renewable energy or
                 credits to offset a portion of electricity consumption)
                 efficiency-promoting initiatives including purchasing energy-efficient lighting and vehicles,
                 reducing packaging sizes, mileage tracking and route efficiencies

            our major manufacturing operations have been certified to iso 14001 since 1997. our major
            worldwide technology equipment distribution centers achieved certification in 2010. quarterly

            sharing and innovation.


            energy goal 2020
            in 2003, we made a public commitment to reduce (ghg) emissions — our carbon footprint — by
            joining the u.s. epa climate leaders program and launching an internal program known as energy
            challenge 2012.


            this 10-year initiative set a goal to reduce ghg emissions across all company operations 1 10
            percent by 2012. we met this target six years ahead of schedule, so we set a new target of 25
            percent reduction by 2012 (from a 2002 baseline). at the conclusion of the program, we
            successfully cut emissions by 42 percent — that’s 210,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents
            (co2e) — and reduced energy consumption by 31 percent.


            our new corporate-wide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020 (from a
            2012 baseline). in 2014, we reduced energy consumption by 11 percent and cut emissions by 15

            energy consumption




            energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by company-owned fleet and natural
            gas/electricity consumption in facilities. vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of
            data, when unavailable, estimations have been used.


            greenhouse gas inventory
            in keeping with the international guidelines of the greenhouse gas protocol developed by the
            world resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development, we track
            the six major ghgs: carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), nitrous oxide (n2o),
            hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs), perfluorocarbons (pfcs) and sulfur hexafluoride (sf6). we express our
            carbon footprint in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e).


            energy sources account for more than 99 percent of our ghg emissions. our ghg inventory
            includes direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, primarily natural gas and indirect
            emissions from purchased electricity and steam at our manufacturing sites, offices and
            warehouses. the inventory also includes the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service
            and sales vehicle fleet.


            in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol, inventory adjustments are completed each year
            as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and changes to the vehicle fleet; as reflected in
            energy consumption and ghg emission charts. we have expanded our ghg tracking to include
            scope 3 emissions, from employee business travel, product transport and employee commute.


            in 2014, xerox ghg emissions totaled 232,241 metric tons of co2e. about 51 percent were
            indirect emissions from purchased electricity and steam. the remaining 49 percent were direct
            emissions from the combustion of natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel. xerox-owned or leased

            facilities, such as manufacturing sites, offices and warehouses, are associated with 50 percent of
            our direct ghg emissions. the remaining 50 percent are direct emissions from our service and
            sales vehicle fleet and other mobile sources.


            greenhouse gas emissions




            energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by company-owned fleet and natural
            gas/electricity consumption in facilities. vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of
            data, when unavailable, estimations have been used.


            the assessment of scope 3 emissions poses many challenges due to the large number of variables,
            the difficulty in collecting data from suppliers and increasing uncertainty in the data as the
            sources become further removed from the company. we have begun calculating scope 3 emissions
            according to the wri scope 3 accounting standard. we will use the information to prioritize our
            ghg emission reduction opportunities and to integrate consideration of carbon impact into
            sourcing and internal decision-making.


            our scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 ghg emissions have been verified by a third party
            verification/assurance company in accordance with iso 14064-3:2006 against our xerox
            corporation defined methodology described in “xerox corporation greenhouse gas emissions
            inventory management plan, version 2, august 2014” and the principles of transparency,
            accuracy, consistency, completeness and relevance.


            climate change risks and opportunities
            xerox has examined the regulatory, physical and commercial risks and opportunities associated
            with climate change across our value chain.


            we assess and manage our carbon risk by maintaining both a robust ghg emissions inventory and
            a mature regulatory tracking function that provides the necessary information to stay abreast of
            developing regulation. we do not consider our company to be subject to unique risks due to
            changing weather patterns, rising temperatures and sea level rise, but we recognize that our
            business could be impacted by more frequent disruptions as a result of severe weather in locations

                                                                                                                                     55/147

            where we operate. we may also need to invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to
            aid customers who are impacted by business disruptions due to severe weather. we’re experienced
            in working with customers to ensure continuity of critical applications by prioritizing business needs
            and developing customer-specific preparedness plans where appropriate. our business resumption
            plans include communication with employees and customers, management of employee health
            and safety issues, business continuity and resumption processes, and interaction with government
            organizations.


            we recognize that the increasing costs of energy and concerns around energy security are issues
            that affect both our operations and those of our customers. our commitment to reduce energy use
            in our operations was driven in part by cost savings, and we recognized that helping our customers
            to reduce energy costs through more efficient document solutions could increase our revenues.


            our immediate (short-term) focus is reducing energy consumption in our own operations as we
            make progress toward achieving our corporate goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020. we strive to
            provide sustainable document management technology solutions to our customers to reduce the
            energy and environmental impacts of their business.


            to meet our commitment for “reducing energy use and protecting the climate,” our long-term
            (more than three-year) strategy is to continue to invest in technologies that reduce the carbon
            footprint of our operations and develop technology solutions that help our customers to reduce
            the energy and environmental impacts of their business. our ultimate aim is to be carbon-neutral.


            we invest in innovation, market leadership and sound management practices that deliver
            measurable benefits to the environment, our customers and society and that also increase
            shareholder value. we recognize the importance of creative partnerships with suppliers, customers
            and other stakeholders to achieve these benefits and maximize their value. being smart with
            product innovation is an important part of sector leadership.


            we are well positioned for current and potential future regulation by our investment in a robust
            ghg emission inventory. we are currently gathering scope 3 emissions data and other key metrics
            to assess climate change risk in the supply chain.


            preserving clean air and water


            air emissions
            xerox has significantly reduced manufacturing air emissions over the past 20 years. continuous
            improvement remains a priority.


            most of our air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner,
            photoreceptor drums and belts, and fuser rolls. although 2014 volatile organic process air
            emissions (voc and non-voc) from these production activities were essentially the same as in
            2013*, our historical reductions demonstrate the success of our design initiatives to minimize
            environmental impact. emission reductions have primarily come from process modification, lower
            production volumes of legacy products coated using organic solvents, and production declines
            attributable to longer-life components.


                                                                                                                     56/147

            * 2013 emissions have been revised in this report to reflect the inclusion of process emissions that were
            inadvertently excluded.



            volatile organic process air emissions




            a subset of these volatile organic process emissions is defined by the u.s. environmental
            protection agency (epa) as hazardous air pollutants (hap). in 2014, xerox reported worldwide air
            emissions of approximately 5 metric tons of hap under national toxic chemical release regulations,
            including the united states’ toxic release inventory (tri) program. methylene chloride, methyl
            isobutyl ketone (mibk), 1,3-butadiene and styrene represent virtually all of these hap emissions.




                                                                                                                        57/147

            ozone-depleting substances
            xerox policy prohibits the use of ozone-depleting substances (ods) as ingredients in products,
            spare parts, accessories and packaging. ozone-depleting substances are used as refrigerants in
            facility and vehicle air conditioning systems and various food/equipment-cooling systems. although
            ods may be released during the normal operation and failure of these systems, the total amount
            released is not significant from a company-wide perspective. elimination of ods as refrigerant is
            managed consistent with government phase-out dates.


            toxic chemical releases
            the release of materials used in our worldwide operations is evaluated annually and reported to
            government agencies under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations, such as the u.s.
            toxic release inventory, the canadian national pollution release inventory, and the european
            pollutant release and transfer register. releases for reporting year 2014 were 5 percent lower
            than 2013 levels and 71 percent lower than 2007 levels. in 2014, reportable releases and transfers
            decreased primarily due to decreases in the amount of organic solvent used in production
            manufacturing processes.




                                                                                                                 58/147

            reportable toxic chemical releases and transfers




            in 2011, operations with reportable toxic chemical releases to the air, land or water — in amounts
            of greater than one metric ton — established goals, targets and objectives related to chemical
            releases. progress against these goals as of year-end 2014 is summarized below.


                 an initiative to reclaim spent methyl isobutyl ketone (mibk) continued to exceed
                 expectations in the third full year of implementation. recovered solvent was qualified for use
                 as a cleaning solvent for the fluid delivery systems used in u.s. fuser roll coating operations.
                 as a result, the amount of virgin mibk purchased in 2014 for use in the manufacturing
                 operation was reduced by 42 percent from the 2010 baseline on a normalized, per-part basis.
                 the amount of methylene chloride used to manufacture xerox photoreceptor belts was
                 reduced by more than 61 percent from the 2010 baseline, greatly exceeding target. this
                 dramatic reduction was primarily due to volume declines of legacy products and process
                 modifications that reduced the amount of methylene chloride used for batch cleaning of
                 production equipment.
                 emissions of 1,3-butadiene from u.s. toner resin manufacturing operations did not meet the
                 normalized, per-batch target in 2014 due to a process modification that increased transfer
                 losses. actions have been taken to partially mitigate those losses, and a new baseline will be
                 established.

            spills and accidental releases
            our goal is to prevent all environmental releases of regulated materials to air, soil and water. we
            have greatly reduced the frequency of spills and accidental releases, though we have not yet
            reached our target of eliminating these events.


            in 2014, our north american operations identified two reportable accidental spills/releases
            (compared with five in 2013). both of the events occurred at our monroe county, new york,
            location. one event was contained within the internal containment structure and cleaned up with
            no environmental impact. the other was the result of a minor spill of a hazardous material which
            forced an evacuation of the building and subsequent ventilation of the material to the air.
            immediate corrective actions were taken in both cases.


                                                                                                                    59/147

            water consumption and treatment
            as part of our commitment to conserve resources, we monitor water consumption across our
            manufacturing, distribution and r&d facilities worldwide. we have met the corporate goal to
            reduce water consumption by 21 percent by 2014 (against a 2009 baseline).


            our new goal is to reduce water consumption by 35 percent by 2020 (against a 2010 baseline).
            water consumption in 2014 was down 28 percent against the 2020 goal.


            though we certainly continued conservation activities in 2014, any additional benefit was offset
            by changes in production scheduling that resulted in increases in manufacturing, more frequent
            product changes, and cleaning cycles. as a result, water consumption rose slightly in 2014.


            however, at our emulsion aggregate toner plant in webster, new york, employee teams worked to
            reduce overall waste generated by the process. a primary focus was the amount of water used for
            equipment cleaning. teams were able to identify opportunities to reduce the frequency of full
            equipment washes and to optimize the way water is directed through the equipment. it improves
            cleaning efficiency and reduces the amount of fresh water used in each cleaning cycle.


            the water discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored to validate compliance with local
            sanitary sewer discharge limits. wastewater from manufacturing processes is treated, as necessary,
            before being discharged into local sanitary sewers. we utilize best practices to prevent unwanted
            pollutants from entering waterways via surface contamination and run-off. extensive sampling of
            wastewater, discharged to both sanitary and storm sewers, ensures that discharged water meets
            our strict requirements.


            the new york water environment association presented our webster, new york, facilities with a
            silver environmental performance award for water discharge quality for 2014. this award
            acknowledges that nearly 4,000 water permit analyses for sanitary and storm water met all permit
            specifications. we have received five gold and ten silver awards since the program began in 2000.




                                                                                                                 60/147

            preventing and managing waste


            hazardous waste
            there were no significant changes to our worldwide hazardous waste volumes in 2014. however,
            improvements included beneficially managing 73 percent of the hazardous waste generated in
            2014 through recycling and/or fuels blending technologies, as compared with 62 percent in 2013.


            we do not export hazardous waste to developing nations. a third-party supplier is contracted to
            recover spent methyl isobutyl ketone; this material is returned to us to support ongoing coating
            operations. solid and liquid hazardous waste streams that have an adequate btu value are
            managed via a fuels blending program. an off-site waste disposal vendor blends these waste
            streams to meet the specifications provided by cement kilns.




                                                                                                                                    61/147

            non-hazardous solid waste
            we have had major waste reduction efforts in place for many years. we reuse boxes, pallets and
            containers for parts delivery. we recapture toner that is outside the acceptable size range during
            manufacturing, recycle returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal and paper.


            we have an aspirational goal to drive our reuse/recycle rate to 100% by 2020 at our technology
            facilities compared to a baseline year of 2009. additionally, xerox has committed to developing a
            process to collect and track solid waste data at all of our services facilities.


            our global manufacturing operations and all facilities in monroe county, new york, generated
            43,000 metric tons of non-hazardous solid waste in 2014, up slightly from 41,000 metric tons in
            2013. process waste consists primarily of paper, wood pallets, waste toner, plastics and packaging
            waste such as corrugated cardboard; equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal, waste
            batteries and lamps, miscellaneous trash, and non-usable end-of-life equipment and parts that are
            returned to xerox for processing. equipment manufacturing waste made up about 65 percent of
            the non-hazardous solid waste managed by xerox operations in 2014.


            in 2014, we managed 93 percent of non-hazardous solid waste beneficially, up from 92 percent in
            2013. the increased reuse/recycle rate can be attributed to an increase in our manufacturing
            operations using energy from waste technology for non-recyclables in 2014. additionally, in 2014
            our equipment resellers were able to return a number of products to the marketplace for resale.
            that resulted in a significant reduction of all non-hazardous waste. please note that the
            reuse/recycle rate has been revised from previous years to more accurately represent non-
            hazardous waste management methods.

            environmental remediation and compliance


            in 1985, we began a voluntary assessment program that identified 68 of our worksites requiring
            remediation. we worked closely with the appropriate federal, state and local agencies to initiate
            prompt and appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees, neighbors and the
            environment.


            today, only seven of the original 68 sites still require active remedial or control measures. during
            2014 we were able to complete active remediation at two sites. we have removed the sources of
            contamination and have remediated the properties for reuse or redevelopment. in 2014, we
            completed remediation at a site in canada, which was validated with final confirmation sampling
            in 2015. the other site remediated was in california, which will now enter into long-term
            groundwater monitoring.


            in addition to using conventional techniques for groundwater recovery and soil excavation, we
            have a history of developing innovative remedial technologies. these included techniques that
            enhance the recovery of contaminants such as high-vacuum 2-phase extraction and enhanced
            bedrock fracturing. we also employ technologies where contaminants are converted to less-harmful
            substances through enhanced natural biodegradation and chemical oxidation.


            compliance reporting
            we require our various operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report allegations of regulatory
            violations to our ehs&s group for tracking, evaluation and corrective action, where appropriate. in
            2014, six instances resulted in a notice of violation. two of these resulted in penalties. one
            stemmed from incomplete inspection and maintenance records and the other involved exceeding
            wastewater discharge limits. all issues have been abated and closed out with the relevant
            authorities, and we’ve established appropriate controls to ensure ongoing compliance.




                                                                                                                   66/147

            the xerox foundation
            we invest in the communities in which we live and work for reasons beyond fulfilling our
            obligation as a corporate citizen. we do it because it makes our company stronger and more
            competitive.


            a foundation for good




            our philanthropic efforts are managed through the xerox foundation, which executes a deliberate
            investment strategy to deliver the greatest impact possible for every dollar spent. in 2014, we
            invested $13.5 million in the non-profit sector through the xerox foundation. more than 2,500
            non-profit organizations, colleges and universities received direct financial support in the form of
            grants, matching gifts or community involvement activities of xerox people.


            our philanthropic efforts, carried out through the foundation, support objectives within the
            following four categories:
                                                                                                                   67/147

            caring for communities

            employee volunteer activities
            at xerox, we believe a combination of financial and human resources can bring about greater
            change than either on its own. this philosophy is perhaps best represented by our community
            involvement program. this long-running grassroots program backs the voluntary spirit of our
            employees with funding support from xerox. in this way, we’re making the biggest difference in
            the communities where we live and work.


            since the program began in 1974, thousands of xerox people have been involved in regional,
            community-focused projects each year. in 2014, the xerox foundation invested over $1.3 million
            in the community involvement program, enabling 13,000 xerox people to participate in 800
            projects.


            outside of our employee volunteer programs, xerox people also give their time and talent to a
            wide variety of causes. here are a few examples:


                 xerox scientists participate in the xerox science consultant program, which sends our people
                 into elementary schools to teach science to inquiring young minds and to ignite interest in
                 science as a career
                 xerox lawyers provide pro bono work to a wide range of non-profits
                 people across xerox — from the “c-suite” to the “factory floor” — volunteer their time to
                 help make our world a better place

            during 2014, 91.3 percent of our philanthropic investments were directed to institutions and
            organizations where someone from xerox was personally involved.


            no relationship better illustrates xerox’s commitment to community volunteers than the one we
            have with the united way. in 2014, the xerox foundation gave $1.8 million in grants to some 70
            united way organizations throughout the united states, including $500,000 to the united way of
            rochester, new york. in addition, xerox employees personally donated more than $650,000 of
            their own money as well as time volunteering at united way agencies and day of caring.


            the grand total of xerox’s contribution to the united way in 2014, combining foundation grants
            and employees’ donations, was more than $2.4 million.




                                                                                                                69/147

            education and workforce
            preparedness
            as part of a larger effort to support individuals pursuing technical degrees and help the u.s.
            address its shortage of scientists and engineers, we provide matching gifts to colleges and
            universities. in 2014, 500 different institutions received 1,300 matching gifts from the xerox
            foundation.


            investing in education




                                                                                                             70/147

            to help train a new generation of scientists and engineers, the xerox foundation awarded grants
            to 500 different institutions throughout the united states in 2014. the top five beneficiaries of
            this program in 2014 were the university of rochester, rochester institute of technology, cornell
            university, dartmouth college and massachusetts institute of technology.


            our support of education involves managing three programs with a common theme: providing
            educational access to underrepresented minorities. in turn, this supports the strategic interest of
            the company by enabling us to recruit from a highly motivated, technically educated talent pool.
            in addition, our own people benefit by being involved on college campuses.


                 the black college engineering liaison program awarded 20 grants to schools such as north
                 carolina a&t university; howard university; spelman college; morgan state university;
                 hampton university; talladega college; tuskegee university; southern university; and
                 benedict college.
                 the hispanic college liaison program dispersed 22 grants to schools such as university of
                 puerto rico; city college of new york; university of california; university at buffalo;
                 university of central florida; polytechnic institute of nyu; california state; california
                 polytechnic; interamerican university of puerto rico; university of texas; and rochester
                 institute of technology.
                 the xerox technical minority scholarship program provided 128 scholarships to help
                 deserving minority students complete degrees in engineering.

            we also continued our partnership with the national academy foundation’s academies of
            engineering. these “schools within schools” provide incentives for minority and female high school
            students to pursue college degrees and ultimately careers in science, technology, engineering and
            mathematics, the stem principles.


            we made a $1 million, four-year grant commitment as a founding member to change the
            equation, a start-up organization aimed at rallying support from the business community around
            stem education, identifying programs that have empirical results, and leveraging them on a
            national scale.


            in partnership with the national merit scholarship corporation, the xerox foundation also
            awarded a total of 31 xerox merit, xerox achievement, national merit and national achievement
            scholarships.


            other investments in education and workforce preparedness include:


                 a better chance
                 prep for prep
                 the national action council for minorities in engineering

            the xerox foundation also invested in four organizations that assist returning members of the
            military who are experiencing difficulty re-entering the workforce.

            caring for communities

            science and technology
            at xerox, innovation is our foundation for success. academic organizations play an important role
            in the long-term strategic interests of the company by furthering scientific research and training
            the next generation of scientists. in 2014, xerox scientists championed 40 grants to 30 different
            universities — 23 located in the united states, and seven worldwide.


            grants worth more than $1.1 million were recommended to university science programs by the
            xerox university affairs committee, which consists of a dozen xerox scientists from the united
            states, canada and the united kingdom.


            our scientists and the professors we funded co-authored and published 18 research papers in
            leading academic journals.


            academic organizations play an important role in the long-term strategic interests of the company
            by furthering scientific research and training the next generation of scientists. this is why the the
            xerox foundation supports many such organizations, including university of rochester and
            university of rochester/wilmot center, new york hall of science and polytechnic institute of new
            york university.


            as a result of the program, xerox hired one graduate student and hosted eight interns in 2014. in
            all, we hosted 21 visits to our webster, new york, campus and made 53 visits to universities
            around the world.

            caring for communities

            national and cultural affairs
            xerox supports a variety of organizations that address issues facing our nation, help those in need,
            or honor veterans or victims of national tragedies. we support many cultural and arts institutions
            in the communities where our employees live and work.


            organizations that address national problems include:


            naacp legal defense and educational fund, partnership for a drug-free america, paralyzed
            veterans of america, national center for addiction and substance abuse, minority corporate
            counsel association and asian american legal defense and education fund.


            cultural organizations include:


            dance theater of harlem, connecticut ballet, kennedy center, lincoln center, ballet hispanico,
            stepping stones museum for children, lockwood mathews mansion museum and many more.


            memberships
            in 2014, we paid membership dues to 38 non-profit organizations, including council on foreign
            relations, conference board, national minority supplier development council, techamerica,
            american national standards institute and the technology ceo council.


            disaster relief
            we invest in the american red cross for its efforts to respond quickly and effectively to natural
            disasters. we invest in save the children and concern worldwide for their efforts to respond
            quickly and effectively to humanitarian needs across the world. over the last year, our support
            went to those affected by the earthquake in nepal and the ebola outbreak in africa.


            environmental affairs
            from habitat preservation to sustainability research and the promotion of environmental
            consciousness, we are committed to the protection of the environment for future generations. a
            grant to the nature conservancy helps continue pioneering work in promoting sustainable forestry
            practices in northern boreal forests of canada.


            science and technology
            we support new york hall of science, polytechnic institute of nyu, university of rochester and
            rochester institute of technology.


            other grants benefit outward bound (which teaches respect for the environment among young
            people); the maritime aquarium in norwalk, connecticut; national aquarium in baltimore,
            maryland; suny college of environment and forestry; soundwaters; university of
            pennsylvania/wharton’s global environmental program and many other organizations such as
            discovery center, discovery museum, mill river collaborative, connecticut science center and
            institutions that work toward the goal of a sustainable world.
                                                                                                                   74/147

               evolving the workplace

              employee engagement
              when people believe they can make a difference in an organization, they are more motivated and
              effective at their jobs. that is why xerox is committed to fostering open communication between
              employees and management.


              we encourage one-on-one conversations between employees and supervisors. we also survey
              employees regularly to gather information that becomes the basis for improvements throughout
              the company. our commitment to employee engagement creates an environment of open
              innovation that benefits our business and strengthens our contribution to global citizenship.


              voice of the employee survey
              since 2009, we’ve run our anonymous voice of the employee (voe) survey. the survey gets to the
              heart of the day-to-day work experience, generates dialogue among managers and employees, and
              results in actions carried out by teams.


              the voe survey is administered every two years. the results reported here were collected in 2013.
              the 2015 survey is currently under way; we plan to share these results in our 2016 citizenship
              report.


              the 2013 voe survey was available to our global population in 49 countries and offered in 26
              languages. we received over 68,500 survey responses with almost 100,000 write-in comments.


              there are four categories in the survey:


                    my work: questions about the job, feedback, learning opportunities, the ability to take
                    informed risks and personal job satisfaction
                    my manager: questions about the manager’s behaviors, expectations, communication, team
                    building and the employee perception of his/her leadership
                    our team: questions about how employees work together and collaborate
                    our company: questions about xerox strategy and direction

              in addition, two write-in questions ask people to describe 1) what they like best about working for
              xerox and 2) where we as a company can improve.


            we received over 31,000 responses to the first question offering more than 50,000 ideas. the
            dominant theme expressed in the survey was the power of collegiality and the open and
            supportive atmosphere at xerox. as one respondent put it: “i feel i am with a company, a team,
            and a leader that shares my vision and passion as well as a place that fosters openness to new
            thinking.” employees also praised the friendly and stress-free work environment, the diversity of
            the work, the flexibility provided to them by management and the strength of the xerox brand
            worldwide.


            highlights of the survey questions reveal:

                                                                                                                    75/147

                 employees have a solid understanding of personal contribution to team goals
                 managers make their expectations known and clear

                 most employees feel personal accomplishment from their work contributions

            more important, the survey reveals areas for improvement. the 2013 survey identified three key
            areas of importance to our employees: developing a clearer understanding of our business
            strategy, ensuring fair pay and ensuring fair treatment in the workplace. in 2014 and 2015, we
            developed programs to address each of these.

            we hire from the communities in which we do business. we take care to research and comply with
            local labor laws to ensure the safety and happiness of all our employees around the globe.
            candidates must be authorized to work in the country to which they are applying and be fluent in
            the language of the country where a job is based.


            we don’t discriminate against any applicant for employment or any employee in any aspect of
            their employment at xerox because of age, race, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender
            identity, military status, pregnancy, national origin, veteran status, other legally protected
            characteristic or basis, or any unlawful means.


            compensation is based on merit, degree of responsibility, the scope of the work, the impact the
            role has on the company and other work-related criteria. we comply with all laws governing fair
            employment and labor practices.


            military hiring programs in the u.s.


            we value the experience and skills acquired during military service. as part of a commitment to
            the white house joining forces initiative, we pledged to hire 10,000 veterans by 2018; in 2014,
            we hired nearly 1,700.

            evolving the workplace

            diversity and inclusion
            at xerox, diversity is not viewed as a mandate, but as an essential part of our corporate culture.
            treating others with respect and offering equal opportunity regardless of origin, race, gender or
            sexual orientation makes us stronger because it allows us to take full advantage of a global
            workforce that is rich in experience, knowledge and creativity. many of our accomplishments as a
            company originate from teams of diverse individuals whose varying perspectives complement one
            another as they work together to achieve our strategic goals.


            females in the workplace




            we foster a culture of inclusion and opportunity, which is supported by a number of employee-
            focused initiatives and tracked through measurable actions.


            award-winning diversity


            year after year, xerox is recognized for embracing diversity in the workplace. the following is a list
            of some of our acknowledgements from 2014 and 2015:

            executive diversity council
            the executive diversity council consists of senior leaders from across xerox. the council meets at
            selected times throughout the year to discuss matters such as:


                 workforce representation
                 work environment
                 diverse customer markets
                 organizational efforts to address the needs of a multicultural workforce

            in addition, select council members may be involved in other diversity initiatives, such as the
            corporate champion program, where senior executives are matched with employee caucus groups.
            the “champions” educate our senior management on their groups’ unique environmental
            perspective and community initiatives.


            independent caucus groups also play an important role in our diversity story. these caucuses,
            similar to networking and affinity groups, are instrumental in advocating openness, opportunity
            and inclusion for the entire xerox community. they work with management to achieve common
            business objectives and self-advocacy and to create an environment of inclusion. six caucus groups
            currently address the concerns of employees who are african-american, hispanic, asian, women,
            african-american women, and/or gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender.


            non-discrimination policy
            globally, we create policies that support our business goals and reflect the culture of the countries
            in which we do business. xerox does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religious belief,
            sex, age, national origin, citizenship status, marital status, union status, sexual orientation or
            gender identity.


            by focusing on diversity, xerox hires, promotes and retains the best people who are well suited for
            our business. we’ve designed our hiring and promotion efforts to ensure a deep, diverse reserve of
            strong players who are ready to assume leadership roles. our hiring practices include engaging

                                                                                                                    80/147

            groups of students and new graduates.


            scholarships and recruitment
            we grant more than 120 scholarships each year through our technical minority scholarship
            program, and we are reaching out to young people through programs such as the first (for
            inspiration and recognition of science and technology) robotics competition and the xerox
            science consultant program that encourages broader interest in science and technology. we
            introduce xerox career opportunities to the hispanic student population at 45 universities and
            institutions and, to expand our recruitment efforts further, we are partnering with the society of
            hispanic engineers. we have a similar university outreach program for recruiting african-american
            employees.


            equal employment opportunity
            in the u.s., xerox complies with equal employment opportunity (eeo) guidelines and all applicable
            federal, state and local laws that govern the hiring and treatment of its employees. we do not
            discriminate against protected veterans, including veterans of the vietnam era and disabled
            veterans, individuals with a disability or employees who take protected leave time.


            representation of women around the globe
            across all lines of business and around the world:


                 twenty-seven percent of our executives are female

                 forty-four percent of our board of directors are women; all are over 50 years of age

            evolving the workplace

            compensation and benefits
            at xerox, we have long understood our success depends on attracting and sustaining a healthy
            and productive global workforce. to that end, we offer well-rounded compensation and benefits
            packages that place value in the whole person.


            our comprehensive u.s. package includes competitive pay, healthcare benefits for employees and
            their families, a 401k savings plan with a company match, wellness resources and workplace
            recognition opportunities. we also offer employee assistance programs, healthcare coaching and
            advocacy support, adoption assistance, education assistance and tuition aid. our paid-time-off
            program includes company-paid holiday and vacation benefits. we offer a variety of continuing
            education and learning opportunities to enhance personal and professional development.


            xerox supports time-off programs including personal leaves of absence, military leaves and family
            medical leaves in compliance with the u.s. federal family and medical leave act of 1993.


            our pay philosophy in all countries supports both individual and business needs by providing our
            people with rewards that are linked to individual performance and company results. our total
            compensation package includes all forms of cash (base pay, overtime and commissions), benefits
            and recognition. to ensure our pay and benefits packages remain competitive, we participate in
            numerous pay and benefit surveys. we offer the same benefits package to full- and part-time
            employees by region.


            in 2015, we began a pay review process, which will recur in the first quarter of every year. this
            process formalizes our approach to employee pay reviews across all organizations and geographies.
            following this process, we create industry-based pay guidelines for a variety of roles in each
            geography, then we examine employee performance and compare current employee pay to those
            guidelines in order to determine increases.




                                                                                                                82/147

            evolving the workplace

            health, wellness and safety
            we believe that the health of our business depends on the health and safety of our people. from
            giving our employees and their families the means to manage their health to making workplaces
            and commutes safer, we continue to make measureable changes in the lives of our people
            worldwide.


            healthcare
            our healthcare philosophy — healthy together — focuses on helping employees and family
            members to make informed healthcare decisions and gives them the tools to manage their health
            and well-being. employees can also access various health and wellness programs through the
            healthcare carriers they select. as part of the healthy together program, the company provides
            free, confidential wellness screenings on an annual basis so employees can identify key health risks
            and work with their primary care physician. xerox also contracted with various wellness vendors to
            assist employees in developing action plans to address these risks. we provide easy access to
            meaningful, timely and relevant information through a single portal, simplifying the experience of
            choosing and using benefits. currently, this program is available to employees in the united
            states. our healthy together strategy will continue to evolve as we move toward an outcomes-

            xerox is committed to creating a safe work environment for our people. we strive toward a goal of
            zero workplace injuries, continually decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries every year. in
            2014, our global technology operations total recordable injury (tri) rate decreased 12% and the
            day away from work case (dafw) rate decreased by 7% from 2013 levels. across all of our u.s.
            operations, the tri frequency rate decreased 3% and dafw frequency rate decreased by 13%.
            these performance improvements are reflective of the increased safety awareness and
            communications to our employees and focused safety management processes within our
            management teams.

            we have been successful in integrating many corporate safety management processes into our
            services organization, including injury recordkeeping, accident investigation, fire and life safety,
            and emergency preparedness. this integration has established common objectives and
            standardized the inspection and management processes for key employee safety disciplines.


            we focus our safety improvement efforts where we can make the most impact on preventing
            incidents and where populations are most at risk. we have continued our efforts to increase
            employee safety awareness and integrate inspections of safe work practices into our management



                                                                                                                   84/147

            processes. with weekly health, safety and wellness communications to our equipment service
            technician workforce, and newly established safety training programs, we help them recognize safe
            practices on and off the job to improve their overall health and wellness.


            safe facilities
            in order to ensure fire and life safety attributes are in place in the buildings we own and lease, all
            real estate transactions are reviewed by the environment, health, safety and sustainability
            (ehs&s) organization prior to occupying. xerox fire safety and life safety requirements have been
            established regardless of location in the world, size of the facility or occupancy classification. the
            focus of the safety review is fire and incident prevention, early detection, suppression, occupant
            notification and prompt building evacuation. these reviews are linked with the implementation of
            building specific emergency preparedness planning and drills.


            audit program
            a well-established internal audit program measures our success in implementing corporate
            standards, allows us to share best practices and helps us validate regulatory compliance. audits at
            major operations are conducted on a rolling average of once every three to five years (or sooner,
            based on performance). the frequency and the focus of the audits are based on the type of
            operations and the inherent risks associated with the operations. in 2012, we added our services
            operations to this audit schedule.


            xerox audit teams evaluate operations against our internal standards, external regulations and
            industry guidelines. beginning in 2010, the teams also evaluated management system
            performance. with the assistance of the local managers and support staff, action plans are
            developed and deficiencies corrected. senior management pays particular attention to situations
            with the potential to pose a significant risk of environmental damage, serious injury to employees
            or regulatory non-compliance. in 2014, we met our goal of resolution of these issues within 90
            days and continued to demonstrate that the audit program has become an important mechanism
            for identifying and correcting performance gaps.


            adding services to the mix




                                                                                                                     85/147

            xerox service audits
            33 countries • 200 locations • 130 international + 70 us (20%)




            our services operations are located in approximately 500 sites worldwide. initially, ehs&s was
            engaged in audits of a limited number of facilities between 2010 and 2012. in 2013, ehs&s set
            out to complete audits of all 130 international services locations and worked with various value
            chain partners including global real estate and facilities, human resources, and local operations
            management to address any issues that were identified.


            in 2014, audits were completed at 70 u.s. locations, for a total audit count of 200. in order to
            establish a consistent level of ehs&s performance worldwide, a common set of facility
            requirements was developed that applies across all geographies, taking into account existing life
            safety and building codes as well as specific regulatory requirements that may apply in different
            parts of the world.


            the on-site review of these locations provided significant insight into the variety of business
            operations, facility and/or management issues and best practices that could be used to improve
            overall performance. outside of the u.s., due to the large variation in local regulations, the audits
            identified a number of sites requiring some sort of physical upgrade, modification or intervention
            to meet safety and environmental requirements. corrective actions for all of these locations have
            been completed.


            consistent application of accepted life safety and building codes within all 50 u.s. states means
            there were fewer physical issues identified. however, some operational management process
            deficiencies were identified and are currently being addressed.


            now in the control phase, the services operations audit project will include on-going assessment,
            on-site spot checks and continued outreach. site operations and facility management will be
            required to complete an annual self-assessment and provide supporting documentation as

                                                                                                                    86/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            evidence of ongoing compliance. in addition, processes are in place to ensure that acquisitions are
            thoroughly evaluated to ensure that new facilities meet appropriate standards.


            emergency preparedness
            because emergencies and disasters often strike without warning, xerox has implemented an
            emergency preparedness and response program to help protect the safety of our employees, the
            surrounding communities and the environment.


            to prepare for emergencies, xerox facilities worldwide have implemented site-specific emergency
            preparedness plans to assist with the development and execution of appropriate actions in
            response to local emergencies. our plans account for common emergencies, such as responding to
            fires; for weather-related emergencies, such as tornadoes and hurricanes; and for more location-
            specific emergencies, such as responding to earthquakes and radiological emergencies. we also
            include resources and procedures for first aid medical response in the event of an injury or illness
            to an employee in our facilities. we provide first aid kits and emergency medical information to
            our medical emergency response team (mert) and provide training to our mert and fire
            response personnel.


            shelter-in-place procedures, already in place in our technology sites, are being rolled out to our
            services sites to protect our employees from emergency situations that occur outside of our
            facilities.


            in addition to emergency action plans that are established at the local operation level, there are
            preparedness plans at the corporate level including major incidents, crisis management and
            pandemic preparedness. these plans have been designed with a central corporate strategy that
            utilizes an incident command structure. incident response managers are responsible for
            local/regional tactical and emergency response; coordinating efforts at their respective locations
            with the corporate crisis management team; and addressing local business operations issues.
            response coordination and integration are part of the planning process.


            all preparedness plans are regularly tested for effectiveness through management reviews,
            corporate audits and annual drills. any discrepancies are noted and corrective actions are
            implemented. following an emergency, business resumption plans are put into action to ensure
            the business operations are quickly restored after the incident.


            motor vehicle safety
            motor vehicle safety is a key component of our safety initiatives. we have a company car program
            that specifies motor vehicle safety requirements for our drivers and accident prevention and
            reporting processes. employee driving records are reviewed on a regular basis, and we provide
            remedial motor vehicle safety training to improve awareness and competency. motor vehicle
            accidents are tracked by frequency and type and are reported to the management team.


            we also participate on fleet safety benchmark forums to keep up to date on the latest motor
            vehicle safety practices and technologies and to share xerox’s best practices with our peers.




                                                                                                                   87/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            the use of cell phones in any company vehicle is restricted. texting is forbidden while the vehicle
            is moving. employees who need to use their phones in the car are instructed to find a safe place
            to stop.


            a comprehensive safety review is conducted on any vehicle model prior to it being accepted as
            part of the xerox fleet. we review the safety ratings and crash test results of candidate vehicles
            and require safety features such as daytime running lights and safety barriers between the driver’s
            seat and storage areas.


            ergonomics
            because musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant portion of our work-related injuries, we
            work to minimize the risk factors as a job is designed. we study exposure to ergonomic hazards
            and raise awareness with employees so they can make improvements to their workstations.


            from manufacturing operations to office work, we continue to study the causes and potential
            remedies for workplace injuries. the following provides some brief highlights.


                 manufacturing operations: workstation evaluations are conducted in xerox facilities
                 worldwide for ergonomic hazards based upon risk profile and injury experience. ergonomic
                 enhancements such as tilt tables, lifts and hoists make it easier for employees to maneuver
                 parts and equipment during assembly.
                 machine service: xerox customer service engineers’ (cses) exposure to ergonomic hazards
                 has been studied. the findings have helped us select tools and develop procedures to
                 mitigate risk of musculoskeletal disorders. throughout the equipment design process,
                 evaluations are done to assess risks for our cses. the best time to make a modification is
                 when a product is still in the design or early test phases.
                 office ergonomics: our largest employee population is office-based. raising awareness and
                 helping employees make effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for this
                 population. we created computer-based training on ergonomics principles and practices. this
                 method of delivery enables employees to go through needed training programs at a time
                 that minimizes business interruptions. for employees that require additional ergonomic
                 technical assistance due to workplace injuries or medical accommodations, we have partnered
                 with a third-party consultant to conduct more detailed ergonomic assessments. by leveraging
                 this consultant we are able to better support a larger geographic area. we also continue to
                 focus on ways to unify the ergonomics program across all sectors of business.


            asset protection and fire safety
            the xerox asset protection and fire safety program provides fire-safe workplaces and limits the
            potential for losses to xerox equipment and property from fire, explosion and natural hazards, such
            as windstorms, snow-loading collapse and floods. the program includes periodic inspections,
            management reviews of findings, and mitigation planning. our philosophy is to maintain our
            higher-valued locations to a “highly protected risk” standard. in addition, locations are reviewed
            for conformance to xerox standards and recognized fire and life safety standards. we continue to
            demonstrate strong loss control performance and benefit from favorable insurance rates and
            premiums.




                                                                                                                  88/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            contractor safety process
            the goal of the contractor safety program is to ensure contracted work conforms to all applicable
            regulations and xerox environmental, health and safety requirements. contractors are qualified to
            the safety and health requirements prior to beginning work at a xerox location. contractors are
            required to submit a job safety plan and workers on u.s. xerox sites attend an orientation session.
            incidents and injuries are tracked both as feedback and to measure program effectiveness.
            although first established in our rochester, new york, operations, this model is being applied
            successfully in many of our larger locations.


            xerox also functions as a contractor for many xerox client accounts. we establish safety plans,
            deliver specific employee training and maintain management oversight to ensure operations meet
            both xerox and client requirements. in 2014, xerox uk was awarded accreditation from
            safecontractor a second year in a row for our commitment to achieving excellence in health and
            safety when conducting contracted work. this distinction has proved to be an asset in both
            obtaining new business and retaining our existing customers. safecontractor is a leading third-
            party accreditation scheme that recognizes very high standards in health and safety management
            among u.k. contractors.


            workplace health management
            our workplace health programs include processes for emergency medical response, the
            characterization of employee fitness for duty, illness prevention, and health and wellness
            promotion.


            programs are in place for conducting medical exams in connection with safety-sensitive work, and
            drug testing and immunizations based upon specific work operations and client accounts. ehs&s
            and corporate risk management partner on managing accommodations and post injury or
            disability return to work processes.


            preventing and monitoring workplace exposures
            to protect employees from unsafe exposures to chemicals, noise and radiation, xerox applies
            exposure limits to worldwide manufacturing, research and technology service operations based
            upon the threshold limit values (tlv) recommended by the american conference of
            governmental industrial hygienists. these reflect the best advice of a widely respected committee
            of international experts. however, in jurisdictions where government regulations are more
            stringent, xerox meets those regulatory requirements. for some materials — including toners and
            certain solvents and metals — xerox has established exposure limits that are more stringent than
            the tlv or existing regulations and standards.


            using the xerox exposure assessment process industrial hygiene and safety professionals monitor,
            assess and report workplace exposures. effective process design, engineering controls, safe job
            procedures and personal protective equipment are used to control exposures and protect employee
            health. medical surveillance programs are in place to monitor the health of employees working in
            operations with specific jobs and hazards (e.g., high noise, organic solvents). results of those
            medical exams are reviewed to ensure no adverse health effects.


            of the workplace exposures monitored in 2014, approximately 99 percent were within xerox limits.
            all were within regulatory limits or were controlled through the proper use of personal protective
            equipment where engineering controls were not possible.
                                                                                                                  89/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            environment, health and safety project reviews
            we continually make modifications to work processes and operations to improve efficiency and
            effectiveness. to ensure these changes meet xerox safety standards and follow our risk
            management philosophy, projects are reviewed by technical safety and environmental
            professionals. the scope of the project is defined, potential safety and environmental impacts are
            characterized, and control requirements are established before the project is initiated. the process
            serves to inform the engineering and management teams on safety requirements and ensures all
            project designs have controls integrated into work plans. the process ensures environmental,
            health and safety requirements are understood and implemented at the beginning of the project.

            evolving the workplace

            talent management and workforce
            development
            at xerox, we’ve built a culture around learning. rather than simply “delivering training,” we
            integrate learning into day-to-day work. our employees have access to a library of learning tools
            aligned to our corporate vision, values and business direction. so whether an engineer wants to
            brush up on writing and editing or an accountant wants to learn what it takes to be a manager,
            employees can delve into what interests them and take ownership of their own development.


            we rely on the expertise of our workforce to remain competitive and thrive.


            our key priorities include:
                 integrating learning with work
                 building a culture of learning, not just the delivery of training
                 fostering ownership of high-performance and career-focused learning among employees

            career planning
            we want employees to have rewarding careers at all levels, and our learning strategy and assets
            play an important part in our success. managers and employees work together to build
            individualized learning plans. in addition, we are developing our next generation of leaders. when
            managers identify an emerging leader on their team, they work with the individual to plan future
            learning, education and job roles. in addition, they alert their own management team about the
            emerging leader.


            each year, our ceo and her senior team discuss individual performance and career paths with
            those who are poised to assume key management roles. our human resource development
            council provides a forum for senior management to review the future needs of the organization,
            noting strengths, gaps and strategies to build strong teams for years to come.


            learning resources
            all employees (plus authorized business partners) can access our online learning environment,
            learning@xerox. this includes resources for many industry and xerox proprietary certifications. in
            addition to on-demand virtual learning, we offer face-to-face and virtual instructor-led classes,
            online collaboration, user-generated sharing, customized online portals and performance support to
            our people worldwide.


            on-the-job training is tailored to both current responsibilities as well as building a foundation for
            the future. these experiences provide hands-on opportunities to expand and enhance skills.


            we also encourage and, in some cases, offer support for employee participation in advanced
            degree and certification programs.




                                                                                                                    91/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            we realize that a strong employee onboarding experience for new hires is important for their
            success. the experience combines aspects of education about xerox culture and values with
            guidance about benefits, and more. learning paths cover topics such as ethics, diversity, and
            inclusion and security, as well as organization and critical job-specific information.


            asset access
            during 2014, 1.2 million learning assets were accessed through learning@xerox by our employees
            and partners. to keep our learning resources fresh, we publish thousands of new assets each year,
            including approximately 1,000 new or updated proprietary elearning courses. completions for each
            asset are captured allowing employees and managers to validate progress.


            we are currently working to improve our tracking and reporting process for employee training that
            occurs outside of our learning@xerox environment.


            learning@xerox is our web-based global learning platform. xerox employees and authorized
            partners have round-the-clock access to a collection of more than 750,000 learning resources,
            including videos, online classes and digitized books that support both formal and informal
            development needs.


            xstreamvideo, our video-sharing platform, contains more than 8,000 videos created by xerox
            employees which increase workforce engagement, allow our people to identify and promote
            innovative solutions, and accelerate the adoption of successful business strategies.


            xerox provides learning portals with curated resources targeted to specific employee population
            needs. for the services business, we launched xerox services university in 2014, which features
            blended social learning, access to targeted content and engaging coaching opportunities. each
            portal is aligned to our workforce development strategy.


            we evaluate all learning activities to ensure they contain relevant knowledge, fill skill gaps and
            promote the development of our employees. we assess the impact on our business through
            competency development impact studies, which help us understand how our training enhances
            productivity.


            our global learning and development has been recognized by the human capital development
            industry for thought leadership and spotlighted in publications such as training magazine,
            elearning! magazine, and chief learning officer magazine. we have received industry recognition
            from bersin by deloitte as a “learning leader” and won the whatworks ® award.


            in 2015, xerox was recognized as a learning leader through participation in the white house
            summit focused on the president’s upskill america initiative. the commitment to our workforce
            was referenced in the associated white house report.

            evolving the workplace

            employee rights
            at xerox, we protect the fundamental rights of our employees and respect the laws and customs
            of the countries in which we do business.


            we recognize our employees are our greatest asset. we continually strive to provide all of our
            employees with a safe workplace, free from all forms of harassment and discrimination. we have
            global policies and practices to ensure the highest ethical standards. all of our employees are
            treated fairly and equitably regardless of nationality, religion, ethnic origin, gender, sexual
            orientation, language or any other protected status.


            many xerox employees are represented by labor unions, trade unions or work councils throughout
            our global operations. relationships with these groups are based on applicable laws in each
            country.


                 in europe, we recognize a variety of work councils and trade unions as established under
                 european labor laws to meet requirements for information and consultation for the
                 protection of employee rights.
                 in the united states and canada, we maintain a cooperative and effective relationship with
                 five unions that represent nearly 2,000 employees in 15 locations: workers united, the
                 international union of operating engineers (iuoe), communications workers of america
                 (cwa), the united brotherhood of carpenters and the service employees international union,
                 through a cooperative agreement with workers united.


            operational changes to collective agreements
            in the u.s., the notification periods required for operational changes are specified in the different
            collective bargaining agreements and vary depending on the location and type of change. as a
            default, each agreement contains a “duration clause” which provides that if either party desires to
            make changes to the agreement before its termination, written notice must be given 60 days prior
            to the expiration date.


            grievance processes
            each collective bargaining agreement in the u.s. includes a provision allowing for unions to file
            grievances. the number of steps in the grievance process, however, is unique to each collective
            bargaining agreement, with the final step being binding arbitration.


            in calendar year 2014, u.s. grievances heard at the following steps (which denotes varying levels
            of management) were as follows:


            step 1: 165
            step 2: 107
            step 3: 111
            step 4: 53
            arbitration: 2
            others resolved: 79
                                                                                                                    93/147

            putting customers first

            customer satisfaction
            our customer experience is the key to our success. by listening to customers and enhancing our
            work based on their input, we are able to drive both meaningful relationships and quantifiable
            analytics to continuously enhance our programs and process.


            relationship surveys
            through relationship surveys, we ask our customers and partners about their experiences working
            with xerox. the surveys identify levels of customer satisfaction with our products, services and
            support. the feedback helps us determine which improvements are most likely to bolster customer
            value and help differentiate us from the competition. we follow a rigorous management process
            to ensure customer feedback is addressed at multiple levels with full accountability by the
            business.


            transactional surveys
            we employ transactional surveys to monitor satisfaction with our products and services. these
            surveys help us to diagnose root causes of complex issues. transactional surveys also tell us if we
            have achieved the objectives of our service-level agreements and if our customers are satisfied
            with individual interactions.


            customer satisfaction
            our global customer experience includes survey features and functions as well as advanced
            analytics capabilities, which drive progress in our customer experience program through better
            insights and closed-loop follow-up. in addition, the centralized platform provides a basis for
            governance and measurement process oversight.


            social media
            we have several customer support social media offerings, enhancing the online support experience
            and providing new ways for customers to engage with xerox support in the u.s.:


                 the xerox support community offers a peer-to-peer forum where customers and other
                 industry professionals can collaborate about xerox equipment and software. customers may
                 also access this online community with their mobile devices, enhancing their support
                 experience with social networking on the go.
                 the at your service blog provides customers with a witty and insightful look into equipment
                 features and services.
                 xerox’s latest support news is shared with followers of the @xeroxsupport twitter handle.
                 customers may also engage with us for product information and technical assistance.

            we actively listen to, and engage in, conversations generated by consumers in public forums and
            social media. this enables us to better understand consumers’ experiences with our products and
            processes and their perceptions of our brand. social media listening focuses on individual, publicly
            available conversations and provides insight into the impact of our products, processes, people,
            innovations and communications.



                                                                                                                   94/147

            xerox corporate focus executive program
            the xerox corporate focus executive program fosters relationships with our top corporate
            accounts. a senior xerox executive is assigned to collaborate with our account team to understand
            customer requirements, establish and implement strategic account plans, marshal resources to
            eliminate customer concerns and build strong, productive customer partnerships that enhance
            customer satisfaction and accelerate revenue growth.


            executive customer care program
            for more than 20 years, our corporate officers have volunteered in a rotation as “customer care
            officer of the day.” the program provides customers the opportunity to share their concerns with
            our senior leaders. it also gives our executives a unique opportunity to hear from a broad range of
            customers firsthand.


            the officer, supported by a team of dedicated professional problem solvers, assumes personal
            responsibility for assisting with any and all customer concerns. the officer of the day has three
            main priorities: listen to the customer, address the customer’s problem and take the necessary
            action to fix the underlying cause. it is a time-honored commitment to our customer focus.




                                                                                                                  95/147

            innovative solutions
            innovation is more than a buzzword at xerox. it’s what we use smartly and strategically to help
            the world tackle many daunting and laborious tasks. our mission and heritage to help our
            customers be more successful has led us on a fascinating journey where we innovate services,
            technologies and solutions that improve the flow of work, help our environment and enhance
            people’s lives.


            controlling an outbreak




            we have more than 600 researchers and engineers at xerox. since we acquired affiliated
            computer services in 2010, many of these individuals have shifted focus to our services business.
            we’ve developed more than two-dozen technology platforms to drive our business. these
            platforms support more than 100 customer offerings, such as the merge™ parking platform, mobile
            analytics platform, citysight®, maven® outbreak management software and the xerox ® program
            integrity validator. today, approximately 40 percent of our patent filings are in support of our
            services offerings.


            customer dreaming sessions
            in the words of sophie vandebroek, xerox chief technology officer and president of the xerox
            innovation group, “something is only an innovation if it makes a difference to our clients or to the
            world.” so the question is, how do you know what delights your customers? in our case, we ask
            them.


            at xerox, we view our customers as partners in innovation. our researchers observe customers and
            their clients directly in their work environments and employ ethnographic methods to identify
            needs and pain points. last year, we conducted nearly 200 customer events with more than 2,500
            participants. more than half of those interactions were dreaming sessions, where researchers and
            customers get together to explore the future of the customer’s business and identify the key
            issues.




                                                                                                                   96/147

            from those deep dives spring ideas that develop into business opportunities. for example, we’re
            working on ways to make it easier to harness data from images. scientists and engineers from our
            four global research centers are applying advanced image processing, sophisticated algorithms and
            predictive analytics to a range of industries, including transportation and healthcare.


            the merge® parking management system, deployed in downtown los angeles, is one example of a
            solution built on xerox innovation. this first-of-its-kind system gathers and analyzes data from
            smart meters, off-street parking lots and more than 6,000 on-street parking sensors to provide a
            complete picture of parking demand. motorists use their smartphones and vehicle navigation
            systems to obtain real-time information on parking rates and available parking spaces, and to
            make payments. in addition, smart-pricing algorithms adjust parking rates based on demand. this
            demand-based pricing helps eliminate congestion by offering incentives to drivers to use a
            different mode of transportation or park farther away.


            xerox is developing an easy-to-use transit solution, called xerox seamless™, which will provide a
            new, disruptive model for public transport mobile payments. operators would simply install near
            field communication (nfc) tags provided by xerox on their transport network. the tags use a
            patented method, developed by xerox research and development teams based in grenoble and
            valence, france, to secure the encrypted transactions and transmit them even without network
            connectivity.


            the xerox seamless solution will come with a smartphone app that makes it easy for public
            transport customers to manage their travel. travelers will simply download the seamless app and
            register. billing will be processed automatically, based on the trips completed on the various
            transport providers.

            putting customers first

            safe services and products
            safety has always been a cornerstone of our work in product development. our comprehensive
            product safety plan details specific requirements and all xerox imaging equipment is assessed for
            conformance to these requirements. we assess all potential hazards, including the ways in which
            different hazards may interact. we take a conservative position on potential health risks to
            employees and customers, always meeting or exceeding government safety regulations.


            customers are encouraged to review product safety information and understand the
            environmental profile of our devices. user guides contain information regarding safe use as well as
            any applicable hazard warning. our product safety data sheets (psds) offer environmental, health
            and safety information for each xerox device. safety data sheets (sds) identify hazards
            associated with specific materials and describe how they can be safely handled, used and stored.
            both our sds and product labeling have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the
            globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals (ghs) as implemented
            through regulations in our various markets. customers can access sds and psds in multiple
            languages at www.xerox.com/environment.


            we have robust processes for tracking regulatory violations and non-conformity with voluntary
            codes and labels. in 2014, no such instances resulted in fines or sanctions. we did self-report a
            non-compliance related to cadmium content in excess of regulatory and ecolabel limits in a small
            assembly used in several product families. the situation and actions we took are described in
            detail in the sustainable services and products section of this report. we have a comprehensive
            process in place for tracking customer concerns and other field events. all customer issues, such as
            incidents involving component failures and other potential safety concerns, are investigated
            carefully to determine the root cause, as well as monitored to discover trends. corrective actions
            are implemented, as necessary.


            ergonomic design
            we consider the ergonomic aspects of our products from both a user and a service standpoint to
            ensure inclusion and operability. our design teams consider all points of human interface, including
            a product’s height, curves, placement of touch screens and paper trays. customers work directly
            with the designers in our labs to test and continually improve the usability of new products.


            machine emissions
            consistent with the world’s most stringent ecolabels, we design products to control emissions of
            chemicals and noise. as a result, current products have achieved chemical emission levels that are
            well below global regulatory requirements — often at or near the detection limit of our
            measurement equipment — and are considered to have a negligible impact on customers’ work
            environments. we publish emissions data on each product’s product safety data sheet.


            toner study
            in 2013, we concluded a comprehensive investigation that lasted more than three decades on the
            health risks of inhaling xerographic toner. the studies included assessments of the health of
            current employees and an assessment of the causes of death for people who worked for the

            company between 1960 and 1982. the analyses demonstrated that the health and mortality
            patterns of xerox employees are consistent with a healthy working population, and in fact, our
            employees had a lower rate of disease (i.e., are healthier) than the general population. in october
            2010, the mortality study was published in the peer-reviewed journal of occupational and
            environmental medicine.

            data privacy
            at xerox, we take the utmost care to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of information our
            customers provide.


            our success depends directly on the extent to which our customers trust us to manage their
            business processes. we have policies and controls in place to ensure privacy protection for our
            customers’ personally identifiable information. our policies follow industry best practices, like the
            use of encryption technology and data loss protection software.


            additionally, we research and monitor the data-protection laws in the countries where we do
            business to ensure that we comply with applicable requirements. for example, we comply with the
            following international laws where applicable:


                 canadian personal information protection and electronic documents act (pipeda)
                 european union directive 95/46/ec on the protection of personal data
                 u.s. “safe harbor” framework, which was negotiated between the u.s. department of
                 commerce and the european commission as a way for u.s. companies to provide privacy
                 protection as required by directive 95/46/ec
                 applicable u.s. federal and state privacy laws

            we govern our privacy practices through the xerox ethics hotline and independent external
            sources, such as the better business bureau eu safe harbor program. both resources give
            customers and employees an outlet to report any concerns about the potential misuse of data.

            cybersecurity
            cyber attacks pose a threat to our customers, our employees, and our partners — in short, our very
            business. that’s why we’re always on the alert, working to stop hackers who would deface our
            website or gain access to sensitive information. we have comprehensive plans to deal with
            sophisticated threats, such as organized cyber criminals, cyber-espionage groups and even state-
            sponsored intrusion.


            our cybersecurity strategy has five major components:


            data-centric protection
            we use data segregation, encryption and data-loss-prevention technologies to ensure safe and
            secure processing and sharing of critical information. in addition, all data is classified according to
            its sensitivity. this data classification process enables us to understand the relative importance of
            securing each dataset and to make an informed business decision about the level and allocation
            of resources required.


            standards-based management
            by following industry-standard cybersecurity guidelines, we ensure our processes are repeatable,
            predictable and easily understandable.


            of the numerous cybersecurity control frameworks, we chose to implement both iso 27000 and
            the national institute of standards & technology cybersecurity framework.


                 iso 27000 information security management system — this international standard defines
                 “requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an
                 information security management system.” we incorporate iso 27000 as a normal part of
                 our business processes. independent auditors have certified many of our systems and data
                 centers as iso 27000-compliant.
                 national institute of standards & technology cybersecurity framework — created through
                 collaboration between industry and government, this framework protects networks and
                 infrastructure. the prioritized, flexible and scalable approach helps us manage cybersecurity-
                 related risk in a cost-effective manner. while this framework is relatively new to xerox, it has
                 already proven useful to predict, detect, disrupt or deter, respond and recover valuable data.

            capability maturity assessments performed by independent parties and benchmarking with other
            companies find our implementation to be sound, relevant and aligned with industry standards.


            continuous assessment
            we utilize a combination of evidence-based assessments, vulnerability scanning and penetration
            tests to validate that our data protection is effective and to ensure controls are operating properly
            on an ongoing basis.

            cybersecurity incident response
            we have emergency response procedures in place throughout our business. if we were to identify
            an attempted cybersecurity attack, we would take the following actions:


                 identify whom to notify internally
                 establish a multidiscipline virtual response team
                 implement monitoring protocols and egress prevention
                 estimate the extent of the compromise
                 coordinate with legal counsel and insurance carriers
                 if necessary, notify legal authorities

            these steps provide a general framework; business units have detailed plans tailored to their
            needs. we perform tests to assess our operational and managerial readiness on a regular basis.


            cyber risk management
            recent high-profile breaches demonstrate that any organization can suffer a cyber attack. when
            this occurs, there may be costly consequences — such as regulatory fines or purchasing identity-
            theft monitoring for affected parties. many companies invest in errors & omissions or cyber
            liability insurance to mitigate this risk.


            many insurance carriers and underwriters assess the level of risk when determining insurance rates.
            xerox, as well as other companies, has received reduced premiums and/or more favorable policy
            limits by implementing effective cybersecurity management.


            cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the it department. by collaborating across our
            company, we effectively manage risk, reduce the likelihood and limit the impact of exposure, and
            enable quick recovery from any attack on our infrastructure, networks and systems.

            putting customers first

            accessibility and mobility
            xerox was the first in the print industry to design products that are accessible and easy to operate,
            and we are committed to upholding that standard for the products and services we provide today.
            to make our systems more accessible for people with disabilities, we have developed accessories
            such as angled consoles, magnifying lenses for visually impaired users, braille console labels and
            “start print” foot switches. software for embedded web servers and print drivers is specifically
            designed to be compatible with screen readers to allow people with visual impairments to operate
            them. we strive to continually improve our performance in the area of accessibility and adapt
            products so that ease of use is not compromised.


            in 1998, congress amended section 508 of the u.s. rehabilitation act of 1973. we developed
            solutions to adapt our technology for use by government workers who are disabled. we established
            a rigorous process to evaluate our products’ compliance with section 508.


            in the near future, there will be changes to the section 508 rules and new input from the
            european union and the far east. learn more about our efforts to meet section 508 accessibility
            requirements.


            today, we are focused on increased mobility with the anywhere, always-on enterprise. we’re
            enabling enterprises to manage a complex infrastructure as employees are bringing their own
            devices to work and demanding the same seamless, secure ability to find, use and print business
            documents. xerox technologies — such as mobile print solution and predictive analytics used to
            improve the ease of municipal parking — are enhancing mobility and easy access to information.

            doing good business

            governance
            the xerox board of directors represents the interests of our shareholders in the successful
            operation of the company. the board also oversees the management of xerox to ensure the
            vitality of the company for our customers, employees and the other individuals and organizations
            that depend on us. the board is accountable for ensuring that xerox executes its responsibilities in
            a legal and ethical manner in any business environment.


            oversight of our commitment to global citizenship rests with the corporate governance committee
            of the xerox board of directors. the committee reviews significant shareholder-relations issues,
            and environmental and corporate social responsibility (csr) matters, and ensures that our actions
            align with our core values and priorities for citizenship. to that end, members of the board have
            reviewed a detailed outline of this report and support its content.


            in 2015, xerox strengthened its governance model by formalizing operation of a csr steering
            committee and csr council. the steering committee is ultimately accountable to the board.


            the steering committee, which includes three corporate officers who report directly to the ceo,
            sets corporate priorities, defines strategy and provides direction to the council. the csr council is
            composed of senior executives with responsibility and subject matter expertise in csr elements.


            the council is composed for the materiality assessment process and establishment of associated
            goals, key performance indicators and timelines. the council reports progress to the steering
            committee and the board. each council member leads a function-based work group that is
            responsible for understanding the drivers of performance, identifying risks and opportunities,
            executing action plans, and tracking regulatory and voluntary developments related to csr
            matters.

            board independence
            based on standards for independence developed by the new york stock exchange, the xerox board
            is currently approximately 90 percent independent. it includes one non-independent director: xerox
            chairman and ceo, ursula m. burns.


            the board appoints one of the independent directors to serve as the lead independent director
            whose responsibilities include: presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors; calling
            special meetings of the independent directors, as needed; addressing individual board member
            performance matters, as needed; and serving as a liaison on board-wide issues between the
            independent directors and the chief executive officer, as needed.


            criteria for membership
            the corporate governance committee of the xerox board considers candidates for board
            membership recommended by board members, management, shareholders and others. the
                                                                                                                    104/147

            corporate governance guidelines require that a substantial majority of the board should consist of
            independent directors, and that management representation on the board should be limited to
            senior company management.


            although no specific minimum qualifications must be met by prospective candidates, the
            corporate governance committee applies criteria set forth in our corporate governance
            guidelines. the criteria include, among other things, the candidate’s broad perspective, integrity,
            independence of judgment, experience, expertise, diversity, ability to make independent analytical
            inquiries, understanding of the company’s business environment and willingness to devote
            adequate time and effort to board responsibilities. nominees should bring a variety of business
            backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to the board. the corporate governance committee
            does not assign specific weights to particular criteria, and no particular criterion is necessarily
            applicable to all prospective nominees.


            director election
            each director stands for re-election every year at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. in
            an uncontested election, each director is elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total
            votes cast for the director. any incumbent nominee who receives a greater number of “votes
            against” than “for” his or her election is required to submit his or her resignation promptly. the
            remaining independent directors then evaluate relevant facts and circumstances and determine
            whether to accept or reject the resignation. following the official results of the election, the board
            is required to promptly disclose, in a filing with the securities and exchange commission, its
            decision and the reasons for the decision.


            requirement for ownership of shares
            all non-employee directors are expected to establish a meaningful equity ownership interest in the
            company. this requirement is achieved by paying directors at least one-half of their semi-annual
            board membership fees in deferred stock units, which are required to be held until one year after
            termination of board service.


            access to management, employees and advisors
            board members have complete access to the company’s senior management and other employees,
            and at the company’s expense, are authorized to obtain advice and assistance from outside
            professional advisors of their choosing.


            interaction with stakeholders
            board members are expected to attend the company’s annual meeting of shareholders and be
            available to speak with xerox stakeholders. to communicate with the non-management directors,
            you may directly contact the chairman of the xerox corporate governance committee at the
            “contact the board” link at www.xerox.com/governance.


            executive sessions of outside directors
            each regularly scheduled board meeting includes an executive session of only the independent
            directors.

            doing good business

            ethics and integrity
            our commitment to business ethics represents more than a declaration to do the right thing. it
            has become an integral part of the way we do business. in 2001, we established a business ethics
            and compliance program to make sure xerox employees and all those working on behalf of the
            company follow the highest ethical standards. the program aims to prevent, detect and address
            potential violations of xerox’s code of business ethics and its policies, laws and regulations.


            business ethics and compliance program
            to oversee all ethics-related activities, xerox established a chief ethics officer who reports to
            senior management and the board of directors. in addition, the xerox ethics and compliance
            governance board was formed to integrate the business ethics and compliance program into
            worldwide business operations. the ethics and compliance governance board represents business
            and corporate organizations within xerox and its subsidiaries, and participates in quarterly
            meetings chaired by our business ethics office. each board member has the following duties within
            his/her area of responsibility:


                 to establish a business ethics and compliance network
                 to implement ethics training and education programs
                 to ensure consistent enforcement of discipline policy
                 to ensure that organization-specific policies are consistent with existing laws, the xerox code
                 of business conduct and other company policies
                 to oversee and make recommendations for changes to xerox policies, including the business
                 ethics and compliance office charter
                 to evaluate ethics and business conduct issues and trends to proactively address potential
                 problems
                 to attest annually that organizational ethics and compliance programs are effective and all
                 employees have completed required business conduct training and acknowledgements

            code of business conduct
            our code of business conduct serves as the foundation of our ethics and compliance program. it
            embodies and reinforces our commitment to integrity and helps our people resolve ethics and
            compliance concerns consistent with our core values and legal and policy controls. our code of
            business conduct is available in 15 languages and accessible on our internal and external websites.
            the code is aligned to our core values and covers policies and guidance on key topics, including
            sales and marketing activities, controllership, insider trading, bribery, nondiscriminatory
            employment practices, privacy rights, human rights and environmental stewardship. the code also
            specifies employees’ obligations to report suspected ethical violations and reinforces our strong
            “no retaliation policy.”


            in addition to our global code of business conduct, we have a supplemental code of conduct for
            finance employees and a specific code of conduct for the board of directors. as a member of the
            electronic industry citizenship coalition, xerox uses the electronic industry code of conduct (eicc)
            as our supplier code of conduct.




                                                                                                                   108/147

            key components
            at the start of every year, our ceo distributes a message on business ethics to all employees. all
            employees must complete ethics training annually and acknowledge that they have read the code
            of business conduct. at the same time, officers and senior managers must certify that they are in
            compliance with our code of business conduct and have processes in place to support the
            company’s business ethics and compliance program.


            we promote awareness of our ethics and compliance program on our ethics & policies website and
            our intranet. periodically, we send ethics surveys to employees in several countries to gauge the
            state of the company’s ethical culture and help us focus on areas for improvement.


            we provide a variety of channels for employees, suppliers and customers to report suspected
            ethical violations, including phone, web, email and postal mail. our ethics helpline is available
            globally 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in multiple languages, via toll-free telephone numbers
            (see www.xerox.com/ethics) and our web reporting tool (www.xeroxethicshelpline.com), which
            supports multiple languages. we’ve contracted with an independent third party that specializes in
            helpline reporting with immediate electronic transfer of all reports to our business ethics and
            compliance office for case management.


            for some cases, the business ethics and compliance office provides guidance and takes immediate
            action; for others, including allegations of wrongdoing, an ethics investigation is required. the
            office follows a formal, consistent method for assessing alleged violations and complaints and
            directs them to the appropriate functional areas for investigation, resolution and closure. our
            business ethics and compliance office charter includes a “worldwide assignment of responsibility
            matrix for handling potential ethics violations and associated penalty guidelines.” the matrix
            includes a wide range of possible ethics and compliance violations within each category of our
            code of business conduct. ethics allegation matters that are substantiated, in whole or in part,
            result in some sort of disciplinary action — either counseling, training, warning letter, job
            reassignment, financial penalty or, in some cases, dismissal from the company. in addition to
            disciplinary action, resolution of many cases also may involve changes in processes or policies to
            prevent future occurrences.


            our business ethics and compliance office tracks all cases from initial reporting to closure.
            additionally, the office reports quarterly case activity and trends to the business ethics &
            compliance governance board and the audit committee of the board of directors, including the
            number of matters reported, case categories, outcomes and disciplinary action.

            anti-corruption
            xerox operates an active and comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption program that
            complies with all related laws and regulations. we have developed a global compliance program,
            supported by policy and training, to ensure zero tolerance for the giving or offering of a bribe of
            any amount or value, including so-called “facilitation payments.” the program also includes risk
            assessment of third-party intermediaries, followed by the application of appropriate due diligence,
            training and certification prior to engagement. we are committed to enhancing the program
            continually.


            banknote anti-counterfeiting
            the risk of banknote counterfeiting has increased with the quality of digital imaging tools and
            color printing technology. in response, we have joined other companies, the u.s. secret service and
            the central bank counterfeit deterrence group (a consortium of 32 central banks and note
            printing authorities) to assess threats to currency and support the use of anti-counterfeiting
            technologies. technology to deter the use of digital equipment for counterfeiting banknotes is
            being standardized. xerox sales and service employees are trained to respond to inquiries about
            our anti-counterfeiting efforts.


            black market supplies
            every year, the global imaging industry — and the customers who use its products and services —
            suffer the loss of millions of dollars due to counterfeiting or theft of supplies. we continually
            remind our customers that counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment performance, low
            supply yields, inferior print quality, toner leakage, increased failure rates and equipment downtime
            — all of which can cost time and money. to avoid this risk, we advise our customers to purchase
            solely from xerox authorized resellers. we work closely with our procurement department to call
            attention to “blending” of supplies — the mixing of counterfeit with original materials to achieve
            lower pricing and make detection of counterfeit items more difficult.


            theft of customer supplies represents an increasingly costly problem for xerox and its customers.
            it is difficult to prevent because web-based sales channels make it easy to purchase stolen
            products and to sell them once they are stolen. we continue to invest in technology and resources

                                                                                                                   110/147

            to bring the problem to the attention of customers and to identify their obligation to maintain the
            security of supplies (contracted and purchases). through engagement and support of our
            customers and local law enforcement agencies, we also provide tracing of stolen goods to identify
            and close the sources of theft.


            xerox is leading the charge against counterfeiting and other black-market activities, independently
            and in collaboration with other original equipment manufacturers (oems). to combat acts of
            piracy and fraud, our security team routinely works with the u.s. federal bureau of investigation,
            attorneys general offices, the postal inspector’s office and other global law enforcement agencies.
            in addition, we are a member of the imaging supplies coalition (isc), a trade association that
            serves to heighten customer awareness of black-market activities. wholesalers, dealers and
            consumers may submit questionable goods to the isc for authentication by the manufacturer. for
            more information, visit www.isc-inc.org.

            doing good business

            human rights
            as a truly global enterprise, we understand that we have an obligation to play a larger role in the
            world. we lead by example, encouraging respect for human rights in our own company and
            through our business relationships. every employee engagement, partner relationship and customer
            touchpoint represents an opportunity for xerox to exercise its commitment to human rights.


            our code of business conduct supports the principles of the united nations universal declaration
            of human rights. we make sure those principles are followed in our labor relations and
            employment practices, relationships with suppliers, risk management, internal audit systems and
            our approach to building business in emerging markets.


            xerox is a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc), an organization that
            promotes a standards-based approach for monitoring the social responsibility of suppliers. through
            the eicc, we further our commitment to human rights in such areas as labor, health, safety and
            environmental activity. see supplier relations for more information.


            we also manage a comprehensive data privacy program. we take utmost care to preserve
            protection of customer and employee personally identifiable information. see data privacy for
            more.


            a corporate-wide global policy letter serves as the foundation of our position on human rights.

            doing good business

            supplier relations
            social responsibility is ingrained in our business model, starting at the very beginning — with our
            supply chain. as a major organization spending approximately $10 billion per year to support our
            operations, we feel an obligation to actively manage our global supplier base and ensure these
            critical partners meet our high ethical standards.


            as a part of the purchasing process, we assess the quality, cost, delivery and sustainability of all
            products and services. across the u.s., europe and asia, xerox employees source, contract and
            purchase; local presence encourages direct interaction with our suppliers.

            supplier code of conduct
            our supplier code of conduct and compliance program are the primary tools we use to ensure
            ethical management in our supply chain.


            in 2006, we began working with the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc), whose code
            of conduct sets industry standards on social, environmental and ethical issues in the electronics
            industry supply chain. in 2008, we became an official member of the eicc. we have adopted the
            eicc code of conduct as our supplier code of conduct, and xerox serves on the eicc senior
            executive advisory council.


            we continually reinforce the importance of the supplier code of conduct to our supplier base. we
            incorporate standards from the supplier code of conduct in purchase agreements. we run a risk
            assessment and require suppliers to participate in the xerox compliance program. finally, we send
            an annual communication to our entire supplier base.


            the xerox compliance program upholds our supplier code of conduct. the following are
            components of the compliance program.


                 all suppliers are subject to an initial risk assessment, which is based on objective criteria.
                 suppliers flagged in the risk assessment — in addition to suppliers deemed critical to our
                 supply chain — are required to complete detailed questionnaires. in addition to highlighting
                 areas of potential concern, these questionnaires clarify our expectations and reinforce the
                 importance of these topics.
                 based on the assessments and questionnaires, we annually select suppliers for compliance
                 review or audit.
                 trained xerox personnel conduct audits on-site. audits and compliance reviews both follow
                 the eicc audit format, which addresses labor practices, freedom of association, child labor
                 and forced labor, human rights, environmental concerns and more.
                 during the audit, we classify areas of nonconformance as “priority,” “major,” “minor” or “for
                 review.” we provide each supplier with a written performance assessment.

            in 2014, we conducted 31 audits and 41 compliance reviews, representing 30 percent and 46
            percent of xerox direct/technology supplier spend. since 2010, we’ve conducted over 300
            compliance reviews and audits.


            in 2009, xerox became the first organization to achieve global certification from the chartered
            institute of purchasing and supply (cips) in the area of procurement excellence through processes
            and procedures, now known as cips silver. in 2012, xerox achieved cips gold certification at a
            global level, which recognizes our leadership in ethical, sustainable and strategic procurement and
            verifies our effectiveness in managing our global supplier base.


            xerox recently achieved the highest certification awarded at a global level, cips platinum
            certification. the platinum certification signifies world-class levels in all aspects of ethical,
            sustainable and strategic procurement when measured against cips’ globally respected standards
            structured around leadership and organization, strategy, people, process and systems, and
            performance measurement and management.



                                                                                                                  115/147

9/28/2015                                         xerox 2015 global citizenship report

            the certification process helped xerox global procurement to identify and validate internal best
            practices, identify areas for improvement, and provided an unbiased measure of our organization’s
            performance against benchmark industry criteria.


            in addition, it was a development opportunity for our people. team members, as well as the other
            resources they engaged, were energized by the experience. this project put the spotlight on the
            excellent work by our procurement team.


            business performance and reviews
            we regularly review suppliers’ performance against expectations and contractual requirements,
            prioritizing based on business risk and revenue impact. suppliers with the highest business risk and
            potential revenue impact are considered “critical” and are required to maintain an acceptable
            business resumption plan. we inspect these plans on a regular basis.


            revenue risk criteria include:


                 the amount of revenue at risk
                 the total dollar amount spent
                 the length of time before the machine or parts in the field impact recovery time
                 the total spend across xerox product families

            business risk criteria include:


                 whether a supplier is a single source
                 length of time to resume normal business practice after an adverse event
                 percent of business revenue xerox represents

            conflict minerals
            we are committed to improving mining conditions associated with mining in conflict regions.


                 xerox has an extensive conflict mineral policy.
                 we publish our due diligence activities in our yearly conflict mineral report.
                 our internal processes incorporate the organization for economic cooperation and
                 development (oecd) framework for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict-
                 affected and high-risk areas.
                 we are an active member of eicc and the conflict mineral sourcing initiative (cfsi).
                 we use the cfsi reporting template to survey our supply base about conflict mineral usage.
                 we support the conflict free smelter program (cfsp), which independently audits smelters
                 and refiners to determine if they have a system in place to assure sourcing of conflict-free
                 minerals.
                 our supplier contract template includes a specific reference to conflict minerals to ensure
                 responsible sourcing in our supply chain.

            supply chain security
            the xerox brand is known worldwide for delivering industry-leading document technology, services
            and solutions. counterfeit parts and supplies misrepresent the quality of our products and pose a
            serious threat to our reputation.


                 we have rigorous processes to identify and eliminate counterfeit supplies and components
                 from our supply chain. read our anti-counterfeiting statement.
                 whenever possible, we source from a base of trusted suppliers (and their authorized
                 distributors) who have been through our comprehensive vetting system.
                 we also always seek warranties guaranteeing authenticity and quality; among other benefits,
                 this practice mitigates obsolescence.
                 if suppliers wish to substitute an item different than originally agreed upon, they must obtain
                 approval from our global procurement group.
                 we’ve built security controls into our supply chain to help ensure the uninterrupted flow of
                 products from the point of manufacture to the customer.
                 we are a certified participant of the u.s. customs and border protection customs-trade
                 partnership against terrorism (c-tpat) and the e.u. authorized economic operator (aeo)
                 program in the netherlands and ireland. as part of these memberships, we’ve adopted
                 specific criteria into both our supplier security requirements and internal security policies and
                 standards.
                 we have an ongoing assessment program to monitor compliance by high-risk suppliers and
                 internal locations. we belong to the transported asset protection association (tapa).


            supplier diversity
            we proactively identify and seek to work with certified small businesses and also enterprises
            owned by minorities, women, veterans, gays and lesbians, and disabled persons. a diverse supplier
            pool is a competitive advantage and a powerful business tool.


            during 2014, xerox and our subsidiaries purchased goods and services from the following:


            minority-owned                                       $236 million

            diversity and inclusion is important not only to our company, but to our society and our world. we
            take part in several efforts with the goal of increasing diversity and inclusion in several different
            business areas.


                 the inclusion initiative is committed to identify and increase opportunities for minority- and
                 women-owned (mwbe) law firms. since joining the initiative in 2011, we have continuously

            doing good business

            risk management
            with global leadership comes global responsibility...not only to our people and shareholders, but
            also to the suppliers, distributors and citizens of the countries in which we operate. that’s why we
            devote considerable resources toward enterprise risk management (erm), anticipating and
            avoiding risks to the financial and operational health of our business.


            erm follows a clearly defined business strategy that is shared across the company and that is
            aligned with our strategic and organizational goals. our erm process adheres to the coso ii
            (committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission) framework. we assess all
            categories of business risk — strategic, operational, compliance, legal and regulatory, reputational
            and financial reporting — and coordinate our erm assessment with the internal audit risk
            assessment to ensure consistency between the erm plans and upcoming internal audits.


            several executive committees integrate enterprise risk management with business management
            by monitoring both risk exposure and how effectively those risks are managed. they include our:


                 management committee
                 enterprise risk steering committee
                 business ethics and compliance governance board
                 it risk governance board
                 credit committee
                 currency strategy committee
                 reputation management committee
                 management audit committees

            in addition, the xerox board of directors regularly reviews the enterprise risk profile and monitors
            the effectiveness of management policies and decisions, including risk management activities.




                                                                                                                   119/147

            business continuity
            we respond to major events that could disrupt business operations — such as natural disasters
            and pandemics — with comprehensive business continuity action plans. these plans are designed
            to minimize adverse impacts to our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and assets. they are
            well documented, communicated across all business units and tested annually to ensure rapid and
            effective response.


            xerox is a leader in telecommuting practices. when weather, power outages, or other work
            disruptions impact specific geographic areas, we are often able to continue our high level of
            service by redirecting the impacted activity to employees and/or systems in other locations.


            as an example, in 2014, severe winter weather forced the closure of our american logistics center
            for parts and supplies. in accordance with our business continuity action plan, we routed requests
            to distribution centers throughout the united states and set up regional locations to fulfill the
            requests. in doing so, we protected our people and assets while meeting our customers’ needs.


            safety is always our top concern. often, local customers experience the same work interruptions;
            communicating with clients and other stakeholders is paramount.


            our business continuity program office is responsible for the business continuity assurance
            process. all xerox organizations assess their plans against a standard set of criteria and report the
            status during operational reviews.




                                                                                                                    120/147

            investor relations
            xerox investor relations provides information about our financial performance, strategic intent and
            expectations for long-term profitable revenue growth to investors, financial analysts and potential
            shareholders worldwide. investor relations pays special attention to the clarity and accessibility of
            this information, which is released on a timely basis through press releases, webcasts, quarterly
            earnings presentations, annual reports, and securities and exchange commission (sec) filings.


            institutional investors hold approximately 85 percent of xerox’s common shares; of this group, the
            top 20 own close to 50 percent of the shares.


            in 2014, we held the following investor-related events:


                 approximately 80 institutional investors, analysts and investment bankers participated in the
                 company’s annual investor conference in new york city and over 100 watched the live
                 webcast.
                 xerox executives participated in 13 brokerage conferences.
                 investors and analysts met with xerox leaders at the print14 trade show in chicago, and we
                 conducted two audio calls related to our services business — one on managed print services
                 and one on our private healthcare exchange business.
                 we hosted approximately 60 small group meetings with current and potential investors in
                 major markets, including atlanta, baltimore, boston, chicago, dallas, denver, kansas city,
                 london, los angeles, minneapolis, montreal, new york, san francisco, toronto and zurich.
                 xerox executives spoke with investors/analysts during approximately 350 one-on-one
                 meetings and phone calls.

            doing good business

            public policy engagement
            xerox has a long-standing tradition of civic engagement. our involvement in the political process
            and global public policy debate is a natural extension of our core values. we work with
            governments, others in our industry and the broader business community to advocate for public
            policies that support our business goals.


            on issues for which our experience and knowledge add an important perspective to public debate,
            we seek to educate policymakers, both directly and indirectly, through various coalitions and trade
            associations. through the office of global government affairs, we have interactions with
            governments and governmental organizations throughout the u.s. (at federal, state and local
            levels) and around the world. we engage on issues that range from legal, trade, tax policy and
            financial activities to regulatory compliance, intellectual property and government procurement.


            international trade
            we support open markets and free trade. international trade is a powerful engine of global
            economic development that fosters job growth, improved living conditions and opportunities
            around the world. we support government-to-government negotiations aimed at liberalizing
            trading rules and opening markets, both on a bilateral and multinational basis. more open markets
            are critical for our technology and service solutions where we face barriers worldwide. we believe
            that all participants must be responsible citizens of the countries in which they do business.


            our chairman and ceo serves as the chair of the president’s export council, which is the principal
            national advisory committee on international trade. the council advises the president of
            government policies and programs that affect u.s. trade performance, promotes export expansion,
            and provides a forum for discussing and resolving trade-related problems among the business,
            industrial, agricultural, labor and government sectors.


            competitiveness
            through our support of the change the equation initiative, which directs more resources to
            science, technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) education programs, we focus on
            improving the ability of the u.s. to compete on the global stage.


            corporate taxation
            as a global enterprise, we comply with the tax laws and regulations in all 180-plus countries in
            which we operate. for more detail on the taxes we pay, please see our 2014 annual report.


            at the same time, we work in support of u.s. corporate tax reform. the u.s. has the highest tax
            rates among large, industrialized nations. corporate tax reform is needed if u.s. companies are to
            be fully competitive in overseas markets where 95 percent of the world’s population lives.


            intellectual property
            as a participant in the coalition against counterfeiting and piracy, we play an active role in
            combating theft of intellectual property by counterfeiters who manufacture knock-off products. we

                                                                                                                  122/147

            are also strongly supportive of changes in the law that would reduce the impact of frivolous
            intellectual property litigation that imposes unnecessary costs on innovative companies.


            environment
            our environment, health, safety and sustainability governance policy, adopted in 1991, forms the
            foundation of our environmental leadership program.


            state legislation
            we promote policy positions that make information technology (it) more effective in supporting
            state and local government missions, improve government technology acquisition processes,
            maximize the positive financial impact of it investments and create better outcomes for
            americans served by state and local government agencies and programs. our office of global
            government affairs has an established network of state and local government consultants whose
            responsibilities include monitoring legislation and policies that would impact our various
            government lines of business. examples of our government business interests include it
            outsourcing, regulation of credit card fees, eligibility and health insurance exchanges, emergency
            management services, work zone speed enforcement and electronic toll collections.


            retirement policy
            we believe policymakers should foster a legal and economic framework that encourages employers
            to maintain and increase the number of workers who have access to employer-provided retirement
            security. we take our commitment to our employees, both current and retired, very seriously and
            work with the u.s. congress and the administration to formulate policies that allow us to meet
            those commitments.


            healthcare
            as an active player in healthcare, we promote policies that allow for sustainable, high-quality
            systems that are more accessible, less costly and more patient-centered. we support every citizen
            having access to quality, affordable health coverage. however, too many obstacles — regulatory
            mandates, inaccessible data, inefficient processes, incomprehensible billing and ever-rising costs —
            threaten to undermine our ability to provide healthcare effectively. we seek to use our healthcare
            expertise, our heritage of innovation and our influence to enhance the entire healthcare
            ecosystem. we work with patients, providers, payers, employers and governments at all levels to
            improve people’s lives through better, more accessible and more affordable healthcare.


            as such, xerox maintains a leadership role in the following employer community organizations and
            coalitions:


                   corporate health care coalition (chcc): chcc is an organization composed of leading
                   companies from varying industries that compete in the global marketplace and advocate
                   for policies to make quality healthcare more affordable, accessible, accountable and
                   sustainable.
                   national coalition on benefits (ncb): the ncb is dedicated to working with congress to
                   maintain employers’ ability to provide uniform health and retirement benefits to employees
                   and retirees across state and local lines and to ensure that federal health reform initiatives
                   preserve erisa benefits.
                   american benefits council (abc): abc is a trade association whose corporate members
                   either directly sponsor or provide services to retirement, health and compensation plans
                                                                                                                    123/147

9/28/2015                                          xerox 2015 global citizenship report

                   covering more than 100 million americans and millions of others internationally. abc’s
                   mission is to be the most effective advocate for employer-sponsored benefit plans.
                   erisa industry committee (eric): a trade association, eric represents the employee
                   benefits and compensation interests of america’s major employers.


            professional organizations and associations
            trade associations around the world play an important role in assisting our company with business
            development opportunities and citizenship activities, as well as in helping us meet certain public
            policy objectives. we are a member of a wide array of trade associations. any trade association
            dues, or portions thereof, that are not deductible for tax purposes are reported in our lobbying
            disclosure reports. our senior managers play a leadership role in various organizations, such as the
            business roundtable, the u.s. chamber of commerce and the technology ceo council. these
            organizations develop and promote public policies that are considered important to our public
            policy interests and operations.


            while we prefer to make political expenditures directly rather than through professional
            organizations and associations, xerox, like all major corporations, is a member of various 501(c)
            organizations that may engage in political activities. while we may not necessarily agree with
            every position taken by each organization to which we contribute, we determine that the intended
            use of a contribution is consistent with our mission and core values before making a contribution
            to any such group. where our dues and other expenditures total $25,000 or more, we inquire and
            make a reasonable effort to obtain from those associations the portion of the dues or payments
            that are used for lobbying expenditures or political contributions. to the extent it is reported to us,
            we disclose the non-deductible portion of our contributions annually.


            the following lists u.s.-based trade associations in which 2014 dues and expenditures paid by
            xerox total $25,000 or more. the portion of our contributions used for lobbying expenditures or
            political contributions is also indicated:

                   business roundtable: the business roundtable has been actively engaged in shaping the
                   debate on corporate tax reform and is supportive of xerox’s goals for reform that will
                   enhance the ability of u.s. companies to compete internationally. we participate in the
                   policy formation and advocacy functions for the business roundtable’s tax reform efforts.
                   the roundtable has also focused heavily on developments with the most burdensome of
                   epa’s proposed regulations covering areas such as ozone, carbon emissions and boiler
                   controls, proposing less costly methods of achieving epa’s overall environmental goals.

            code of conduct training
            the xerox code of business conduct contains explicit information on our policies governing
            contact with elected and appointed government officials and agencies, as well as lobbying and
            political contributions. all xerox employees are required to participate in annual training on the
            code of business conduct and must certify adherence to the code upon the conclusion of the
            course.


            employee personal political contributions
            while we encourage our people to participate in community and political activities, we do not
            endorse any organization or activity in which employees choose to participate; and we do not
            discriminate in favor of or against employees based on the organizations they choose to support.
            employees are not reimbursed directly or through increases in compensation for their personal
            political contributions and expenses.


            xerox contributions to 527s in 2014
            the following 527 organizations received support from xerox in 2014. the name derives from
            section 527 of the internal revenue code, under which these organizations are tax-exempt. these
            organizations have a purely political focus, rather than one supporting an issue or cause. xerox
            contributions to the following 527 organizations are made with corporate — rather than xpac —
            funds:

                   republican governors association

            xerox corporate political contributions
            we have a long-standing policy that nothing of value may be given, paid, promised or offered —
            directly or indirectly — from corporate treasury funds for any of the following: (1) political party,
            committee and/or candidate for any federal, state or local government office anywhere around
            the world; (2) independent expenditure or ballot measure committees; (3) electioneering
            communications; or (4) candidates for judicial office.


            we have an established policy that does not permit any in-kind political contributions. the only
            authorized method to make political contributions on behalf of xerox is through the xerox
            corporation political action committee (xpac).


            xerox corporation political action committee (xpac)
            xpac is supported entirely by voluntary contributions from eligible xerox employees, and all
            contributions go directly to candidate campaigns for political office. xpac is nonpartisan and
            actively supports candidates and helps elect policymakers whose positions are consistent with our
            business values and strategies. xpac contributions promote the interests of the company and are
            made without regard for the private political preferences of company officers and executives. we
            strictly prohibit the use of xpac contributions to motivate or reward any official act.


            every proposed political contribution undergoes an internal review process to evaluate whether it is
            legally permissible and in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. in many cases,
            we may not agree with every position taken by a candidate whom we support.


            the xpac guidelines used as a basis for supporting candidates and elected officials include:


                   the integrity and character of the candidate
                   the candidate’s position on significant policy issues of importance to our company
                   the candidate’s overall support for our company and industry
                   the candidate’s overall support for the free enterprise system and u.s. competitiveness
                   a demonstrated willingness on the part of the candidate to work with our company and
                   industry to achieve responsible public policy solutions
                   the candidate’s representation of a state or district in which our company has significant
                   employees or facilities
                   the candidate’s representation of a state or district in which our company has significant
                   employees or facilities
                   whether the candidate holds a leadership position within their political party
                   the candidate’s electability
                   permissibility under applicable law

            in addition, xpac focuses on contributions that go directly to candidates for office. special
            exceptions are required for:


                   out-of-election-cycle contributions
                   contributions to leadership pacs
                   contributions to trade association pacs
                   contributions to ballot measure committees

                                                                                                                    126/147

                   contributions to political parties

            xpac does not permit contributions for:


                   independent expenditure committees
                   electioneering communications
                   candidates for judicial office
                   presidential candidates at any stage in the campaign process

            xpac discloses all contributions made and received on reports filed with the federal election
            commission and the various state and local campaign finance commissions, as required by law. in
            accordance with xpac’s articles of organization, an audit of the accounting books of the xpac are
            performed at least once during every two-year election cycle to assure compliance with the federal
            election campaign act of 1971, as amended, and its regulations and all other applicable laws.


            we use outside legal experts to provide periodic oversight of the company’s political activities.

              our goal: zero waste to landfills
              in 2014, we managed 93 percent of non-hazardous solid waste beneficially, up from
              92 percent in 2013. we’ve established a new aspirational goal to drive our
              reuse/recycle rate to 100% by 2020 at our technology facilities compared to a
              baseline year of 2009.

              as part of our commitment to conserve resources, we monitor water consumption
              across our manufacturing, distribution and r&d facilities worldwide. having met our
              corporate goal to reduce water consumption by 21 percent by 2014 (against a 2009
              baseline), we established a new goal to reduce water consumption by 35% by 2020
              (against a 2010 baseline). water consumption in 2014 was down 28% against the
              2020 goal.

            reducing emissions by reducing employee air travel
            business travel plays a big role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. in
            recent years, we’ve promoted videoconferencing and other technology as
            environmentally friendly alternatives to air travel. thanks to these efforts, we’ve
            reduced emissions due to air travel by 20 percent per employee for several years.
            from 2013 to 2014, emissions went up slightly due to increased business
            requirements.

            voice of the employee survey
            our proprietary voice of the employee survey allows managers to assess their
            employees’ satisfaction with their job, work group, manager and xerox as a whole.

            since 2009, we have surveyed our global population across 49 countries and in 26
            languages. each manager receives a personalized report to assist in developing
            action plans where needed. in addition, we capture global trend data and employee
            ideas.

            addressing employee inquiries
            a xerox proprietary web-based polling/routing/reporting system links employee
            inquiries or comments through the intranet with appropriate xerox contacts to
            identify and track any comment, suggestion or unresolved problem for action.

            the chart below displays the number of employee inquiries we received and routed
            for resolution. the decline in inquiries in recent years is due to the overall resolution
            of systemic issues and the ability for employees to provide comments/suggestions or
            raise a technical issue.

            stated, a balanced workforce makes good business sense.

            in the u.s., 55 percent of employees are women, and women represent 27 percent
            of executive and senior-level managers. diversity reporting is not tracked in most
            other countries.

            the chart below displays the percentage of executive and senior-level managers who
            were women over the past four years in the u.s.

            employee diversity — minority employees
            employees with different ways of thinking — and different ways of perceiving our
            world — are employees who create innovative solutions. in a business like ours,
            whose lifeblood is fresh ideas, this variety of perspectives is a priceless resource and
            a key to achieving critical business results.

            minorities represent 42 percent of employees and 13 percent of executive and
            senior-level managers in the u.s. diversity reporting is not tracked in most other
            countries.

            the chart below displays the percentage of minority employees in our u.s. workforce
            over the past four years.

            measuring customer satisfaction
            in 2011, we began investing in a new customer satisfaction process to ensure a
            stronger focus on understanding and fulfilling customer needs and expectations. the
            new process solicits feedback from our technology customers around the globe,
            providing detailed insights that help us identify systemic issues and make the
            necessary changes that ensure strong customer satisfaction. improved closed-loop
            follow-up processes also enable faster responses to individual problems.

            2011
            we chose to invest in a new customer satisfaction process to ensure a stronger
            focus on understanding and fulfilling customer needs and expectations.


            2012
            we continued our investment in a new customer satisfaction process to ensure our
            award-winning service and customer-centric approach builds customer loyalty and
            trust.


            2013
            we further developed our new customer satisfaction process and saw positive
            results, both in the feedback from our customers and in the internal measures we
            use to assess the quality of what we are delivering to the marketplace.


            2014
            xerox centralized client satisfaction measurement activities and provided
            governance and oversight on the measurement process with emphasis on improving
