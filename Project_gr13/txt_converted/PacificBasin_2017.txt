     csr reporting framework
     our csr reporting follows the environmental, social and governance reporting guide (“esg guide”) of the stock
     exchange of hong kong (the “stock exchange” or “sehk”), and draws on the guidelines and principles of the united
     nations’ global compact and gri’s sustainability guidelines as well as the international integrated reporting council’s
     international <ir> framework.

     we have measured and tracked key aspects of our csr

     the stock exchange esg guide’s disclosure requirements as
     they are phased in.


      an integrated reporting framework
      in preparing our annual report, csr report and internal management reports, we follow the international <ir>
      framework of the international integrated reporting council which enhances the way we think, plan and report the story
      of our business.

      our integrated reporting demonstrates how we embed holistic, integrated thinking into our strategy and plans and make
      informed decisions and manage key risks to build investor and stakeholder confidence and improve future performance.
      we also show how we rely on and impact our resources and relationships – our capitals – to protect and create value
      over the long term.

     our approach to csr
     a sustainable business approach
     we are a substantial shipping business that draws on and impacts the resources and relationships we rely on to create and
     protect value. these are called our "capitals".

     as a large player in our sector with an ambitious vision for the future, we recognise our responsibilities to these capitals
     which have a bearing on the long-term sustainability of our business. we believe that many of the responsible actions we
     take – our commitment to corporate social responsibility (csr) – make us competitively stronger and enhance our financial
     performance, our reputation and the future value of our business.

     these responsibilities and relationships are components of the key material matters we focus on to deliver our strategic
     objectives. our active approach to csr is therefore rooted in our culture and, governed by our policies and systems,
     integrated into our daily business behaviour and operating practices.

                                                                                                  page 11

our resources in action

materiality matrix & stakeholder engagement
pacific basin engages in active two-way dialogue with our stakeholders – primarily customers, suppliers, employees,
shareholders, financiers, industry associations and regulators. this enables us to map issues that are of greatest importance
to our business and stakeholders, and determine the key matters for discussion in our csr reporting. in addition to our day-
to-day contact with customers, we conduct regular and in-depth customer and investor surveys that provide insight about
our operations and ways we can improve. we also engage actively with associations that work to influence and respond to
regulations that affect our industry.

we measure and report key performance indicators (kpis) across our environmental and workplace performance. through
the reporting of these kpis and information in our csr report, we disclose each element deemed to be of greatest impact
to our business and stakeholders.

we welcome our stakeholders’ feedback on our approach to csr and the key material matters we discuss in our csr
reporting. please refer to the feedback form and contact details on page 41 of this report.

     people-focused safety innovation
     we constantly strive to enhance our safety culture with commitments from senior management ashore driving this safety
     mind-set across our organisation and fleet.

     our commitment to safety is manifested not only through our proactive pacific basin management system, but also through
     innovative proprietary initiatives and significant investment in seafarer training at sea and ashore to standards exceeding
     mandatory requirements, resulting in safety performance metrics (kpis) that are among the best in the industry.

     mitigation and safety performance include:

we have responded by reinforcing our established safety
programme with a campaign to target “zero lost time
injuries” which includes enhanced pre-joining and on-board training, and monthly alerts to the fleet with reminders of injuries
sustained on our ships. our “make complacency history” campaign now reaches out to our seafarers’ families for a more
holistic and effective approach.

very sadly, one of our deck cadets died in february 2016 from a fall overboard while assisting with the lashing of deck cargo
in the port of tauranga. the main lesson learned from this fatal accident was that crew must attach their safety harness
to a fall arrestor while working close to the edge of the cargo stack in accordance with our company requirement to do so.
the lessons were well noted and steps were taken to mitigate the risk of a repeat of such accident and to ensure that the
company’s safety management system and our safe working procedures are strictly adhered to on all our vessels. in its
report on the accident, the transport accident investigation commission of new zealand (taic) endorsed our follow-up
safety actions which they said negated their need to make any recommendations. we sincerely regret and were deeply
saddened by the accident, and our thoughts continue to be with the family of the deceased cadet.

     we sustained no navigational accidents in 2016. our navigational performance has benefitted from an extensive
     engagement exercise which collected wide-ranging feedback from our ships’ officers and managers as well as company-
     specific bridge team management training for all our navigating officers, which we introduced in 2013.

     we encourage near-miss reporting which in 2016 accounted for 783 reports (2015: 539) through which officers and crew
     described safety incidents and near-misses, however minor, which serves as a valuable tool for the prevention of injury and
     loss.

     staff wellbeing ashore
     we believe that exercising and staying fit is very important for all of us. in 2017, we will implement a global health, well being
     and fitness initiative to encourage our staff to be more physically active and spend more time outdoors.

                                                   in september, we won the safety award at the lloyd’s global awards 2016.




     operating in a highly regulated industry
     our workplace safety, health and engagement metrics follow best practices as defined by the industry and our peers.
     shipping is a highly regulated industry and pacific basin meets all minimum requirements and in some cases exceeds
     requirements determined by local, regional and industry mandates and customer expectations.

     our commitment to safety is manifested through (a) a proactive pacific basin management system, (b) innovative home-
     grown initiatives and significant investment in seafarer training at sea and ashore to standards exceeding mandatory
     requirements, and (c) kpis that are among the best in the industry.

     quality assured
     our pacific basin management system ashore and at sea conforms to the mandatory international
     safety management (ism) code. it is also certified by lloyd’s register quality assurance (lrqa) to
     voluntary standards, including:

     ■ iso 9001:2008 for our quality management system

     ■ iso 14001:2004 for our environmental management system

     ■ ohsas 18001:2007 for our occupational health & safety management system

training & development
we believe that our investment in the development and training of our staff at sea and ashore drives engagement, motivation
and retention of our staff and is key to maximising their safety and productivity.


high-performance teamwork at pacific basin is vital to our success. we
foster high crew standards and teamwork at sea, and our shore-based
technical and operations managers are experienced former ship captains
and chief engineers. this encourages a culture where problems are shared
openly and officers can rely on the very best, consistent support from
ashore.

employees at sea
we train our seafarers to standards equal to or exceeding those required by the international maritime organization’s
international convention on standards of training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers (or stcw).

this significant investment we make in seafarer training at sea and ashore drives our safety and external inspection
performance indicators which are consistently among the best in the industry.

here are a number of training and development investments we make to ensure a class-leading safety culture, service
delivery and workplace fulfilment:

■ we host at least four officer training seminars annually
  at our crewing centres in manila and dalian. through
  these two-day events, we engage with our “on-board
  managers” to reinforce our company policies, practices
  and values, review regulatory changes and industry
  developments, share safety and navigation-related
  experiences, and analyse industry incidents and develop
  preventive measures with the involvement of our crew and
  managers.

employees ashore
ashore, we make a concerted investment in staff training
and leadership development at all levels of the organisation,
which has resulted in enhanced productivity, engagement,
loyalty and retention and a strong foundation for our
succession planning. that investment ashore broadly takes
the following forms:

■ on-the-job training, site visits and company visits

■ understudy programmes for young executives

responsible procurement
our pacific basin management system manual requires
that, in all but some exceptional circumstances, stores and
spares for our fleet are purchased from approved suppliers
who are vetted before approval and reviewed at regular
intervals thereafter.

our selection and continued support of suppliers is heavily
influenced by the outcome of our reviews of their and their
products’ performance affecting occupational health, safety,
quality and the environment.

examples of vetting criteria we require of our suppliers and
subcontractors include, as appropriate:

■ certification to a recognised international standard

     award-winning safety & quality at sea
     the history of our technical team stretches back well beyond the founding of pacific basin, as many of our technical
     management colleagues served at the venerable jardine ship management which we acquired in 2000. drawing on our
     technical team’s combined experience, a safety-first ethos and the prudent rules and guidelines enshrined in our pacific
     basin management system, we are proud to be the stewards of best practices in technical, safety, quality and csr
     management. we frequently receive industry recognition for our commitment to and performance in these areas, as well as
     other areas such as corporate governance and investor relations.

     in 2016, we won three top global and regional industry awards for safety and best dry bulk ship operator including:

environment
                    drawing on our natural capital
                    the primary environmental impacts of shipping are emissions and discharges. at sea and in port, these
                    outputs are substantially all regulated and compliance is enforced across international, regional and local
                    jurisdictions.

                    we recognise our responsibility to reduce the impact of our operations on air, sea and land, and our
                    pacific basin management system is designed to measure and continually improve every aspect of fleet
                    operations, including our environmental outputs.


our environmental philosophy is centred on our commitment to being a responsible company at the forefront of environmental
efforts within the dry bulk shipping industry.

we have embedded across our global footprint at sea and ashore environmental programmes and initiatives that embrace
environmental stewardship and, specifically, serve to reduce our atmospheric emissions, marine discharges and resource
consumption. broadly speaking, we achieve this by:

tackling our environmental responsibilities
propelling a vessel across oceans requires many resources, the outputs of which impact the environment, as summarised on
page 12      . we take a holistic approach to reducing our operations’ impact on the atmosphere, sea and land. our pacific basin
management system ashore and at sea conforms to the mandatory international safety management (ism) code and is also
certified by lloyd’s register quality assurance (lrqa) to voluntary standards, including iso 14001:2004 for our environmental
management system. we track the effectiveness of our environmental management systems using kpis.

environmental responsibilities

we seek to minimise our impact on the environment
from atmospheric emissions, resource consumption
and marine discharges
through the adoption of energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly ship designs, technologies and practices at sea and
ashore. the information below is a summary of significant initiatives we pursue to reduce our environmental impact.




atmospheric emissions & fuel efficiency
the main measures and technologies we use to minimise our emissions include:

 marine discharges & waste management
 the main measures and technologies we use to minimise our marine discharge and waste include:

 reducing marine discharges

 ■ our ism-compliant safety management system prescribes system controls, procedural safeguards and training to prevent
   and respond to oil spillage.

 ■ oily water separators minimise the risk of inadvertently pumping out contaminated bilge water.

 ■ imo-compliant ballast water management plans set out strict practices to minimise the spread of aquatic species.

 ■ we use biocide-based paints and monitor advances in more eco-friendly paints.

 waste management

 garbage compactors on our ships facilitate easy storage of operational garbage (excluding food waste and cargo residues)
 until it can be disposed of responsibly on shore.

green efforts ashore
across our offices ashore, we do what we reasonably can to minimise our
footprint by addressing environmental elements that are within our control.

guidelines and communications are regularly posted and policies and practices
are in place across our network of offices to:

■ reduce consumption of electricity, water and materials

■ recycle office waste

pacific basin was awarded a silver label in the wwf’s low-carbon office
operation programme that measures and tracks outputs and energy consumption from our headquarters in hong kong.

an independent audit of our environmental performance determined that our office in hong kong (where 59% of our shore-
based staff work) produced carbon emissions of 1,067 metric tonnes for the 2015/2016 audit year (2014/15: 1,329).

our hong kong headquarters’ carbon intensity in 2016 reduced 20% to 5.3 tonnes co2 per employee due to a number of
initiatives including:

■ eliminating ten computer servers;

■ more skype-based video meetings reducing the need for air travel; and

■ switching from business class to economy class air travel.

the seafarer community
as one of the largest foreign employers of chinese crew and a significant employer of filipino crew, we invest in recruitment
activities and training programmes in dalian, manila and hong kong. community donations are focused on seafarer welfare
causes.

■ our human resources director is an asian ambassador of the sailors’ society, an organisation we support because of our
  particular interest in the welfare of seafarers and their dependents globally. through this role, we promote regionally the need
  to support the welfare of seafarers whose lives at sea are not easy and who give so much to the business of shipping.

■ in 2016, our charitable donations and sponsorship amounted to
  over us$55,000, including donations to the sailors’ society and the
  mission to seafarers.

■ we sponsor a minibus in manila for the use of the sailors’ society to
  provide free transport to all seafarers in manila and to facilitated ship
  visits by the manila port chaplain.

our ships trade globally and our crew and ships are considered
ambassadors for pacific basin wherever they sail, so we
inspire them to:

■ strictly abide by requirements under applicable
  environmental law so as to minimise our impact on the cities,
  towns, ports and shorelines we visit;

■ show skilful seamanship and act professionally in the way
  they conduct their ships’ business;

■ be respectful law-abiding visitors, to show warm hospitality
  towards visitors on board, and to be in every way becoming
  of pacific basin personnel; and

■ establish and maintain good relations with port authorities,
  agents and other stakeholders in the places we visit.

one measure of our success in this area is the feedback we get from stevedores, port operators and other stakeholders in the
ports where we call. here are examples of commendations we received in 2016:

    our carbon emissions have been calculated using the industry-standard ship energy efficiency operational indicator (eeoi) method since
    2013. 2012 carbon emissions are based on an earlier co2 index formula.
2
    emissions from our headquarter office consumption and activities includes emissions from staff commuting and business air travel, air
    conditioning, lighting and computer and office equipment, as well as paper and fresh water consumption (audit period: july 2015 to june 2016).
3
    in 2016, we purchased more low sulphur marine gas oil (and no low sulphur fuel oil or marine diesel oil) in order to meet emission regulations
    limiting fuel sulphur content to no more than 0.1% in designated emission control areas where our ships frequently trade.
4
    in 2015, the fatal fall of an indian stevedore who entered a cargo hold without authorisation was deemed to be outside our scope of responsibility.
    two deaths in 2012 were non-work related, including one of natural causes.

      remarks:
      a)   we do not address sehk esg subject areas a2.2, a2.4, a2.5 and b6 because we are a freight service business that does not require sourced water or
           packaging material and does not manufacture and/or sell products.
      b)   items in bold text are “comply or explain” matters for 2016, while the disclosure level for all other items is “recommended” only.
