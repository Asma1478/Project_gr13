                 building three iconic brands people trust & champion
                 yum! brands 2014 corporate social responsibilty report


thank you for your interest in the yum! brands 2014 corporate social responsibility report. i’m extremely proud
of the many ways our three iconic brands come together to show we’re a company with a huge heart—opening
doors, growing people and truly caring about the world.


kfc, pizza hut and taco bell serve millions of customers in our 41,000 restaurants in 125 countries and territories
around the world. and i’m equally pleased that each brand has meaningful csr efforts that positively impact the
local communities where our employees, franchisees and customers live and work. considering our collective
impact, yum! brands was the only restaurant company to be named one of the 100 best corporate citizens by
corporate responsibility magazine in 2014. i’m proud of the progress we’re making on our journey to build
three global brands people trust and champion, and we are going to get better and more courageous every day at
delivering on the high quality, high integrity commitments our consumers and stakeholders care about most in
our food, people, communities and environment.


this year we continued on our journey to serve high quality food that’s delicious and nutritious. we also invested
significantly in all of our people. when it comes to reducing our environmental footprint, we made great strides
towards being responsibly green in our restaurants and beyond. lastly, we have raised $600 million in cash and
food donations since 2007 in the fight against global hunger for the united nations world food programme and
other hunger relief agencies.


as you learn more about our efforts in this report, hopefully you’ll see that csr is at the heart of how we are
growing our brands. i believe people will trust and champion us when our actions and commitments to being a
sustainable and responsible organization are clear and consistent and when we’re open and transparent about our
progress, challenges and outcomes. make sure to check out our 2014 performance summary for a quick overview.
thank you again for your interest and please feel free to contact us with any questions.

  supplier code of conduct
  yum! brands, inc. ("yum") is committed to conducting its business in an ethical, legal and socially responsible manner. to
  encourage compliance with all legal requirements and ethical business practices, yum has established this supplier code of
  conduct (the "code") for yum's u.s. suppliers ("suppliers").

  compliance with laws and regulations

  suppliers are required to abide by all applicable laws, codes or regulations including, but not limited to, any local, state or
  federal laws regarding wages and benefits, workmen's compensation, working hours, equal opportunity, worker and product
  safety. yum also expects that suppliers will conform their practices to the published standards for their industry.

  employment practices

  working hours & conditions: in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, codes and industry standards, suppliers are
  expected to ensure that their employees have safe and healthy working conditions and reasonable daily and weekly work
  schedules. employees should not be required to work more than the number of hours allowed for regular and overtime work
  periods under applicable local, state and federal law.

  non-discrimination: suppliers should implement a policy to effectuate all applicable local and federal laws prohibiting
  discrimination in hiring and employment on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, age, physical disability, national origin,
  creed or any other basis prohibited by law.

  child labor: suppliers should not use workers under the legal age for employment for the type of work being performed in any
  facility in which the supplier is doing work for yum. in no event should suppliers use employees younger than 14 years of age.

  forced and indentured labor: in accordance with applicable law, no supplier should perform work or produce goods for yum
  using labor under any form of indentured servitude, nor should threats of violence, physical punishment, confinement, or other
  form of physical, sexual, psychological, or verbal harassment or abuse be used as a method of discipline or control.

  notification to employees: to the extent required by law, suppliers should establish company-wide policies implementing the
  standards outlined in this code and post notices of those policies for their employees. the notices should be in all languages
  necessary to fully communicate the policy to its employees.

  audits and inspections

  each supplier should conduct audits and inspections to insure their compliance with this code and applicable legal and
  contractual standards. in addition to any contractual rights of yum or unified foodservice purchasing co-op, llc ("ufpc"), the
  supplier's failure to observe the code may subject them to disciplinary action, which could include termination of the supplier
  relationship. the business relationship with yum and ufpc is strengthened upon full and complete compliance with the code
  and the supplier's agreements with yum and ufpc.

  application

  the code is a general statement of yum's expectations with respect to its suppliers. the code should not be read in lieu of but
  in addition to the supplier's obligations as set out in any agreements between yum or ufpc and the supplier. in the event of a
  conflict between the code and an applicable agreement, the agreement shall control.
