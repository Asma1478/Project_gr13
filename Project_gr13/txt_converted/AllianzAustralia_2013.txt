              i am pleased to report very good results once again this year. a ­ llianz posted
              revenues of more than € 110 bn for the first time ever, while at the same
              time considerably increasing profitability. at € 10.1 bn, our 2013 operating
              profit was one of the highest in our history. we increased our net income by
              14.1 % to € 6.3 bn. net income attributable to shareholders amounted to
              € 6.0 bn. therefore, we will propose a dividend of € 5.30 per share.

              with these results we held up very well not only against our international
              competitors. we also continued to further improve our financial strength
              as evidenced by one of the best ratings of all insurance companies from the
              rating agency standard & poor’s. furthermore, our aa rating outlook was
              updated to “stable” by the same rating agency. this represents an outstanding
              assessment of our capital strength and solidity. the message is that your
              money is well invested in ­allianz shares.

              this strong performance in such a challenging business environment is
              once again the impressive result of the efficiency and skill of o­ ur employees
              around the world – and of our distribution partners. i would like to thank
              them for their remarkable efforts last year. and i think that i also may offer
              these words of praise on your behalf, as the owners of ­allianz.

    it was a difficult year for all regions of the world, with growth hampered by
    the need for structural adjustments, the fiscal consolidation in the
    eurozone, the fiscal gridlock in the united states and sizeable political risks
    – especially in the middle east. as a result, global economic growth in 2013
    was even slightly lower than in the previous year. while central banks have
    supported growth by making an almost unlimited supply of liquidity
    available, the impact of persistently low interest rate levels represents a
    challenge for all savers and, in turn, for us as an insurer. in addition, severe
    hail, storms and floods in 2013 had an adverse effect on our results, in
    particular in germany and eastern europe.

    even so, we succeeded in making positive headlines for the second year in
    a row. the property-casualty business posted an increase in operating profit
    of 14.2 %, despite considerable losses from natural catastrophes. we were
    more than able to make up for these losses with a big improvement at our
    u.s. property-casualty subsidiary fireman’s fund and an excellent contri­-
    bution to operating profit from ­allianz italy.

    meanwhile, our life/health revenues grew by 8.5 %, supported by strong
    growth in particular in germany and italy, despite the general uncertainty
    among clients caused by the low interest rate environment, while operating
    profit declined by 8.0% from the high level in the previous year. in germany,
    we launched a new life insurance product in 2013 with separate guarantees
    in the savings and payout phases, which results in much less stringent
    capital adequacy requirements. in return, the client can expect higher
    returns. this innovation met with a good response in the market.

    the asset management business managed to post a record operating profit
    in 2013, with growth of 7.0 % despite a challenging environment in
    the second half. our asset manager pimco recorded outflows of funds

              following the debate in the united states on a gradual reduction of asset
              purchases by the federal reserve bank.

              we continued to pursue our investments in future growth in a systematic
              manner. this year, we made an acquisition in turkey, which makes us the
              market leader in one of the most attractive growth markets. we bought the
              company – multi-line insurer yapı kredi – in july, at the same time securing
              a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with yapı kredi bank. thanks
              to the acquisition of yapı kredi, our market share in turkey is now almost
              comparable with our position in germany.

              for the coming year, we believe that allianz is well equipped to further boost
              its competitive position despite the challenges we face.

              although the economies in europe and the united states are continuing to
              stabilize, interest rates in both regions are likely to remain low for the
              foreseeable future. the euro has meanwhile staged a strong recovery, despite
              the european debt crisis being far from over. while this is a welcome
              development in one sense, it ­also has an adverse impact on exports and on
              the foreign revenues of european companies with international operations.
              however, without further diversifying our investment portfolio we won’t
              achieve a satisfying investment performance on new investments. in this
              context, we also have to be attuned to currency fluctuations.

              a further challenge is the need to tackle difficult detailed aspects of
              regulation – supervisory legislation, solvency rules and the consequences
              of ­allianz’s systemic relevance. this ties up a lot of resources and could
              potentially lead to higher capital adequacy requirements for a   ­ llianz. in our
              opinion, our strong capital position already covers such higher capital
              adequacy requirements today.




                                                                                                  7

    alongside regulation, another increasingly important theme is the digitali-
    zation of our business models. new technologies are enabling us to meet
    the evolving needs of our clients, develop new products and tariffs and
    become more efficient and competitive. in this context, keeping our clients’
    and company’s data secure has been given top priority. digitalization is
    a long-term project. we have already achieved a great deal in recent years,
    but there is still a lot of work to do if we are to take full advantage of the
    potential available to us.

    we are pleased to note that our shareholders have also benefited from our
    success. we see the increase of 24.4 % in ­allianz’s share price in 2013 as a
    sign that the markets agree with our strategy and our earnings stability. for
    2014, we are aiming for an operating profit of € 10.0 bn. due to ongoing
    market volatility, however, we believe that this result may ultimately rise or
    fall by up to € 500 mn. we will continue to work hard to justify your trust in us.

     supervisory board report




     ladies and gentlemen,
     during the 2013 fiscal year, the supervisory board fulfilled all its duties and obligations as laid
     out in the company statutes and applicable law. it monitored the management of the company
     and advised the board of management regarding the conduct of business.

     overview
     within the framework of our monitoring and advisory activities, the board of management
     informed us on a regular basis, and in a timely and comprehensive manner, both verbally and
     in writing, on the course of business, as well as on the economic and financial development
     of ­­allianz group and ­­allianz se, including deviations in actual business developments from
     existing plans. further key areas the board of management reported on were business strategy,
     capital adequacy, the challenges facing life insurance due to persistent low interest rates, the
     effects of the sovereign debt crisis in europe and ­­allianz se’s classification as a global systemi-
     cally important insurer by the financial stability board (fsb) and the international association
     of insurance supervisors (iais), as well as any potentially resulting regulatory requirements.

                       in addition, we were extensively involved in the board of management’s planning for both the
                       2014 fiscal year and the medium term. at various meetings, the chief executive officers (ceos)
                       of euler hermes, ­­allianz lebensversicherungs-ag and pimco presented the performance and
                       strategic positioning of their entities.

                       the board of management’s reports were supplemented by documents which each member of
                       the supervisory board received in preparation for each meeting. likewise, the annual financial
                       statements of ­­allianz se, the consolidated financial statements and the auditor’s reports were
                       also made available to us in time for the relevant meeting. the half-yearly and quarterly financial
                       reports, and the results of the auditor’s review were provided in advance to members of the
                       audit committee.

                       in the 2013 fiscal year, the supervisory board held six meetings. the meetings took place in
                       february, march, may, august, october and december.

                       the board of management also informed us in writing of important events that occurred
                       between meetings. the chairmen of the supervisory and management board also had regular
                       discussions about major developments and decisions. details on each member’s participation
                       at meetings of the supervisory board and its committees can be found in the corporate gover-
                       nance report, starting on   page 27.

                       issues discussed in the supervisory board plenary sessions
                       in all of the supervisory board’s 2013 meetings, the board of management reported on group
                       revenues and results, developments in individual business segments, and on the capital,
                       financial and risk situation. we were regularly informed by the board of management on
                       the impact of natural catastrophes, the status of major legal disputes and other essential
                       developments.

                       in the meeting of 20 february 2013, the supervisory board dealt comprehensively with the pro-
                       visional financial figures for the 2012 fiscal year and the board of management’s recommended
                                                                             ­­
                       dividend. it also discussed the intended closure of allianz   bank’s business operations and the
                       planned purchase of turkish insurer yapı kredi. the appointed audit firm, kpmg ag
                       wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (kpmg), munich, reported in detail on the provisional results
                       of their audit. the supervisory board also reviewed the extent to which individual members of
                       the board of management had achieved their targets and set their variable remuneration for
                       the 2012 fiscal year and their 2010 – 2012 mid-term bonus.

                                                                                                           ­­
                       in the meeting of 14 march 2013, the supervisory board discussed the audited annual allianz se
                       and consolidated financial statements as well as the recommendation for the appropriation

     of earnings by the board of management for the 2012 fiscal year. kpmg confirmed there were no
     discrepancies to their february report and issued an unqualified auditor’s report for the indi-
     vidual and consolidated financial statements. the supervisory board also dealt with the agenda
     for the 2013 agm of ­­allianz se and approved the supervisory board’s proposals for resolution. in
     addition, we resolved to appoint kpmg as auditor for the individual and consolidated financial
     statements for the 2013 fiscal year as well as for the auditor’s review of the 2013 half-yearly
     interim report. by way of a presentation the supervisory board was also informed in detail
     about the performance of global credit insurer euler hermes.

     on 7 may 2013, just before the agm, the board of management briefed us on the first quarter
     2013 performance and on the group’s current situation, particularly the capital adequacy. we
     further used this meeting to prepare for the subsequent agm. the supervisory board adopted a
     resolution regarding the extension of manual bauer’s appointment until 31 december 2014, the
     year in which he will turn 60.

     in our meeting on 1 august 2013 the board of management reported in depth on the half-yearly
     results. we examined ­­allianz turkey’s business activities and the security of client data in the
                                                                      ­­
     wake of the nsa disclosures. we also dealt with the issuance of allianz     shares to employees of
     ­­allianz group. we were given a presentation on the performance of a­­ llianz lebensversicherungs-­
     ag and had a thorough discussion about the challenges posed by persistently low interest rates
     and about product initiatives featuring a new guarantee concept. in the executive session, we
     agreed to a reduction in the thresholds regarding transactions in equity holdings which
     require our approval as well as to the respective amendment of our rules of procedure.

                                                                                     ­­
     at the meeting of 2 october 2013, we dealt extensively with the strategy of the allianz group,
     including risk strategy and risk management, capital management and digitalization. we were
     also given a presentation on the business performance and further development of the busi-
     ness model at pimco and discussed the outflows of funds from fixed income investments. the
     meeting was followed by a separate information session for members of the supervisory board
     where ­­allianz managers gave presentations on current topics.

     at the 12 december 2013 meeting, the board of management informed us of the third-quarter
                                                                   ­­
     results, further business developments, the situation of the allianz group, and several other
     issues. we then discussed the planning for the 2014 fiscal year and the three-year period 2014 –
     2016, as well as the remuneration structures within the ­­allianz group and the declaration of
     conformity with the german corporate governance code (code). on the recommendation of
     the personnel committee, the supervisory board adopted a resolution to adjust the remunera-

                       pension schemes for members of the board of management, and set out their targets for 2014.
                       we also reviewed and approved the appropriateness of the remuneration of the board of
                       management by means of a vertical and horizontal comparison. in line with a new recommen-
                       dation of the code, the “upper management” and “relevant workforce” groups were defined for
                       the vertical comparison. in addition, we intensively discussed the supervisory board’s efficiency
                       review, which we carried out for the first time in 2013 with the aid of an external advisor, and
                       we discussed potential improvements in the way the supervisory board operates.

                       the supervisory board dealt with the new version of the code dated 13 may 2013.

                       on 12 december 2013 the board of management and the supervisory board issued the decla-

                       recommendations of the german corporate governance code commission made in the
                       code’s version of 13 may 2013 with one exception. deviating from item 5.3.2 of the code, the
                       supervisory board’s risk committee – rather than the audit committee – will be responsible
                       for monitoring the risk management system.

                       committee activities
                       the supervisory board has formed various committees in order to perform its duties efficiently:
                       the standing committee, the personnel committee, the audit committee, the risk committee
                       and the nomination committee. the committees prepare the discussion and adoption of reso-
                       lutions in the plenary sessions. furthermore, in appropriate cases, the authority to adopt reso-
                       lutions has been delegated to the committees. there is no conciliation committee because the
                       german co-determination act (“mitbestimmungsgesetz”) which provides for such a commit-
                       tee does not apply to ­­allianz se as a european company (se). please find the composition of the
                       committees at the end of the reporting period on   page 15.




annual report 2013     allianz group                                                                                       13

     the standing committee held five meetings in 2013. these related primarily to corporate gover-
     nance issues, the preparation for the agm, the employee stock purchase plan, and a review of
     the supervisory board’s efficiency conducted by an external advisor. during the fiscal year the
     committee passed resolutions requiring approval on the use of authorized capital 2010/ii for
     the issue of shares to employees and to approve loans to senior executives.

     the personnel committee met four times over the fiscal year 2013. the committee dealt with
     personnel matters for both active and former members of the board of management, including
     succession planning and top management development. it also reviewed the extent to which
     members of the board of management had achieved their annual targets for fiscal year 2012
     and the targets for the 2010-2012 mid-term bonus. the committee prepared the review of the
     board of management’s remuneration system, including the setting of targets for variable
     remuneration in 2014. in addition, the committee dealt with the mandates held by board of
     management members in the interests of the ­­allianz group. in relation to this, resolutions
     were also adopted by written procedure in april and july 2013.

     the audit committee held five meetings in 2013. in the presence of the auditors, it discussed
     the annual financial statements of ­­allianz se and the consolidated financial statements of the
     ­­allianz group, the management reports and auditor’s reports. in addition, the committee
     reviewed the half-yearly and quarterly financial reports and, together with the auditors, went
     through the details of the auditor’s review of these financial statements. after carrying out
     these reviews, the audit committee saw no reason to raise any objections. the committee also
     reviewed the auditor’s engagement and established priorities for the annual audit. in addition,
     assignments to the auditors for services not connected to the audit itself were discussed. an
     upper limit for “non-audit services” by kpmg was agreed upon, requiring approval from the
     audit committee if it is to be exceeded. the committee also dealt with the compliance system,
     the internal auditing system as well the accounting process and internal financial reporting
     control mechanisms, including the appropriateness of the respective systems and processes.
     the committee received regular reports from the head of group audit, from the general
     counsel and from the chief compliance officer on material audit results and their status as
     well as on legal and compliance issues. the committee approved the audit plan by group
     audit for 2014.

     the risk committee held two meetings in 2013. in both meetings, the committee discussed the
     current risk situation of the ­­allianz group with the board of management. the risk report as
                                                            ­­
     well as other risk-related statements in the annual allianz   se and consolidated financial state-
     ments and management and group management reports, were reviewed with the auditor and

                       the audit committee was informed of the result. the appropriateness of the early risk recogni-
                       tion system in ­­allianz was also discussed. in the august meeting, the committee looked in
                       detail at the effectiveness of the risk management system, including an examination of its
                       compliance with minimum supervisory requirements. other matters considered were the risk
                       strategy and market and credit risk.

                       there was no business requiring a meeting of the nomination committee during fiscal year 2013.

                       the supervisory board was regularly and comprehensively informed of the committees’ work.

                       audit of annual accounts and consolidated financial statements
                        in compliance with the special legal provisions applying to insurance companies, the statutory
                        auditor and the auditor for the review of the half-yearly financial report are appointed by the
                        supervisory board of ­­allianz se and not by the agm. the supervisory board has appointed kpmg
                        as statutory auditor for the annual ­­allianz se and consolidated financial statements as well as
                        for the review of the half-yearly financial report. kpmg audited the financial statements of
                       ­allianz se and the ­allianz group as well as the respective management reports. they issued an
                        auditor’s report without any reservations. the consolidated financial statements were pre-
                        pared on the basis of the international financial reporting standards (ifrs), as adopted in the
                        european union. kpmg performed a review of the half-yearly and quarterly financial reports.

                       all supervisory board members received the documentation relating to the annual financial
                       state­ments and the auditor’s reports from kpmg for the 2013 fiscal year on schedule. the provi-
                       sional financial statements and kpmg’s audit results were discussed in the audit committee




annual report 2013     allianz group                                                                                        15

     on 25 february 2014 and in the plenary session of the supervisory board on 26 february 2014.
     the final financial statements and kpmg’s audit reports were reviewed on 13 march 2014 by the
     audit committee and in the supervisory board plenary session. the auditors participated in
     these discussions and presented the main results from the audit. no material weaknesses in
     the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. there were no circumstances
     that might give cause for concern about the auditor’s independence.

     on the basis of our own reviews of the annual ­allianz se and consolidated financial statements,
     the management and group management reports and the recommendation for appropriation
     of earnings, we raised no objections and agreed with the results of the kpmg audit. we approved
     the ­allianz se and consolidated financial statements prepared by the board of management.
     the company’s financial statements are therefore adopted. we agree with the board of man-
     agement’s proposal on the appropriation of earnings.

     the supervisory board would like to thank all ­allianz group employees for their great personal
     commitment over the past year.

     members of the supervisory board and board of management
     dr. gerhard cromme resigned as a member of the supervisory board effective 14 august 2012.
     christine bosse was initially appointed to the supervisory board by court order as his successor.
     on 7 may 2013, the agm elected ms bosse to the supervisory board. the current term of the
     supervisory board will expire following the 2017 agm.

     on 1 january 2013, board of management members mr. oliver bäte and dr. dieter wemmer
     exchanged their responsibilities. mr. bäte took over responsibility for insurance western ­&
     southern europe. dr. wemmer took over responsibility for finance, controlling, risk.

through its support for and acceptance of these standards. the cen-
tral compliance department is responsible, in close cooperation with
local compliance departments, for ensuring the effective implemen-
tation and monitoring of the compliance program within the ­allianz
group as well as for the investigation of potential compliance
infringements.
      the standards of conduct established by the a     ­ llianz group’s
code of conduct for business ethics and compliance are obligatory
for all employees worldwide. the code of conduct is available on our
website at   www.­allianz.com/corporate-governance.
      the code of conduct and the internal guidelines derived from it
provide all employees with clear guidance on behavior that lives up
to the values of the a­ llianz group. in order to transmit the principles
of the code of conduct and the internal compliance program based
on these principles, ­allianz has implemented interactive training
programs around the world. these provide practical guidelines
which enable employees to come to their own decisions. the code of
conduct also forms the basis for guidelines and controls to ensure
fair dealings with ­allianz group customers (sales compliance).
      there are legal provisions against corruption and bribery in
almost all countries in which ­allianz has a presence. the global anti-
corruption program of the ­allianz group ensures the continuous
monitoring and improvement of the internal anti-corruption con-
trols. (for further information on the anti-corruption program,
please refer to progress in sustainable development starting on  
    page 59.)
      a major component of the ­allianz group’s compliance program
is a whistleblower system that allows employees to alert the relevant
compliance department confidentially about irregularities. employ-
ees who voice concerns about irregularities in good faith should not
fear retribution in any form, even if the concerns turn out to be
unfounded at a later date.

pensions and similar benefits
to provide competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability
benefits, since 1 january 2005 board of management members par­
ticipate in a contribution-based system. prior to this date, board
members participated in a defined benefit plan that provided fixed
benefits not linked to base salary increases. benefits generated under
this plan were frozen at the end of 2004. additionally, most board
members participate in the ­allianz versorgungskasse vvag (avk), a
contribution-based pension plan and the a  ­ llianz pensionsverein e.v.
(apv), which provide pension benefits for salaries up to the german
social security ceiling.
     company contributions to the current pension plan depend on
the years of service on the board of management. they are invested
in a fund with a guaranteed minimum interest rate per year. on
retirement, the accumulated capital is converted into a lifetime
annuity. each year the supervisory board decides whether, and to
what extent, a budget is provided, also considering the targeted pen­
sion level. this budget includes a risk premium paid to cover death
and disability. the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 60, except
for cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons. in
these cases it may become payable earlier on; an increase by projec­
tion may apply. in the case of death, a pension may be paid to depen­
dents. surviving dependents normally receive 60 % (surviving partner)

asset management market
for the asset management industry as a whole, 2013 was a favorable
year, although it was a further year of uncertainty in capital markets
with volatility remaining at elevated levels. the announcement of the
federal reserve in may that it would start to take a reduction of its
asset purchases into consideration led to an increase in interest rates.
the yield on 10-year u.s. government bonds increased from 1.6 % at
the end of may 2013 to around 3 % at the end of the year. as a result of
the interest rate increase, valuations for fixed income assets declined,
while equities recorded a strong performance. on a global basis,
equities rose by 29 % last year.
     market flows into equity and fixed income strategies were par-
ticularly strong in the first half of 2013. during the second half of the
year, flows into traditional fixed income strategies were to a certain
extent impacted by the rise in interest rates. flows into both shorter-
term and floating-rate strategies continued to be strong, while cer-
tain investors found the higher yields presented new opportunities
in longer-term strategies. flows into equity assets, however, mostly
continued throughout the year, reaching levels not observed in the
recent past.
     allianz’s asset management operations recorded strong inflows
in areas such as non-traditional fixed income and multi-asset. the
overall flow development, however, was impacted by the general
market trend of outflows in the traditional bond space.
     throughout 2013 both pimco and ­allianzgi reflected market
developments in their portfolio allocations and continued to deliver
outstanding client service. from a strategic perspective, pimco as
well as ­allianzgi went ahead with the implementation of their longer-
term development plans. in 2013, ­allianzgi engaged in further com-
plexity reduction by combining entities, while at the same time fur-
ther expanding its product offerings, e.g. in the infrastructure debt
space. pimco continues to focus on delivering returns and managing
risk on behalf of clients across a growing range of investment solu-
tions, and took additional steps with regard to their longer-term
development plan to broaden its product offerings into such areas as
the alternatives platform, income solutions, equities and etfs.

strategy and steering
our longer-term strategic ambition is to be the world’s strongest financial com-
munity: the leading property-casualty insurer in terms of revenue and profitability,
one of the three most profitable life and health insurers among our global peer
group and the number one active wealth manager by assets and operating margin.
in 2013, we stayed on target to meet this goal, achieving one of the best operating
results in our history. we remain the global number one in property-casualty
insurance, are among the top five global life and health insurers and defended
our position as the world’s most profitable and second largest active asset manager.

in an uncertain and volatile business environment, we will protect the pillars of
our business strategy – our integrity, financial strength, operational excellence
and talent base – and leverage our size to offer outstanding products and s­ ervices
to our customers and business partners.

our integrity calls upon us to make only promises we can keep and
take only risks we can manage. good corporate governance and
transparency are key to gaining and keeping the trust of our stake-
holders.

compliance management
in 2013, we continued with measures to further strengthen the effec-
tiveness of compliance management by enhancing quality assur-
ance, global reporting on compliance risks and independent reviews
of key elements of our compliance program. a     ­ llianz applies its gen-
eral operational risk management approach to assess corruption
and fraud risks. additional assessments and on-site reviews are com-
bined with the new compliance quality assurance program. rolled
out in 2012, the program consists of self-assessments, on-site reviews
and monitoring via reporting. it verifies the implementation and
effectiveness of ­allianz’s compliance management system, which
includes the anti-corruption program, across the group.
      the implementation and maintenance of the ­allianz anti-­
corruption program, which is compulsory for all employees, contin-
ued in 2013. it aims to inform employees about a      ­ llianz’s main anti-
corruption and anti-fraud rules, the essentials of our anti-corruption
and gifts and entertainment policies, and our anti-fraud principles.
training about anti-discrimination and anti-harassment procedures
is also offered, in alignment with local legal requirements.

trust and transparency
one of the aftereffects of the banking and european sovereign debt
crisis is that the insurance industry has been confronted with an
increasing degree of regulation. all-time low interest rates and mar-
ket insecurity and volatility remain critical factors for our business
and particularly for our customers. our main goal when interacting
with governments is to contribute solutions to socio-political issues
and create a stable political and economic landscape that will ben-
efit our customers and us over the long term. for example, we are
engaging in discussions on the impact of low interest rates on savings
and old-age provisions and facilitating investments in a low-carbon
economy.
      headquartered in germany, ­allianz se is committed to the coun-
try’s long lasting democracy. thus, we contribute to democratic
political parties in the german parliament (bundestag) representing
a variety of views within the political spectrum and supporting the
social market economy. our policy governing corporate donations to
political parties in germany rules that all contributions are made
annually on 1 july to ensure that they are in no manner connected, or
perceived to be connected, to any legislative initiative or elections. in
2013, we contributed a total of € 150,000.

premiums grew around 4.5 % in 2013 (adjusted for foreign currency
translation effects).
     underwriting profitability improved slightly in 2013, reflecting
the general positive pricing momentum and the low level of natural
catastrophes. but overall profitability was restrained by the challeng-
ing investment environment. despite small increases in the wake of
the assumed change in u.s. monetary policy (“tapering”), interest
rates remained at low levels and investment returns were therefore
subdued.

in the life sector, global premium income growth recovered slightly
in 2013. this improvement was mainly led by emerging markets,
which benefited from relatively strong increases in china and south-
east asia. latin america continued to post double-digit growth as
well. the performance of advanced markets was more mixed, with
some – notably the u.s. market – under pressure and others recover-
ing rather strongly, for example germany, france and italy. in total,
according to our own market estimates and based on preliminary
figures, global premiums grew by around 3 % in 2013 (adjusted for
foreign currency translation effects).
      the persistent low-yield environment coupled with modest eco-
nomic growth depressed new business profitability for traditional
life business. insurance savings products continued to suffer from
weak demand against a backdrop of reduced guarantees. however,
risk protection products fared better. these included not only tradi-
tional mortality, but also health insurance products such as disability
and long-term care insurance – which benefited from rising con-
sumer awareness of a “protection gap” in these fields.

for the asset management industry as a whole, 2013 was a favorable
year, although it was a further year of uncertainty in capital markets
with volatility remaining at elevated levels. the announcement of the
federal reserve in may that it would start to take a reduction of its
asset purchases into consideration, led to an increase in interest
rates. the yield on 10-year u.s. government bonds increased from
1.6 % at the end of may 2013 to around 3 % at the end of the year. as a
result of the interest rate increase, valuations for fixed income assets
declined, while equities recorded a strong performance. on a global
basis, equities rose by 29 % last year.

      and 2012, respectively.




net cash flow provided by operating activities amounted to € 23.2 bn,
up by € 4.4 bn compared to the previous year. net cash flow provided
by operating activities is comprised of net income plus adjustments
for non-cash charges, credits and other items included in net earn-
ings and cash flows related to the net change in operating assets and
liabilities. net income after adding back non-cash charges and similar
items increased by € 0.2 bn to € 8.8 bn in 2013. additionally, operating
cash flows from net changes in operating assets and liabilities,
including other items, grew by € 4.1 bn to € 14.4 bn. this was driven by
higher reserves for insurance and investment contracts in our life/
health business, mainly in germany and the united states. we also
recorded net cash inflows from financial assets and liabilities held
for trading as well as higher positive net changes from our operating
receivables/payables. lower reserves for losses and loss adjustment
expenses in particular in our property-casualty business in the united
states – as a result of the changed structure in our crop business –
partially offset these effects.
      net cash outflow used in investing activities increased by € 7.9 bn
to € 22.8 bn in 2013. this rise was mainly attributable to higher net
cash outflows for available-for-sale investments at our banking busi-
ness in italy and our life/health operation in the united states.

through channels to new markets at lower cost: digitalization is one
of our major ongoing group initiatives and affects all areas of a­ llianz,
including our customers and our employees. this initiative spans
everything from the design of new modular products, to new forms
of access, to servicing existing customers in a better way. for example
we are developing web-based and multi-access customer interaction
tools to address changing customer behaviors. on the operational
side, we are harmonizing systems across the group to reduce com-
plexity and improve efficiency. we are making considerable progress
in this group-wide digital transformation program and will invest
approximately € 300 mn in 2014 to build reusable assets in the three
areas of the ­allianz digital target picture: customer interaction, ana-
lytics & products and productivity. these initiatives are based on
multi-year strategic infrastructure programs. ­allianz will invest
approximately € 200 mn in 2014 focused primarily on the consolidation
of data center operations worldwide and on the implementation of a
private global network. digitalization is also the basis for enhanced
management information systems to improve steering. when driv-

priority.

governance
responsibility for ensuring the completeness, accuracy and reliability
of our consolidated financial statements rests with the chairman of
the board of management and the board member responsible for
finance, controlling and risk of ­allianz se, supported by group center
functions, the group disclosure committee and operating entities.
     the group disclosure committee ensures that these board
members are made aware of all material information that could
affect our disclosures and assesses the completeness and accuracy
of the information provided in the quarterly and annual financial
reports. the committee meets on a quarterly basis before the financial
reports are issued.
      subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individu-
ally responsible for adhering to the group’s internal control policy
and for creating local disclosure committees that are similar to the
group-level committee. the entities’ ceos and cfos provide periodic
sign-offs to the management of a  ­ llianz se, certifying the effectiveness
of their local system of internal controls as well as the completeness,
accuracy and reliability of financial data reported to the holding.

further control mechanisms
in our opinion, a strong internal control environment is key to man-
age our company successfully and to reinforce trust with our stake-
holders. in addition to icofr, for example, we have implemented an
enhanced internal control environment across our largest life insur-
ance operating entities for the market consistent embedded value
(mcev) reporting process.

actual maturities may deviate from the contractually defined matur-
ities because certain security issuers have the right to call or repay
certain obligations ahead of schedule, with or without redemption or
early repayment penalties. investments that are not due at a single
maturity date are, in general, not allocated over various maturity
buckets, but are shown within their final contractual maturity dates.

 ria, which include the degree of creditworthiness, capital levels and
 marketplace reputation of its reinsurers, are such that the ­allianz
 group believes that its reinsurance credit risk is not significant, and
 historically has not experienced noteworthy difficulty in collecting
 claims from its reinsurers. additionally, and as appropriate, the
­allianz group may also require letters of credit, deposits, or other
 financial guarantees to further minimize its exposure to credit risk.
 in certain cases, however, the a   ­ llianz group does establish an allow-
 ance for doubtful amounts related to reinsurance as appropriate,
 although this amount was not significant as of 31 december 2013 and
2012. the ­allianz group primarily maintains business relations with
 highly rated reinsurers.

1   t he presented subtotal for expenses and total income and expenses from fully consolidated private
     equity investments for the year ended 31 december 2013 differs from the amounts presented in the
     “consolidated income statements” and in “total revenues and reconciliation of operating profit (loss)
     to net income (loss)”. this difference is due to a consolidation effect of € 2 mn (2012: € (33) mn) for the
     year ended 31 december 2013. this consolidation effect results from the deferred policyholder participa-
     tion, recognized on the result from fully consolidated private equity investments within operating profit
     in the life/health segment, that was reclassified into expenses from fully consolidated private equity
     investments in non-operating profit to ensure a consistent presentation of the ­allianz group‘s operating
     profit.

1   t he german securities trading act (“wertpapierhandelsgesetz”) obliges issuers to announce immediately any information which may have a substantial price impact.
     therefore we cannot exclude that we have to announce key figures related to quarterly and fiscal year results ahead of the dates mentioned above. as we can never
     rule out changes of dates, we recommend checking them on the internet at www.allianz.com/financialcalendar.
