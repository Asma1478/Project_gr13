dear stakeholder,

we are living in exciting times, with india continuing on its path of being
amongst the top economic powerhouses of the world. but this growth also
brings the country its own challenges, with growing consumption demand
outstripping the availability of natural resources. demand for energy has
gone up at a galloping rate with over 300 million indian citizens still having
no access to electricity. unfortunately india has low reserves of fossil fuels
of oil and gas. however india has the fifth largest coal reserve in the world
and ‘electricity for all’ at affordable costs is possible only through the use of
coal.

it is possible to minimise the impact of coal mining on environment and society. by adoption of best practices to
improve coal quality, productivity, and safety and by use of environment-friendly technologies including coal
gasification, beneficiation - we can fulfil our responsibility to both people and the planet.


present outlook
as the highest profit-making coal company of coal india limited for the reporting period of 2011-12, mahanadi
coalfields ltd has also once again entered the 100 million club for the third time in a row. production of raw coal
during 2011-12 was 103.12 million tonne (mte) as against 100.28 mte produced in 2010-11 with a growth of 2.83%.

we also are amongst the first coal companies to have best practices in business processes – using latest
technological methods and process to achieve sustainable mining. coal washeries are being put to provide value
added products to different consumers. efforts are on to overcome the entire process of transportation and
handling of coal with minimum human intervention to ensure safety.

we are striving hard to achieve the target of ‘zero accident’ by continual efforts to have state of the art equipments
as required, impart training, create more safety awareness, invest in safety related r&d and periodic monitor on
safety compliances.

this success story is not just entirely an economic one, we have endeavoured to work towards achieving an
inclusive growth and not just financial. this report will walk you through some of our key achievements for the
reporting period of 2011-12.


responsibility at mahanadi coalfields
at mahanadi coalfields, we are aware about the immense responsibility we have to our resources, our employees,
community and to the nation. realising the need to have a systematic and efficient resource management system,
we have embarked on a journey of sustainable development that goes beyond business. as the first step towards
this journey, we have committed to adopt the department of public enterprises (dpe) guidelines on sustainable
development for central public enterprises (cpse). as per the guidelines, we have constituted a sub-committee on
corporate governance, strategic management, sustainable development and risk management at the board
level.

by publishing our first sustainability report as per the globally recognised standard – global reporting initiative (gri
ver g3.1), we are committing to map our continual progress and performance in the sustainability journey. i'm
happy to see that mcl continues to win accolades for its performance including prestigious awards in
2011-12 like 'best mother plant award at msme international marketing expo' and the 'e-world 2011 award'.




                                                                                                                    6

sustainability report 2011-12                                                                mahanadi coalfields limited



responsibility to achieve economic growth
mcl recorded pre-tax profit of rs. 5463.69 crore in 2011-12 against a pre-tax profit of rs. 4039.30 crore last year
and total dividend paid to govt. of india was rs. 2226.55 crore registering thereby, a growth of 30.48% in net sales,
35.26% in pbt, 42.16 % in pat and 41.81% in dividend over last year. the interim dividend of rs. 1006.56 crore has
been paid on equity share capital. further, rs. 1219.99 crore has been proposed as final dividend on paid up equity
share capital thereby registering a hike in dividend payout of 1194.50% of equity capital as compared to 842.28% of
equity capital in the previous year. we continued to achieve a high production rate with production of raw coal
during 2011-12 being 103.12 million tonne (mte) as against 100.28 mte produced in 2010-11 with a growth of
2.83%.

we continue to pioneer value based initiatives in business processes such as deployment of surface miner,
e-tendering, e-procurement, e-despatch and pap based cooperatives.


responsibility in governance
the company has made headway in implementing department of public enterprises (dpe) guidelines on
corporate governance and it gives me pleasure to share with you that the company has secured "excellent" rating
under the existing reporting system related to compliance of the guidelines.
the governance mechanism has undergone a number of changes during last year with the following being most
remarkable.
  formation of four board sub-committees other than the existing audit committee with special focus on
  matters such as technical, hrm, corporate governance, strategic management, sustainable development,
  risk management and employement of land oustees etc.
  inducting independent directors on the boards of subsidiary companies of mcl
  creating organisational structure for risk management and sustainable development.
  monitoring of tender by independent monitors and integrity pact with contractors/suppliers


responsibility to the environment

mining sustainably is the responsibility that mcl has towards the environment and society and more so being a
public sector undertaking. we continue to undertake several steps to remain a green champion in the region.
taking the first step towards an integrated management system, mcl was awarded the certification of iso 9001
and 14001:2004 on 24th march, 2012 by the governing board of certification international (uk) limited, for 22
mines and the headquarters. for the reporting period, we have also initiated several sustainable initiatives under
the dpe guidelines on sustainable development – rain water harvesting, energy conservation, solar power
generation and intensive afforestation, etc.


responsibility towards safety
for mcl, safety of our employees is of paramount importance. and, we aim to achieve ‘zero accident’ to create a
safe and secure work environment for our people. unfortunately despite our best efforts, 5 fatalities occurred at
mcl during the reporting period of 2011-12. this tragedy has made us more determined to invest in the best
technology and safety equipments for the safety of our workforce. some of the mitigation initiatives we are
implementing are:
   deployment of statutory personnel full time, wholly for accident prevention work
   risk assessment and risk management has been done in all mines covering hazards and mechanism of each
   hazard, control, action and responsibility and its implementation is updated regularly.
   recommendations of 10th safety conference, standing committee on safety and cil safety board are being
   implemented.
   we are already using and investing in latest tools and equipments like universal drilling machine, hydraulic
   roof bolting machine, man riding system in underground mines, surface miner in all open cast mines
the above list demonstrates our commitment to ever increasing our value generating capacity to meet the
expectations of our stakeholders and our nation in a sustainable way.

responsibility to the community
being geographically expandable, it is imperative that some indigenous communities get affected by our
company’s operations. but mcl believes that long standing trustworthy relationship with the communities in
which it operates is mutually fulfilling and towards that end we work relentlessly with number of social initiatives.
through a structured csr policy and a range of activities such as potable water supply through tankers during
summer to all the peripheral villages, construction of public utility roads and community centers, village health and
family welfare programmes, check dams, mobile medical check ups etc. not only enhance our social alignment but
also symbolise true discharge of social responsibilities.


responsibility to the future
we are committed to continue our journey towards sustainable development – ensure a better, safer and more
responsible mahanadi coalfields. with the demand for power rising, we have already embarked on diversifying into
“power generation” through pit head super critical power plant at basundhara coalfields. to create an initial
capacity of 2x800 mw, a fully owned spv has been formed in december 2011 and incorporated under the
companies act, 1956. this diversification promises some strong business sense under current business scenario.
mcl has already applied for transmission license for the budhipadar-basundhara transmission line. further,
initiatives have also been taken to foray into solar power generation.

we are also focussed on reducing dust emissions and investing in technology for making mining sustainable and
safer. we have plans to introduce ripper dozer to remove ob and to construct four numbers of washeries of 10.00
mty. capacity each, two in talcher coalfields, one in ib valley coalfields and one in basundhara area of ib valley
coalfields. techno-economic-feasibility reports for all these washeries have been approved by the mcl board. we
are also going to introduce silo with rapid loading system at all the major opencast projects of mcl.

with this being our first sustainability report adhering to gri ver g3.1 for application level c and externally assured,
we look forward to improving our reporting, enhancing our disclosure parameters, and introducing innovative
initiatives. we also plan to include the principles of the national voluntary guidelines on social, environmental and
economic responsibilities of business along with reporting as per gri g3.1 guidelines.

we look forward to your feedback on this report. i look forward to your encouragement in making our sustainable
journey a success with your suggestions for further improvement.

the coalfields of ib valley and talcher, the former being a part of western coalfields limited (wcl) and the other a
part of the central coalfields limited (ccl), were carved out from their respective companies and brought into the
fold of south eastern coalfields limited (secl) in 1986. eventually, with the passage of time and due to expansion in
the capacities, being the only coalfields in odisha, the coalfields were taken out from secl and restructured into a
separate entity, called the mahanadi coalfields limited (mcl) with headquarters at sambalpur (odisha). thus, on
april 3, 1992, a new company of coal india having manpower of 21,742 was born with initial coal production of 23
million tonnes.

mcl is the 2nd largest coal producing and in the reporting period of 2011-12 was the highest profit making coal
company in coal india limited (cil). in just 20 years of being, mahanadi coalfields limited, popularly known as 'm c
l' has achieved many milestones in coal mining sector by introducing mechanisation and new technologies and has
become the second highest coal producing subsidiary of coal india. conferred with 'mini-ratna' status by
government of india on 15th march, 2007, mcl is a proud member of 100 million tonnes coal producing companies
since 2009. it registered coal production of over 103 million tonnes in 2011-12.

as a central public service enterprise, mcl is accountable to the people of india. mcl takes this responsibility
seriously and strives hard to engage with its various stakeholders and address their critical concerns. this is
important as stakeholders have a direct impact on the way our company operates (customers, employees) or
because our operations may have a direct or indirect impact on them (community and employees). our key
stakeholders are described below. for each of these stakeholders, we have tried to zero-in on the main issues which
concern them. these issues are further managed by putting appropriate engagement mechanisms in place.

materiality

sustainability report 2011-12                                                                 mahanadi coalfields limited



we are in the process of refining and creating a robust stakeholder engagement framework and subsequent
methodology for material issue identification. for this report, we adopted an approach that considers:
  existing organisational processes: includes internal stakeholder grievance processes like customer
  satisfactions, etc)
  key senior management perspective: issues and concerns from the perspective of key senior management
  across various departments
  peer review of material issues: challenges and issues faced by peer companies including global coal
  companies, related industry-sectors like metals & mining, and other cpses.

all the issues analysed from the above approach were then prioritised by mapping each issue individually against
their significance from stakeholder perspective and significance from the organisation perspective.

vigilance and transparency

as a central public service enterprise under the ministry of coals (moc), government of india, mcl adheres to a
high ethical and vigilant work environment. for the year 2011-12, an agreed list and list of officers of doubtful
integrity were prepared and sent to moc and coal india ltd (cil). officers who appeared in the above lists have
been transferred from sensitive posts and a close watch is being maintained on those officers by the vigilance
department in coordination with the central bureau of investigation, bhubaneswar.

matters related to vigilance and right to information act (rti)
 during the year 3 cases for 1st stage advice were referred to cvc, which are pending at cvc
  23 parliament questions were attended and requisite information furnished mostly on the same day of its
 receipt.
 19 rti queries have been attended and information furnished within the desired timeline.
 monthly/quarterly reports to cvc, moc and cil have been submitted within the prescribed timeline.
  during the year, vigilance clearance status in respect of 9164 employees (directors, executives and non-

  etc.

training of board members
the functional directors, by virtue of their possessing the requisite expertise and experience in their respective
functional areas, are aware of the business model of the company as well as the risk profile of the company’s
business. the part-time directors are fully aware of the company’s business model. but having aimed at better
familiarity with corporate governance practices, the independent directors have been nominated for undergoing
training programmes organised by top institutions. a suitable training policy for directors in line with dpe
guidelines on corporate governance is also in the offing.

vigilance awareness period

as per the directives of the central vigilance commission, mcl observed vigilance awareness period from 31st
october, 2011 to 5th november, 2011 in all its areas and establishments. during the period, interactive sessions
were held with the suppliers/customers, in which initiatives were taken for improvement of the system and
procedures, besides the complaint handling policy of the company and the avenues available for redressal of
grievances, e-payment, e-procurement, e-auction were explained. the viewpoints expressed by the
customers/suppliers have also been taken note of for taking corrective measures wherever necessary and feasible.

as a part of the programme, a seminar on “participative vigilance in combating white-collared corruption” was held
at 11.00 am on 04.11.2011 in mcl auditorium, jagruti vihar. the seminar was attended by eminent persons
including retired high court judges, government officials, senior persons from the print media and cmd and
directors of mcl in addition to participants from headquarters and areas of mcl.

a vigilance bulletin covering some prominent sample of case studies done by the vigilance department, mcl and
circulars issued by cvc on tenders was released on the occasion of observance of vigilance awareness period.
copies of the bulletin have been widely circulated within the company.

achieving transparency
   taking note of low percentage of coal weighment w.r.t. to internal colliery transport, the matter was taken up with
   the chief executive immediately after assuming charge. as a result, a major decision was taken to install in-
   motion weighbridges at suitable vantage points. due to constant monitoring of the activity, financial bids for 12
   in-motion weigh bridges could be finalized within the period under report. procurement action of another 23
   numbers are in progress.
   “coalnet” linkage in the weighbridges activated for bringing transparency in the coal weighment process.
   awareness generation on various anti-corruption issues was done through workshops, essay competition,
   circular/pamphlet within the company as well as for the general public students.                       besides, sr.
   manager(pers./vig.) had been consistently imparting awareness on various vigilance and anti-corruption issues
   through classroom lectures.
   85 aprs scrutinized which is more than 20% prescribed by the cvc. whenever the discrepancies/lapses have
   been found, the same has been taken note of for further surveillance.
   seventeen surprise checks were made which has brought significant amount of fairness and transparency in the
   record maintenance and consumption pattern of diesel, coal quality and contractual coal transport. it is worthy
   to make a mention here that utilization of drill machine (udm) worth `3.78 crore lying idle for six months in
   different stores could be possible after intervention of the vigilance department.
   recognizing the hardship suffered by the vendors w.r.t. emd refund, a meaningful contribution was made in
   operationalsing the rtgs account upto the area level for facilitating e-refund of emds in future.
   another outstanding contribution was according timely vigilance status to 9164 employees that too within 2-3
   working days of receipt despite having the smallest organisational set up among all vigilance department of cil
   and its subsidiaries.

coal production in 2011-12 is 103.12 m.te and growth over 2010-11 is (+)2.83% . the achievement against the aap
target is 97.28%, the reasons for less production against the target being frequent stoppage by villagers,
particularly, in talcher coalfields on r&r issue; environment clearance problems in ib valley coalfields and
forestry clearance problem both in talcher as well as ib valley coalfields.

growth through diversification
growing market demand for power in sync with the company's existing potentials have prompted the company to
diversify into “power generation” through pit head super critical power plant at basundhara coalfields. to create an
initial capacity of 2x800 mw, a fully owned spv has been formed in december 2011 and incorporated under the
companies act, 1956. this diversification promises some strong business sense under current business scenario.
mcl has already applied for transmission license for the budhipadar-basundhara transmission line which has
already been charged. further, initiatives has also been taken to foray into solar power generation.

opportunities and threats
(a) production performance of mcl for the financial year 2011-12 as compared to the target and achievement of the
previous year is given below:

opportunities:
  huge demand of coal in the country especially for power generation.
  huge potentiality of coal mining in mcl
  power plants located in the northern india are also linked to mcl.
  to formulate a sound marketing strategy and long term agreement with consumers, railways and shippers.
  to set up washeries
  diversification to power
  jv for coal gasification and coal to liquid (oil).

threats:
  coal amenable to opencast mining - requirement of more land.
  land acquisition and consequent social displacement.
  rehabilitation and resettlement issues.
  proneness of opencast mining to environmental pollution.
  inadequacy of railway rakes for coal transportation.
  majority of consumers are far away from coalfields i.e. increase in rail freight means high landed cost to the
  consumers.
  moef stipulation for use of 34% ash content coal (mostly available in mcl) by power houses beyond 1000 kms.
  the coastal based tpps have option to use imported coal.
  captive mining – allotment of blocks to mcls consumers, some central psus and state psus, for power
  generation and coal mining by state govt. companies for sale of coal in the market.

sustainability report 2011-12                                                                  mahanadi coalfields limited



at present, there are 31 completed projects in mcl with rated capacity of 88.58 mte., out of which 2 projects with
rated capacity of 1.60 mte have been exhausted during xi plan period. there are 18 on-going projects under
implementation (as on march 2012) with rated capacity of 116.78 mte. production from these on-going projects
during 2011-12 is 35.141 mte.

basundhara area (known as gopalpur tract) of ib valley coalfields has enough potentiality, with the bottleneck
being the coal evacuation arrangement. the company has planned and approved a 52 km. long railway line from
basundhara area to jharsuguda railway station at a capital investment of rs. 469.68 crore. two mous have been
signed between mcl and south-eastern railway for land acquisition and construction of the railway line. land
acquisition work is in progress and construction work has been started. the project has been delayed due to
acquisition of forest land which is pending for want of noc under fra- 2006, and also construction of one major
bridge over ib river is under execution. an amount of rs. 146.53 crore has been paid to south-eastern railway out
of which rs. 112.79 crore has been utilised so far.

similarly, in talcher coalfields, construction of kalinga-angul link railway line is going on. once this segment is
completed, there will be unidirectional movement of empty rail rakes from angul side and the loaded rakes will be
evacuated through talcher side. this will increase the rake movement capacity of talcher coalfields by double.

to further increase the coal dispatch system, rapid loading system (silo) will be constructed in 10 projects
including two jv projects.

mcl is also planning to set up 04 numbers of washeries of its own, 10.0 mty capacity each, to cope up with the moef
stipulation to dispatch coal below 34% ash at distant power houses. out of these, two washeries will come up in
talcher coalfields, one in ib valley coalfields and one in basundhara sector of ib valley coalfields. the techno-
economic feasibility report of all these washeries on bom basis have been approved by mcl board.

mcl is going to construct coal corridor both at talcher and ib valley coalfields for dedicated coal transportation. for
construction of 4-lane 18 mts wide and 41.5 km long road at talcher coalfields, work order has been issued to m/s
ivrcl-amr jv at a cost of rs. 251.34 crore on 14.12.2011.
for construction of 4-lane coal corridor road from bankibahal ( coal mine) to bhedabahal (on sh-10) in the district
of sundergarh, the project has been approved by the mcl board on its 138th meeting held on 31.03.2012 for an
amount of rs. 385 crore.

regarding customer satisfaction, the required meetings are being held at area level with various consumers at the
time of joint sampling. complaints are very rare and those are sorted out at the colliery level / loading level and
there is no such problem with regard to consumer satisfaction. the customer feedback form is also placed on the
website of mcl so that all the consumers can download the feedback form and submit the same at the earliest.
topmost feedback given by consumers at these meetings was on quality and quantity of coal and delivery-dispatch
of coal to the customers.

the following steps were taken by the company to improve quality and consumer satisfaction.
    frequent interactions with different consumers have been done to improve consumer satisfaction. in view of
    this, a meeting of regional coal consumer council (rccc) was held with various major coal consumers on
    24.11.2011 at mcl hqs.
    consumers were encouraged for free checking and supervising personally the coal loading sidings as well as
    weigh bridges.
    all sidings from where huge quantity of coal is despatched to major consumers and core sector industries have
    been put directly under the nodal officers who were specifically responsible for maintaining and ensuring
    proper quality, weighment and sizing of coal.
    whenever any complaint whether it was major or minor in nature received in the department, the same had
    been enquired at the spot by officers of qc department and the findings had been informed to the consumer
    from where complaint was received.
    constant monitoring was being done by qc department with all the railway sidings at area level about despatch
    of coal to all consumers.
    surprise inspections and analysis of coal from different sidings are being done regularly by teams of officials of
    qc department to ensure proper quantity and quality of coal despatched.
    frequent inspections of weigh bridges and laboratories are being done regularly by qc department .
    in case of any discrepancy or fault found in laboratories, weigh bridges and sidings, the same was
    communicated to the concerned cgm/gm of the area for information and taking corrective measures.

supplier relationship
mcl is committed to provide self employment opportunities to the local budding entrepreneurs through the
process of ancillarisation and provide a sustainable business to them by apportioning a substantial share by
revenue in the areas of stores/consumable/repairing etc.

for the above cause mcl has full fledged ancillary development cell which is committed for
the following activities:
    undertakes, allows and encourages all endeavours to explore and develop the potentialities of the small scale
    industries(ssi) in its operational jurisdiction within the state of odisha.
    to improve the availability of spares, import substitution for meeting the growing demand of mcl, with the help
    of directorate of industries of the state and d.i.c.
    a broad outlook to create scope of increased self-employment and thus self-dependency amidst the young
    population of the locality of state.
    prosperity of general mass, in the state and elevation of this state in the industrial map of the nation and
    adjusting the industrial products of the s.s.i units of this state to reach the new dynamics of achieving the global
    competitive standard.

the ancillary development cell of mcl is committed to the overall development of small scale industries of the
state of odisha located within the operational jurisdiction of mcl, with a sole aim to provide increased scope of self
employment opportunities to the skilled and un-skilled unemployed youth of the locality and thus self-dependence
and prosperity of the general mass in the state. since inception, the company has helped and developed ssi units
of odisha. more than 150 such ssi units were awarded proven/provisional ancillary status for various consumable
spares/items and service related jobs directly linked to production processes involved in engineering and mining
section of mcl.

further, in its continued efforts in keeping alive these ancillary units, mcl has been giving sustainable business to
those ancillary units who are committed to quality supply of materials and maintaining prompt delivery schedules.
after reviewing the performance of the ancillary units, their cases are considered for renewal of ancillary status. as
on date, approximately 51 ssi units (ancillary units) have got extension of validity of ancillary status based on merit
and actively participating in the procurement process of mcl and supplying various quality ancillarised spares to
the user areas.

areas of ancillarisation:
    consumable stores, furniture, forest products, safety items, machinery spare parts, castings, services
    feeder breaker / chp spares, underground equipment spares, hemm spares, pipe fittings, civil items
    electrical items, fire fighting equipment, rolled steel items, printing jobs, cables, etc.


purchase / repair statistics of ancillary units (both proven and provisional) and ssi units
inside odisha for the last three years is as below;

                                       8.76 crore

                                                       7.13 crore
                                                                      6.46 crore




                                       2009 – 10       2010 – 11       2011 – 12
the low figure in the 2011-12 was mainly due to decrease in utilization of chps/feeder breakers in the light of usage
of surface miners in various mines. with continual increase in demand of coal in the country and up coming of new
projects, in turn will assure more volume of purchases from the ancillary units of mcl as well as from other ssi units
inside odisha.

                                                                                                                    40

as with any other mining, coal mining also creates a number of environmental challenges, including soil erosion,
dust, noise and water pollution, and impacts on local biodiversity. as a responsible company, mcl strives hard to be
a green champion and a leader in environment mitigation. we follow the environment policy adopted by our
holding company - coal india. mcl now has an integrated management system through the award of certification
of iso 9001 and 14001:2004 by the governing board of certification international (uk) limited, for 22 mines and its
headquarters.

all major parameters that constitute effective environmental management are under active consideration during
decision making process related to projects with stringent follow-up action.

the department of public enterprises (dpe), government of india has issued guidelines on sustainable
development for all central public sector enterprises (cpses). in line with the guidelines, mcl as part of the mou
with coal india will be focussing on the following sustainability initiatives:
  afforestation
  energy conservation
  acquifer recharge/recycling of sewage water
  rain water harvesting

in addition, mcl is committed to sensitize awareness on sustainable development amongst its employees through
training and workshops.

energy consumption
at mcl, we have undertaken several steps to increase in energy efficiency thereby helping energy conservation.
some of the initiatives include:
   periodical overhaul of engines and regular checking of filters, hoses and tyre pressure to reduce fuel and
   lubricant consumption
   periodical maintenance of batteries and regular checking of self starters
   encouraging use of cfls, using electronic chokes in tubelights and electronic regulators
   regular cleaning of filters of air conditioners and ensuring proper closing of air-conditioned space
   placement of 3.3 kv/550v tsus (transwitch units) near the load in underground mines have been placed so that
   sufficient voltage is made available to the loads/machineries for achieving better efficiency and rated output as
   well as prescribed life of the machineries.

monitoring and control
for air, water and noise pollution control measures, the samples are collected and tested round the year with
appropriate frequency at strategic places by the competent agencies. in case, it is found that any of the control
parameters exceeds the tolerance limits as fixed by the statutory body, the matter is referred to cmpdi for
suggestions and corrective measures. cmpdi may interact with outside agencies for this purpose, if required, and
then corrective measures are suggested to mcl for implementation.

air pollution control measures
we continuously monitor quality of air, water and noise in and around our operations, results of which are
submitted to the central pollution control board (cpcb), spcb and moef as the statute. for the period of 2011-12,
ambient air quality for our mines in terms of spm, rpm have been well within the prescribed limits. the prescribed
limits of the odisha pollution control board (opcb) is: spm - 430 μg/cum, rpm - 215 μg/cum, sox - 80 μg/cum, nox -
809 μg/cum. below is the air monitoring data for representing mines of talcher coalfields and ib valley coalfields
respectively.

the environmental monitoring results of all mines are available on the company’s website www.mcl.gov.in

in keeping with the company’s concern for environment it has kept up the long standing practices to check air
pollution with a good number of measures, some of which are highlighted here.
   using surface miner technology, a blast-less mining technology which eliminates the dust generating
   operations like drilling, blasting and crushing completely while sprinkling water at the same time. apart from
   that, selective mining of coal and stone layers is done separately with the machine to reduce the ash content by
   about 3% resulting in less ash generation in power plant and reduction of green house gas as well.
   one heavy-duty truck-mounted vaccum-operated mechanical road sweeper is in operation for sweeping and
   collection of coal spillage and dust over coal transportation roads at hingula oc expansion project.

water consumption
as with any mining operations, water management is essential to ensure - conservation of freshwater usage as well
as mitigating through water pollution measures. some of the measures, we have undertaken to control water
pollution are highlighted below:

   mine drainage water pumped out of the mine as well as the water flowing out from ob dumps is put into settling
   ponds before being discharged in order to settle the sediments and prevent silting of rivers and other water
   bodies.
   oil and grease traps (ogt) are used at the workshops of opencast mines to remove oil and grease as well as oily
   sludge from the waste water.
   garland drains and catch drains are also provided around quarry boundary and ob dumps in order to arrest
   sediments and prevent shifting of natural drainage.

water conservation initiatives
  disused quarry voids are used as water harvesting structure for recharge of ground water
  water treatment plants (wtp) are operational under integrated water supply schemes of talcher, ib valley,
  belpahar and basundhara. small scale water filtration units for domestic supply are existing at talcher and
  orient areas using underground mine water.

land reclamation and plantation
working towards our goal of ecological restoration, mcl planted 75,575 saplings (40,625 in talcher coalfields and
34,950 in ib valley coalfields) of mixed indigenous species over external dumps and backfilled internal dumps after
adequate physical reclamation, as well as in vacant patches of other land and avenues, in the mines during the year
2011-12. the plantation projects were executed through orissa forest development corporation (ofdc) and
chhattisgarh van vikas nigam limited, korba. this was done, as in previous year, for biological reclamation of the
mine-degraded land towards the goal of ecological restoration. the plantation included plant species like fruit
bearing, timber yielding and dust catching variety plants. the different plantation activities are - raising planting
stocks in a nursery in polypots, survey and demarcation, development of site by clearance of unwanted
miscellaneous growths, alignment and staking, pitting, planting including casualty replacement, application of
fertile earth to each pit @ 1 cft per pit, weeding, soil working (with saucer formation), application of fertilizers &
insecticide (npk, urea, chloropyriphos 20% ec, etc), watering, providing watch and ward for plant protection
measures etc.

land – resettlement & rehabilitation
mcl acquires land for expansion of mining activities by providing rehabilitation and resettlement to the affected
villagers. during the reporting period, mcl acquired 1891.166 hectares of land.

mcl is committed to help the project affected/displaced families for execution of its projects and has been making
efforts to improve the socio-economic status of project affected families (pafs) and also committed for progress
with development which amply reflected in its r&r policy. besides land compensation paid as per guidelines issued
by moc and land acquisition authorities, eligible nominees of adivasi/ tribal land oustees are being given
permanent employment, as per provisions of r&r policy of govt. of odisha 1989, 1998 and 2006. there is no
discrimination in the rehabilitation of adivasis/tribals in mcl. during the reporting period, the total resettlement &
rehabilitation expenditure was rs. 15.12 crore, and 335 pafs resettled.

mcl has provided 396 employments during 2011-2012 as compared to 920 employments during 2010-2011 and
total number of 10383 employments since inception. mcl has also opened a grievance cell i.e. single window
system in each of its coalfields to redress any grievances of the land oustees. rehabilitation colonies have been set
up with pucca roads, street lighting, health centres, post offices, daily markets, schools, community centres,
worshiping places, etc. for the benefit of the land oustees. mcl provides opd facility to all peripheral villagers in its
existing hospitals/dispensaries available in the coalfields with free of cost or at a nominal charge of rs. 2.00 per
patient.


biodiversity
plans have been made to undertake bio-diversity study of 3 projects (lingaraj, balaram, lakhanpur ocps) in 2013-
14. an earlier mine-wise biodiversity study was conducted by sambalpur university in 2008. the study did not find
any specific, typical and endangered plant species or endangered wild life species in the area of study. as a part of
the bio-diversity measures, 30% of the total plantation in the mining area is of edible fruit bearing trees that attract
squirrels, bats and rodents. fire protection and prevention measures are undertaken to prevent fires destroying
the flora and fauna particularly during summer.
as per the report there are no national park, sanctuary, biosphere reserve, tiger reserve, elephant reserve, any
other reserve, habitat for migratory birds & elephant corridor within 10 km of the mining area (mine core zone) both
in talcher coalfields and in ib valley coalfields. however an elephant corridor exists within 20 km of the
bhubaneswari ocp in talcher coalfields in angul district. the forest dept prepared a plan for habitat improvement
of the surrounding areas of bhubaneswari ocp and an amount of rs. 50 lakhs was deposited with the forest
department towards the same in 2004.
for all forthcoming new mines/expansion mines of mcl, a biodiversity study shall be done as per the terms of
reference (tor) approved by ministry of environment & forest (moef) and the report will be included in the eia-emp
document for submission to moef.

compliance
the deputy director, mines, sambalpur circle, sambalpur, odisha informed the company vide letter dt:02.11.2011
to project officer samleshwari ocp alleging illegal extraction of coal from 2008-09 to 2010-2011 and requested to
deposit cost price of coal amounting to rs. 862,57,93,370 as per section 21(5) of mines and minerals (development
& regulation) act, 1957.

the alleged violations arose due to procedural delays and the need for the project to continue mining to meet the
target in the interest of public. during this entire period, correspondence with deputy director, mines was
continuing.

as per the directive of moef, the matter relating to violation with respect to production in excess of environmental
clearance (ec) capacity in seven mines was put up to the board of directors (140th meet on june 2012) and a
resolution to not to repeat such violations was passed.
we are committed to the resolution passed by the board to conduct mining and associated operations in an
environmentally responsible manner to comply with the applicable laws and other requirements related to
environmental aspects.

training and development is one of the key hr functions and is an integral part of the human resource development
activity. managing people in today's multicultural, diversified and rapidly changing world is a challenge and hence
investing in training and development is not a luxury but an essential part for organisation's ongoing success. in line
with its long term objective of being a learning organisation, mcl has continuously invested and promoted training
& development of not only its own employees but also project affected families/project affected people. the
company imparts internal training as well as sponsors outside training to its employees in reputed institutions like
iims, tiss, ximb, xlri, imi and other institutions of national repute. the company has mandated training hours per
year for employees keeping in consideration the fact that technology is deskilling the employees at a very fast rate.
the company also proposed to build its own training institute – mahanadi institute of coal management at
bhubaneswar with world class infrastructure and reputed faculty members.

during the year 2011-2012, a total number of 648 employees in the category of executives were trained internally
and 934 executives were sent to outside training as against 313 and 633 respectively during the year 2010-11. the
company also sponsored four of its directors for 2 external training programs. keeping in view the skill gap, 36
numbers of employees are being given training in 02 governmental itis this year and efforts are on to get 100 more
employees trained in various iti trades required for mcl.

employee relations and benefits
the key to having cordial, mutually trustful and harmonious employee relations are regular engagement and
interactions by the management team with the employees. periodic and regular interactions take place amongst
the management and apex forums of workmen (joint consultative committee). specific industrial relations (ir)
meetings are conducted to ensure efficient productivity and improved production. one of the important focuses of
these meetings is to listen and address employee-related issues and emphasise the importance of safety.

except for the country-wide strike held on 10.10.2011 by 5 central trade unions demanding plr of rs. 25,000/- per
employee, the industrial relations remain peaceful because of the highly motivated cooperative employees unions.
there has been no lock-out or strikes in the company during the reporting period of 2011-12.

our full-time employees enjoy benefit plans such as provident fund, family pension fund and annuity fund. at
mcl, the ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men is 1:1. the minimum wages paid by the company
are at par with the industry and are higher than as prescribed in the government gazette. the company does not
employ nor encourage forced, bonded or child labour in any of its operations. mcl abides by the mines act, 1952,
which prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine. we follow proper checks and audits as
per the act, to ensure no child is employed in the mines, including medical examinations for age proof.
