in fiscal 2011, chubu electric power recorded the first operating loss
in its history on a non-consolidated basis, mainly due to swelling ther-
mal power fuel costs attributable to the shutdown of the hamaoka
station. to improve our financial standing despite tight conditions that
are expected to continue unless the station resumes operation, we will
continue working to maximize management efficiency, in the hope of
meeting the expectations of our shareholders and other stakeholders.


csr management in the chubu electric power group

in japan, growing public concern over energy issues after the great
east japan earthquake has prompted serious discussions on the
reform of energy supply systems, including the feasibility of full
liberalization of the electricity retail market and the possibility of
separate operation of electricity generation and transmission, and on
the national energy policy, which particularly focuses on the

    measures to further improve the safety
    of the hamaoka nuclear power station
    chubu electric power shut down the hamaoka nuclear power station in may 2011, in response to a request by the
    national government. our first priority in making this decision was to provide a sincere response to people’ s concerns
    about the safety of nuclear power generation and regain trust in the safety of nuclear energy from society at large,
    including local communities.
        under these circumstances, chubu electric power is facing serious management challenges with regard to the
    fulfillment of its csr: we should improve the safety of our power generation facilities, including the hamaoka nuclear
    power station, and increase public understanding of these facilities, while ensuring the stable supply of electricity and
    improving our financial situation.
        in this feature article, we will introduce the measures that chubu electric power has been implementing since the
    suspension of operations at the hamaoka nuclear power station.
    (based on the plan as of july 30, 2012. should a significant change be made to the plan, a revised version will be made available through press
    releases and on the web site.)

 1     -4 extension of time for completing tsunami
          countermeasures
chubu electric power had made progress toward its december 2012 target for completing certain tsunami countermeasures (at a cost of about 140 billion
yen) at the hamaoka nuclear power station as established in july 2011. however, with some measures for which revisions were announced in march 2012,
the amount of work increased significantly, leading to problems such as too much work scheduled at one time. subsequently on july 30, 2012, the
company announced that it had become necessary to extend the work period by about a year.
     “flooding prevention measures 1” (such as the breakwater) and the “increase reliability of waterproof doors in outer walls of buildings” part of
“flooding prevention measures 2” continue to progress according to the original schedule.
     chubu electric will examine the necessity of revising existing measures as well as implementing additional measures to ensure the safety of the
hamaoka nuclear power station against earthquakes and tsunamis based on the results of surveys conducted on the fukushima daiichi nuclear power
station accident and on the announcements made by the cabinet office’s “nankai trough massive earthquake model investigative commission.”

     measures to ensure business continuity
     in the event of a large disaster
     as a company that provides people living in the chubu region with the lifeline service of electricity, chubu electric power
     has been committed to improving its risk management system. specifically, we have been implementing measures against
     large earthquakes, such as the predicted triple interrelated earthquakes (tokai, tonankai and nankai earthquakes), focus-
     ing on improving the disaster resistance of our equipment, and creating a disaster management system to ensure early
     recovery from disaster damage.
         we will continue to implement necessary measures to improve both our equipment and business operations by incor-

     topics from disaster damage

   in may 2012, chubu electric carried out a drill for the recovery of power distribution facilities from disaster
   damage, the first drill of its kind held with the participation of all 10 electric power companies in japan.
       a total of 144 employees participated in the training, including 52 employees of nine other electric
   power companies. based on the assumption that the triple interrelated earthquakes would cause serious
   damage to the supply of electricity in chubu electric’ s service area, participants received training in the
   recovery of service wires and the delivery/receipt of inspection- and repair-related slips.

                                                                                                                               training on distribution facilities held with the

safer operation of hamaoka nuclear power station. meanwhile, each unit of
joetsu thermal power station (total capacity: 2,380 mw) will enter
commercial operation between july 2012 and may 2014. in order to
accelerate the use of renewable energy, we will continue to steadily develop
tokuyama hydro power station (total capacity: 153.4 mw), while continuing
group-wide efforts to develop mega solar power stations, wind power
stations and smaller-sized hydro power stations.
     in addition, we will work to start the operation of nishi-nagoya
thermal power station unit no. 7 (total capacity: approximately
2,316 mw) in fiscal 2017. this is in response to the decisions by other
electric companies to delay the construction of nuclear power stations,
from which we were planning to receive electricity, meaning that we now
have to secure other sources of supply. by bringing forward the launch of
nishi-nagoya thermal power station unit no. 7, we can also cut fuel
consumption and co2 emissions.

vision 2030—“what we aim for”
in february 2011, the chubu electric power group set out to consider the factors important for meeting the trust of its
customers and society, as well as the kinds of changes it should make to fulfill expectations for the group. this process was
prompted by a rapidly changing operating environment, as well as conditions at the time that continued to fuel deep
uncertainty with respect to future outcomes. the result was the formulation by the group of “what we aim for,” and four
missions toward the realization of this objective.



                                                                “what we aim for”

           keeps growing”

             services” that can be chosen by customers, by pursuing optimal energy use together with our customers.
           ● to ensure sustainable growth, we will create new corporate value by launching businesses overseas, making best use
             of managerial resources and know-how we have cultivated in our domestic electric power businesses.

building a next-generation electric
power network
chubu electric power will work on promoting distributed energy sources, a mode of power generation taking place at locations
near the sites of electricity consumption. chubu electric power aims to build an electric power network that is robust and can
withstand natural disasters and other risks by efficiently combining large-scale centralized power sources with distributed energy
sources to increase the reliability of the power grid as a whole, while at the same time making the best use of new technologies
such as the smart community and the smart meter to ensure harmonization with customer energy supply systems.

basis for calculation
investments and expenses related to preventing, reducing and/or avoiding environmental impact, removing the impact, putting right any damage, and other activities instrumental to these
are measured.
● investment amounts are expenditures allocated out of capital investment for environmental conservation.
● expenses associated with investments such as depreciation, equipment leasing, and maintenance and operating costs are calculated taking into account factors such as the depreciation
   period for each type of facility or equipment.

   to reflect customers’ opinions in improving its services, chubu electric power actively creates opportunities to listen to objective comments and
   advice from external parties to allow the company to share the same viewpoint as its customers. in april 2012, we had a meeting with the
   members of the central japan branch of the nippon association of consumer specialists (nacs) to exchange opinions on our activities in
   fiscal 2011. comments and requests received will be used to improve our future activities.

   ■ major opinions
   ● the size of the type used in notices received from chubu electric power is too small, and the writing style
     is too formal. the text should be simplified, and important points should be emphasized more by using
     larger type or enclosing sentences in a box so that they can be understood by everyone regardless of age.
   ● more warnings should be issued about “energy saving” frauds and unscrupulous sales practices. more
     information, including specific precautions that consumers need to take and examples of typical sales
     pitches should be provided by chubu electric power.
   ● the membership and login process for the electricity charges inquiry service should be simplified. in addi-
     tion, if graphs showing a year-on-year comparison of electricity usage (kwh) for each household are avail-
     able, they will lead to higher motivation for people to save electricity.                                                  a scene at the meeting
