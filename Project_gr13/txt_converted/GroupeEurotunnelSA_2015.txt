4 risk factors

     in conducting its business, the eurotunnel group is exposed to different risks of an industrial, environmental, human, commercial,
     financial or other nature.

     the eurotunnel group applies the provisions of the reference framework published by the french financial markets authority (amf) for
     internal control and risk management systems. eurotunnel group has an active risk management policy designed to protect and
     develop its assets and reputation and to safeguard the interests of shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, its other
     stakeholders and the environment. the group has a comprehensive system in place to identify and manage risks, which is described in
     chapter 16 of this registration document.

     for the 2014 financial year, the eurotunnel group has carried out the annual review of risks that could have a significant negative impact
     on its operations, reputation, financial position or results. this risk review encompassed all the consolidated subsidiaries of the group.
     concerning the myferrylink maritime business, the group’s risks are those inherent to the shipping operations and the commercial
     activity. for the record, the ferries are operated exclusively by a worker cooperative which is external to the group. the risk management
     mechanisms now apply across the entire scope of consolidation.




     4.1. risks related to the environment in which the
     eurotunnel group operates

     4.1.1 risks related to the economic and political climate

     the group’s operations are directly influenced by the prevailing economic conditions in its main markets, particularly france and the
     united kingdom. changes in cross-channel traffic and rail freight traffic are linked to the general economic context. while the group’s
     business has demonstrated its resilience during periods of economic and financial crisis and although the british economy did
     demonstrate growth in 2014, a deterioration or stagnation of economic conditions could have a direct impact on the volume of rail and
     maritime traffic in both the passenger and freight segments. uncertainties about the general economic situation have had and are likely
     to continue to have a negative impact on the business performance and financial position of many companies, and this could have
     repercussions for the group’s customers and suppliers.

     various events could change the economic environment in which the group operates and could, as a corollary, affect its business; in
     particular, a political decision taken by either one of the two nations to withdraw from the european union could also, if acted upon,
     impact on the economy and on trade between great britain and continental europe, and could thus have an effect on the group’s traffic
     volumes.

     all these risks are measured and monitored at meetings of the corporate management committees to anticipate and prepare for
     changes in the economic environment, and to make any necessary strategic and tactical adjustments.


     4.1.2 risks related to the competitive environment

     in its different activities, the group faces strong competition from both international and national players in the private and public sectors.
     this competitive environment (presented in chapter 6 of this registration document) could intensify across all of the group’s areas of
     activity, particularly during a slump in the truck market and increased price sensitivity among customers at a time of economic instability.

     with regard to the activities of the fixed link, the eurotunnel group faces competition from cross-channel transport operators, whose
     pricing strategies and other competitive initiatives could have a negative impact on shuttle service volumes (particularly truck shuttle
     services) and passenger numbers on high-speed passenger trains. as indicated in chapter 6 of this registration document, the
     group’s commercial and operational strategy could be affected by this context, in which service quality remains a crucial distinguishing
     factor. the group adapts its marketing strategy to this competitive environment, particularly during its operational reviews.

     concerning the competitive environment of europorte, developments in the market and in rail freight transport traffic and related
     activities are, due to recent changes, quite specific. as a result of a complex amalgamation of economic, logistical and industrial factors,
     among them, the reliability of the transport service, the quality and condition of train paths and the balanced prioritisation of freight and
     passenger transport, french rail freight traffic has undergone a significant downturn since 2000, with freight volume virtually halved,

                                                                                                                                                             4

reaching its all-time low in 2010, followed by a somewhat modest recovery in 2011(1). in 2014, competition between the operators
remained strong and the long-standing operator continues to enjoy a prominent position in the market: in the space of 10 years, the
french market has opened up as much as the german market has in 20 years of liberalisation. the situation is different in great britain
where rail freight is developing and where it is anticipated that it will take an even greater share of the british freight transport market.

myferrylink faces strong competition from other operators in the short straits market. the pricing strategies and other competitive
initiatives of those direct competitors are likely to have an even greater impact given that there is less differentiation between the services
offered (compared with the fixed link service).

in response to this intensification of the competition, the group rationalises its operations and processes in order to adapt its cost
structure, offer new services to its customers and enhance its commercial offering.

as part of the group’s treasury procedures described in section 16.9 of this registration document, its finance department continually
monitors movements in inflation and interest rates, and its treasury risk management committee receives monthly reports containing
forecast and actual rate changes.


interest rate
as explained in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document, the risk of adverse
movements in interest rates during the life of the term loan is covered by the fact that (i) two tranches of the loan are at a fixed rate, (ii) the
two inflation-linked tranches are at a fixed rate and (iii) the last two tranches are at a floating rate and are covered by a swap converting
the floating rate into a fixed rate for the full life of the term loan.

rate of inflation
as explained in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document, the inflation risk
affects both interest and principal repayments on the two inflation-linked tranches, of £750 million and c367 million respectively. by way
of illustration, a percentage point variation in the inflation rate would have an annual impact of c16 million on the amount of the principal
of tranches a1 and a2 and the associated financial charges.


foreign exchange risks
around half of the eurotunnel group’s revenue is generated in sterling, while a larger proportion of expenditure (operating expense and
investment) is in euros. moreover, the group’s term loan is denominated in sterling for a notional amount of £1.467 billion, at
31 december 2014, and in euros for a total notional amount of c1.926 billion, at 31 december 2014. the eurotunnel group makes every
effort to match more closely the currencies in which its revenues and expenses are denominated, and also uses currency hedging to
manage its foreign exchange risk effectively. however, there is no guarantee that these measures will significantly reduce the risk borne
by the eurotunnel group in the event of a fall in sterling against the euro, or ensure that the materialisation of this risk would not have a
significant impact on the eurotunnel group’s financial position and/or ability to service its debt.

4 risk factors

     the eurotunnel group prepares its consolidated financial statements in euros. at 31 december 2014, its balance sheet exposure to
     trading currencies was as follows:

                                                                               foreign

     the assets and liabilities in the above table do not include fixed assets or equity, which are carried at historical exchange rates.

     fluctuations in the sterling/euro exchange rate have an impact on the value in euros of revenue, costs, expenses and financial income,
     as well as on the group’s assets and liabilities. the following table summarises the exchange rate sensitivity of the group’s profits and
     equity at 31 december 2014 in relation to sterling exchange rate fluctuations:

     in addition to the measures described above, the group’s finance department continually monitors movements in the sterling/euro
     exchange rate, while its treasury risk management committee receives monthly reports containing forecast and actual exchange rate
     fluctuations. a report on the work of the treasury risk management committee is submitted to get se’s audit committee.

     the group’s various business activities result in receivables and debt distributed among the different group companies, sometimes in
     different currencies, particularly for get se and its subsidiaries. the group arranges funding for its various business activities, but these
     intra-group financing arrangements may generate currency imbalances which, as a result of exchange rate risk and depending on the
     direction of the funding flows, may automatically translate into losses in the consolidated financial statements.


     credit and counterparty risks
     customer credit risk
     the group’s exposure to customer credit risk is limited to its customers in the united kingdom and eurozone countries, with the
     exception of:
     • the railways, public institutions which accounted for 25% of the group’s revenue in 2014;
     • the group’s passenger shuttle and myferrylink customers who pay for their tickets in advance, particularly via the internet;
        consequently the credit risk in relation to these customers is very limited.

     the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, as well as the ageing of those trade receivables and the provision for
     bad debts, is explained in detail in note p of the appendix to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this
     registration document.

     credit risk is limited in view of the distribution of the portfolio and customer volumes. in fact, revenue from the group’s five largest
     customers, not including the railways, only accounted for 6% of its total revenue in 2014.

     the group manages its customer credit risk through a policy requiring that every new customer undergo a credit check before being
     able to benefit from the group’s standard credit terms. the group’s credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means of
     continuous monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in relation to the credit limits and payment terms granted
     to them.


     suppliers
     the group’s exposure to counterparty risk with its suppliers is managed by framework agreements that contain standard mechanisms
     based on third-party guarantees or prepayments and appropriate recovery procedures.


     short-term investments
     the group’s maximum exposure to credit risk on short-term investments is set out in note w to the consolidated financial statements in
     paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.




8   2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

                                                                                                                   risk factors                  
                                                                                                                                                 4

the group limits its exposure to credit risk by investing only in (i) term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum maturity of six
months, and with counterparties with at least a p-1 short-term rating from moody’s, and (ii) funds and money market funds with a
long-term rating of at least aaa from moody’s or aaa from s&p.

the amounts invested by the group in any one fund or money market fund should not exceed c120 million per fund or money market
fund in euros or £100 million per fund or money market fund in sterling. investments in term deposits or certificates of deposit with the
same counterparty may not exceed c78 million or £65 million.

the treasury risk management committee monitors the group’s compliance with this investment policy.


liquidity risk
a significant proportion of the eurotunnel group’s operational cash flow is taken up by interest payments on the term loan and, since
2013, ongoing repayment of the principal, in instalments, until 2050. this expense could reduce the group’s capacity to finance its
investments or possible external growth operations.

a breakdown of the group’s financial liabilities by contractual maturity is given in note w of the appendix to the consolidated financial
statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.

the terms and conditions of the group’s bank loans, particularly concerning defaults and early repayment, as well as the financial
covenants that the group must comply with in respect of debt servicing, are described in chapter 22 of this registration document and
note u of the appendix to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.

the contractual terms of the group’s hedging instruments (swaps) to cover its variable-rate loans are explained in note u of the appendix
to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.

the group manages its liquidity risk exposure through centralised treasury management by its finance department, which continually
monitors the group’s treasury position. the group also prepares monthly short- and medium-term cash flow forecasts, which are
presented to the treasury risk management committee composed of the head of financial control, the deputy chief executive officer,
and their main managers.

in this context, the group acquired floating rate notes with a nominal value of c167 million in 2011 and 2012. these notes were issued by
channel link enterprises finance (clef), the securitisation vehicle for the group’s debt. these notes have the same characteristics as
the group’s tranche c debt, namely a maturity between 2041 and 2050 (see note p of the appendix to the consolidated financial
statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document). this acquisition will in particular improve the group’s financial results.

as indicated in note w of the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document, the company has
carried out a specific review of its liquidity risk and considers that it is able to meet its future obligations.

as indicated in section 10.6 of this registration document, at 31 december 2014 the group was in compliance with all its debt service
cover ratios (financial covenants).

as indicated in section 10.1 of this registration document, get se received a baa2 rating from moody’s in 2007, which is still valid at
the date of this registration document.

raw materials and energy risks
for the fixed link, the eurotunnel group uses electricity as its main source of energy, particularly for train traction. the supply of
electricity represents a significant expense for the eurotunnel group (accounting for about 5% of overall operating expenditure in 2014)
and a large general increase in the cost of raw materials and electricity could have negative repercussions on the group’s results.

in the light of the highly volatile energy market, the group has introduced a risk management policy to hedge market price risk and
volume risk.

application of the french law on the new organisation of electricity markets (nome) helps reduce the group’s exposure to energy
market volatility.

volume purchases on the uk wholesale market are performed under annual contracts. purchases are made in tranches to spread the
risk, based on fundamental and technical market analysis.

to mitigate volume risk, the group closely monitors its electricity use and regularly updates its forecasts.


4 risk factors

     the group and its electricity suppliers negotiate the volume constraints in power supply contracts so as to reduce the group’s volume
     risk, by including the option of changing contractual volumes without penalty, or by adding a take-or-pay clause based on an annual
     rather than seasonal timeframe.

     the europorte entities favour the use of electrical power. when these subsidiaries use diesel locomotives, the cost price of traction may
     be affected by a change in the fuel price. ways of mitigating this risk are being explored.

     the maritime segment is exposed to risks related to the entry into force of the marpol marine pollution regulations mentioned in
     section 4.1.5 of this registration document, and their impact on the volatility of light fuel oil prices, which could have repercussions on
     the group as a result of higher prices charged by seafrance scop on capacity buyback deals.


     risk on shares and other financial instruments
     the group’s investments are governed by its treasury policy and are therefore limited to the list of financial instruments detailed in
     ‘‘short-term investments’’ above and the floating rate notes mentioned in ‘‘liquidity risk’’ above. the group does not invest in equities,
     interest rate instruments or other derivatives.


     4.1.4 risks related to retirement benefits

     in the united kingdom, the eurotunnel group administers three defined benefit pension schemes:
     • the main pension scheme, the channel tunnel group pension fund, which changed in 2010 from a wholly defined benefit plan to a
         hybrid scheme (part defined benefit and part defined contribution);
     • a pension fund for gbrf; and
     • a defined benefit plan closed to new entrants (senior executive pension fund, open only to senior managers who joined prior
         to 2000).

     an independent actuary values the schemes’ assets and liabilities. the present value of the schemes’ assets which are not due to be
     realised in the short term may undergo significant changes related to market developments.

     were the values of the schemes’ assets and liabilities to reveal underfunding, the eurotunnel group could be asked to fund the shortfall
     within the framework of a plan extending over a period of up to 10 years.

     risks associated with the uk pension schemes are managed through a regular review process and meetings with the trustees,
     actuaries and other professional advisers.


     4.1.5 risks related to the regulatory and political environment

     regulatory environment
     the eurotunnel group operates in a highly regulated environment, which results in a high degree of dependency on decisions and
     measures over which the group has very little or no influence. these regulations are subject to change and interpretation by
     administrative authorities and courts, and could be considerably tightened by national or european authorities, which would adversely
     affect the group’s business activities and financial results. compliance with the rules, in their current form and as amended in the future,
     could result in increased operating and investment costs. the competent authorities could also adopt other stricter rules or rules in new
     areas that are not currently considered, with similar effect.


     fixed link
     this regulatory framework includes the european rail directives, particularly directive 2001/14/ec which concerns both the division of
     rail infrastructure capacity and the pricing of rail infrastructure, and specifies certain operating rules applicable to rail infrastructure
     managers. this regulatory framework is constantly changing. the provisions of the recast directive on the first railway package
     (2012/34/ue) need to be transposed by the channel tunnel authorities with an economic regulation enacted, henceforth, by two
     separate national authorities (l’autorité de regulation des activités ferroviaires on the french side and the office of rail regulation on the
     british side) which could potentially lead to dissonance. the interpretation of the directive by these two separate national authorities may
     have an impact on the pricing of rail infrastructure and, consequently, on fixed link revenues. the draft fourth railway package could
     affect the operation and financial position of concessionaires as a result of the proposed separation of the activities of infrastructure
     manager and rail company. these measures could impose restrictions on the eurotunnel group’s business activities and affect its
     revenue. these directives can also be subject to change and interpretation by administrative authorities and courts, and the associated
     regulations could even be significantly tightened by national or european authorities.

operation of the tunnel is subject to highly detailed regulations drawn up by the igc and the safety authority. the concession
agreement described in section 22 of this registration document may be terminated by the states in the event of force majeure,
particularly in the event of war or a serious breach by the concessionaires of their obligations under the concession agreement.
furthermore, if the eurotunnel group should be in breach of its obligations under the concession agreement, the igc could impose
significant daily penalties. the igc has the power to make decisions (particularly in relation to the distance between trains using the
tunnel) that could lead to a reduction in tunnel capacity. the regulatory authorities could also adopt new measures relating to safety or
other matters, particularly concerning infrastructure access conditions or, more specifically, the development of more rigorous border
controls. in accordance with the uk government’s immigration act 2014, the eurotunnel group must control passports of passengers
who leave the united kingdom via its folkestone terminal with effect from 8 april 2015. the eurotunnel group is working with the
uk government to minimise the impact of these new controls on the traffic flows on the folkestone terminal. this could force the
eurotunnel group to incur significant additional expenditure, or could impose restrictions on its business activities and impact
its revenue.

the public affairs department is responsible for ensuring compliance with the rights and obligations arising from the concession, by
both the states and the concessionaires, and for monitoring relations with the igc. the eurotunnel group has no control over the igc,
which represents the two governments, particularly the french ministère des transports and the british department of transport.
moreover, the eurotunnel group has no control over the french regulatory authority for rail business or over the corresponding british
regulatory authority, which are responsible for economic regulation of the fixed link. that being the case, the obligations assumed
under the concession agreement require the states to conduct themselves in a specific manner in the performance of their duties. the
concession agreement grants the concessionaires the option of requesting, before the arbitration tribunal, in accordance with the
terms of the treaty of canterbury, compensation for breaches of contract by the states.


europorte
in france, the costs of access to the national rail network are high. their increase and/or a reduction of government funding could
contribute to a worsening of europorte’s financial results. a termination of funding would give rise to a marked increase in the operating
costs of rail operators, including epf, which would be likely to significantly disrupt the market and the pricing policy, and to threaten the
competitiveness of rail freight in the long term. in the area of transport, the public authorities are recommending the promotion and
development of alternative modes of transport. encouraging a modal shift from road to rail is one of the main levers of this policy. yet,
france’s secondary rail network, which was historically very dense, has been neglected and, following a lack of maintenance and use, is
gradually being dismantled. however, this network is essential to the survival of rail freight, since it allows a large part of freight flows to be
channelled into the main network. without political will on the part of the actors responsible for developing transport infrastructure and
the implications of that lack of political will for the modal shift strategy, the progressive deterioration or eventual disappearance of the
feeder networks could have a major impact on the revenue of epf, which obtains a third of its business from the transportation of grain.
the railway reform act of 4 august 2014 may compromise the independence of management of the french rail network and the
impartiality of train paths.

in great britain, policies concerning financial assistance and subsidies have an impact on traffic, particularly in the fields of biomass and
intermodal transport.

europorte france, europorte channel and gbrf operate under rail freight operators’ licences. these activities may only commence on
the infrastructure after approval of the safety documentation and issuance of a safety certificate by the competent authority.
furthermore, in order to obtain authorisation to transport certain hazardous materials on a given infrastructure, a safety plan is submitted
and validated by the manager of the infrastructure in question.

the plan to harmonise the conditions of employment of railway workers (both freight and passenger) is one of the objectives of the draft
railway reform. it is anticipated that a ‘‘foundation’’ decree will set the common rules regarding organisation and working time,
guaranteeing the ‘‘requirements of safety and continuity of public services’’, and that the decree will be supplemented by a sector-wide
collective agreement, the drafting of which has been entrusted to a joint committee composed of the french public and rail transport
union and seven trade union organisations. the establishment of a harmonised social framework for the whole rail sector could affect
the social equilibrium of the company and adversely affect the competitiveness of europorte.


myferrylink
concerning the maritime sector, to be compliant with marpol regulation 73/78 ‘‘regulations for the prevention of air pollution by
ships’’ to be enacted in 2015, the eurotunnel group, as a ship owner, has chosen to use light fuel oil so that its ships will have
international air pollution prevention certification, in compliance with the marpol regulations. this decision exposes the company to
the risk of price volatility affecting this type of fuel, which may be in greater demand.

4 risk factors

     businesses within the group are subject to different laws and regulations. an amendment or tightening of those regulations could result
     in additional investment or operating costs for the group in order to bring itself into line with those regulatory developments. changes in
     regulations or case law concerning the application of tax rules could also have an impact on the group’s results. moreover, other
     measures, not directly related to the regulation of the eurotunnel group’s business activities, could still affect them. by way of example,
     increased measures to enforce regulations relating to immigration, customs and excise duties could cause delays or affect customer
     satisfaction levels.


     4.1.6 risks related to extreme weather events

     the shuttle service, unlike the ferries, is unaffected by sea conditions and is not dependent on the weather. however, the occurrence of
     events related to extreme weather conditions, such as major storms or heavy snowfall, can make road networks impassable, thus
     preventing customers from accessing the fixed link. such events could also disrupt the functioning of the fixed link infrastructure,
     reducing its operating capacity or even leading to its temporary closure. extreme weather events can also have an impact on the rail
     companies using the fixed link and on essential service providers or supply networks that are indispensable for the operation of the
     fixed link (electricity, water, roads, fuel, etc.). finally, they can also affect rail freight transport activities or the financial situation of their
     customers, and could prevent the myferrylink ships from making sea crossings.

     thus, extreme weather events can affect the group’s business and impact its revenue.

     for the concession, the eurotunnel group has on-site weather stations to forecast these events. moreover, operational continuity plans
     ensure the continuity of operations in degraded mode for a given period. in such cases, the group also has management plans for road
     traffic in the vicinity of the terminals.


     4.1.7 risks linked to terrorist threats and attacks

     like other infrastructure operators, the eurotunnel group constantly faces the risk of a terrorist threat or attack on its installations,
     particularly the fixed link, or on neighbouring infrastructure required for circulation of the trains or shuttles. this risk is all the greater in
     view of the general security threat now faced as a result of attempted terrorist attacks. the eurotunnel group carries out certain activities
     on behalf of the states and, consequently must implement security and public health measures along with specific measures for the
     application of national programmes (such as the vigipirate security alert system) in accordance with the concession agreement. the
     eurotunnel group adapts its operational practices to meet these requirements and to deliver the required quality of service. it is not
     possible to rule out a change in these requirements that would make it necessary for the group to adapt its business and commercial
     practices, leading to an increase in operating costs or deterioration in service quality. that could have an adverse effect on the group’s
     image, competitive advantages, activity, financial position and results. irrespective of the insurance cover in place (see section 4.3
     below) and government responsibilities, if this risk were to materialise, it could have a significant adverse impact on the business,
     revenue and image of the eurotunnel group. in addition, safety and security measures could be tightened, which could increase
     inconvenience caused to passengers, reduce capacity and substantially increase the group’s safety and security-related expenditure.
     risk management procedures related to the risk of terrorism are described in section 17.2.4 of this registration document.


     4.1.8 risks related to health epidemics

     in the european and global health context, the outbreak of an epidemic or the fear of an epidemic are likely to have a negative impact on
     traffic, leading to a fall in revenue and/or an increase in costs linked to public health measures.

     for the implementation of its operational continuity plans, particularly with regard to operation of the concession, the eurotunnel group
     has a crisis management unit which decides on any operational adjustments that may be required, working closely and continuously
     with the competent authorities.


     4.1.9 risk of harm to image and/or reputation

     the group may be exposed to reputational risks, particularly when the group’s values or operational excellence are questioned, or when
     its legitimacy as an infrastructure manager or transport operator is challenged.

through its organisation and procedures, the eurotunnel group makes every effort to prevent the occurrence of operational risks and
disparaging attacks that could harm its image and/or reputation.

furthermore, in relation to its development, the group could face opposition from local communities or organisations to the installation
or operation of certain types of equipment or the setting up of new activities. deterioration in these conditions could result in permits and
licences being refused or delayed, and have a negative impact on the group’s business. therefore, the eurotunnel group engages in
broad consultation upstream of its projects, builds partnerships with civil society and ensures that its activities generate economic
benefits consistent with the expectations of the communities.




4.2. risks related to conducting the business of the
eurotunnel group

4.2.1 risks related to external growth, development and investment
in the group’s business

as part of its development strategy, the eurotunnel group has pursued in the past, and may pursue in the future, external growth
through acquisitions. such transactions involve a certain number of risks related to their implementation, the integration of the newly
acquired activities and personnel, failure to generate expected synergies, maintaining uniform controls, procedures and policies, the
appearance of unexpected costs or liabilities and applicable regulations. these risks could have a significant negative effect on the
group’s business, financial position or results, or on its ability to achieve its objectives.

in order to maintain its quality of service, the eurotunnel group is planning large-scale maintenance and replacement of part of its rolling
stock (three new truck shuttles have already been ordered in january 2015). given the time required to maintain, build and commission
these complex elements, the capital expenditure must be planned several years in advance. the length of the investment cycle carries
risks for the expected return on past investments. the uncertainties linked to this type of long-term investment could cause significant
budget overruns.

at the end of 2014, the group announced its decision to seek a buyer for myferrylink and its three ferries. divestiture transactions may
not be completed in the anticipated timeframe, they may not achieve the desired disposal value, they may result in additional costs, or
they may be unsuccessful.


4.2.2 operational risks

operational risks inherent in rail transport and infrastructure operation
• the eurotunnel group has more than 20 years of experience in maintaining its rolling stock, equipment and infrastructure. it has a
  standard maintenance programme, a long-term large-scale maintenance programme, as well as a rolling stock and equipment
  replacement plan, as indicated in section 6.2.4 of this registration document. however, given the specific nature of the rolling stock,
  equipment and infrastructure used for the fixed link, the particular conditions and intensity of their use and technological advances,
  these programmes and plans may prove insufficient or unsuitable, particularly in the event of premature obsolescence or an increase
  in technical faults. this would lead to unforeseen costs or partial or temporary service interruptions, which could affect eurotunnel
  group’s business, financial position and results. the eurotunnel group has implemented standardisation and reconditioning
  programmes designed to reduce future maintenance needs and improve the availability of its rolling stock. the impact of the new
  industrial solutions introduced to improve operating performance may be hard to master or grasp and could lead to temporary
  disruptions to services.
• during the repair or maintenance of its systems, technical incidents/accidents may jeopardise the safety of eurotunnel group
  employees and subcontractors. the eurotunnel group is committed to implementing all safety plans necessary to ensure the
  wellbeing of all persons working on its sites.




                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se


4 risk factors

     •   risks related to safety and fire in the tunnel are covered by the design of the system itself and by a series of principles, procedures
         and controls that have been validated by the igc. with regard to past incidents, the occurrence of another major fire would result in a
         substantial increase in the insurance premium. the introduction and effective operation of the safe stations reduces the impact of
         this historical risk, but cannot reduce the possibility of recurrence. the group regularly monitors innovations in fire detection and
         prevention systems. the group also takes into account the fact that these risks could come from external entities using the group’s
         facilities and, therefore, as part of its policy to improve safety and service quality, it has two additional independent rescue
         locomotives.
     •   concerning risks related to security, the eurotunnel group continues to implement intrusion prevention measures and continues to
         encourage the detection of concealed passengers on trucks transported. the flow of illegal migrants increased sharply in 2014. a
         continuing trend of increasing numbers of illegal migrants could require the investment of additional resources or result in poorer
         service quality which would consequently have an impact on the results of this activity.
     •   the current state of the rolling stock market requires europorte in france to place orders to buy and/or lease long before they are
         produced and brought into service, creating the risk that the market offering may be inappropriate to europorte’s needs. when the
         time comes, this could affect europorte’s ability to fulfil its commitments in a timely manner. on the british side, rolling stock that
         meets european and national regulations seems to be increasingly difficult to obtain and this could hold back gbrf’s development.


     lack of control by the group over the activities of the railways and railway companies
     network business, being the group’s principal customer, could have a significant impact on the group’s financial situation. the tunnel is
     used by high speed passenger train operators and train operators’ rail freight services, whose results could be affected by external
     events and circumstances beyond the control of the eurotunnel group. the eurotunnel group does not operate these services and
     cannot exert direct influence on the commercial operation of high speed passenger train services or the train operators’ rail freight
     services. the performance, service level, capacities and prices offered by these operators to their customers, along with other factors
     that may be beyond the operators’ control, influence the use of their services; in turn, these factors affect the revenue that the eurotunnel
     group receives from the railways and railway companies. the train operators’ rail freight services face organisational problems
     relating to coordination of national operators, regulatory or labour constraints specific to the rail sector, technical constraints of the rail
     network lines used and the priority of freight versus passenger traffic on infrastructures within the european union. these barriers to
     development could make it hard to achieve significant growth in the volumes transported by the train operators’ rail freight services,
     and could even lead to a substantial decline in traffic. a significant portion of the eurotunnel group’s revenue therefore depends on the
     successful operation of these services by entities over which it has no control.

     the railway facilities used by the high speed passenger train services and rail freight trains are outside the eurotunnel group’s
     concession and could be subject to disruption from various sources. this could result in the stoppage or reduction of this traffic. such
     events could have a negative impact on the group’s revenue derived from the usage of its railway network.


     4.2.3 risks related to human resources

     skills
     the group’s business encompasses a wide range of occupations, calling on a variety of skills. in the context of an inverted age pyramid
     for the fixed link, the replacement of some staff and potential retraining plans are areas managed by the group’s human resources
     department. the eurotunnel group has therefore increased its forward planning in terms of skills management and the transfer
     of know-how.

     calling for a broad spectrum of requirements, particularly in terms of safety, technical expertise and psychological aptitude, occupations
     in the rail industry require lengthy training. staff shortages and the difficulty of replacement within existing teams, including the
     management team, connected with stiff competition among the various operators, could affect certain developments. in order to
     anticipate the risk of the loss of key skills or the growing scarcity of workers for certain jobs, the group is pursuing a human resources
     policy that is highly oriented towards forward-looking job management adapted to different contexts and on the encouragement of
     employability through the development of training, as indicated in chapter 17 below. faced with the absence of government training
     programmes leading to qualifications in the rail sector, the group has set up an organisation dedicated to rail industry training courses. in
     addition, in order to retain its key employees and motivate their performance, the group has introduced long-term incentives and a
     bonus share scheme for all group employees.

     labour relations
     in the current economic downturn, the risk of deteriorating labour relations and staff disputes cannot be ruled out. strikes, walkouts,
     industrial action or other forms of unrest could disrupt the activities of the eurotunnel group. such events could occur not only within the
     eurotunnel group, but could also affect its customers, subcontractors or suppliers. developments within the group could mean that
     consultation and negotiation no longer effectively regulate relations between management and staff. in the event of a breakdown in the

negotiation process, those relations could deteriorate, leading to loss of motivation and trust among employees, and affecting the
group’s external and internal image.

the group has already implemented restructuring and reorganisation in the past. further measures cannot be completely ruled out in
the future. reorganisation could affect the group’s relations with its employees, giving rise to labour disputes and specifically stoppages,
strikes and other forms of disruption that could have a negative effect on the group’s business and results.

labour-related risk management procedures are described in section 17.2 of this registration document.

quality of working life
one of the group’s ambitions is to create the right conditions for employee engagement motivation and to prevent work-related stress.
to help its managers cope with the growing complexity of their work, the group has invested in the promotion of managerial practices
that place an emphasis on staff development. the group has implemented initiatives in the most appropriate areas of the organisation:
listening to employees (telephone helpline, psychological support unit, etc.), strategic workforce planning, career ladder information,
development of skills, optimisation of internal mobility and the annual deployment of a personnel management cycle whose main
objective is to identify, recognise and promote the group’s best talent, and also to spot potential talent that could develop towards
certain roles of responsibility or prominent positions within the organisation. details of the group’s strategy and its results are regularly
shared through internal communication, which fosters cohesion.


4.2.4 risks related to defaulting suppliers or subcontractors

the eurotunnel group relies on subcontractors for parts of its business, particularly relating to security, cleaning (primarily industrial) and
vehicle chocking. it is possible that some of these subcontractors might fail to fulfil their obligations, which could affect the eurotunnel
group’s results or financial position. subcontractor default risk is managed through the purchasing department’s careful supplier
selection procedure, as well as through the monitoring of suppliers’ financial positions and close contract management.

the rolling stock and some of the fixed link installations have been supplied in very small volumes by a very limited number of suppliers
to meet highly specific operating requirements. the eurotunnel group believes that if its original suppliers were unable to supply
replacement parts or whole shuttles for any reason, or were unwilling to do so on acceptable terms, it would be able to obtain the
necessary equipment from other manufacturers. however, the price or timeframe for such replacements could have an adverse impact
on the eurotunnel group’s financial position and prospects. for europorte, the need to lease new locomotives in coming years brings an
increased risk of reliance on key suppliers. equipment and materials risk is managed through the purchase of reserve stocks, the
dynamic (annual or six-monthly) review of suppliers, and research into alternative materials and technologies.

the allocation by the sncf network of poor quality train paths or the unavailability of train paths could harm europorte’s image and
affect its business. on 22 january 2013, europorte signed a framework agreement with réseau ferré de france on the infrastructure
capacity required for the rail company to operate, in addition to a new agreement on train path quality. for the service timetable covered
by the deal, the sncf network agreed to confirm or withdraw freight paths at least two months before the service is scheduled to run.

the ferries owned by the group are operated exclusively by a worker cooperative which is external to the group and could default.


4.2.5 environmental risks

the concessionaires are subject to french, english and european environmental regulations, as well as local regulations that require
them to either obtain authorisation for the disposal of certain waste materials or contract an accredited company to remove and dispose
of the waste. any breach of the environmental regulations would result in them being fined for causing pollution. the regulations also
stipulate that the authorities may force the closure of any facility that does not comply with decisions requiring certain environmentally
harmful activities to cease or be modified.

the eurotunnel group has an environmental protection and sustainable development policy which is described in chapter 17 of this
registration document. however, there is no guarantee that united kingdom, french, european, national or local authorities will not
impose new regulations leading to additional expenditure which could have an adverse impact on the results or financial position of the
eurotunnel group. due to the nature of its activities and its potential new projects or developments, the eurotunnel group, while being
attentive to compliance with the applicable environmental regulations, could experience delays in these developments because of
possible constraints or claims.




                                                                               2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                  


4 risk factors

     these risks are managed through an environmental analysis, which identifies the various risks and assesses their potential impact. the
     resources required to minimise this impact can then be identified. the regulations outline the risks associated with some activities carried
     out at the terminals, and specify requirements for reducing and monitoring their impact.

     in the united kingdom, the concessionaires, as managers of an infrastructure of major importance to the british economy, were
     required by the department for environment, food and rural affairs (defra), under the 2008 climate change act, to carry out a study
     of the ability of its infrastructure to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change.


     4.2.6 social acceptability

     the industrial sites and areas in which europorte operates, and the products transported, present a risk in terms of the environment and
     industrial safety
     the main customers of socorail, the europorte subsidiary specialising in the provision of industrial logistical services, include actors from
     the chemical and oil industries subject to the seveso classification. these industries are subject to very strict safety regulations,
     therefore extremely stringent safety criteria are imposed on subcontractors. although socorail has, for several years, been engaged in a
     voluntary process of iso 9001: 2008 quality certification and mase (business safety improvement manual) safety certification, the
     danger, toxicity or flammability of some raw materials could cause risks, particularly risks of accidents, fires, explosions and damage to
     the environment and wildlife, and could harm the environmental image of europorte and the group. the same applies when europorte’s
     rail freight subsidiaries transport various hazardous, toxic or flammable products. furthermore, the business of rail freight haulage may
     present environmental risks in the event of a rail accident, due to the materials transported or the zones crossed. the industrial safety
     and environmental risk prevention policy is described in section 17.4.2 of this registration document.


     4.2.7 legal risks

     risks related to specific terms of the concession agreement
     the concession agreement under which the eurotunnel group operates may only be modified through amendments negotiated with
     the states. these negotiations could be long and complex. were economic, financial or technical developments affecting the eurotunnel
     group to make rapid changes necessary, the specific terms of the concession agreement could limit the eurotunnel group’s ability to
     adapt or to adjust its business to those developments, which could affect its results and financial position.

     risks related to competition regulation
     the eurotunnel group’s market, pricing practices and behaviour are governed by competition law, the application of which is supervised
     by the french and british competition authorities and the european commission. this could give rise to the introduction of new
     regulatory measures concerning prices, penalties, third-party proceedings for damages and restrictions on the group’s business
     activities. these or other measures could have a significant negative impact on the eurotunnel group’s financial position, particularly in
     the case of divergent interpretations of a given operation by the french authority and the british authority. as indicated in section 20.8 of
     this registration document, the french competition authorities did not come to the same conclusion as the british competition
     authorities concerning the purchase of certain ex-seafrance assets. the group’s management of legal risks is carefully monitored by
     several departments and, in particular, by the group’s legal department through a monitoring procedure and meetings with the relevant
     operational departments.

     risks related to failure to meet contractual obligations
     like any business, the eurotunnel group is, by definition, exposed to risks related to failure to meet its contractual obligations to its
     customers, suppliers, employees and financial partners.


     customers
     the concessionaires’ obligations to the railways under the railway usage contract which ends in 2052, or to railway companies
     under the network statement, and the consequences of failing to meet those obligations are detailed in chapter 22 of this registration
     document. the group did not see any significant reduction in the railways’ contributions to its fixed annual charges in 2014 as a result
     of unavailability of the fixed link. it cannot be ruled out that the railways may wish, before the end of the railway usage contract, to
     renegotiate it or dispute certain of its provisions.

     as part of its transport activity, the eurotunnel group transports passengers and trucks on board its shuttles. the eurotunnel group’s
     commitments are governed by its general conditions of carriage.

within its rail freight transport and industrial-site management business, europorte, to secure its activity and reduce the risk of
dependency on a few key customers, has identified possibilities for diversification and growth. europorte’s commercial policy seeks to
mitigate risks of dependency on a few customers or sectors of activity by diversifying the customer portfolio and developing growth
opportunities in the infrastructure management market.


suppliers
the group’s purchasing procedures and general purchasing conditions set forth the terms of payment for supplier invoices. the
conditions applied by the group in france are compliant with the obligations defined in the french economic modernisation act of
4 august 2008. the group has established systems and procedures for processing supplier invoices to make sure that they are paid in
accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.

financial partners
the obligations related to the group’s term loan are described in chapter 22 of this registration document. these obligations,
combined with the level of the eurotunnel group’s debt, could affect its ability to obtain additional financing in the future and limit its
ability to react to changes that affect its business or the markets in which it operates. the loans and other financing could become
subject to early repayment in full should the group fail to meet certain of its contractual obligations, or in the event of occurrence of the
events or defaults mentioned in chapter 22 and note u to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration
document.

as part of the procedures for the management of these risks, the finance department continually monitors the group’s commitments
and restrictions within the framework of the treasury risk management committee.


significant legal proceedings
the eurotunnel group is now, and could be in the future, involved in certain administrative or judicial proceedings. the most significant
current or potential proceedings are described in section 20.8 of this registration document.

more generally, it cannot be ruled out that, in the future, new legal proceedings, whether related to ongoing proceedings or not, could be
brought against any of the eurotunnel group’s entities; were such proceedings to have an unfavourable outcome, they could have an
adverse impact on the business, financial position or results of the eurotunnel group.


the main shareholder of get se holds a significant percentage of the capital and voting rights
gs infrastructure partners (gsip) holds, through various funds, a significant ownership interest in the capital of get se, as indicated in
chapter 18 of this registration document.

consequently, it could be in a position to exert influence at the general meeting on the group’s corporate decisions requiring shareholder
approval (the election and dismissal of members of the board of directors, the distribution of dividends, changes to the articles of
association and decisions to undertake important operations for the group, including new issues of equity securities). however, the
organisation of corporate governance within the group (number of independent board members, board committees) as described in
chapter 16 of this registration document is another way to moderate this risk.


4.2.8 risks related to information systems

with the arrival of new technologies, the information system is extending beyond the group with the outsourcing of certain it systems
(cloud computing) and new uses by employees (bring your own device). attacks via the internet are increasingly complex and




                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                17

4 risk factors

     numerous. at the same time, the group’s activities and processes are becoming increasingly dependent on information systems.
     information system failures could result in losses or leaks of data, delays or additional costs, posing a risk to the group’s strategy
     or image.

     these risks are addressed through functional, technical and legal security measures: securing smartphones, automatic detection of
     security vulnerabilities on group servers, annual intrusion tests, and so on. system redundancy, contingency plans and recovery plans
     are in place for strategic systems. moreover, the concessionaires that generate a large part of their revenue online and are considered to
     be a critical infrastructure operator are subject to particular audit and control obligations in terms of information system security.




     4.3. insurance

     the eurotunnel group’s insurance programmes consist primarily of policies covering material damage and business interruption
     (including terrorism) and third-party liability.

     for the fixed link, the material damage and business interruption policy (including terrorism) is composed of two layers of c400 million
     and c300 million respectively, providing total cover of c700 million. the first layer was renegotiated and renewed on 1 january 2015 for a
     period of three years ending on 31 december 2017. the second layer was renewed on 1 january 2015 for a period of one year ending
     on 31 december 2015. premiums are paid annually.

     the eurotunnel group’s third-party liability policy (excluding specific programmes) was renewed on 1 january 2014 for two years,
     ending 31 december 2015.

     the dedicated insurance programme for epf, epp and socorail which was already in place, has been renewed for the period
     1 december 2014 to 30 november 2015. it includes cover for material damage and business interruption, third-party liability and
     environmental damage.

     in certain circumstances, payments by insurance companies under existing insurance guarantees may not be sufficient to cover all of
     the loss suffered. losses in excess of the agreed indemnity limits or the application of deductibles or certain exclusion clauses could
     result in the eurotunnel group incurring unforeseen costs or could affect its business, financial position or results.

     in addition, changes to the insurance market and the occurrence of operational incidents could lead to an adverse change in the
     eurotunnel group’s insurance programme and the terms and conditions of such insurance, such as the level of premiums, the level of
     insurance deductibles and the scope of any exclusions which could have an adverse impact on the eurotunnel group’s business,
     financial position or results.

     as part of these risks management procedures, the group constantly monitors the adequacy of coverage and actions to be undertaken.

5.1.5 important events in the development of the business of get se

maritime activity: procedure before the uk competition and markets authority
seafrance was liquidated on 9 january 2012. in july 2012, eurotunnel purchased three ferries as part of the asset disposal procedure
conducted by the french tribunal de commerce, and sub-contracted the operation of the ferries to an independent company, scop
seafrance. the ferries are owned by three subsidiaries of euro-transmanche holding sas, and the commercial activity is carried out by
another subsidiary of euro-transmanche holding sas, myferrylink sas.

on 9 january 2015, the competition appeal tribunal rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group and scop seafrance and
confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
the port of dover within the next six months. the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrance’s business, an interpretation that the group has always contested.

the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
ferries. due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries
within a period of five years, any such sale before 2017 would need to be authorised by the tribunal.

     5.2. investments

     5.2.1 significant investments made by the eurotunnel group during
     the last three years and significant current investments

     the total amount of the eurotunnel group’s investments in the last three years is respectively c182,139,000 for the 2012 financial year,
     c74,382,000 for the 2013 financial year and c140,630,000 for the 2014 financial year.

     over the last three financial years, the eurotunnel group’s main investments in the fixed link were:
     • the installation of the gsm-r (approximately c28 million).
     • the programme to renovate and increase the engine power of 18 locomotives from 5.6 to 7 mw, at a cost of around c22 million,
        which gave the eurotunnel group a 44-strong fleet of 7 mw locomotives at the end of 2013 in order to better able to handle the
        heavier loads that result from the lengthening of truck shuttles to 32 carriers and increased truck weights.
     • the replacement of rails in the tunnel (approximately c14 million).
     • the entry into service of the gsm-p in the north tunnel which is an important element in improving the offer to customers by enabling
        them to use mobile communications services from french or british telecoms operators whilst in the tunnel on shuttles and
        passenger trains (approximately c12 million).
     • the terminal 2015 project, an ambitious programme to develop truck traffic which aims to increase capacity by improving the
        management of the flow of trucks by the addition of a buffer storage area to enable a quick transit, as well as an increased access at
        check-in. in folkestone, the terminal 2015 project includes the creation of new lanes before check-in and new check-in booths. the
        capacity to accommodate trucks will increase with the construction of a secured parking area for 350 vehicles at coquelles
        (approximately c9 million).
     • the decocooning of the ninth passenger shuttle and comprehensive periodic maintenance by rake (approximately c9 million).
     • the floor renovations on the arbel and breda truck shuttles (approximately c8 million).
     • catenary power cut-off at platforms and installation of compressors under passenger shuttle double-deck loaders (approximately
        c4 million).

     over the last three financial years, the eurotunnel group’s main investments in the europorte segment totalled approximately
     c173 million, and consisted mainly of the purchase of rolling stock as part of the ongoing rationalisation of the locomotive fleet, notably
     locomotives for europorte france and gbrf. to accompany its growth in activity, gbrf acquired 21 new class 66 locomotives in 2014,
     of which 11 were subject to a sale and lease back transaction.

     as indicated in chapter 6 of this registration document, on 2 july 2012 the eurotunnel group acquired certain assets from the former
     shipping company seafrance which was in liquidation, consisting mainly of the vessels berlioz, rodin and nord pas-de-calais. the
     total investment to acquire and rehabilitate these vessels was c82 million, of which c65 million was for the initial acquisition.

     in 2011 and 2012, the group acquired variable rate notes with a nominal value of c167 million for c150 million. these notes were issued
     by channel link enterprises finance (clef), the securitisation vehicle for the group’s debt, and are identical in their characteristics to
     tranche c of the group’s debt, including their maturity of between 2041 and 2050. this acquisition improves the group’s financial
     results. these transactions do not modify the existing contractual obligations relating to tranche c of the debt. as a result, these notes

5.2.2 significant future investments

investment projects planned for 2015 fall into three categories: those undertaken in response to outside constraints, those to replace
existing equipment before it becomes obsolete and those to improve the group’s performance. each project has a level of flexibility in
terms of scope and phasing which may be adjusted as circumstances change.

in the current economic environment and given the risk of increased competition in the cross-channel market, these investments are for
the most part essential to sustaining the competitiveness and market shares of the eurotunnel group’s activities.

the project to equip the tunnel with gsm-r continues and requires a total investment estimated at c48 million, of which c10 million is in
2015. this project is to meet obligations under the european directive on interoperability of the european networks and will allow the
circulation of trains run by new entrants, including deutsche bahn.

two major projects which are required to meet environmental regulations and which form part of the group’s sustainable development
are currently being studied for 2015:
• the replacement of chillers for tunnel cooling plant and air conditioning systems using r22 gas, the handling of which is prohibited
   from 1 january 2015, and
• the replacement of the fire-extinguishing gas halon 1301, a contributor to the depletion of the ozone layer, used in firefighting
   systems on-board locomotives, in the service tunnel and in buildings on the terminals.

replacement projects in 2015 include the continued replacement of rails in the tunnel, some track switches, the floors of some truck
shuttles and couplings on the passenger shuttles, locomotives and on truck shuttle loader wagons in order to allow them to operate
under optimum conditions of reliability, safety and security.

intensive use and the natural life cycle of rolling stock lead to deterioration in some of the wagon equipment. to remedy this, several
programmes to study modernisation and replacement have been launched, such as on the passenger shuttle loader wagons, on the
fire doors and on the air conditioning units.

other projects are designed to boost the business’ performance, capacity or productivity, notably including the development plan for the
shuttle activities:
• the comprehensive redevelopment of the french and british terminals including equipping and developing the parking used by
   customers of the truck shuttle service from the summer of 2015.
• the purchase and commissioning of three new truck shuttles from the autumn of 2016. following a european tender process, this
   order, which represents an investment of approximately c40 million, was awarded to wbn waggonbau niesky gmbh. this order is
   for the construction of three new truck shuttles each measuring 800 metres long and comprising 32 transport wagons, three
   loading wagons and a carriage for the transportation of truck drivers. these new truck shuttles will benefit from the latest
   technological advances in order to ensure both energy savings and also robustness and reliability. delivery is expected from the end
   of 2016 and in 2017.
• the redevelopment of the allocation areas and the construction of new buildings to welcome flexi-plus customers on the french and
   uk terminals.

the eleclink project, in which get se holds a 49% share, has received authorisations as described in section 6.4.2 of this registration
document. the investment required for this project will be financed by equity and debt raised by eleclink in accordance with terms and
conditions which have not yet been determined.

6.1. introduction

get se, the group’s listed holding company, controls the two channel tunnel concessionaires and europorte sas in relation to rail
freight transport activities and euro-transmanche holding sas in relation to ship rental and sale of crossings.

the two concessionaires operate the tunnel in accordance with the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement. the treaty of
canterbury, signed on 12 february 1986, authorised the construction and operation of the fixed link by private concessionaire
companies and established the framework of the concession agreement, which was signed on 14 march 1986.

under the terms of the concession agreement, the states granted the concessionaires the right and obligation to design, finance, build
and operate the fixed link between france and the united kingdom for an initial period of 55 years. this term was extended by 10 years
in 1994 and by a further 34 years in 1999. the concession agreement thus extended will expire in 2086. the main provisions of the
treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement are described in chapter 22 of this registration document.

the concessionaires operate the system, which links france and the united kingdom and comprises three tunnels, each approximately
50 kilometres long, which run mostly under the channel, along with the folkesotne terminal in the united kingdom and the coquelles
terminal in france, the fixed equipment and related installations. two of the tunnels are single-track rail tunnels, which in normal service
are used by trains travelling in one direction only. the third tunnel, which for most of its length runs between the two main rail tunnels,
provides a safe means of emergency evacuation and access for tunnel maintenance. there are also four crossing points between the
rail tunnels, so that when maintenance work is being done on a section of one tunnel, trains can switch to the other.

the system is directly linked to the british and french motorway networks with the folkestone and coquelles terminals the departure
and arrival points for vehicles using the shuttle services. shopping and catering facilities are available to customers at each terminal. the
system is also linked to the french and british railway networks, in particular to their high-speed lines. all rail traffic in the system is
controlled from railway control centres at the french and british terminals.

the holding company europorte sas groups all the rail freight transport subsidiaries (europorte segment) providing a wide range of
integrated rail freight services, including national and international haulage, local services for secondary lines, and services to industry
(individual junction management, infrastructure maintenance, and wagon loading and unloading).

the holding company euro-transmanche holding sas groups all the maritime subsidiaries (myferrylink maritime segment) owning
three vessels, which are operated commercially using a series of charter agreements under which scop seafrance is responsible for
the equipment and nautical management of the vessels on the sea route between the ports of calais in france and dover in the
united kingdom, and which are marketed by the subsidiary myferrylink sas.

in 2014 eurotunnel group earned its revenue from three main sources:
• the fixed link activities, mainly:
    – the shuttle service (le shuttle) for both the transport of trucks and the transport of cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches,
      motorcycles and trailers on its passenger shuttles;
    – payments made for use of the railway network by high-speed passenger trains (eurostar) and by train operators’ rail freight
      services;
• the europorte rail freight segment;
• the myferrylink maritime segment.

the breakdown of the eurotunnel group’s 2014 revenue is as follows:

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     6.2. cross-channel activities

     6.2.1 main markets

     the eurotunnel group operates in the transport market between continental europe and the united kingdom. it offers (i) a shuttle
     service between calais and folkestone, and which competes directly with ferry operators between dover and the continent in the
     transport of passengers, cars, coaches and trucks, and (ii) a railway network on which railway companies can run rail freight trains and
     high-speed passenger trains, and (iii) at the time of writing of this registration document, a maritime transport service between dover
     and the continent, under the myferrylink brand, in direct competition with other ferry operators and shuttle services between calais
     and folkestone.


     a) freight market
     freight traffic between continental europe and the united kingdom is commonly divided into four distinct modes:
     • roll-on/roll-off accompanied: trucks and trailers crossing the channel or the north sea on shuttles or ferries at the same time as
         the road tractor and driver, mostly via the short straits;
     • roll-on/roll-off unaccompanied: trailers crossing the channel or the north sea independently of the road tractor, mostly via north
         sea routes;
     • rail freight: conventional or intermodal trains running through the tunnel; and
     • lift-on/lift-off: moveable containers or swap bodies loaded on lift-on/lift-off container ships, mostly on the north sea routes.

     the market is based on three corridors:
     • the short straits: all routes from continental europe to dover, folkestone and ramsgate (including the tunnel);
     • the english channel: all routes from continental europe to ports on the south coast of the united kingdom to the south-west of
        folkestone; and
     • the north sea: all routes from continental europe to ports on the east coast of the united kingdom to the north of ramsgate
        (including the thames estuary).

     the modal distribution varies by geographic zone. for accompanied trucks, the long trip across the english channel or the even longer
     trip across the north sea is costly. these routes are more suitable for roll-on/roll-off unaccompanied and lift-on/lift-off solutions.

     by contrast, the shorter crossing times of the short straits are more appropriate to time-sensitive traffic, and attract a much larger share
     of roll-on/roll-off accompanied traffic.

     short straits
     in the freight market, the truck shuttle service is in direct competition with ferry operators on the accompanied road transport route
     across the short straits, including myferrylink.

     over the last 15 years, there has been a marked shift towards the use of accompanied trucks in the freight market between continental
     europe and the united kingdom. the trend in favour of accompanied trucks has now come to an end and market shares between the
     routes are now relatively stable.

     however, the roll-on/roll-off accompanied mode on the short straits routes still continues to grow because it provides the shortest
     and quickest route for crossing the channel.

     the short straits’ (truck shuttles’ and ferries’) share of the freight market rose on the back of the success of the roll-on/roll-off
     accompanied mode, reflecting:
     • the lack of major development in cross-channel rail freight, and
     • capacity increases and changes in pricing policies by the various operators.

     the freight market continued to grow in 2013 and 2014 with estimated growths respectively of 4.7% and of 7.9% compared with the
     previous year to achieve for the fiscal year 2014 a total short straits market at a level higher than that observed in 2007, before the
     economic crisis and in particular the economic slowdown in the united kingdom.

     since 1st january 2015, pursuant to directive 2005/33/ec of the parliament and the council of the european union, which imposes
     controlled emissions areas for sulphur covering the english channel, the north sea and the baltic, all ferry operators in the north sea
     and the english channel must meet stricter limits on sulphur emissions and for that, they have two alternatives:
     • the first solution is to choose a fuel with low sulphur content, marine gas oil (mgo), and

                                                                                                                                               6

•   the second is to continue using fuels with high sulphur content, such as heavy fuel oil (hfo), but to install equipment to clean
    pollutants from the exhaust gas (exhaust gas separator filters or scrubbers).


b) passenger market
until 2008, the international passenger transport market from and to the united kingdom grew steadily. the impact of the global
economic environment largely reversed this trend between 2009 and 2012. the passenger market achieved significant growth in 2013
and again in 2014 compared with the previous year, mainly during the summer period (source: international passenger survey
estimates).

the passenger shuttle service and the myferrylink maritime service transport passengers travelling with their vehicles between calais,
folkestone and dover. they are in direct competition with ferry operators in the short straits market. the transport services for
passengers travelling without their vehicles provided by airlines or by high-speed passenger trains constitute a marginal and indirect
source of competition to these two services.

eurostar services principally operate in the market for transporting passengers travelling without their vehicles between paris and
london and between brussels and london. eurostar’s main competitors are airlines.


short straits
during the 1990s, this market was characterised in particular by a high proportion of day trips, with passengers attracted by duty-free
purchases or other economic benefits. these advantages having disappeared, the number of day trips on the short straits route is on a
sustained downward trend. however, both the number of long-stay (five days and over) and short-stay (fewer than five days) trips
increased as a result of:
• the withdrawal of passenger services on other cross-channel routes, which led to a transfer of traffic to the short straits;
• the adoption of dynamic pricing by some operators, particularly the eurotunnel group; for its maritime services and shuttle services;
• airline pricing policies and an end to the steady fall in air fares; and
• airport disruption and delays.

the car market declined significantly in 2012, partially offset by one-off events such as the diamond jubilee and the 2012 london
olympic games in june, august and september. the market contracted by 2.4% in 2012 compared with 2011. in 2013, the car market
significantly recovered by about 2.8% compared with 2012, mainly during peak periods, the summer and school holidays in the
united kingdom. in 2014, the short straits market grew by 1.5% compared to 2013.


c) competitive position in the short straits market
the shuttle services and the myferrylink maritime service are in direct competition with the ferry services operated by p&o ferries and
dfds seaways. they compete indirectly with airlines and to a lesser extent with eurostar.


i)  ferry operators
cross-channel ferry operators are using larger ships to handle greater volumes of traffic and to achieve economies of scale over the long
term, looking for growth in the freight market rather than in the passenger market (cars).

the project calais port 2015 aimed at merging the ports of calais and boulogne-sur-mer and the extension of the port of calais, in
particular the ferry terminal, was assigned a public service contract signed by the nord pas de calais region on 19 february 2015
(source: nord littoral 19 february 2015). the port of dover plans to create a new terminal in the western docks to accommodate
larger ferries.

following the withdrawal of hoverspeed in october 2005, speedferries in november 2008, ld lines in september 2010 and the
liquidation of seafrance in january 2012, the eurotunnel group’s main competitors are p&o and dfds seaways.

p&o
p&o ferries (‘‘p&o’’) is a subsidiary of dp world, a worldwide operator of port facilities.

p&o is the most important ferry operator on the short straits, with five vessels, and is in direct competition with eurotunnel group both in
the freight market and in the passenger market.

p&o operates up to five vessels (pride of kent, pride of burgundy, spirit of britain, spirit of france and european seaway), two of which
are new and, at 210 metres, are the longest ships deployed on routes to and from dover.

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     dfds seaways
     norfolkline dfds seaways is owned by the danish company dfds.

     in 2013, dfds seaways had three ships operating on the dover-dunkirk link, all delivered between 2005 and 2006. they have a lower
     passenger capacity than those traditionally used by p&o ferries.

     once seafrance ceased trading, ld lines’ norman spirit was transferred from le havre to bolster dfds’s fleet on the dunkirk-dover
     route. since 17 february 2012, dfds seaways has been running a service between calais and dover. in 2013 and 2014, dfds
     seaways operated two vessels on the dover-calais link (norman spirit and the former molière of seafrance)(1).


     myferrylink
     the myferrylink maritime service is described in section 6.2.5.


     ii) shuttle services
     competitive advantages of the shuttle service
     the eurotunnel group considers that, under normal operating conditions, its shuttle service benefits from considerable competitive
     advantages over ferries even though certain market segments are inaccessible to it, notably out-of-gauge vehicles and certain
     dangerous goods. these competitive advantages are as follows:
     • speed: the standard travel time between the french and british motorways is much shorter than via the ferries;
     • departure frequency: the eurotunnel group’s shuttle service runs more frequently than any of its competitors, and it runs every day
         of the year;
     • reliability: the shuttle service, unlike the ferries, is unaffected by sailing conditions and is not dependent on the weather; and
     • environmentally friendly: the electric power it uses for traction generates much lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels.

     eurotunnel’s shuttle service also offers:
     • a freight service that is independent of the passenger service, which has a peak tourist season;
     • more efficient management of loading/unloading; and
     • the direct management of its terminals, in contrast to the ferries, for which port operations are managed by third parties.

     eurotunnel group considers that the maritime transport service under the myferrylink brand, while completely different from the shuttle
     service, offers its customers a lower-cost alternative with the same eurotunnel group standards in terms of security, safety and
     customer service.


     iii) airlines
     airlines, and particularly low-cost airlines, also have an indirect impact on the short straits market. these companies serve many
     destinations in continental europe and thus compete with operators in the short straits, including the passenger shuttle service in the
     short-stay leisure market. many destinations in france are now served by low-cost airlines offering an alternative means of transport
     between france and the united kingdom.


     iv) eurostar
     to a lesser extent, eurostar’s high-speed passenger trains compete indirectly with the passenger shuttle service in the leisure market.


     6.2.2 fixed link: activities

     the eurotunnel group operates and directly markets a shuttle service through the tunnel and also manages the safe and efficient
     passage of high-speed passenger trains and of the train operators’ rail freight services on the railway network.


     a) shuttle transport activities
     the eurotunnel group’s sales, marketing and operations strategy is focused on clearly differentiating its product from that of its
     competitors. this strategy aims to ensure outstanding service quality and optimum security, and involves the following key measures:
     • constant alignment of supply with demand, to optimise revenue per shuttle;
     • commercial strategies providing a product offering even better suited to customers’ needs; and
     • cost control achieved through programmes to optimise maintenance and production management cycles and as well as the main
        sub-contracting agreements (the areas in which eurotunnel group uses sub-contractors are described in section 17.2.1 i) of this
        registration document).

this business model focuses on operating margins and seeks to maximise profitability rather than to increase volume and market share.

i)    truck shuttle service
introduction
the truck shuttle service carries trucks between france and the united kingdom on shuttle trains. in each terminal, drivers pass
through dedicated check-in, security and border control facilities. other facilities for trucks are located close to the terminals. drivers and
their passengers do not remain in their vehicles during the crossing, but travel in a separate carriage (‘‘club car’’) specially designed for
this purpose. these club cars have been completely refurbished in a campaign that ended in 2014: cosy atmosphere, more comfort
and greater seating capacity.

the eurotunnel group has 15 truck shuttles (six of which have capacity for 31 trucks and nine have capacity for 32 trucks), thus
enabling the group to operate up to six departures per hour in each direction.

on 15 january 2015, eurotunnel group announced the order of three new truck shuttles which will be added to the 15 existing shuttles.
this enhanced fleet will enable eurotunnel group to increase its capacity by 20% and move to a frequency, at peak period, of eight
departures per hour compared to the current six. it involves the construction of three new truck shuttles, with a capacity of 32 trucks.
the new shuttles will benefit from the latest technological developments to ensure both energy savings as well as robustness and
reliability. their delivery is scheduled for late 2016 to 2017.


strategy
truck service marketing strategy
the strategy is based on an optimisation of truck shuttle revenue and a pricing policy that reflects the value of the service provided by
the eurotunnel group as well as its speed, ease and reliability.

throughout the year, the eurotunnel group gives priority to customers under contract, only providing transport to occasional customers
as available capacity allows. as part of the project vision 2020, eurotunnel group is working on optimising the truck shuttle revenue
with a project adjusting the pricing policy based on more flexible prices, adjustable according to demand and capacity available, in order
to encourage an improved distribution of truck flows throughout the week and during the day, so that capacity and occupancy rate can
be optimised while maintaining service quality during peak days.


truck shuttle service market share
the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the truck shuttle service market on the short straits corridor has evolved as follows:

                                                                               2014                                          2013
                                                                                      market share
                                                                      vehicles          (estimate)                 vehicles         market share

    accompanied trucks *                                            1,440,214                  37.8%              1,362,849                  38.6%

*     number of accompanied trucks transported by the truck shuttle service. the market share percentages are derived by calculating the truck shuttle
      service’s accompanied truck traffic as a proportion of the total of such traffic on the short straits market as reported by irn services ltd.


2012 was marked by the absence of the traditional operator seafrance and the resulting redistribution of traffic, as well as by additional
traffic generated by the london olympic games. the market share of truck shuttles therefore continued to rise, reaching 43.5% for the
year, a record since the fixed link was opened. the introduction of the myferrylink maritime service, as well as the new calais-dover
service provided by dfds, helped to re-establish at the port of calais a range of transport services comparable to that which existed
before the departure of the traditional operator seafrance.

the resulting partial redistribution of traffic resulted in a significant fall in market share of the truck shuttle service in 2013, which stood at
38.6% for the year, comparable to that of 2007. the 2014 financial year was marked by an increased competition from ferry operators
based on prices which led to a slight decrease in the market share of the truck shuttle service business to 37.8% for the period.


ii) passenger shuttle service (le shuttle)
introduction
the passenger shuttle service carries cars, motor homes, caravans, coaches, motorcycles and trailers between france and the
united kingdom on shuttles. tickets can be bought in advance at www.eurotunnel.com, by telephone from the customer service
centre, from travel agents and on arrival at check-in. customers remain in their vehicle throughout the crossing, which normally lasts
approximately 35 minutes from platform to platform. each passenger shuttle has two sections: a double-deck section mainly for cars
and motorcycles and a single-deck section reserved for vehicles higher than 1.85 metres, mainly coaches, minibuses and cars with roof
boxes or towing caravans.


6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     the eurotunnel group has nine passenger shuttles able to carry up to 180 cars or 120 cars and 12 coaches. the passenger shuttle
     service can operate up to five departures per hour in each direction.

     strategy
     the business model aims to optimise passenger shuttle revenue by increasing the average revenue per shuttle departure.


     pricing policy (‘‘dynamic pricing’’)
     the group’s pricing system calculates and adjusts ticket prices according to departure time and shuttle load factor. this policy
     optimises passenger revenue and the average ticket price for passenger vehicles (cars, motor homes, caravans, motorcycles, etc.).

     currently le shuttle customer bookings made online represent more than 80% of bookings. a new booking module for le shuttle was
     deployed in november 2014 allowing, for example, smart phones applications and a new reservation module for tour and coach
     operators which will be deployed in the fourth quarter of 2015.


     adapting capacity to demand
     the capacity of the passenger shuttle service is constantly adjusted to improve loading rates and reduce costs. several operational
     changes have been made to continuously improve this strategy, such as better distribution of shuttle departures during the day, fewer
     passenger shuttles running at off-peak times and more during peak times, and the introduction of more flexibility in train crew
     management.

     over the medium term, this policy has allowed the eurotunnel group to optimise the load factor, which went from 45% in 2004 to 60%
     in 2014.


     customer experience
     as a service business, eurotunnel le shuttle puts the customer at the centre of its strategy and implements ways to enhance their
     satisfaction and loyalty. two main areas of progress are being developed:
     • real-time information (for each customer at every stage of their experience with eurotunnel group); and
     • individualisation of the service, that is to say, consideration of the specific needs of customer segments, such as, for example,
         owners of electric vehicles and those travelling with their pets. since autumn 2014 crew members scan the bar code printed on the
         hangers of each vehicle on board the passenger shuttle. this system identifies each customer on board the passenger shuttle and
         provides real-time personalised information. it enables eurotunnel to have meaningful data on the service offered to customers, such
         as actual transit time, compliance with departure time, or position in the shuttle.

     as part of the vision 2020 project described in section 6.2.4 of this registration document, one of the themes is customer information in
     real-time. this is made up of three goals: to provide any relevant information to each customer, to refine knowledge of customer
     expectations and to accurately measure the satisfaction of each customer.


     passenger shuttle service market share
     the eurotunnel group estimates that its share of the car and coach passenger markets on the short straits were as follows:

                                                                                        2014                                           2013

b) railway network
in 2014, eurotunnel group earned 25% of its revenue (36% of fixed link revenue) from the use of the railway network by high-speed
passenger trains and train operators’ rail freight services. the eurotunnel group does not operate these trains but manages their safe
and efficient passage through the tunnel infrastructure.

the use of the tunnel by the railway companies is governed by the railway usage contract with the national railways, which is in force
until 2052. under this charging framework, the railways are obliged to pay to the eurotunnel group fixed annual charges and variable
charges according to the number of passengers on high-speed passenger trains. the variable charges are determined according to a
toll formula that applies throughout the life of the railway usage contract, and which takes into account the effects of inflation to a
certain extent. in addition, the railways are required to contribute to the operating costs of the system, as well as to investment costs
relating to the modernisation of equipment.

a simplified pricing mechanism for freight trains has been put in place, with charging per freight train instead of charging per tonne of
freight. this scale is published annually by the eurotunnel group in its network statement, which sets out access conditions to its
railway network implementing the charging framework of the railway usage contract for all railway companies for the operation of
high-speed passenger trains and freight trains.

the eurotunnel group’s revenue for its railway network depends solely on receiving variable charges payable according to the number
of passengers transported by the eurostar high-speed passenger trains and the number of freight trains, as well as the annual fixed
charges as well as the contribution made by the railways to operating costs.

in 2014, the eurotunnel group generated c305 million of revenue from the use of its railway network.


i)   high-speed passenger trains (eurostar and new market entrants)
market developments
the market for high-speed passenger train services (eurostar and future new market entrants) comprises business and leisure
passengers travelling between the united kingdom and continental europe. the market is geographically diverse and includes
passengers travelling between london and paris or london and brussels as well as passengers travelling between other points in the
united kingdom and france, belgium, the netherlands and germany. eurostar’s high-speed passenger trains connect london with
the centre of paris and brussels and compete directly with airlines on travel time, frequency, comfort and price. for short-stay leisure
travel, eurostar also competes with low-cost airlines in terms of price, capacity and choice of destinations. eurostar operates a direct
service to disneyland paris, a winter service to bourg saint maurice and a summer service to avignon in the south of france.

combined data on market growth for eurostar and the airlines are presented below.

                                                                 2014 (estimated)                                 2013

     market share
     the data below summarises the growth in eurostar’s share of the high-speed passenger train market on the paris-london and
     brussels-london routes.

                                                                                2014 (estimated)                                        2013

     *     sources: sncf and brb.
     **    market share percentages are derived by calculating the volume of rail passengers as a proportion of the total volume of air and rail passenger traffic
           between paris and london and between brussels and london as provided by the caa, brb and sncf.


     the share held by eurostar high-speed passenger trains in the passenger market for the paris-london route has reduced slightly to
     78.4% on average for 2014, compared to 79.7% for 2013. over the same period, their market share on the london-brussels route fell
     slightly from 83.9% to 81.8%.

     the competitive environment of high-speed passenger trains (eurostar)
     in the business travel market, eurostar’s high-speed passenger trains compete with the traditional and low-cost airlines that offer
     regular flights between paris and london and between brussels and london. in the leisure travel market, eurostar’s main competitors
     are the low-cost airlines, not only on the routes served by eurostar but also to other destinations. eurostar has taken several successful
     initiatives in terms of marketing and special offers over the internet, targeting the leisure travel segment. the subsidiary of sncf
     confirmed the schedule for the opening of new destinations in 2015 and 2016.

     in this context of the liberalisation of the international rail passenger transport market on 1 january 2010, the eurotunnel group
     responded by publishing in its network statement its efficient and non-discriminatory conditions for access, and offers new entrants the
     option to operate cross-channel high-speed passenger train services in competition with eurostar and the airline sector, to existing or
     new destinations.

     high-speed passenger trains (eurostar)
     eurostar’s high-speed passenger train services are jointly operated by eurostar international limited, now 55% owned by sncf, 40%
     owned by london and continental railways limited (which is under the control of the british government, as is brb) and 5% owned by
     sncb. the british government announced that they had reached an agreement with a consortium of cdpq, the caisse de dépôt et
     placement du québec and hermes infrastructure for the sale of the 40% holding they have in eurostar.

     since 2007, when high speed 1 and the london terminal at st pancras international opened, the eurostar high-speed passenger train
     service has used a high-speed line between london and the eurotunnel group’s uk terminal. this line improves service reliability and
     reduces the transit time between paris and london or brussels and london by around 20 minutes. in addition, st pancras international
     station improves rail links with northern england, due to the proximity of rail services from st pancras, king’s cross and euston stations.
     ebbsfleet international station, located near the m25 london orbital motorway, also allows eurostar’s operators to expand their
     catchment area.

     in 2014, eurostar ran 14 to 18 departures in each direction between paris and london and seven to ten trains in each direction between
     london and brussels on business days, with adjustments depending on the day, the season and the destination. some trains make
     intermediate stops at ebbsfleet or ashford international in the united kingdom and at calais-fréthun or lille-europe in france. eurostar
     also runs a service to disneyland paris five days a week and a seasonal direct service from london and ashford to bourg saint-maurice
     (from december to april) and to avignon (from july to september).

     in 2014, the number of eurostar passengers going through the tunnel rose by 2.6% to 10.4 million compared with 2013 (source:
     eurostar).

     in november 2014, eurostar announced the order of seven additional trains from siemens which, together with the ten trains already
     ordered in 2010, makes a total of 17 trains. the first of these 17 e-320 trains with distributed power will come into service in late 2015.
     more comfortable and faster than the existing trains with a top speed of 320 km/h, they can accommodate 900 passengers (i.e. 20%
     more). eurostar international limited has confirmed the launch of a new direct service from london to lyon, avignon and marseille from
     may 2015, open for bookings since december 2014, and to be operated throughout the year at the rate of one to five round trips per
     week depending on the season. eurostar international limited has also announced its intention to operate a new service between
     london and amsterdam from december 2016.

additional opportunities exist for services to germany, southern france and / or switzerland.

deutsche bahn has also stated it intends to launch ice passenger train services from london to cologne and frankfurt in a schedule still
to be confirmed. its operational outline for these services received approval from the igc in june 2013.


ii) train operators’ rail freight services
market developments
train operators’ rail freight services compete with most modes of sea and road freight transport between continental europe and the
united kingdom.

the freight volume transported by the train operators’ rail freight services is summarised below.

sources: eurotunnel, db schenker, sncf/captrain and europorte channel.


competitive environment of train operators’ rail freight services
rail freight through the tunnel, originally developed by state-run railways, initially had disappointing results and organisational difficulties
which resulted in a drop in traffic from 3 million tonnes to 1 million tonnes between 1998 and 2007. international rail freight is also held
back by inadequate national infrastructure (train gauge and length, quality and availability of paths), distortions that favour sea or road
transport and excessive constraints (whether regulatory, social or technical).

in order to retain and relaunch train operators’ rail freight services, since 2007 the eurotunnel group has pursued a comprehensive
competitive strategy aimed at addressing the specific challenges in the cross-channel freight market through the implementation of
certain measures in respect of open-access rail development, border restrictions and competitive pricing policies for rail freight services.
between 2007 and 2010, despite the revival of intermodal and conventional block trains, the demise of conventional isolated car
services in france and in great-britain has resulted in the loss of more than a third of cross-channel rail freight traffic, marking a low of
2,097 trains and 1.13 million of tonnes transported in 2010.

in may 2013, with the aim of promoting the development of the freight train traffic of railway companies in the tunnel, eurotunnel group
launched a program to help start new services (etica), extended in june 2014 following its positive results. between 2010 and 2014,
the establishment of etica contributed to the growth in traffic of around 40% (38% in number of trains and 46% in tonnage transported)
compared to 2010.


train operators’ rail freight services
the train operators’ rail freight services between continental europe and the united kingdom are run by railway companies including
db schenker (on behalf of brb), sncf (and its captrain subsidiaries), europorte, and potentially any freight train operator in open
access. three different types of freight trains use the railway network:
• intermodal trains, composed of platform wagons transporting containers or swap bodies;
• conventional trains (carrying goods on pallets in enclosed wagons or bulk loads in adapted wagons such as tankers, hoppers,
    platforms, etc.) making up a full train;
• trains with specialised wagons for transporting new cars.

rail freight trains are in competition with most modes of freight transport in operation between continental europe and the
united kingdom.

in order to revive cross-channel rail freight, the eurotunnel group has adopted a strategy that is based on three policies: (i) development
of open access for all operators of rail freight trains, (ii) dealing effectively with border restrictions, and (iii) a simplified and competitive
pricing policy:
• an average toll charge of £3,000 (c4,500) per train (in 2007 values), for a train travelling at 120 km/h during an average busy period;
• a simplified pricing structure (one toll charge per train, taking account of speed and peak and off-peak transit) allowing operators to
    optimise their trainloads;
• real and effective open access and the capping at c600 (in 2007 values) of essential cross-channel service costs (dealing with
    border restrictions and specialised class 92 locomotives); and
• competitive total costs compared with the road transport sector in order to encourage rail freight development.

after 2010, with its repeated disruptions to rail freight and the end of single wagonload services, the development of new services
between 2010 and 2014 drove an increase in traffic of 38% in the number of trains (and 46% in tonnage transported) compared with



                                                                                 2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     2010, including the creation of new intermodal services and an increase in the transportation of steel, aluminium and vehicle
     components.

     originally set up in may 2013, the success of the etica growth plan led in june 2014 to the intensification of initiatives to promote rail
     freight, with the expansion of the program for assistance to etica start-ups both over time (opening extended until 2018) and by
     expansion of eligible categories, along with a 25% reduction of access charges during off-peak night periods for rail freight services. so
     that these growth efforts can produce their full effect, eurotunnel group has also drawn the attention of authorities to the need to
     address the barriers to development (size, length, capacity, etc.) on existing national networks, which considerably weaken the
     competitiveness and development of cross-channel rail freight.


     c) other revenues
     the fixed link generated c15 million in other revenues in 2014, representing 1% of the eurotunnel group’s total revenue (2% of fixed
     link revenue). these other revenues consist mainly of (i) revenue from third-party retail businesses in the terminals on both sides of the
     tunnel, (ii) revenue paid for telecommunication lines in the tunnel, (iii) revenue related to the property business, (iv) the sale of travel
     insurance products in the united kingdom, and (v) revenue related to ciffco training.


     i)  revenue from third-party retail businesses
     the eurotunnel group has built facilities for its customers on its two terminals in france and the united kingdom, including shops and
     other retail outlets.

     access to the shops, bars and restaurants is available only to customers travelling on the shuttle services. they are located inside the
     terminals, after check-in. these facilities are operated by third parties under three- to ten-year concession agreements on the french
     side and under leases on the british side.

     the eurotunnel group’s strategy is to offer travellers who choose to stop before making the crossing a choice and level of service
     consistent with the overall quality and value of service offered by the eurotunnel group. in 2013, the victor hugo passenger terminal
     building in folkestone and the charles dickens building in coquelles were refurbished to the highest international airport standards in
     order to welcome customers in a pleasant environment.

     in 1994, a contract was signed for 30 years for the operation of three petrol stations located at the entrance and exit of the two terminals.

     the eurotunnel group also earns modest revenue from renting advertising boards on both terminals and around the terminal exit routes.


     ii) property business
     the eurotunnel group owns and manages plots of land near its french and british terminals.

     as an extension of its mission to design, build and operate the fixed link, the eurotunnel group was also given responsibility for local
     land development. the fixed link is not just a transport infrastructure: it was also designed as a platform for the future economic
     development of the kent and calais regions. the eurotunnel group, in the interests of sustainable development, has restored the site of
     the former factory where the tunnel lining segments were made, which was later used as a shelter for illegal immigrants (‘‘red cross
     centre’’). this restoration work has paved the way for a major commercial and tourism development project to stand alongside the cité
     de l’europe shopping centre in coquelles.

     as part of efforts to strengthen its partnership with the town of sangatte-blériot and the conseil général of the pas-de-calais, the
     eurotunnel group signed an agreement with the conseil général of the pas-de-calais on 6 january 2009 covering measures to support
     this ambitious tourism development project.

     as part of the responsibility for local land development given to it by the french authorities at the beginning of the fixed link project, and
     in order to further boost the appeal of the pas-de-calais region as a tourist destination, euro-immo get, a groupe eurotunnel se
     subsidiary, submitted a successful bid for the land development concession for the integrated seaside eco-village and golf course
     project at the porte des deux-caps. the concession agreement was signed on 18 february 2013.

     in general terms, the development of the area entrusted to euro-immo get, the project supervisor, encompasses all the work relating to
     roads, networks, open spaces and various facilities designed to meet the needs of the future occupiers, owners, inhabitants and users
     of the new buildings. the concessionaire will manage the assets acquired until they are transferred to the builders. the concession will
     last for 10 years.

iii) training activity: ciffco, the opal coast international railway training centre
ciffco is a subsidiary 100% owned by eurotunnel group, expert in railway operations. the ciffco centre notably makes it possible
for other rail and industrial operators to train their staff in rail and industrial trades.

ciffco provides:
• an experienced teaching team;
• a building entirely devoted to training, located near the french eurotunnel terminal in coquelles;
• the latest technology high-performance simulators essential for learning to drive trains and modern computing resources notably
   allowing distance learning;
• accreditations required to run its railway training centre activity. to this end, on 8 september 2014, ciffco obtained the renewal for
   five years of its accreditation from the french public rail safety authority epsf. ciffco is also approved as a body responsible for
   examinations of general professional knowledge related to train driving.

in 2014, the train driver training issued by ciffco officially entered the french national directory of professional certifications ‘‘répertoire
national des certifications professionnelles français’’. this will therefore allow a recognised professional qualification to be issued.
ciffco is now the first, and only, private training organisation with the capacity to deliver this qualification alongside the french public
operator.


6.2.3 fixed link: capacities

a) the system
i)   the tunnel
the number of trains or shuttles that can pass through the tunnel every hour is limited. the tunnel capacity is expressed in terms of the
number of standard paths per hour in each direction. a standard path is defined as the time it takes a shuttle train operating at 140 km/h
to cover that part of the system which, under normal operating conditions, is used by all other trains travelling through the tunnel.

one of the key factors determining the tunnel’s capacity is the signalling system. at the date of this registration document, the system
permits 20 standard paths per hour in each direction. under the railway usage contract, trains belonging to the railways have the right
to use up to 50% of the hourly capacity in each direction. high-speed passenger trains and train operators’ rail freight services,
because of their faster or slower speeds relative to the eurotunnel group’s truck and passenger shuttle services, use more than one
standard path to travel through the tunnel. at peak times, speeds can be adjusted to maximise the number of trains and shuttles
travelling through the tunnel. in 2014, the maximum number of standard paths used by passenger and truck shuttle services was ten
per hour in each direction.

at the date of this registration document, the tunnel’s capacity under normal operating conditions does not constitute a significant
constraint limiting growth in the different types of traffic.

as part of its five year strategic thinking for the fixed link, project vision 2020, and as indicated in section 6.2.4 of this registration
document, the group is working on optimising tunnel availability itself, notably by spending no more than one night per week (instead of
the two at present) on the maintenance of the two rail tunnels, thanks to predictive maintenance tools and ‘‘big data’’ analysis. a
dedicated tunnel measurement train will circulate each week to deliver a very accurate assessment of the condition of the track,
catenary and other equipment, eliminating long on-foot visual inspections.

in the medium or long term, the eurotunnel group believes that it will be possible to increase the tunnel’s capacity by the following
means:
• setting uniform operating speeds for all trains, which would allow more trains to run on the same number of standard paths. at the
    date of this registration document, goods trains travel in the tunnel at a speed of 100 or 120 km/h, while high-speed passenger
    trains can reach a speed of 160 km/h in the tunnel. these speed differentials use a large part of the system capacity, because they
    require the eurotunnel group to leave greater intervals between trains than would be necessary if they all travelled at the same speed.
    use of the system’s capacity could therefore be improved by shifting slow or infrequent freight trains to off-peak times, and by
    scheduling trains that travel at speeds higher (160 km/h) or lower (120 km/h) than the standard path (140 km/h) so that they run in
    flights during peak hours;
• increasing the power of the locomotives pulling the shuttles to allow the use of longer trains or reduce transit times;
• reducing the space between trains using the tunnel (to 2 minutes 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes currently) so as to raise system
    capacity to 24 standard paths per hour in both directions, although this would mean improving the fixed equipment; and
• improving the signalling system, notably with ertms (this initial phase creates no additional capacity).

some of these measures require approval by the igc, which has supervisory authority over tunnel operation.

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     a dedicated optical relay system using 2g and 3g telephone and gsm-p mobile internet networks enables passengers on shuttle
     services and high-speed passenger trains to use their mobile phones to make calls and access the internet. this was put in place in
     the north tunnel in 2013 and in the south tunnel in 2014.


     ii) terminals
     currently, ten boarding platforms are in service at the french terminal and ten at the british terminal.

     both terminals were designed so that the number of boarding platforms could be increased to 16. in order to maintain traffic fluidity and
     to increase the number of hourly truck shuttle departures, capacity at the terminals will be expanded. as stated in section 6.2.4 of this
     registration document, the terminal 2015 project notably includes the development of a secure parking area for approximately
     370 trucks in coquelles and an increase in the number of toll booths and in the number of access lanes to the check-in barriers.

     the terminals have self check-in lanes for all customers, along with an automatic number plate recognition system. these systems
     improve traffic flow and reduce operating costs. in a constant drive to improve the quality of service, the coquelles and folkestone
     terminal buildings have been refurbished. a play area with a variety of play equipment and a digital display screen was created in the
     charles dickens building in coquelles. meanwhile, the victor hugo building in folkestone was given award-winning sanitary facilities, a
     prayer room and special facilities for severely disabled people.


     b) rolling stock
     plans to develop the shuttle fleet are described in section 6.2.4 of this registration document.


     c) railway services (passenger and rail freight)
     under the railway usage contract, trains using the railway network are entitled to use up to 50% of the total capacity of the tunnel that
     is allowed by the signalling system. this currently amounts to ten standard paths per hour in each direction for high-speed passenger
     trains (eurostar and new entrants) and train operators’ rail freight services. goods trains currently transport an average load of about
     500 to 600 tonnes each, although some of them can transport up to 1,000 tonnes of freight, and travel at speeds varying between 100
     and 120 km/h. an increase in the average load or the travel speed of goods trains would allow the railway companies to increase freight
     train traffic without additional use of the tunnel’s capacity. similarly, increasing load factors on high-speed passenger trains (those of
     eurostar and new market entrants) and synchronising them so that they run in flights would enable more passengers to be transported
     without using additional tunnel capacity. under the terms of the railway usage contract, the eurotunnel group may use any surplus
     capacity not used by the railway companies if they have not confirmed their capacity requirement by the previous day. use of this
     surplus capacity provides the eurotunnel group with additional flexibility in optimising the flow of traffic and scheduling passenger and
     freight trains and shuttle service departures.


     6.2.4 fixed link: system reliability

     a) tunnel availability and maintenance
     scheduled weekly maintenance of the tunnel is planned and structured so as to promote efficient use of the tunnel and cause minimal
     disruption to commercial operations.

     the eurotunnel group has set itself an objective of limiting service disruptions due to fixed equipment failure to less than 0.75% despite
     continual traffic growth. in 2014, tunnel availability was 99.77% compared with 99.71% in 2013.

     the operational plan aiming to restrict fire risk (salamander plan), along with the creation of fire fighting stations (safe) help to protect
     the infrastructure in case of fire on board a truck shuttle. this plan proved effective on 17 january 2015 when the teams had to deal with
     a small fire on a truck and a section of catenary that had fallen. the implementation of the salamander plan enabled the fire to be rapidly
     contained and damage to be limited.


     b) rail replacement
     rails on the terminals are replaced as part of the routine maintenance programme, without major disruption to commercial services. the
     strategy implemented has reduced costs without harming the quality of the track. this strategy aims to avoid systematically replacing
     both lines of rails, but only those rails that are worn or that present defects.

     the third in tunnel rail replacement campaign began in 2014 and will be completed early 2016. the first 33 kilometres were laid in 2014,
     the laying of 67 additional kilometres will take place in 2015 and 2016. this work is taken advantage of to inspect the hammer beams,
     concrete parts on which the rail rests. thirty-three kilometres of track will be replaced each year, on friday, saturday and sunday nights

                                                                                                                                                6

over 11 weekends at the start of each year. it is intended that resin rails will be installed along the 11 km of the tunnel which are most
susceptible to corrosion.


c) maintenance and availability of rolling stock
the eurotunnel group has also set itself the objective of achieving better utilisation of its transport capacity by improving load factors on
its rolling stock. this is in addition to improving the availability of the rolling stock by modifying maintenance procedures in order to
optimise periods of operation between maintenance visits.

the repair and maintenance programmes implemented by the eurotunnel group have helped to improve the reliability of the electric
locomotives and truck and passenger shuttles. in planning its maintenance programmes, the eurotunnel group’s objectives are
the following:
• ensure that safety requirements are met;
• avoid rolling stock being out of service for prolonged periods; and
• maximise the number of shuttles available at peak hours.

under current maintenance programmes, light maintenance and safety inspections are carried out every 44 days or 30,000 km for the
locomotives, truck shuttles and passenger shuttles. every 600 to 1,200 days, depending on the vehicle and the number of kilometres it
has covered, each shuttle is taken out of service for six weeks to undergo an extensive preventive maintenance programme.

the departure cancellation rate for passenger shuttle services due to faults in rolling stock was 1.4% in 2014, stable compared to 2013.
the departure cancellation rate for truck shuttle services due to faults in rolling stock was 1.4% in 2014, while it was 1.6% in 2013. the
number of stops in the tunnel due to faults in rolling stock was 26 in 2014, compared with 37 in 2013. the eurotunnel group is
implementing simplification and renovation programmes aimed at further reducing future maintenance requirements and improving
reliability.

the goal of the lsm (large scale maintenance) programme is to:
• meet safety requirements (bogie, brake, coupling, batteries, etc.);
• restore and improve the reliability of systems that have reached about a third or half of their overall potential (canopy, sdl
   hydraulic, etc.);
• extend the life of wagons (breda floors, arbel floors, etc.); and
• ensure customer comfort (air conditioning, toilets, interiors, etc.).


d) maintenance strategy
the time (tunnel infrastructure maintenance excellence) programme has led to a reduction in overnight maintenance from three to two
nights per weekend since september 2012, as a result of reduced sub-contracting costs, optimisation of maintenance times and
efficient working methods. this optimisation is ongoing and, since early 2013, maintenance work on the terminals on friday and
saturday nights has been limited and is now transparent for commercial operation and all of the tunnel’s capacity is fully available
for customers.

the process of optimising the rolling stock maintenance strategy has continued. its aims are:
• to improve the availability, performance and quality of the shuttles,
• to increase processing capacity and so minimise the total cost of maintenance, and
• to rationalise technical choices and industrial resources.

this process is based on several lines of work:
• the extension of the light and in-depth preventive maintenance cycles, both for truck shuttles and for passenger shuttles, which has
   a significant impact on the availability of shuttles and processing capacity;
• the technical redesign of maintenance on systems with a high impact on performance and quality, focusing on the relevance of
   maintenance instructions and the implementation of appropriate lsm programmes; and
• the optimisation of key processes such as corrective maintenance, re-profiling and axle replacement, with improvement in the
   efficiency of human, industrial and it resources.


e) projects
in 2014, the eurotunnel group finished its locomotive renovation and power-increase programme with 18 additional units, which brings
the fleet of 7 mw locomotives to 44.

various projects are planned in the short or medium term to further improve system reliability and efficiency, including the project
terminal 2015, work on which began in the summer of 2014 on the two terminals and will be completed during the summer of 2015.

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     concerning the french side of the terminal, the work first focuses on the creation, before registration, of a ‘‘buffer storage’’ area,
     equipped with five lanes from the entrance onto the site up to the tolls, where the number of lanes will increase to six instead of the four at
     present. second major investment in the french terminal: the construction of a secure parking for 370 trucks. featuring a rest area,
     restaurant and a petrol station, this equipment will be managed by the operator of the adjacent motorway.

     concerning the british side of the terminal, the infrastructure developments are designed to separate the flow of trucks from that of the
     cars that will run on the ten existing lanes. the trucks will have five new lanes before check-in.

     more broadly, as part of a collaborative dynamic, eurotunnel group decided to define and orientate the fixed link strategy for the next
     five years, identifying issues and challenges and deciding on goals to be achieved by 2020 (project vision 2020).

     as part of this improved performance over the long term, seven working groups have been set up to bring together seven large
     transverse and collaborative themes, including:
     • fluidity of the terminals: the project aims to increase the hosting capacity of the terminals while reducing transit time between the
         arrival of a customer on the site and their boarding a passenger or truck shuttle.
     • improving the availability of rolling stock: the three third generation truck shuttles ordered in early 2015, will benefit from the latest
         technical advances. on the shuttle side, the loss of capacity due to the departure on mid-life maintenance of a passenger shuttle in
         2017 will be offset by developments on the other eight passenger shuttles.
     • customer experience: as indicated in section 6.2.2, ii of this registration document.
     • improvement of the availability of the infrastructure as specified in section 6.2.3 a) i of this registration document.
     • human resources, as indicated in chapter 17 of this registration document.


     6.2.5 myferrylink: maritime activities

     the eurotunnel group’s myferrylink maritime subsidiaries own three ships. they lease their ships to a scop (an operating company
     outside the eurotunnel group) and market the cross-channel crossings for freight and passenger vehicles.

     the eurotunnel group has entered into lease agreements with the scop which operates the ferries on the short straits route. in turn,
     the eurotunnel group, via its subsidiary myferrylink sas, purchases capacity from the scop and sells the crossings under the
     myferrylink brand. these contractual relationships are described in chapter 22 of this registration document.

     the status of these activities as regards the french and british competition authorities is presented in section 20.8 of this registration
     document.

     the berlioz and rodin ferries can carry from 1,200 to 1,900 passengers and 120 trucks or 700 cars. the freight ferry nord
     pas-de-calais can transport up to 85 trucks. with the scop that are operating them, the three vessels in service make up to
     24 crossings a day.

     in 2014, this activity generated revenue of c93 million for the group, compared with c74 million in 2013.


     i)   myferrylink maritime freight activity
     the eurotunnel group considers that the market share of maritime freight transport under the myferrylink brand across the short
     straits is as follows:

                                                                                 2014                                       2013
                                                                                        market share
                                                                           units         (estimated)                  units        market share

• automotive,
• infrastructure: network rail/london underground/rail services.

the volume of freight moved by rail between 1993/94 and 2013/14 has increased by around 65% to 23,000 million tonne-kms. rail’s
share of overland freight movement is 13%, up from 8% in 1993. approximately 35% of the coal consumed by uk power stations is
transported by rail. around 30% of rail freight is intermodal container traffic. this number is forecast to grow subject to government
grant support.

in the united kingdom, the sensitivity and behaviour of customers in response to environmental issues is already influencing purchasing
criteria and has led companies to pursue or prove their commitment in this field. thus, for example, two large british supermarket
chains, tesco and sainsbury’s, are making increasing use of rail freight in their supply chains to reduce their carbon footprint.

the environmental advantages of rail freight are clear: 26% of the uk’s co2 emissions come from transport, 90% of this being road
transport(1), while rail freight produces three to four times less co2 per tonne transported than road transport, and up to ten times fewer
polluting emissions(2).

the uk’s three main political parties are in favour of freight distribution by rail, recognising its role as a green alternative to road transport.
this support is obvious when we consider the following points:
• promotion of the growth of rail freight – 2007 white paper on rail transport(3) which included the launch of the strategic rail freight
   network and supported a doubling in rail freight volumes,
• promotion of the efficiency and capacity of the railway network, as specified in the publication from the department for transport in
   september 2009 entitled: ‘‘strategic freight network: the longer-term vision’’(4), and
• the strategic funding of the freight programme: through the transport initiatives fund, the department for transport has contributed
   funding to network rail specifically for investments focused on rail freight.

6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     b) french rail freight market
     in the first three quarters of 2014, french rail freight volumes reached 24.15 billion t/km, remaining at a similar level as in 2013
     (24.14 billion t/km). in the same period, europorte in france transported 0.97 billion t/km, a decrease of 17.2% compared with the first
     three quarters of 2013 following the re-internalisation of services subcontracted to the group.


     6.3.2 europorte’s activities in france

     thanks to its denser coverage in france, europorte is positioned as a growth vehicle for the group, present across the entire rail freight
     transport logistical chain, from the collecting and routing on primary and secondary networks (europorte france) or loading and
     unloading of wagons on private branch lines on industrial sites (socorail), to running freight trains in the channel tunnel and managing
     rail infrastructure (ports, private and public/private industrial sites) in france and belgium. europorte is developing its various
     complementary activities concurrently in order to offer its customers complete and customised solutions that meet their expectations in
     terms of integrated logistical chains and high quality of service.

     despite a decrease in volume transported, the turnover generated by europorte activities in france in 2014 has increased, from
     c110 million in 2013 to c115.7 million in 2014.


     a) europorte france (epf)
     europorte france is a private rail company that offers its customers a service hauling freight trains throughout the railway network. every
     day, epf carries out main line rail haulage operations 24 hours a day and seven days a week throughout france with connections to
     neighbouring european countries, in partnership or as an open-access operator, particularly in belgium where epf has railway
     authorisations (licence and certificate).

     for its operations, which averaged around 200 trains per week in 2014, epf has a fleet of approximately 70 main line electric and diesel
     locomotives interoperable with neighbouring european countries. they are used on average by 265 drivers and operators authorised for
     safety operations on the french railway network and, in some cases, in belgium.

     epf has designed its operating model based on six key parameters, specifically with a view to serving its private industrial customers:
     • optimising transport plans based on regular paths,
     • organisation of the rail businesses through regional hubs,
     • guaranteed service through the provision of human and other reliable resources dedicated to traffic,
     • regular and punctual delivery of goods,
     • safety on customers’ private branch lines and on the national railway network, and
     • communication on the status of customers’ freight traffic.

     europorte transports all types of goods, with the exception of explosive, nuclear and biological materials. its entire operating system is
     designed in accordance with the rules on transporting dangerous goods, to maximise the safety of its operations. a major feature of
     2014 was the start of an important business of ammonia transportation and the continued development of the grain business from a
     production centre based around dijon and the champagne region of burgundy, making europorte the main rail operator in this sector in
     bourgogne champagne.

     epf has continued to diversify the goods it transports and its customers, to balance out the risk of seasonal fluctuations in the volumes
     transported; therefore, no customer exceeds 10% of turnover. europorte france also continued to consolidate its rail business along
     france’s north/south corridor through its hubs at lérouville, dijon lyon, fos/marseille and toulouse. epf has also developed its range of
     ‘‘spot’’ trains, started in 2013, to meet growing demand from rail freight customers for one-off transport requirements.

     all main line locomotives are equipped with gps positioning and exchange all relevant technical data with the operating and
     maintenance teams. the command post agents are able to display on their tablet the position of the train, its schedule in relation to its
     paths, battery condition, amount of fuel in its tank. in turn, drivers are gradually being equipped with tablets incorporating driving
     documents, traffic information, alert reports etc.


     b) socorail
     for more than 40 years, socorail has been providing internal logistical services on industrial sites: wagon handling operations, track
     maintenance, loading/unloading wagons and trucks, and operations on ships. socorail’s activities cover a range of services to industry,
     mainly involving dispatch and reception of basic, semi-finished or finished products, and management of rail infrastructure:
     • the management of branched terminal installations including reception, handling and dispatch of loaded or unloaded wagons and
        the associated administrative processing,

•   loading or unloading wagons, particularly tank-wagons,
•   terminal rail services in port zones and on the french railway network,
•   the provision of rail haulage engines on a full-service basis,
•   track maintenance,
•   traffic management of rail networks at various ports,
•   the management of front offices and loading tracks for tank-wagons,
•   the operation of the port terminal for an oil refinery, and
•   ancillary activities.

socorail works on 40 industrial sites and the infrastructure of seven ports, including around 20 sites classified as seveso ii in the oil,
chemicals, steelmaking, automotive and construction materials sectors. socorail is mase and iso 9001 certified. present throughout
france, socorail manages wagons, trucks, operations on ships and port infrastructure.

since 2011, with the integration of europorte services, socorail has developed a service offering for rail infrastructure managers,
consisting of traffic management and railway maintenance. over the last few years, these activities have expanded considerably since
socorail was awarded the delegated management contracts for the ports of dunkirk, nantes saint nazaire, bordeaux, strasbourg and
la rochelle, in addition to the maintenance contract for the ports of le havre and rouen. in 2014, socorail continued its expansion with
wagon maintenance services. this new business complements its logistics activities on industrial sites and local services.

the delegated port infrastructure management sector is socorail’s main business, accounting for 36% of its 2014 revenue, followed by
oil/hydrocarbon refining with 25%. the contributions from chemicals and services to the french railway network and port terminals were
13% and 9%, respectively.


c) europorte proximité (epp)
europorte proximité operates 80 km of lines around the branch at gray, in eastern france, where there is also a maintenance workshop
for diesel locomotives. epp maintains its own rolling stock and that of europorte france.


d) bourgogne fret service
europorte has set up a local railway operator in partnership with its customer cerevia (a union of agricultural cooperatives) to offer other
customers or train operators a way to collect grain along secondary lines. bourgogne fret services, which began operations in
july 2013, is designed to make better use of europorte’s resources while offering cerevia a logistics system that will allow it to form
strategic alliances and increase its zone of influence. in 2014, bourgogne fret service expanded its freight forwarder offering to include
inland waterway barges on the axis saone/rhone.


e) europorte channel
europorte channel was created to provide cross-channel integrated operations, including freight train traction between the two tunnel
terminals of the tunnel, the multimodal transport of goods through the tunnel and the ground operations of rail freight passing through
fréthun. then, with the group’s development and in the interests of the organisation’s rationalisation, these activities have been taken
up, over time, by various entities of the group and continue to be provided by these entities.


6.3.3 europorte’s activities in the united kingdom

gb railfreight (gbrf) is the united kingdom’s third largest rail freight operator employing some 626 staff and generating turnover of
c151 million in 2014. its activities cover all rail freight service segments, both short and long haul: intermodal combined transport, bulk
traffic (including coal), infrastructure equipment, rail industry services, construction materials, petrochemicals and metals, and general
commodities.

as a result of the business relationship established with energy suppliers drax power and more recently with e-on energy, gbrf is the
first company to transport biomass as an alternative to coal in the united kingdom. it has also been a major supplier to the crossrail
project, the suburban rail network of more than 100 km which will serve london and its environs from 2018.

the company has long-term contracts in place for the majority of its customers. during 2014, the company renewed several of its
existing contracts, most notably with british gypsum, drax power, petrochem carless, edf energy and rio tinto alcan. the company
has also secured a major new contract with aggregate industries for the transport of aggregates.

serco, the future operator in 2015 of the sleeping car night service, the caledonian sleeper, between london (euston station) and five
scottish cities, entrusted train traction to gb railfreight.


6 description of the eurotunnel group’s activities

     the main sectors of gbrf’s activity are summarised below:


     bulk transport
     bulk transport services represented 49% of gbrf’s revenue in 2014. the transport of coal between ports and power stations represents
     half of this activity and is complemented by a service transporting biomass.


     intermodal transport
     the transport of containers is the second largest sector of activity for gbrf (21% of revenue) after bulk transport. this sector is largely
     concentrated on services out of the port of felixstowe, the uk’s major container port. gbrf is the main rail operator from the port.

     this sector is particularly susceptible to the economic environment since it is linked to the level of imports and exports to and from the
     united kingdom. the planned extension to the port of felixstowe represents an opportunity to develop gbrf’s container services.


     infrastructure services
     infrastructure maintenance activities whereby the company transports equipment to and evacuates waste material from infrastructure
     construction sites represented 25% of revenue in 2014.

     gbrf’s long-term strategy is based on differentiating itself from its competitors in terms of quality of service and safety management, and
     has three main strands:
     • organic growth: the company’s strategy is to continue developing its business in the infrastructure modernisation and bulk transport
        sectors, by building on existing contractual agreements and winning new business. in particular, gbrf is looking to expand its
        business of transporting biomass and to benefit from the development of this product as an alternative to coal in the uk power
        generation sector.
     • rolling stock: gbrf continues to invest in new material, and in 2014 acquired 21 new class 66 locomotives in order to support its
        growth and maintain service quality. at the end of 2014, 11 of these class 66 locomotives had been refinanced.
     • gbrf seeks to offer optimal working conditions to its employees, thereby ensuring that it retains the expertise needed to maintain the
        high level of service quality expected by its customers.

     furthermore, in conjunction with europorte france, gbrf continues to promote cross-channel rail freight traffic.




     6.4. other activities

     6.4.1 euro carex

     the eurotunnel group is involved in the euro carex project via its subsidiary london carex limited. faced with ever stricter
     environmental constraints and rising fuel prices, paris cdg, amsterdam schipol, lyon st exupéry and liège airports linked up with
     logistics companies including fedex, tnt and la poste to try to encourage a transfer of air freight onto the european high-speed railway
     network. london carex is part of this umbrella organisation, the euro carex association, tasked with developing the british end of the
     network. the carex concept is similar to a cargo aircraft running on rail: high-speed trains that have been modified to carry air freight
     containers. a full-scale trial was carried out in march 2012 with a carex tgv carrying parcels from lyon st-exupéry to london
     st pancras with a stop at roissy-cdg. the trial proved the concept to the satisfaction of all carex partners. in 2013, london carex
     continued its studies into setting up a branched terminal on hs1 and, under the aegis of euro carex, coordinated the drafting of
     specifications, notably examining the conversion of high-speed passenger wagons that have reached the end of their commercial life
     into freight wagons, as is the case in the aviation industry. in 2014, euro carex (liège) carried out a detailed survey (financed by the
     european commission) relating to terminal settings, including air security. euro carex (lyon) also published the results of a survey
     concerning handling on the terminal.


     6.4.2 eleclink

     via its subsidiary get elec limited, the eurotunnel group joined forces with european venture capital company star capital partners in
     2011 to create eleclink limited, a joint venture 49% owned by get se and 51% by star capital. the eleclink project aims to lay a new
     electricity interconnector between the french and british grids by running two direct current cables through the tunnel. the project fits in
     with the european policy to develop infrastructure between member states and will provide a completely secure way to optimise
     electricity transmission.

after having signed in 2013 the connection offers with the two electricity transmission public network, the british national grid and the
french réseau de transport d’electricité, the company obtained in 2014, from the regulatory authorities in both countries and from the
european commission, the regulatory exemption allowing it to trade for 25 years and offer long-term contracts, of a 20-year maximum
duration. eleclink therefore launched in november 2014, a phase of expression of interest during which almost 40 market players
expressed interest in being awarded long-term interconnection capacity. these long contracts represent up to 80% (800 mw) of the
interconnection. the remaining 20% will be marketed in the form of short-term contracts to electricity transmission networks, trading or
investment companies. as soon as the construction contracts for the two converter and cable installation stations have been awarded,
work will begin in 2015. the interconnection is expected to be in service in 2018.

this project represents an investment as described in chapter 5 of this registration document.

     the eurotunnel group earned revenues of c305 million in 2014 from the use of its railway network by eurostar’s high-speed passenger
     trains and by the train operators’ rail freight services, an increase of 3% compared to 2013.

     in 2014, the number of eurostar passengers using the tunnel increased by 3% compared to 2013.

     the number of rail freight trains increased by 14%, mainly due to an increase in intermodal transport and to the favourable impact of
     etica (eurotunnel incentive for capacity additions), the financial assistance scheme to start up new services.


     b) fixed link concession operating costs
     the fixed link segment’s operating costs amounted to c353 million in 2014, an increase of 6% compared to 2013. of the c19 million
     increase, approximately two-thirds was directly related to the increase in the concession’s operational activity and the remainder was
     due to expenditure on non-recurring projects.

9 review of financial results

     9.2.7 pre-tax profit

     at c272 million in 2014, net finance costs decreased by c5 million compared to 2013 as a consequence of the decrease in inflation rates
     and the resulting effect on the nominal value of the index-linked tranche of the debt.

     ‘‘net other financial income and charges’’ in 2014 included net exchange losses of c12 million compared to a net loss of c1 million in
     2013 principally arising from unrealised exchange differences generated by the impact of the appreciation of sterling against the euro on
     the revaluation of intra-group balances in sterling held by french subsidiaries. these intra-group balances arise primarily from funding
     flows between the concessionaires and get se where a deterioration of latent exchange losses would arise from an increase in sterling.
     this line also includes interest receivable on the floating rate notes of c7 million (2013: c7 million).

     the eurotunnel group’s consolidated result before tax for the 2014 financial year was a profit of c56 million, an increase of c26 million
     compared to 2013 at a constant exchange rate.


     9.2.8 net result

     in 2014, income tax expense included a charge of c2 million relating to tax on dividends (3% of the c81 million dividend paid in 2014), an
     income tax charge of c2 million and a net deferred tax credit of c5 million.

     the consolidated result after tax for the eurotunnel group for the 2014 financial year was a profit of c57 million. at 31 december 2013
     the group accounted for the initial recognition of deferred tax in its consolidated accounts which gave rise to a credit for a net deferred
     tax asset of c83 million.

     in total, the net cash inflow in 2014 was c96 million, compared to a net cash inflow of c24 million in 2013, an improvement of c72 million.


     a) cash flow from operating activities
     net cash inflow from trading in 2014 increased by c31 million at a constant exchange rate compared to 2013, to c498 million. after net
     other operating receipts and taxation payments of c4 million, the net cash inflow from operating activities increased by c41 million to
     c502 million in 2014. this is explained mainly by:
     • a net increase of c25 million for the fixed link activity (increase of c44 million in receipts and c19 million in operating costs);
     • a net increase of c2 million in europorte’s operating cash flows; and
     • a net operating cash outflow from the myferrylink segment’s activity of c14 million in 2014 compared to the net cash outflow of
        c18 million in 2013.


     b) cash flow from investing activities
     net cash flow from investing activities increased from c48 million in 2013 (restated at 2014 exchange rate) to c77 million in 2014. the net
     cash flow from investing activities in 2014 included:
     • c40 million relating to the fixed link (2013: c35 million) of which c9 million was spent on replacing rail in the tunnel and c8 million on
        the gsm-r project,
     • net payments of c31 million for europorte as part of the acquisition new locomotives in the uk and france to develop the activity.
        this investment of c87 million was financed by sale and lease back transactions totalling c56 million, and
     • net payments of c5 million relating to the group’s investment in eleclink limited.


     c) cash flow from financing activities
     net cash outflow from financing activities in 2014 amounted to c329 million compared to c389 million in 2013. during 2014, it
     comprised mainly:
     • c247 million of interest paid on the term loan and associated hedging transactions (2013 restated: c249 million),
     • c34 million paid in respect of scheduled repayments on the term loan (2013 restated: c47 million),
     • c81 million paid in dividends (2013: c65 million),
     • c22 million received from the drawdown of the loan taken out for the partial refinancing of locomotives purchased by europorte,
     • c3 million received in relation to the exercise of share options,

•   interest received totalling c9 million of which c6 million was in respect of the floating rate notes owned by the group (2013: c8 million
    of which c6 million was in respect of the floating rate notes).



10.3. borrowing conditions and financing structure of
the eurotunnel group

the financing structure of the eurotunnel group is set out in section 22.4 of this registration document.



10.4. restrictions on the use of capital resources

the restrictions resulting from the financial covenants provided in the term loan are described in section 22.4 of this registration
document.




10.5. sources of funds for future investments

significant future investments for the fixed link are expected to be self-funded. acquisition of rolling stock for europorte may be funded
by external loans or sale and leaseback operations.

with a view to financing terminal 2015 works and the purchase of three new shuttles, as described in chapter 5 of this registration
document, the group decided in 2014 to place c23 million in an account for investment expenses called the ‘‘capex reserve’’ which is
referred to in section 22.4.1 of this registration document, bringing the balance of this account to a total of c45 million.




10.6. debt service cover ratios

pursuant to the terms of the term loan, the eurotunnel group is required to meet the following financial covenants:
• at each half-year closure, the debt service cover ratio may not be less than 1.10. for the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated,
   on a rolling 12 month period, on a consolidated basis taking into account (i) as regards the calculation of available cash flow for the
   servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the senior facilities, and (ii) as regards the calculation of debt
   servicing, the eurotunnel group. failure to meet this financial covenant amounts to one of the events of default and accelerated
   payment as described in note u of the consolidated financial statements contained in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration
   document.
• at each six-monthly test date after 31 december 2007, the ratio of operating cash flow to the total synthetic debt service on the term
   loan may not be less than 1.25. for the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated taking into account the hypothetical amortisation
   on the term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test. failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly
   testing date would lead to restrictions on the use of the group’s excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment
   on the term loan until such time as the test is met once again. these restrictions include, in particular, the ability of the eurotunnel
   group to pay dividends and to finance new activities. failure to meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would
   trigger a prepayment event, under which the group’s excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the
   term loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

the debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio for groupe eurotunnel se at 31 december 2014 were 1.76 and 1.58
respectively, and thus the financial covenants for the period were respected.

11.1. research and development
the high traffic volumes in the system have led the eurotunnel group to focus its research and development strategy on the
investigation of materials, designs, tools and systems with the potential to extend the life of rails and of the track in the tunnel and to
improve rolling stock performance. the eurotunnel group has launched a programme of study for the design of a wind deflector that
would combine the functions of the protection provided by the pagodas with energy savings by improving aerodynamics.

moreover, in order to deal with issues specific to it, the eurotunnel group has mobilised its own resources and those of external partners
for the purposes of research and development in order to make further improvements and solve the technical uncertainties and
obstacles associated with operating outside standard criteria. a number of innovative projects were carried out, such as the installation
of catenary infrastructure and automation that allow catenaries to be turned off at the loading platforms without affecting shuttle
operations, the reinforcement of the floors and chassis of truck shuttles and a design study for a new generation of truck shuttles.

the group is also a founding member of the railenium scientific cooperation foundation’s board of directors. railenium is an institute
for technological research in the rail industry, selected within the framework of france’s economic stimulus plan (‘‘le grand emprunt’’). it
is composed of a foundation for scientific cooperation and a test centre. railenium’s mission is to provide a platform for rail
infrastructure research and development, testing, engineering and training. the foundation pools the work of research bodies and
companies to develop research and development programmes in the field of rail infrastructure and systems, which may go as far as
industrial prototyping. the institute’s partners include seven research and training organisations, fifteen industrial companies involved in
construction, services and engineering, and three infrastructure operators (sncf réseau, sncf and the eurotunnel group).



11.2. trademarks, patents and licences

11.2.1 trademarks and domain names

the eurotunnel group’s main trademarks are the nominative, figurative and semi-figurative trademarks that protect the ‘‘eurotunnel’’
name and the design of the logo. the other trademarks used are registered mainly to protect the corporate names of the eurotunnel
group companies, such as ‘‘france manche’’, ‘‘europorte’’ or ‘‘myferrylink’’, and certain brand names, such as ‘‘le shuttle’’.

at the date of this registration document, the eurotunnel group also owns approximately 420 domain names, including
‘‘eurotunnel.com’’.


11.2.2 patents

the eurotunnel group has also filed for patents relating to specific aspects of its business.

at the date of this registration document, three systems, including that relating to the safe stations, are the subject of patents in force
filed by fm. europorte’s patent application for a system for transferring sand to train sandboxes was published in 2013, but as the
system was not used, the patent protection has been abandoned.


11.2.3 licences

the eurotunnel group has no licence granted by a third party allowing it to use a third party’s trademark. it has granted a non-exclusive

     the eurotunnel group has been pursuing a development strategy based on long-term value creation for several years now. this
     strategy, built into various competitiveness improvement plans, is based on the major strengths of the group:
     • a unique expertise as concessionaire of the fixed link, a factor that offers great credibility in front of partners;
     • an continuously improving service offer;
     • an economic model based on solid foundations.

     the economic recovery in the united kingdom accelerates the growth of the trading of goods across the channel. in 2014, the short
     straits market regained its 2008 pre-crisis levels. this refound momentum opens up prospects for shuttle services.

     this momentum shall also be sustained in the medium term through investments that aim to increase the number of truck shuttles and
     the availability of rolling stock and to improve traffic flows.

     the group has the means, through the terminal 2015 project (an investment of c30 million) and the order of three new truck shuttles
     (c40 million), to cope with the expected growth in truck traffic. the projects for the expansion of the coquelles and folkestone terminals
     are progressing in line with the allocated budgets and with the schedule for an opening expected in 2015.

     beyond the short or medium term, the group is preparing for its future and, as part of a collaborative long-term approach, the vision
     2020 project is organising the fixed link’s teams in preparation for 2020. the challenges ahead are grouped into seven themes on
     which seven working groups are working in order to bring innovative solutions to make this ambitious project a success. within the
     context of this collaborative vision 2020 approach, the group has set itself the objective of receiving, by 2020:
     • 2 million trucks, compared with 1.4 million in 2014;
     • 3 million cars, compared with 2.5 million in 2014;
     • 5,000 rail freight trains, compared with 2,900 in 2014;
     • 13.5 million high-speed train passengers, compared with 10.4 million in 2014.

     the eurotunnel group shall focus on strengthening its growth drivers in 2015, while at the same time reaffirming the priorities of safety
     and service quality. the leading private rail freight operator in france and the uk, the europorte segment operates across the entire rail
     transport logistics chain. five years after it was established, the subsidiary of groupe eurotunnel se relies on the quality of its service, its
     reliability and its punctuality, to develop its business at a steady pace. following the decision of the competition appeal tribunal on
     9 january 2015 confirming the decision that prohibited eurotunnel from operating a ferry service out of dover, the group has decided to
     put its maritime business up for sale.

     since the group does not limit its view of success to economic performance, through the introduction of its csr policy taken to the
     highest levels of the business and the introduction of a composite index, the eurotunnel group is committed to the environmental, social
     and societal dimension of its activity. the eurotunnel group’s objective is overall value creation. the performance of its operations is not
     limited to the technical field but can also be seen in terms of security, upholding ethical principles, dialogue with stakeholders,
     environmental added value, social integration and contribution to local development.

     the anticipated evolution of the group’s business, together with the implementation of its investment policy, enables the group to set
     the financial objective of an ebitda of c535 million for 2015 and c580 million for 2016 (based on an exchange rate of £1=c1.3 and
     excluding myferrylink).

     this objective is based on data, assumptions and estimations deemed reasonable. they are nevertheless susceptible to change or
     modification due to uncertainty linked particularly to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment. in addition, the
     occurrence of certain risks described in chapter 4 ‘‘risk factors’’ of this registration document would have an impact on the group’s
     activities and its ability to achieve its objectives. furthermore, achieving the objectives implies the successful implementation of the
     strategy presented in chapter 6 ‘‘description of the eurotunnel group’s activities’’ of this reference document. the eurotunnel group
     does not therefore make any commitments nor does it give any guarantee that the objectives will be met and the forward-looking
     information contained in this chapter cannot be used to make profit forecasts.

15 remuneration and benefits

     15.1. remuneration policy for executive officers

     the remuneration policy for the chairman and chief executive officer and the deputy chief executive officer is decided by the board of
     directors based on the work and recommendations of the nomination and remuneration committee.

     following the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee, the board of directors wanted the remuneration policy
     for the chairman and chief executive officer, as well as the deputy chief executive officer and other executive officers, to be simple, to
     offer continuity over time and to be consistent with the group’s remuneration policy, including for the management. the remuneration for
     executive officers is linked to mid and long term growth, to the intrinsic value of the company and to the share performance. it is set in line
     with the average remuneration per employee, the dividend and the results.

     the board of directors decided that the remuneration policy should encourage long-term performance in all key areas of the business,
     whether they be strategic, workforce-related, social or environmental, and not only financial issues. in line with the european
     recommendation of 30 april 2009, the performance criteria for the executive officers’ variable remuneration have been designed to
     encourage long-term performance.

     following a proposal of the nomination and remuneration committee, the board of directors ensures that the remuneration of the
     executive officers is consistent with the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders, and that the different components of
     the remuneration of the executive officers (fixed and variable remuneration, possible granting of additional retirement benefits and share
     options) are commensurate and in keeping with the principles set out in the afep/medef code.

     in particular, the board of directors strives to adhere to the following guidelines:
     • completeness: all the elements that make up the remuneration of executive officers are reviewed each year: the fixed and variable
         elements and share options or preference shares, benefits in kind, attendance fees and retirement conditions.
     • intelligibility of the rules and balance: the rules are simple, stable, transparent and, where possible, enduring; each element of the
         remuneration is clearly substantiated and is in keeping with the general interest of the business: the variable part intended to reflect
         the actual contribution of the executive officers to the success of the group changes according to criteria representing the results of
         the group as well as the operational targets set for the year.
         at the start of each financial year, the board of directors, on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee,
         defines each of the targets set for the executive officers for the year in question and determines what proportion of the overall variable
         part each of them may obtain. after the close of the financial year, the nomination and remuneration committee evaluates the
         achievement of said targets and, based on that assessment, the board of directors decides the variable part to be awarded to each
         executive officer. the variable remuneration awarded for a given financial year is therefore paid in the following year:
         – the part based on the achievement of targets linked to the group’s intrinsic annual performance is based on financial indicators
             determined according to group objectives;
         – the part based on the achievement of operational targets is based on criteria set taking into account the capacity to achieve
             certain strategic objectives;
         – the share options include internal performance criteria (ebitda target and payment of dividends) and/or, as the case might be,
             external performance criteria to ensure their financial alignment with the long-term interests of the shareholders.
     • measurement: remuneration is determined taking into account the general interests of the business, market practices and the
         performance of the executive officers. therefore, in line with the group’s remuneration policy, the fixed part of the chairman and
         chief executive officer’s remuneration was not revised in 2014. in addition, given that the overall performance of the business
         depends on good management of relations with all the stakeholders, the labour relations performance criterion included in the
         calculation of the chairman and chief executive officer’s remuneration two years ago was strengthened, not in percentage terms,
         but through the introduction of a composite csr index in the business.
     • consistency and benchmarking: in its recommendations to the board of directors, the nomination and remuneration committee
         ensures that the remuneration policy proposed is adapted to each individual’s responsibilities and consistent with the remuneration
         policy for the employees of the group and in line with comparable groups. in order to compare the consistency of the remuneration
         of the chairman and chief executive officer with market practice, the committee carried out its own analyses and to appraise the
         results, also commissioned a specialised consultancy (mercer) to undertake a study of the positioning of the chairman and chief
         executive officer’s remuneration in relation to remuneration paid by other similar groups of companies.

     the remuneration sums shown in this chapter 15 cover all remuneration due or allocated to the executive officers, for all of their terms or
     functions within the group.

15.2. remuneration and benefits paid by get se and its
subsidiaries to executive officers of get se (including
all conditional or deferred remuneration)

15.2.1 remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer

the remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer, jacques gounon, as determined by the board of directors on the
recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee, is composed of:
• a fixed remuneration;
• an annual variable remuneration subject to performance criteria;
• attendance fees;
• benefits in kind;
• a supplementary defined contribution retirement plan;
• a long-term variable remuneration in the form of company share options or preference shares convertible into ordinary shares,
   granted subject to performance criteria.

the chairman and chief executive officer is not entitled to any severance or non-competition payments. he is not eligible to benefit from
the collective schemes for the allocation of free shares that are in place within the group.

the arrangements for jacques gounon’s remuneration, as described above in relation to his position within the eurotunnel group
companies, will remain in place until a subsequent decision is taken by the board of directors of get se, on the recommendation of the
nomination and remuneration committee.

annual fixed remuneration
the fixed part of the gross annual remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer has been fixed at c500,000 since 1 april
2013. it was not amended in 2014, and on 17 march 2015, the board of directors decided, in accordance with the recommendation of
the nomination and remuneration committee, not to modify the fixed part of the chairman and chief executive officer’s remuneration
for 2015.


annual variable remuneration for 2014
the annual variable remuneration is capped at 100% of the fixed part, i.e. c500,000, and is subject to meeting performance criteria.

for 2014, the board of directors approved the proposal made by the nomination and remuneration committee to set the following two
financial criteria, with each representing 25%:
• net result for the year compared to the net result stated in the budget: 25%;
• published target for ebitda in 2014: 25%. in 2014, this second financial criterion replaced the budgeted operating cash flow making
    the target more visible for the sake of consistency and transparency.

the board of directors also defined the following three operational criteria:
• consolidation of long-term growth prospects for the group: 30%;
• innovation: capacity for technological innovation: 10%;
   the achievement of this objective was appraised using different indices, such as the renewal in 2014 of club car carriages
   (television... etc.), the use of new technologies to optimise operational and business processes and launching the gsm-p in the
   north service tunnel in 2014 (public telephony);
• improvement in business performance while complying with social and environmental responsibility: 10%;

the achievement of this objective was appraised using different tangible indices but framed by three quantified indicators, including the
rate of staff turnover, which for 2014, must not exceed 5 and the rate of vocational training, calculated based on the ratio below:

                                                 number of training hours provided
                                                                                        >1
                                                     average headcount  30

the financial data are adjusted for exceptional external factors (such as exchange rate differences) in order to neutralise their impact and
keep genuinely comparable data.

on 2 march 2015, the nomination and remuneration committee examined these criteria.



                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

     the committee examined the quantitative criteria (financial and operational) and quantified the degree to which they had been met. the
     committee found that the ebitda target had been exceeded, but had not reached the 110% band, and therefore remained limited to
     25%, while the net result criterion reached the 120% band. the committee found that the target of consolidation of long-term growth
     prospects for the group and the technical innovation criteria had been achieved. the committee also considered the criterion of quality
     of social dialogue to enhance performance. the committee undertook a qualitative evaluation, which was nonetheless guided by three
     quantified indicators of the quality of social dialogue. the committee found that with a staff turnover rate of 5.2, compared with the
     target of 5, the quality of social dialogue objective had only been two-thirds achieved.

     at its meeting on 17 march 2015, the board of directors considered the performance of the chairman and chief executive officer by
     reference to the performance indicators set out above. taking into account both quantitative and qualitative criteria as set out by the
     board of directors, the results achieved for the variable part of the remuneration would have amounted to c508,333, or 101% of the
     gross annual fixed remuneration. following the recommendations of the nomination and remuneration committee, the board of
     directors fixed the chairman and chief executive officer’s variable remuneration for the year ended 31 december 2014 at c500,000 or
     100% of the target gross annual fixed remuneration, compared with 98% (c490,625) in 2013.

     annual variable remuneration for 2015
     for 2015, the board of directors, following the recommendations of the nomination and remuneration committee, decided to
     encourage the over-performance of the chairman and chief executive officer and to that purpose, after having considered the relative
     competitiveness of the remuneration granted to the chairman and chief executive officer, decided, while maintaining a target bonus of
     100% of the basic annual salary should the targets be met, to increase the maximum to 120% of the annual basic salary in the event of
     over-performance.

     the board of directors decided to maintain two financial criteria, including the net result criterion, which has been applied since 2010 and
     the choice of published ebitda as a target for the chairman and chief executive officer’s remuneration, to ensure consistency and
     transparency of the disclosure. as in previous years, the board of directors decided to retain a proportion of 50% to be based on
     operational criteria, in order to have performance criteria that cover all key business issues.

     financial objectives:
     • consolidated net result for the year compared with the net result estimated in the budget: (25%);
     • ebitda target: c535 million in 2015 at an exchange rate of £1=c1.3 and excluding myferrylink (25%);

     operational objectives:
     • 20%: key strategic investments;
     • 20%: consolidation of the group’s long-term growth prospects;
     • 10%: composite csr index.

     for 2015, the nomination and remuneration committee wished that some work be undertaken on a composite csr index, which
     would be tightened, stable, relevant and balanced. the group instructed an external advisor to carry out a benchmark of the best
     practices of companies within the cac 40 index, and commissioned a qualitative survey with both its internal and external stakeholders.
     this approach identified four themes that are directly related to the group’s business: health/safety, social climate, greenhouse gas
     emissions and client satisfaction. indicators and targets have been determined for each of these items, so as to calculate the level of
     achievement of the composite index, in accordance with the criteria set out for each item.

     the budgetary targets for 2015 were determined according to the group’s budget, as considered by the board of directors. the
     performance levels required to attain these quantitative targets were established accurately and may not be disclosed for confidentiality
     reasons.

     the financial data is adjusted for exceptional external factors in order to neutralise their impact and keep genuinely comparable data.

with regard to quantitative criteria, the variable remuneration of the chairman and chief executive officer is adjusted as follows,
depending on the degree of attainment of the budgetary or financial target concerned:
• 50% of the maximum if 80% of the target is attained;
• 60% of the maximum if 85% of the target is attained;
• 80% of the maximum if 90% of the target is attained;
• 90% of the maximum if 95% of the target is attained;
• 100% of the maximum if 100% of the target is attained;
• 110% of the maximum (exceptional bonus) if 110% of the target is attained;
• 120% of the maximum (exceptional bonus) if 120% of the target is attained.

this scale enables the over-performance of some criteria to be taken into account, without however the total amount exceeding the
maximum set by the board of directors for the variable part of the remuneration.

given the cross-border nature of the functions of the chairman and chief executive officer, the payment of the annual remuneration to
the chairman and chief executive officer is made by get se (50%), esl (30%) and ese (20%).

benefits in kind and attendance fees
for 2014, jacques gounon received an allowance of £540 per month for the use of his personal vehicle, i.e. c8,152 for the year (2013:
£6,480 or c8,888 based on the exchange rate used for the 2013 income statement).

jacques gounon receives attendance fees for his role as a director of get se (see the table in paragraph 15.2.3 below).


supplementary defined contribution pension plan, and death and disability insurance
the chairman and chief executive officer does not have a defined benefit pension plan. the chairman and chief executive officer
benefits, with respect to the french part of his remuneration, from the same supplementary pension plan available to any other senior
manager employed by esgie above the b remuneration bracket. this plan, whose beneficiaries include people other than the group’s
executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. it is a defined contribution plan, which would currently grant the chairman and chief
executive officer an estimated pension of c3,826 per year (non-commutable annuity), assuming he retires at the age of 65.

with respect to the french and british parts of his remuneration, he benefits from basic retirement benefits and supplementary
retirement benefits. in 2014, employee contributions to this supplementary pension scheme totalled c18,605 (2013: c18,230) and
employer contributions totalled c30,142 (2013: c29,538). in 2014, employee contributions to the supplementary pension scheme
totalled c1,502 (2013: c1,481), out of a total of c13,530 for all employees concerned (2013: c12,606), while employer contributions
totalled c6,008 (2013: c5,925), out of a total of c56,971 (2013: c50,424) for all employees concerned.

the chairman and chief executive officer is covered by the staff private death and disability insurance and the personal accident policy
available to employees of get se.


long-term variable benefits
within the framework of partnership governance, where the interests of all partners in the business are taken into account, groupe
eurotunnel se has introduced performance-linked benefits for employees and executive officers, in order to align employees’ and
executive officers’ interests with those of shareholders and to maximise shareholder value.

the first component of the mechanism, designed to combine the development of the business’ non-executive employees, through
collective plans for the free allocation of shares to employees. these are collective plans for the benefit of all employees of groupe
eurotunnel se and of all its french and british subsidiaries, except for executive officers and employees on the executive committee.

the second component aims to promote management performance over the long term, with purchase option plans for shares or for
preference shares convertible into ordinary shares.

pursuant to the authorisation granted by resolution 25 of the combined general meeting of 26 may 2010, on the recommendation of the
nomination and remuneration committee, the board of directors approved the terms of a share option scheme and proceeded to grant
options on 16 july 2010, 21 july 2011 and 20 july 2012.

pursuant to the authorisation granted by resolutions 14 and 15 of the combined general meeting of 29 april 2014, on the
recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee, the board of directors proceeded on 29 april 2014 to grant free
preference shares convertible into ordinary shares.

for each of these grants, the board of directors ensured that the options granted to the chairman and chief executive officer did not
exceed 10% of all options or preference shares granted.

15 remuneration and benefits

     the chairman and chief executive officer formally undertook not to hedge use stock options or preference shares which he receives
     from the company.

     in accordance with article l. 225-185 of the french commercial code, the board of directors decided that jacques gounon, executive
     officer, should keep 50% of the shares resulting from the exercise of options granted under the various plans throughout the term of
     his mandate.

     the chairman and chief executive officer was excluded from the list of employees eligible to benefit from the 2011 and 2012 collective
     free share allocation as authorised by the general meeting of 28 april 2011 and by the general meeting of 29 april 2014.

     in addition to legal requirements, the board of directors resolved, for each of the stock option plans, that the exercise price could not be
     less than:
     • the average share price of the company’s share price on nyse euronext during the 20 last trading days preceding the date on
         which the options to purchase shares are granted;
     • the average of the last three months preceding the date on which the share options are granted;
     • the average of the buyback price for the shares where they are held by the company as of the grant date, in accordance with
         articles l. 225-208 and l. 225-209 of the french commercial code.


     2010 conditional share option scheme
     on 16 july 2010, under the said scheme, the board of directors granted jacques gounon, chairman and chief executive officer,
     116,000 conditional options.

     the exercise price is set at c6.42.

     in its meetings on 21 july 2011 and 20 july 2012, the board of directors noted that the performance criteria for options granted on

     the internal and external performance criteria were as follows:
     • 50% of the options: (i) the decision of the general meeting of shareholders of get se to distribute a dividend, and (ii) the ebitda in
        the consolidated annual financial statements, for the relevant financial year, being at least equal to that in the scheme rules:

            by shareholders at the 2011 general meeting,
        – with respect to 25% of the options, this condition being measured against the 2011 financial statements submitted for approval
            by shareholders at the 2012 general meeting.
     • 50% of the options: get se’s share price performance against the sbf120 share index, such performance being at least equal to
        the performance of the said index, to be measured over a period starting with the opening share price on the grant date (16 july
        2010) and ending 12 months later:
        – with respect to 25% of the options, this condition being measured on the basis of actual share price for the period 16 july 2010
            to 15 july 2011,
        – with respect to 25% of the options, this condition being measured on the basis of actual share price for the period 16 july 2011
            to 15 july 2012.

preference shares 2014
with a view to encouraging the creation of shareholder value, the 2014 plan aims to encourage executive officers and employees of the
group who able to influence the operation of the business through their initiatives, to maximise their contribution to the success of
the group.

the general meeting of 29 april 2014 authorised the creation of a new category of 300 shares, convertible at the end of a period of four
years into a maximum of 1,500,000 ordinary shares (representing 0.27% of the capital) if market performance conditions are met. the
choice of preference shares was made because of their lower allocation cost for the company compared to ordinary shares.

as part of this plan, the board of directors granted on 29 april 2014 to jacques gounon, chairman and chief executive officer,
30 preference shares which may be converted into 150,000 ordinary shares.

preference shares shall be converted into ordinary shares, depending on the evolution of the market price of the get se ordinary
shares, after a period of four years from the grant date of the preference shares by the board of directors of the company (‘‘conversion
date’’), without prior request of the holder.

the average price of the ordinary shares on the grant date or the conversion date has been/will be determined by reference to the
higher value of the given averages, as follows:
• at the average of the 6 (six) months preceding the grant date or conversion date;

     annual variable remuneration for 2014

group’s executive officers, is not a defined benefit plan. it is a defined contribution plan which would currently grant the deputy chief
executive officer an estimated pension of c18,242 per year (non-commutable annuity), assuming he retires at the age of 65.

the deputy chief executive officer benefits from basic retirement benefits and supplementary retirement benefits. in 2014, employee

available to employees of get se.


long-term variable benefits
pursuant to the authorisation granted by resolution 25 of the combined general meeting of 26 may 2010, and on the recommendation of
the nomination and remuneration committee, the board of directors has in the past granted share options, notably in 2012.


2012 share option scheme
pursuant to the said scheme, emmanuel moulin, who was then an employee, received 35,000 options.

the exercise price is set at c6.33.

three of the four performance conditions were met and therefore 75% of the 2012 options were acquired. the board of directors
decided to give him the benefit of these options which had been acquired as an employee.

     2014 preference shares
     the general meeting of 29 april 2014 authorised the creation of a new category of 300 shares, convertible at the end of a period of four
     years to a maximum of 1,500,000 ordinary shares (representing 0.27% of the capital) if market performance conditions are met. the
     choice of preference shares was made because of their lower allocation cost for the company compared to ordinary shares.

     pursuant to this scheme, the board of directors granted on 29 april 2014 30 preference shares convertible into 150,000 ordinary shares
     to emmanuel moulin, deputy chief executive officer.

     preference shares shall be converted into ordinary shares, depending on the evolution of the market price of the get se ordinary
     shares, after a period of four years from the grant date of the preference shares by the board of directors of the company (‘‘conversion
     date’’), without prior request of the holder.

     the average price of the ordinary shares on the grant date or the conversion date has been/will be determined by reference to the
     higher value of the given averages, as follows:
     • at the average of the 6 (six) months preceding the grant date or conversion date;
     • at the average repurchase price of ordinary shares held in treasury by the company at the grant date or the conversion date,
        pursuant to articles l. 225-208 and l. 225-209 of the french commercial code.

     the conversion ratio will be 5,000 ordinary shares per preference share for a target objective 100% met, with a tapering scale
     corresponding to the percentage of the objective met and set such that, the entire amount of ordinary shares may be allocated, where
     applicable.

     the target objective for the market price of ordinary shares of the company on the conversion date, calculated according to the above
     terms is set at c11.50.

     emmanuel moulin, upon leaving get se before the end of the vesting period, will lose his rights to preference shares.

15.2.3 attendance fees

the directors of get se receive attendance fees.

the maximum total amount of attendance fees was set by the combined general meeting of 20 june 2007. the rules governing the
distribution of attendance fees were decided by the board of directors. in principle, they consist of a fixed part and a variable part, in
proportion to the director’s attendance at board meetings and committee meetings. the committee chairmen receive an additional fixed
fee. fixed and variable fees are paid monthly.

the amount and breakdown of attendance fees were reviewed by the board of directors in 2014, following the recommendation of the
nomination and remuneration committee. consequently, in accordance with article 21 of the afep/medef code, this remuneration,
which already took into account the actual attendance of directors at board and committee meetings, will henceforth predominantly
be variable.

get se directors’ attendance fees* in 2014 totalled c623,775 (2013: c540,750) as detailed in the table below:

15.5. other remuneration policy considerations
remuneration of the members of the executive committee
as stated in chapter 17 of this registration document, the eurotunnel group’s remuneration policy is based on fair and transparent
remuneration to ensure perfect consistency between individual goals and business objectives. the group’s strategy is also to share its
success with its employees in order to involve them in the group’s growth. the group’s remuneration policy aims to promote the
achievement of economic, social and market performance, enhance the growth of skills, meet and outperform objectives and increase
the commitment of employees and officers in the long term, while strengthening employee ownership.

the members of the nomination and remuneration committee ensure consistency between the policy applied to executive officers and
the policy applied to the senior managers of the group. the members of the nomination and remuneration committee also examine
the alignment of the managers’ remuneration principles.

the remuneration of the chief operating officers, which is decided by the general management, is made up of fixed annual
remuneration supplemented by an incentivising variable part, the criteria for which are largely based on the group’s economic
performance, as with the variable remuneration of the chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officer. the variable financial
part is accompanied by qualitative criteria to assess individual performance.

the members of the executive committee also receive remuneration made up of a fixed part, the amount of which is proportional to
each one’s responsibilities, supplemented by a variable part whose quantitative criteria depend on the group’s results in order to
improve the sense of solidarity.

the introduction below, sections 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6, 16.9, 16.10, and 16.11, the elements likely to have an impact in the
event of a public offer listed under item 25 of the cross-reference table in appendix iii of this registration document, together constitute
the report of the chairman of the board of directors of get se pursuant to article l. 225-37 of the french commercial code. the
chairman and chief executive officer instructed the company secretary to compile the content of this report, which was prepared by
including contributions from several departments, including the finance department, the financial control department, the internal audit
department, and the legal department. this report was sent to the statutory auditors, and submitted to the general management which
considers it to be consistent with the systems in place within the group. on the recommendation of the audit committee, the board of
directors approved it on 17 march 2015.

the policy and rules agreed upon by the board of directors to determine the remuneration and all benefits granted to the executive
officers are set out in chapter 15 of this registration document.

on 17 march 2015, in accordance with article l. 225-37 of the french commercial code, the chairman of the board of directors drew
up a report covering the following matters:
• the composition of the board of directors and the terms for the preparation and organisation of its work;
• the principles and rules established by the nomination and remuneration committee and the board of directors to determine the
   remuneration and benefits of any kind granted to corporate officers;
• the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by get se;
• the limitations, if any, to the powers of the chief executive officer;
• the corporate governance code to which get se refers; and
• the specific arrangements relating to the participation of shareholders in general meetings.

the corporate governance code to which get se refers is the code for listed companies established by the association française des
entreprises privées (afep) and the mouvement des entreprises de france (medef) (the afep/medef code).

the eurotunnel group adapts its corporate governance to the specific needs of the business in a bid to ensure continual progress. in its
governance structure, get se has adopted the combined system which consists of the appointment of one person to serve as both
chairman and chief executive officer. the continued combination of the roles of chairman and of chief executive officer is justified to
ensure a more efficient and reactive management, linked to the specific history of the business and in difficult regulatory, competitive and
market environments. this continued combination of roles is in accordance with the good governance rules to which get se has
always adhered.

indeed, the binational nature of the business was reflected early on by the implementation of exacting governance standards within the
group which enable the preservation of the interests of all shareholders as well as a balance of power within the governance structures:
• the size of the board of directors (11 members) allows for real debate to take place and for clear and rapid decision-making,
   particularly as board members are committed to their role, are independently minded and bring to the business a wide range of skills;
   in the 2014 self-evaluation of the board, the directors confirmed their satisfaction as to quality of the discussions, conduct of
   business by the chairman, freedom of expression and time reserved for discussion;
• the board of directors is very active (10 meetings in 2014);
• the majority of board members are independent (82%);
• five board committees have been set up and each is very active: in 2014, more than 18 committee meetings took place, making a
   total of 28 meetings including full board meetings;
• some of the committees, including the audit committee and the nomination and remuneration committee, are exclusively
   composed of independent board members;
• so as to promote best ethical and governance practices within the group, the board of directors set up an ethics and governance
   committee in 2013, the terms of reference for which can be found at paragraph 16.2.3 of this registration document;
• the board of directors appointed colette neuville as a senior independent director in 2014. she is responsible for monitoring and
   managing any potential conflict of interest situations that may arise for the executive management and other board members, for
   suggesting to the chairman of the board additional agenda items for meetings of the board of directors, as required, for ensuring that
   good governance takes place within the board of directors and committees, and for managing each year the evaluation of the board
   of directors on the basis of an anonymous detailed questionnaire on the roles and competence of the board, its functioning as a
   whole and the areas dealt with by the board and its committees.

board members and the executive management have built a strong tradition of transparency and dialogue. the governance structure
and the matter of the dissociation of roles are the subject of a specific item in the board self-evaluation questionnaire. for 2014, the
current combined role (chairman and chief executive officer in one person) was also strongly supported.

the 2014 results illustrate the soundness of the strategies adopted and the quality of the teams implementing them.

16 board and management practices

     16.1. general management

     16.1.1 chief executive officer and deputy chief executive officers

     the general management of get se is carried out by the chairman of the board of directors without change in the governance
     structure, with an organisation including a board of directors in which the roles of chairman and chief executive officer are combined.

     as indicated in the introduction above, the rationale for continuing to combine these roles is principally to ensure a more effective and
     responsive form of management, related to the particular history of the company and in a context of a challenging economic situation
     and an uncertain regulatory, competitive and market environment.

     the board of directors sets the term of office of the chief executive officer, which may not exceed his term of office as chairman.

     the chief executive officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of get se. the chief executive
     officer exercises his powers within the scope of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers expressly conferred by law on
     shareholders and on the board of directors, as well as the limitations imposed by the internal rules described in section 16.5 of this
     registration document.

     the chief executive officer represents get se in its relations with third parties. get se is bound by decisions of the chief executive
     officer that do not fall within its corporate purpose, unless it can prove that the third party knew or should have known in the
     circumstances, that the decision exceeded such purpose. however, the publication of the company’s by-laws does not alone constitute
     such proof. provisions of the by-laws and decisions of the board of directors limiting the powers of the chief executive officer are not
     binding on third parties.

     the deputy chief executive officer is tasked with supporting the chief executive officer. with regards to third parties, the deputy chief
     executive officer represents the company in the same manner as the chief executive officer; pursuant to article l. 225-56.ii-2 of the
     french commercial code, he has the same powers as the chief executive officer. the maximum number of deputy chief executive
     officers is three.

     emmanuel moulin will serve as deputy chief executive officer of the eurotunnel group until 31 march 2015, the date on which his term
     will terminate. after this date, the supervision and support functions within general management, in place since 1 january 2014, will
     return to the following:
     • jacques gounon, chairman and chief executive officer, will keep responsibility for the supervision of strategy, communications,
          safety and ethics, public affairs, internal audit, shareholder and investor relations, investment policy and of the secretariat to the
          board of directors.
     • the two chief operating officers, michel boudoussier – chief operating officer, concession – and pascal sainson – chief
          operating officer, europorte – will continue to manage their current respective businesses under the supervision of the chairman
          and chief executive officer. the activities previously under the supervision of the deputy chief executive officer such as the group
          finance directorate, legal services, the business services department, the treasury and the group human resources department will
          return to be under the supervision of the chairman and chief executive officer.

     where the chief executive officer ceases or is prevented from carrying out his duties, in the absence of a decision to the contrary by the
     board of directors, the deputy chief executive officers continue to carry out their duties and fulfil their role until the appointment of a new
     chief executive officer.

     no person may be appointed as chief executive officer or deputy chief executive officer if they are aged 65 or over. on reaching the
     age of 65, any chief executive officer or deputy chief executive officer in office is deemed to have resigned.

     the board of directors can terminate the appointment of the chief executive officer at any time. the board of directors can also
     terminate the appointment of the deputy chief executive officer, on the recommendation of the chief executive officer.

16.1.2 executive committee

get se has an executive committee composed of the persons named in section 14.3 above. the executive committee is chaired by
the chairman and chief executive officer. the committee meets to monitor the group’s performance and results and, if necessary, to
adjust the group’s strategy. the executive committee coordinates the operation of the group and ensures the proper functioning of the
group as a whole.




16.2. conditions applicable to the preparation and
organisation of the work of the board of directors

16.2.1 composition and organisation of the board of directors

a) members of the board of directors
at the date of this registration document, the board of directors of get se has eleven members, of whom nine are independent
(representing 82% of board members in office). the board of directors has four women board members, being more than 36% of the
board, in accordance with the french law of 27 january 2011 on the balanced representation of women and men on boards.

the proportion of non-french board members is 36%. the average age of board members is 66.

the complementary expertise and experience of the board members is an advantage for the group. board members bring to the
company a complementary range of experience and industrial, managerial, financial and scientific skills and a diversity of backgrounds
with a mix of men/women, ages and nationalities.

board members are appointed, re-appointed or removed by the general meeting of shareholders. the nomination committee assesses
the composition and size of the board, oversees the assessment process for candidates for the position of member of the board,
determines whether such candidates are qualified to become board members, in accordance with the criteria set out by the board and
makes recommendation to the board of directors with regards to candidates.

the composition of the board of directors aims to balance experience, ability and independence whilst respecting the parity and
diversity which reflect the bi-national nature of the business. good synergy within the board depends on the diversity (in terms of
nationality, ability, etc.), equality and complementarity of its members. the board of directors, as a whole, must also adequately reflect
the communities within which eurotunnel group carries on its business (public/private, transport business, rail infrastructure, cross-
channel market, franco-british business, a history of crises).

it is expected that board members should have the following essential qualities:
• to be mindful of the interests of the company;
• to be a good judge, in particular of situations, strategies and persons, based amongst other things on their experience;
• to be able to anticipate so as to identify risks and strategic issues;
• to have integrity, be present, active and involved.

the following qualifications or attributes are taken into account in the selection of board members: management and/or board
experience, comprehensive and multi-disciplinary experience, integrity and professionalism, the personal qualities required to contribute
actively to the discussions of the board of directors.

for the entire duration of their term of office, each board member must own a number of shares which, the general meeting of
shareholders of 29 april 2015 is asked to increase from 1,000 shares to 5,000 shares, to be purchased over a three-year period,
reaching the following minimum number each year:
• year 1: 2,000 shares
• year 2: 3,000 shares
• year 3: 5,000 shares

if, at the time of their appointment, board members do not own at least 2,000 shares or if, during their term of office, they cease to own
the minimum number of shares, they are deemed to have resigned unless the situation is remedied within the appropriate time.




                                                                             2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                             91

16 board and management practices

     if there are one or more vacancies on the board, the board of directors may, between two general meetings, make interim appointments
     in accordance with the provisions of article l. 225-24 of the french commercial code. the term of office of board members appointed
     in place of another is the remainder of the term of office of their predecessor. to ensure the continuity, coherence and quality of the board
     of director’s work, and in accordance with recommendation 13 of the afep/medef code relating to training of new directors, get se
     offers new board members an induction period designed to facilitate their integration: on-site visits to facilitate an understanding of the
     company’s business, a briefing on economic/financial data, the group’s key constitutional documents and the option to attend external
     training, including with ifa (french institute of directors).

     the term of office of board members is four years. the appointment terminates at the end of the ordinary general meeting called to
     approve the financial statements of the preceding financial year and held during the year in which their term of office expires. the
     appointment of half of the board of directors is renewed in a staggered manner every two years, so that, each time, renewal covers part
     of the members of the board of directors in accordance with article 12 of the afep/medef code.

     all outgoing members are eligible for re-election. notwithstanding the above stipulations, the number of people aged 75 or over serving
     on the board of directors as individuals or as permanent representatives of legal entities may not exceed one third (rounded up to the
     nearest whole number, if applicable) of the number of board members serving at the end of each general meeting called to approve the
     separate financial statements. if this limit is exceeded, the oldest board member is automatically deemed to have resigned.


     b) chairman of the board of directors
     the board of directors appoints one of its members as chairman for a period identical to their term of office as board member, unless the
     board of directors sets a shorter term. the chairman must be an individual.

     the chairman of the board of directors represents the board of directors. he directs and organises the work of the board of directors
     and reports on this to the general meeting. he ensures the proper functioning of get se and, in particular, that members of the board of
     directors are able to discharge their duties.

     the age limit for the position of chairman of the board of directors is 70. the term of office of the chairman expires on the date of the
     ordinary general meeting called to approve the financial statements of the financial year during which the serving chairman reaches the
     age limit. however, the board of directors may extend or renew the term of office of the chairman for additional one-year periods, up to
     five times.

     should the chairman be temporarily unable to carry out his duties or in the event of his death, the board of directors may appoint a board
     member to serve in his place. where the impediment is temporary, the appointment is for a limited period, which may be renewed. in the
     event of the incumbent’s death, the appointment is effective until a new chairman is appointed. the nomination and remuneration
     committee decided to consider and monitor the preparation of a succession plan to replace executive officers in the event of a
     sudden vacancy.


     c) meetings of the board of directors
     the board of directors meets as frequently as the interests of the company require and at least three times each year. meetings are called
     by the chairman or by the board member designated to act in the chairman’s place and are held at the registered office or at any other
     place specified by the person who calls the meeting. however, if the board of directors has not met for more than two months, board
     members representing at least one third of the members of the board of directors and, if applicable, the chief executive officer, may
     request that the chairman call a meeting on a specific agenda.

     meetings of the board of directors are conducted in french with an unofficial translation in english. documents provided to members for
     meetings of the board, as well as minutes of the meeting, are prepared in french with an unofficial translation in english.


     d) quorum
     the presence of at least one half of the serving members is required for a meeting of the board of directors to proceed to business. the
     internal rules of the board of directors provide that members are deemed to be present within the scope of article l. 225-37 of the
     french commercial code, for the purpose of calculating the quorum and majority, when they participate by videoconference or other
     means of telecommunication that enable them to be identified and to participate in the meeting in accordance with governing laws and
     regulations. this provision does not apply for the approval of decisions referred to in articles l. 232-1 and l. 233-16 of the french
     commercial code.


     e) majority rules
     decisions are taken by a majority of members present or represented, with the chairman casting the deciding vote in the event of a
     tied vote.

f) powers
the board of directors determines get se’s business objectives and, as indicated in section 16.5, oversees their implementation.
subject to the powers expressly granted to shareholders in general meetings and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the board of
directors may consider any matter affecting the proper functioning of get se and takes decisions in this respect in the interest of all
shareholders.

in its relations with third parties, get se is bound by decisions of the board of directors that do not fall within its corporate purpose,
unless it can prove that the third party knew or should have known in the circumstances that the decision exceeded the corporate
purpose. however, the publication of the by-laws does not alone constitute such proof.

the board of directors may carry out such controls and checks as it deems appropriate. each board member receives all information
and documents needed to perform their duties in accordance with the conditions set out in the internal rules of the board of directors,
particularly as regards confidentiality.

the board of directors may decide to establish committees for the purpose of considering issues that the board or its chairman may
submit for their review. the board of directors determines the composition and terms of reference of the said committees, which
conduct their business under the responsibility of the board of directors. the board of directors also determines the remuneration of the
committee members, if any.

the board of directors decides or authorises the issue of debt securities pursuant to article l. 228-40 of the french commercial code,
unless the general meeting resolves to exercise this power.


g) board members’ rights, information and ethics (charter of ethics, internal rules, code of conduct)
since the origin, the eurotunnel group has developed on strong values that ensure cohesion, its future and its development. the board
of directors is committed to promoting those values, as well as the best governance and ethical practices within the group. the ethics
and corporate governance committee of the board ensures that the ethical culture and principles applicable to its management and its
entire staff, are communicated within the business.

the group has put in place a group ethics charter which extends the ethics policy already in place within the concession to all entities
which have joined the group. in accordance with the united nations global compact, the group ethics charter describes the
fundamental values which must be endorsed by each employee, whatever the circumstances or the country, by reference to the oecd
guidelines for companies. the company secretarial department monitors market laws and regulations, as well as best practice with
regards to corporate governance, and ensures they are considered in order to be implemented in the internal rules and procedures. this
has been reinforced since 2013 following the appointment of an ethics and safety director, who sits on the executive committee.

the director’s charter sets out the rights and obligations of each board member, in particular with regards to conflicts of interests. each
board member undertakes to abide by this charter and carry out their duties with independence, integrity, loyalty and professionalism.
as indicated below, the senior independent director ensures that the board and its committees abide by governance practices and is
responsible for handling any conflict of interests of executive officers and other board members: ‘‘directors undertake, in any
circumstances, to maintain their independence of analysis, judgement, decision and action and to reject any direct or indirect pressure
on them from other directors, groups of shareholders, suppliers, and more generally, any third party. in particular, directors must avoid
plurality of functions within companies, which directly or indirectly compete with the company, such plurality being likely to affect the
interest of the company, or its governance. directors undertake not to seek or accept from the company of the subsidiaries thereof, any
advantages likely to affect their independence.’’ a code of good conduct concerning securities transactions was put in place by the
board of directors several years ago so as to avoid any insider trading issues. the first part of the code of good conduct sets out the
essential ethical principles that apply and the second part sets out the applicable preventive measures.

the board of directors has adopted a set of internal rules to complement the laws, regulations and by-laws in place, specifying the role
and functional practices of the board of directors and its committees, with particular attention given to the principles of the
afep/medef code.

the internal rules make specific provision concerning the composition of the board of directors and the independence criteria applied to
its members, the duties and powers of the board, information provided to members and the internal rules of each of its committees. the
internal rules are regularly reviewed and supplemented or amended as necessary.

the main provisions of these internal rules are described below.




                                                                             2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

16 board and management practices

     role of the board of directors
     as part of its administrative responsibilities, and in compliance with governing laws and the by-laws of get se, the board of directors:
     • appoints or removes the chairman and chief executive officer and decides whether the chairman and chief executive officer’s roles

•   all materials provided at meetings of the board of directors and all information obtained during or outside such meetings of the board
    of directors are strictly confidential without exception, irrespective of whether such materials or information were presented as
    confidential. board members must consider themselves bound to secrecy beyond a mere obligation of discretion.
•   in addition to this obligation of confidentiality, board members undertake not to make public statements in their capacity as members
    of the board of directors on any matter pertaining to eurotunnel group, whether or not related to meetings of the board of directors,
    without the prior consent of the chairman.
•   every board member must comply with all market regulations intended to prevent market abuse that would be harmful to the
    interests and image of eurotunnel group.


board proceedings, videoconferencing or teleconferencing
each year the annual report includes a section on the activities and operation of the board of directors and its committees during the
previous year.

the internal rules of the board of directors indicate that board members may participate in meetings by all means authorised by law and
the by-laws, including videoconferencing or teleconferencing as long as such videoconferencing or teleconferencing facilities (i) enable
the transmission of at least the voices of the participants and (ii) satisfy technical requirements enabling the continuous and
simultaneous transmission of the proceedings.

board members’ information
the chairman or the chief executive officer gives each board member the documents and information needed to carry out their duties,
subject to the confidentiality obligations described in the internal rules.

committees
the board of directors may establish temporary or permanent special committees, each consisting of at least three and no more than
five members appointed by the board of directors, with one committee member designated by the board of directors as the committee
chairman.

the board of directors has established an audit committee, a nomination and remuneration committee, a safety and security
committee, a strategy and sustainable development committee and an ethics and corporate governance committee, as described in
section 16.2.3 of this registration document.

independent board members
at least half of the board members must be independent within the scope of and in accordance with the criteria of the afep/medef code.

the criteria for board members to be reviewed as independent are the following:
• not to be an employee or executive director of get se or an employee or director of its parent or a company that the latter
   consolidates, and not having been in such a position for the previous five years;
• not to be an executive director of a company in which get se holds, either directly or indirectly, a directorship or in which an
   employee appointed as such or an executive director of get se (currently in office or having held such office for less than five years)
   is a director;
• not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker or commercial banker:
   – that is material to get se or the group,
   – or for whom get se or the group represent a significant part of their business.
   the evaluation of how significant the relationship is with get se or the group must be debated by the board of directors.
• not to be related by close family ties to an executive director;
• not to have been an auditor of the corporation within the previous five years;
• not to have been a director of the corporation for more than twelve years.

board members representing substantial shareholders of the company may be considered independent so long as such shareholders
do not participate in the control of the company. however, where the interest of the shareholder in question exceeds 10% of the share
capital or voting rights, the board of directors must consider the matter of the board member’s independence, on the basis of a report
from the nomination committee, taking into account the structure of the capital of the company and the existence of potential conflicts
of interest.

the board of directors is required to verify at least once a year that board members satisfy the independence criteria set out above. after
consideration of their individual position by the nomination committee, the board of directors resolved on 17 march 2015 that the
following board members met the independence criteria set out in the afep/medef code: colette neuville, patricia hewitt, perrette rey,

16 board and management practices

     peter levene, colette lewiner, robert rochefort, philippe vasseur, tim yeo and, since 31 may 2014, jean-pierre trotignon, whose term
     of office as deputy chief executive officer of eurotunnel group ended over five years ago, on 31 may 2009.

     jacques gounon, chairman and chief executive officer, and philippe camu, a representative of gs global infrastructure partners, the
     company’s main shareholder, are not considered to be independent board members.

     to consider the extent to which a business relationship is or is not significant, the board of directors referred to a table summarising fund
     flows (purchases and sales) occurring during the financial year elapsed, between:
     • group companies on one hand, and
     • group companies of which independent board members of the company are also a board member.

     these flows are considered in relation to the total weight of purchases and sales, for each group, to measure their significance. for
     2014, this table reveals that the sum of sales of the company’s group, to any one of the groups concerned, or of its purchases from any
     one of those groups, does not exceed 0.7% of the total sales or purchases of the company’s group or of any one of the groups
     concerned, with the exception of two suppliers for which tendering rules and procedures protect equality of treatment of the suppliers
     and accordingly, the independence of the directors.

     therefore, as at 17 march 2015, there are nine independent board members out of a total of eleven (representing 82% of the board
     members in office). more than half of the board members are independent in accordance with the provisions of the afep/medef code.

     the table set out below indicates the situation of each board member in relation to the independence criteria referred to in the
     afep/medef corporate governance code:

the high participation rate of board members throughout the year should be noted. this frequency and rate of participation are the first
objective factor which, during 2014, ensured that the board of directors was in a position to fulfil its role and take the decisions
appropriate to the development of get se.

in 2014, in addition to financial and legal authorisations, the board of directors concentrated mainly on issues of strategy, accounts and
corporate governance.

at each of its meetings, the board of directors discussed business development and performance in terms of the group’s activities and
results and took note of the company’s stock market performance and its market capitalisation.

during 2014, the board of directors finalised the financial statements as at 31 december 2013 and prepared the half-yearly financial
statements as at 30 june 2014. in these presentations as well as in the monthly board report, the board is kept informed of the financial
situation and the treasury situation.

it also considered the overall budget for 2015 and monitored the progress of the europorte subsidiaries and of the maritime segment.
the board also carried out a review of the risk map for the group, as well as the activity of the internal audit function. the board of
directors also made preparations for the combined general meeting and, in particular, drew up the draft resolutions. the board decided
to renew the share buyback programme.

regarding corporate governance, during the 2014 financial year, the board of directors carried out its self-evaluation and approved the
chairman’s report on internal control procedures for 2013. the board of directors determined the chairman and chief executive’s
variable remuneration for 2013, on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee, and set the quantitative and
operational targets that would determine the variable portion of his remuneration for 2014.

the board of directors followed the developments in the procedure started by the uk competition commission regarding the
acquisition of three ships owned by the now defunct maritime operator, seafrance, as well as the procedure started by eurostar with
respect to charges set out in the 2014 network statement for the use of the tunnel. the board also considered the contribution of

     addressed to france and the united kingdom on 21 june 2013.

     the board of directors had the opportunity, in a strategy seminar, to conduct a detailed strategic analysis of the group in its competitive
     environment and performed a review of the strategic plan and its implementation.

     the board of directors has been following developments in the plan to run two high-voltage dc cables through the tunnel. the board of
     directors also monitored the company’s safety and security policy during the year.

     from the beginning of the year until 17 march 2015, the date on which the board of directors signed the financial statements for the year
     ended 31 december 2014, the board of directors held three meetings. the average attendance rate was 100%. these meetings

     chairman and chief executive officer for the 2014 financial year and the criteria for the variable part of the remuneration of the chairman
     and chief executive officer for 2015. the board of directors expressed its views concerning the information conveyed to shareholders in
     this registration document, so that shareholders are fully able to evaluate the company’s management, its board and its strategy.
     further to the decision of the competition appeal tribunal on 9 january 2015 which rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group
     and scop seafrance, the board of directors decided to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three ferries. the board of directors, upon
     proposal from the audit committee, drew up a procedure concerning the identification of regulated agreements, as updated in
     accordance with the provisions of order no 2014-863 of 31 july 2014 which purports to simplify and improve transparency measures
     concerning regulated agreements.

     the board of directors delegates to the special committees the task of preparing and submitting information on specific topics for the
     board’s approval. five committees investigate matters that fall within their field of responsibility, and submit their opinions and
     recommendations to the board of directors, namely: the audit committee, the nomination and remuneration committee, the safety
     and security committee, the strategy and sustainable development committee and the ethics and corporate governance committee,
     whose terms of reference are governed by the internal rules of the board of directors and its committees. each committee has
     a chairman.

     the audit committee is composed of three members chosen from among the board members other than the chairman of the board of
     directors, including at least two from among the independent board members in accordance with article 16.1 of the afep/medef code.
     the board of directors appoints one of the members as chairman of the audit committee. at least one member of the audit committee
     must have ‘‘specific expertise in finance or accounting matters’’ and be ‘‘independent’’ and the other members of the audit committee
     must have minimum expertise in financial and accounting matters if they are not experts in the matter.

     the audit committee is composed of robert rochefort (chairman), colette lewiner and colette neuville. two thirds of the committee

     members. get se complies with the provision of the afep/medef code relating to the presence of two thirds of independent
     board members.

     the chairman of the committee, with regard to his professional experience (former chief executive of credoc, the french research
     centre for the study and observation of living conditions, chairman of get se audit committee since 2007, member of several
     committees and boards including the scientific council of statistics, manager of the statistics department of the national health
     insurance fund), his academic training (a post-graduate degree in economics and a masters degree in mathematics) and his specific
     knowledge which is useful for the work performed by the committee, has specific expertise in finance and accounting matters.

the duties of the audit committee are to:
• monitor the process of preparation of the financial and accounting information; before presentation to the board of directors, the
   audit committee examines the consolidated and parent company financial statements, together with budgets and forecasts; it
   reviews the accounting and financial information, particularly the financial statements, checking that important events or complex
   transactions have been properly accounted for (significant acquisitions or disposals, restructuring, hedging transactions, the
   existence of special purpose vehicles, significant provisions, etc.) which have had an impact on the company’s financial statements;
   it also monitors financial information.
• the audit committee is informed of the architecture of all systems for establishing accounting and financial information; when
   financial information is taken from an accounting process, it must be coherent with the accounting information that is produced; if it is
   not taken from an accounting process, the audit committee must make sure that the information comes from a process that is
   sufficiently structured and organised to be able to judge the quality and reliability of this information (non-standardised performance
   indicators, restructuring plan, etc.).
• ensure the statutory audit of the financial statements by the statutory auditors. the audit committee holds discussions with the
   statutory auditors and examines their conclusions, to learn the main areas of risk or uncertainty concerning the annual or
   consolidated financial statements. the audit committee examines the main factors having an impact on the audit approach (scope
   of consolidation, acquisition and disposal transactions, accounting options, new standards applied, large transactions, etc.) and
   significant risks relating to the preparation and processing of the financial and accounting information identified by the statutory
   auditors.
• monitor the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems: the audit committee checks the existence of internal
   control and risk management systems, and that they are made use of, and makes sure that the weaknesses identified are dealt with
   by corrective action. this applies to risks already accounted for and those identified by the internal control and risk management
   systems and which could have an impact on the accounts; for this assignment, the audit committee may examine the results of the
   work of internal and/or external audits performed on these subjects. the audit committee is not involved in the implementation of
   the said systems, nor the corrective actions, which are the responsibility of general management.
• ensure that the independence of the statutory auditors is monitored: the committee is in charge of controlling the selection and
   re-appointment of the statutory auditors, where appropriate using a call-for-tenders procedure, of issuing an opinion on the amount
   of fees requested by them, and issuing a recommendation on the statutory auditors proposed for appointment by the general
   meeting.

the audit committee met six times in 2014; the average attendance rate of board members per meeting was 100%.

      directors. the chairman and chief executive officer of get se is a member of the committee. the strategy and sustainable
      development committee meets at least once every six months, and is convened by its chairman. depending on the agenda, the

      governance committee, to perform the following specific tasks:
      • to develop and recommend to the board of directors corporate governance principles applicable to the company and monitor their
          subsequent implementation;
      • to ensure ethical conduct and discuss any related matters that the board of directors (or its chairman) submits for examination.

      the ethics and corporate governance committee ensure that the ethic culture and the governance principles applicable to all the
      employees and the executive officers are circulated within the group.

      the ethics and corporate governance committee comprises all the committee chairmen. this committee is chaired by the chairman
      and chief executive officer of get se who calls meetings of the committee. depending on the agenda, the committee may invite
      persons who deal with issues relating to ethics and corporate governance and representatives from the various operational departments
      of get se, the group or its subsidiaries.

      this committee comprises five board members who each chair a board committee so that the predominantly ethical principles adopted
      by the ethics and corporate governance committee may inform the work of each of the other committees. the committee members
      are: jacques gounon (chair), colette neuville, robert rochefort, tim yeo and jean-pierre trotignon. it met on 14 november 2014 with
      an attendance rate of 100%. in particular, it carried out a review of the 2014 general meetings of sbf120 companies, considered the
      comments and observations received from investors before the general meeting of 29 april 2014, analysed the annual report of the amf
      on governance and executive remuneration, examined the report of the high committee on corporate governance and agreed upon
      the actions and direction to be taken by the various committees of the board of directors for 2014/2015. the ethics and corporate
      governance committee reviewed the update of the securities code of behaviour.

      between the beginning of the year and 17 march 2015, the committee met once on 16 january 2015, with an attendance rate of 100%.
      during that meeting, the committee specifically reviewed the draft update of the by-laws and the analysis of the revised guide for
      application of the afep/medef code. the committee also considered the update of the internal rules applicable to the board of directors.

16.3. board of directors self-evaluation

evaluation of the board of directors is carried out each year in accordance with article 10 of the afep/medef code in a process overseen
by the senior independent director. the evaluation is based on a detailed anonymous questionnaire addressing the roles and powers of
the board of directors, the board’s functioning as a whole and the individual areas of activity of the board and its committees. using a
questionnaire makes the evaluation process more objective and, as a result, the assessments made by the board members may be
weighted. the summary report prepared by the senior independent director forms the basis of the board discussion which take place
each year.

this questionnaire was reviewed by the senior independent director in 2014. the questionnaire has been simplified and completed
compared to the previous years. 53 questions relate to the board of directors per se on five items (identical to those of the previous year,
so as to enable a compare of the results).

the questionnaire comprises 74 questions around six main themes:
• composition of the board and term of office;
• meetings of the board of directors (organisation of meetings, directors’ access to information, content and quality of debates,
   relations with committees, director training, minutes);
• internal rules;
• attendance fees;
• quality of the assessment;
• role and performance of specialised committees.

11 questions relate to the committees (common items and specific items).

all members of the board of directors (other than the chairman and chief executive officer), namely ten board members, responded.
they were invited to give a score of 1 to 5 with:
• 1 corresponding to ‘‘yes’’;
• 2, ‘‘mostly yes’’;
• 3, ‘‘unsure’’;
• 4, ‘‘mostly no’’;
• 5, ‘‘no’’.

the senior independent director presented an analysis of the findings to the board of directors at its meeting on 13 february 2015.

the average score for all answers is 1.5. the overall opinion of board members on the board and its workings is largely positive. the
directors confirmed their satisfaction on the quality of the relations between the board members, the quality of discussions, the
information provided, as well as the number of committees, their membership, the number of meetings and the attendance of the
members. with an average score of 1.5, the effective contribution of each board member to the functioning of the board (skills and
involvement) was considered extremely satisfactory. the current governance structure (with a combined role of chairman and chief
executive officer) was also broadly supported (1.6).

the board of directors discussed the manner in which it operates in a collegiate pooling of impartial views, and considered pragmatic
ways to improve and how these might be put into practice through specific actions, including, inter alia, practical proposals to improve
communication of the agendas of the committees and the information resulting from the work of the committees.

      16.4. principles and rules relating to the
      determination of remuneration and all benefits of
      any kind granted to corporate officers

      principles and rules relating to the determination of remuneration and all benefits of any kind to which corporate officers are entitled are
      determined by the board of directors on the recommendation of the nomination and remuneration committee in accordance with the
      board’s internal rules. these are set out in chapter 15 of this registration document.




      16.5. limitations on the powers of the chief executive
      officer

      the chief executive officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances in the name of get se. the chief executive
      officer exercises his powers within the scope of the corporate purpose and subject to the powers conferred by law expressly on general
      meetings of shareholders and the board of directors. he represents get se in its relations with third parties.

      neither the provisions of the by-laws of the company nor any decisions of the board of directors limiting the powers of the chief
      executive officer can be enforced against third parties.

      pursuant to article 1 of the internal rules of the board of directors, major strategic transactions involving the acquisition or disposal of
      equity investments and assets, partnership agreements, joint ventures or cooperation agreements relating to research, development,
      industrial or commercial matters and more generally any transaction or undertaking that could have a significant impact on the financial
      or operating situation of the group come within the remit of the board of directors. article 1 of the internal rules also states that:
      • any significant transaction outside the approved business strategy is subject to prior approval by the board of directors;
      • these rules apply not only to external acquisition or disposal transactions but also to any significant investments in organic growth or
          any internal restructuring transaction.




      16.6. service contracts between members of the board
      of directors and general management and get se

      to the knowledge of get se, there are no service contracts between corporate officers and get se that provide for the granting of any
      particular benefits under the terms of such contracts.

      get se has made no undertakings for the benefit of jacques gounon.

      jacques gounon is the group’s chairman and chief executive officer and, due to the binational nature of the concession, receives part
      of his remuneration from eurotunnel services limited, as indicated in chapter 15 of this registration document. by virtue of english law,
      which cannot be derogated or waived, such payments technically create a service contract governed by english law. this contract does
      not involve any undertaking by the company for jacques gounon’s benefit, and jacques gounon has not been granted any contractual
      severance package. in addition, in the event that jacques gounon’s role as chief executive officer is terminated, to avoid eurotunnel
      services limited having to give jacques gounon notice in accordance with the group’s rules for senior managers – i.e. one month’s
      notice per year of service, capped at 12 months – jacques gounon proposed in 2008 to the nomination and remuneration committee
      to limit the notice period applicable to the contract to the minimum required under english law, which is one week per year of service,
      capped at 12 weeks. the proposal was accepted by the board of directors of get se. the afep/medef recommendation, which is to
      terminate a person’s employment contract if they are appointed as a corporate officer, cannot be applied to the chairman and chief
      executive officer, since it is in contradiction with a mandatory provision of english law, which is complied with in principle, but the effect
      of which has been limited to the strict legal minimum.

16.9. internal control and risk management
procedures (report of the chairman of the board of
directors on internal control)

16.9.1 definition and objectives of internal control and risk
management

a) legal framework and reference framework
in accordance with article l. 22-537 paragraph 6 of the french commercial code, the chairman of groupe eurotunnel se draws up a
report on the group’s internal control and risk management procedures. the chairman’s report is the subject of a report produced by
the statutory auditors, a copy of which can be found in section 16.9.5 of this registration document.

the chairman’s report was drafted with reference to the reference framework recommended by the french financial markets authority
(l’autorité des marchés financiers) dated 22 july 2010.

the audit committee examined the chairman’s report, which was then reviewed and approved by the board of directors of get se on
17 march 2015, in accordance with article l. 225-37 paragraph 10 of the french commercial code.


b) definition, objectives and scope of internal control and risk management
internal control is a system comprising a combination of means, modes of conduct, procedures and actions adapted to the specific
features of each company. it contributes to the effective management of the company’s business, the efficiency of its operations and the

                                                                                                                                                 

      efficient use of its resources and should enable it to appropriately factor in all significant risks, be they operational, financial or
      compliance-related.

      specifically, the system seeks to ensure:
      • compliance with the laws and regulations in force;
      • the implementation of instructions decided by the general management;
      • the proper functioning of the company’s internal processes, particularly those related to safeguarding its tangible and intangible
         assets;
      • the reliability of financial information.

      internal control is not restricted to a set of procedures or mere accounting and financial processes and it does not encompass all the
      initiatives undertaken by corporate or management bodies. moreover, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the company’s
      objectives will be achieved.

      the internal control and risk management system extends throughout the group and its consolidated french and british subsidiaries.

      as part of its continuous improvement approach, in 2014 the group implemented the following actions to reinforce the internal control
      and risk management system:
      • the body of procedures was updated and enhanced;
      • the internal control team was strengthened;
      • the register of group risks, based on a reference framework common to all subsidiaries, and the individual registers for each
         subsidiary, set up in 2013, were updated at the 2014 annual review.


      16.9.2 comprehensive risk management and internal control process

      a) risk management procedures
      the objective of the group’s risk management process is to enable general management and the board of directors to:
      • have a complete, consistent and structured view of all types of major risks to which the company is exposed and of their
         evolution; and
      • appreciate the appropriateness of the mitigating measures implemented by those responsible for managing each of the risks in the
         light of their potential impact on the company’s strategic objectives.

      risk management contributes to creating and preserving the company’s value, assets and reputation. it provides greater security in the
      company’s decision making and in its processes, which promotes the achievement of its objectives. it fosters consistency between the
      company’s actions and its values and seeks to mobilise the company’s employees around a common vision of the main risks and
      promote awareness among them of the risks inherent to their work.


      i)   identification and analysis of risks
      this first stage allows the key risks threatening the achievement of the company’s objectives to be identified and consolidated. a risk can
      be either a threat or a missed opportunity. it is characterised by an event, which has one or more sources and one or more
      consequences. this identification will be followed by an analysis which involves examining the potential consequences of the key risks
      (consequences that may be financial, human, legal or related to reputation) and estimating the likelihood that they may come to pass.
      this dual approach is a continuous process.


      ii) risk management
      the risk management system is monitored and regularly reviewed with a view to its ongoing improvement. the aim is to identify and
      assess key potential risks and draw lessons from incidents.

      the process includes a formal annual review presented to the audit committee and, subsequently, to the board of directors of get se,
      at the end of the financial year under consideration. the risk reviews are based on the strategic plan applicable at the date of the relevant
      review.

      risk reviews are coordinated by the company’s corporate risk manager. these reviews seek to identify and quantify the risks facing the
      company and to identify and assess the mitigating measures put in place to manage them. they make it possible to implement a
      risk map.

                                                                                                                                              16

the process, which consists primarily of formal interviews with directors and senior management across the company, comprises two
parallel approaches:
• a top-down approach, consisting of the identification of the risks linked to strategic initiatives (both from the point of view of their
   direct effect on the company’s business and the knock-on effect that they may generate on pre-existing risks) and changes in the
   company’s economic environment; and
• the traditional bottom-up approach which seeks to identify risks in each of the main business areas (commercial,
   technical/operational, financial, staff, safety and security, environment and corporate governance).

the identification of new risks is based on the systematic review of external sources of information (global conditions, benchmarking,
trade bodies, etc.) and internal information (developments within the company, interviews and lobbying of the management team).

the risk register contains the following information:
• description of the risk;
• residual risk assessment, following consideration of mitigation measures, based on criteria of probability of occurrence and impact;
• identification of the risk manager and the degree to which that manager considers the risk is managed as at the date of the review
   with a view to improving this.

the risks are arranged in order according to the degree to which they are critical. all group risks are grouped in categories and
sub-categories which are common to all subsidiaries, to enable an appropriate and homogeneous point of comparison between them.
in addition, a group register has been compiled to enable monitoring at a more global level. thus, the risks of each group subsidiary and
the risks monitored at a corporate level are mapped in this manner. this approach, initiated in 2013, was completed with the 2014
annual review.

this approach of identifying and analysing significant risks and processes strengthens the group’s knowledge of risk by formalising and
consolidating work already done in this area.


iii) treatment and monitoring of risks
each risk has a level of control that corresponds to the systems of selection and implementation of the measures aimed at altering it. the
company may envisage a number of measures: reduction, transfer, deletion or acceptance of a risk. the choice of how to manage a risk
will involve, in particular, weighing opportunities against the costs of risk management measures, while also taking account of their
possible effects on the likelihood and/or consequences of the risk occurring. the controls to be put in place fall under the scope of the
internal control system. in this way, the internal control system contributes to the management of risks incurred in the company’s
activities.

the corporate risk manager and internal audit monitor major risks and new or emerging risks, on an ongoing basis, and any significant
changes are reported to the executive committee and to the audit committee.


b) components of internal control
internal control comprises of five closely related components, as follows:
• control environment;
• risk assessment;
• control activities;
• information and communication;
• monitoring.

they are implemented by the group as follows:


i)   control environment
the control environment, which is key to the internal control system and essential for good risk management and procedural application,
is based on human behaviour and is the foundation for other internal control elements.

the control environment of eurotunnel is based on the following elements:
• a general human resources policy which sets out the group’s values and operating principles, as well as the key measures in place in
   relation to working conditions and practices, staff training and development, and standards of conduct. for the group, ethics and
   integrity are the surest guarantee of sustainable and responsible growth. to that end, the general policy is set forth in the charter of
   ethics and behaviour, which was approved by the board of directors on 28 january 2013 and distributed to all employees. with the
   introduction of the bribery act in the united kingdom, the group has reviewed its anti-corruption policy and put in place various
   appropriate measures, notably to remind employees and partners of the importance of this issue.

16 board and management practices

      • the board of directors’ keen interest in internal control and general management’s express desire for continuous improvement of
        operational processes.
      • clear definition of responsibilities by means of a corporate organisation chart distributed via the intranet and detailed job descriptions
        with clearly outlined responsibilities. in addition to the implementation of delegation of authority and approval limits, in key areas, and
        formal delegation of responsibility in the main operational areas.
      • the existence of a body of operational policies and procedures, documented for all the main business segments.
      • the existence of a formal monthly reporting process and quarterly budget reviews, ensuring the company’s good financial
        management.


      ii) risk assessment
      every company has to face external and internal risks that may impede the full achievement of its objectives. the main risks that the
      eurotunnel group considers itself exposed to are described in chapter 4 – risk factors.

      the group relies on a variety of processes to identify risks and take them into account:
      • the strategic plan, approved by the management committee, is presented to the get se board of directors. it defines the medium
         and long-term objectives of the group and, taking account of the associated risks, sets out action plans to achieve them.
      • the annual budget establishes short-term operational and commercial objectives for each of the group’s main areas of activity, as
         well as the expected financial results. the annual budget is presented to the get se board of directors.
      • performance indicators (kpis) are established for the main identified risk areas, including safety, commercial performance and
         operational reliability. these indicators are reported on a weekly basis to members of the executive committee.
      • an annual corporate risk review is carried out and the results are reported to the audit committee and board of directors of
         get se. this review is described in section 16.9.2a).


      iii) control activities
      proportionate controls for the issues at stake in each process are designed to make sure the necessary steps are taken to manage risks
      likely to impede the achievement of the company’s objectives. the application of regulations and procedures assist in the
      implementation of guidelines issued by management. control activities are carried out at all hierarchical and functional levels of the
      company. for each business area, specific measures are recommended to ensure compliance with the key aspects of internal control.

      the ethics and corporate governance committee has introduced the ethics and governance code which refers to all the procedures.
      this committee enables an ethical culture and ethical principles to be absorbed throughout the company and informs the work of
      executive officers. with regard to internal communications, a group intranet, myget, was set up in 2014 and enables each and every
      employee to have access to information related to his subsidiary and those of the eurotunnel group, particularly where internal control
      procedures are concerned. in addition, the french group committee met for the first time on 31 january 2014, providing an opportunity
      for a reciprocal sharing of information, an exchange of viewpoints and dialogue between french employee representatives and the
      group’s management on strategic objectives and the key staff issues. in particular, the committee is informed each year of
      developments and the outlook going forward for the group. with regard to payroll functions, formal procedures are in place and strict
      segregation of duties is in place, within hr, in the key stages of the payroll process.

      in the purchasing area, the code of conduct for purchasing was brought up to date in 2011: it is the practical and ethical guide that
      enables each employee to comply with the applicable laws and regulations and also, to develop a climate of trust between group
      representatives and persons outside the business. formal procedures and delegation of authority are in place for the management and
      approval of purchases. in addition, a responsible supplier charter has been in place since 2010, to build lasting and balanced
      relationships between customers and suppliers. finally, the call-for-tenders procedures require that competitive conditions are in place
      in addition to a supplier approval process.

      in the security area, procedures related to the protection of people, goods and data underpin the risk cover principles in terms of
      organisation and security. the safety and security committee monitors performance in these areas by means of quarterly reports from
      the security and sustainable development directorate. these include the reporting of safety performance against its target, the results
      of safety evaluations and an update on security matters. the safety and security committee has created two sub-groups, one
      responsible for emergency planning and the binat exercises and the other for security issues. furthermore, a formal document entitled
      sgs (système de gestion de la sécurité – security management system) is updated as necessary and at least once every five years by
      the safety and sustainable development directorate. this document identifies the major risks to which the company’s customers,
      employees, sub-contractors and visitors are exposed, and the measures in place to manage them. the sgs is formally approved by the
      igc in its capacity as safety authority.

      in the information systems area, risks associated with data and system integrity are covered by procedures and controls that are
      integrated in the systems themselves. the group has an it tool utilisation guide which allows all employees to share best practice and

levels of control that are adapted to the level of risk exposure. this policy is accompanied by an information systems safety audit
programme carried out by an external service.

in the legal area, organisation at local level ensures that within each business segment and department, french, british and european
legislation is respected, particularly in the following areas: anti-corruption, competition, personal data protection and securities
transactions. an anti-fraud programme is in operation providing staff training and organising campaigns to raise awareness concerning
the major fraud risks. a whistle-blowing system is in place: any employee may refer to the group’s ethics advisory service if he feels that
it may be difficult to communicate directly with his superior or that such communication might not be followed up appropriately. finally,
the code of conduct, in place since december 2010 and regularly updated, contains a reminder of the measures intended to prevent
insider trading and establishes ‘‘no-trade window’’ periods.

in the insurance area, the group only deals with high ranking insurers. in particular, it has arrangements in place to cover civil liability for
all its entities, as well as property damage and loss of revenue resulting from an insured risk. a full insurance risk assessment is carried
out every three years to assess the adequacy of the group’s insurance cover. it is reviewed at the time of policy renewals.

in the treasury area, a corporate treasury risk management committee (trmc) is in place; it monitors foreign exchange and interest
rate trends and the use of financial instruments, in addition to cash flow, cash and compliance with banking covenants. cash
management policies and procedures are approved annually by the get se board of directors. the treasury management plan enables
monitoring of foreseeable cash flow availability for the group’s different entities.

the control activities in the accounting and finance area are the subject of a specific description set out in section 16.9.3 entitled
internal control procedures related to the preparation and treatment of financial and accounting information.


iv) information and internal communications
the group ensures the internal distribution of relevant and reliable information that allows everyone to fulfil their responsibilities. this
covers both the efficiency and integrity of information systems and ensures efficient multi-directional communication within
the company.

the board of directors of get se is regularly provided with the information it requires:
• annually, the strategic plan and the annual budget;
• monthly, a report containing information on financial results and the financial situation, in addition to a summary of commercial and
   operational performance.

the audit committee, the nomination and remuneration committee, the safety and security committee, the strategy and
sustainable development committee and the ethics and corporate governance committee of the board of directors of
get se receive reports of concern to them at each of their periodic meetings. the chairmen of these committees keep the get se
board of directors informed of the work of their committees.

the members of the executive committee of get se receive the following documents for information purposes:
• monthly, a report on the financial results and analysis of performance in relation to the budget; and
• monthly, a report containing the key performance indicators for each business segment (safety, commercial performance and
   market share, productivity and operational reliability, service quality, employee headcount and related statistics, financial results with
   comparison against the budget and against the most recent forecasts);
• weekly, a report setting out key information related to safety, human resources, operations, and to commercial and financial
   performance.

regular communication with group personnel is ensured through the new myget intranet, launched in 2014, which allows each
employee to obtain information on the group’s main activities and on new policies and procedures applicable within the company. in
addition, a newsletter is produced for each subsidiary. periodic meetings held by the management forum bring together the group’s key
managers for general discussions.


v) monitoring and supervision
monitoring entails periodic assessment of the internal control system. it forms part of the group’s day-to-day operations, and includes
regular management and supervisory activities, as well as the work carried out by the audit functions. during 2014 and up to the date of
this registration document, get se has not identified any major shortcomings in its internal control system.

16 board and management practices

      monitoring and supervision falls under the responsibility of the board of directors of get se, and the following parties:


      general management and its management committee
      the mission of general management is to define the key aspects of the risk management and internal control systems and to ensure
      their implementation. to do so, it is supported by the operational directorates.


      the audit committee
      the audit committee is responsible for monitoring actions undertaken with regard to internal control and reports to the board of
      directors. twice a year, the committee examines the internal audit plan and its objectives, as well as the general conclusions of internal
      audit missions. the initiatives and projects that shape internal control are also presented to it. the committee then reports on its findings
      and views to the board of directors.


      the group finance department
      the group finance department is responsible for all finance functions within the group, through its centralised functions (planning,
      reporting, consolidation, tax matters, accounting and treasury) and through its functional links with the financial director of each
      subsidiary. it encourages a sound understanding of the group’s internal control rules as well as their dissemination and proper
      application, and it monitors the progress of internal control and risk management projects.

      the risk management and internal control department
      the risk management and internal control department reports to the corporate finance directorate. this department is responsible for
      implementation and monitoring of the key risk map in order to minimise the impact of adverse events and fully capitalise on
      opportunities. it is also tasked with the development and deployment of internal control throughout the entire group. alongside
      professional experts, it coordinates the implementation of projects and internal control tasks decided by general management.


      the risk committee
      this committee participates in the opening and closure of the annual risk review. it is in charge of reviewing and approving the mapping
      results generated by the annual risk review. it comprises the deputy chief executive officer, the group’s financial director, the head of
      internal audit, the secretary to the board of directors, the chief operating officer concession, the chairman of europorte and the
      corporate risk manager.

      the internal audit department
      the internal audit department is part of general management. twice a year, the head of internal audit reports to the audit committee on
      the work undertaken by his department. it plans audit works in order to ensure appropriate cover for all the main risk factors and it
      submits an audit plan to the audit committee. a formal process exists for the correction of weaknesses highlighted in internal audit
      reports. the status of corrective actions is presented to the audit committee.

      the internal audit department comprises a central team which performs regular audits on the operational units, as well as audits on
      corporate or cross-departmental subjects. for each mission, a report is drawn up itemising the findings identified and the associated
      risks as well as its recommendations as part of an action plan to be implemented by the audited entity. this report is passed on to the
      functional department concerned and to the deputy chief executive officer.

      an integral part of the corporate risk assessment, internal audit takes part in the annual risk review and assesses the appropriateness
      and effectiveness of measures in place to mitigate the identified risks. the results of the corporate risk assessment and the internal audit
      review are presented to the audit committee.

      the internal audit department consults the safety and security committee on an annual basis to jointly identify audit requirements in
      these areas.

      the internal audit department received certification in 2012 from ifaci (institut français de l’audit et du contrôle internes – the french
      audit and internal control institute), in accordance with international internal audit standards. in 2013 and in 2014, follow-up audits were
      performed and these confirmed the ifaci certification.

      specific committees
      the group has set up a number of specific committees:
      • the investment committee which endorses the group’s major investment projects,
      • the commitments committee which endorses the key sales and purchasing contracts of the group’s various entities,
      • the corporate treasury risk management committee.

• operating performance committee (service quality and customer experience),
• risk committee,

16.9.3 internal control procedures related to the preparation and
treatment of financial and accounting information

a) monitoring the accounting and financial structure
i)   structure
corporate general management is responsible for preparing the group’s individual and consolidated financial statements and
implementing the internal control systems related to finance and accounting. to do this, it has put in place a monitoring function to
identify and manage the major risks that could potentially impact the preparation of accounting and financial information published by
the group:
• it ensures the group has the organisation and resources in place to guarantee that the financial statements reflect its transactions
   accurately and in full;
• it oversees, via the management reporting processes, the reliability of the published accounting and financial information;
• it supervises the preparation and year-end closing of the financial statements, paying particular attention to the accounting treatment
   of major or complex transactions, the quality of estimates used in the consolidated financial statements and the year-end closing
   procedures that are considered sensitive;
• it is informed of the auditors’ conclusions drawn from their work on the individual and consolidated financial statements. it also keeps
   itself abreast of any significant risks or major weakness in internal control notified by the auditors and makes sure that these are
   addressed by the corrective actions implemented by the group.

financial management is centralised in the group’s finance department, which is responsible for defining the group’s accounting
rules and policies, cash management, consolidation of the group financial statements and financial reporting. this centralised
responsibility covers all the accounting entities of the eurotunnel group, both in the united kingdom and france, in addition to its freight
activities in spain and belgium.

accounts management is performed by each entity in accordance with the group’s accounting principles. data are then passed to
the group’s finance department for consolidation.

the audit committee plays a crucial role in controlling the group’s financial reporting and in preparatory work for year-end closing of
the financial statements and consideration of the interim statements by the board of directors, in particular:
• any changes to accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee;
• the group finance department submits a quarterly report to the audit committee on major accounting and reporting issues
   and options;
• the audit committee reviews the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements before their presentation to the get se
   board of directors;
• at these meetings, the committee receives formal reports drawn up by the statutory auditors, financial management, internal audit,
   treasury and risk management.


ii) the accounting rules
the quality of accounting and financial information relies on observance of the accounting rules and principles by both the accounts
production process and the year-end closing process, to ensure that the information contained in the financial statements is true and fair.

the rules to be observed for accounts production and upstream processes are the following: truthfulness of transactions and events
recorded, completeness of all transactions and events, accurate measurement of amounts related to transactions, the accrual principle
and appropriate classification of transactions and events in the accounts.

the rules to be observed for the year-end closing process are the following: existence of assets and liabilities, rights and obligations,
completeness of assets and liabilities, accurate measurement and allocation of assets and liabilities, appropriate presentation and




                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                               111


16 board and management practices

      intelligibility of the financial information, truthfulness of rights and obligations, accurate measurement and assessment of financial
      information.

      these rules are set forth in written procedures and cover all operations performed by the group finance department; they are
      accessible and are conveyed to the various group entities.


      iii) organisation and security of it systems
      a single integrated accounting system, sap ecc, is used across all accounting entities, with the exception of gbrf. the transmission of
      transactions and accounting data using other sap modules is automatic. for systems outside the integrated sap environment –
      principally in the areas of passenger sales – accounting data uploads are automated. reconciliation and verification controls are in place
      to ensure the completeness and accuracy of these interfaces.

      the it systems and environment are organised to ensure secure, reliable, accessible and relevant provision of accounting and financial
      information. controls are in place to ensure the physical security of hardware and software, the integrity of data and the continuity of
      operation of the major computer systems. appropriate measures are in place to cope with the risk of unauthorised intrusion into
      information systems and its possible consequences, from inappropriate access to loss of data.


      b) processes involved in the preparation of published accounting and financial information
      i)   transaction accounting
      the reliability of published financial information depends on adequate controls over the transactions giving rise to accounting entries to
      ensure they are accurate, complete and compliant with the standards in force. these controls are applied for all processes feeding into
      the accounts, particularly operating revenue, purchases, inventory control, fixed assets, payroll and treasury, in addition to capital
      transactions and provisions and commitments. the month-end closures, including detailed verification of the main revenue and
      expenditure accounts, are carried out by the budget controllers. formal balance sheet reconciliations are also carried out by the
      accounts department.

      financial and management accounting is integrated and prepared using the same source data. monthly reconciliations are carried out
      between management accounting data and the accounting data used to prepare the published accounting and financial information.

      ii) consolidation
      • consolidation of the financial statements of the various group entities is carried out centrally by the group finance department,
          which ensures that the scope and rules of consolidation are kept up to date.
      • there is a formal process for preparing the group’s consolidated financial statements which includes:
          – advance reporting dates at end-may and end-november allowing the group to anticipate the accounting treatment of complex
             transactions;
          – publication by the group finance department of a timetable and period-end closure instructions for the subsidiaries;
          – preparation of consolidation information by subsidiaries to ensure standardisation in the application of group accounting policies
             and in the information reported in the group’s consolidated financial statements.
      • the interim and full-year consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of the individual company trial balances in the
          sap accounting system.
      • intragroup transactions are identified and eliminated. accounting adjustments in the consolidation processes are controlled and
          approved by the appropriate level of management.
      • changes in the consolidated financial position at the opening and reporting dates are analysed and explained.


      iii) external communication of financial information
      an annual timetable is drawn up by the group corporate management setting out the periodic obligations related to the provision of
      accounting and financial communications to the market. this schedule, which specifies the nature and timing of each disclosure and the
      person responsible for its preparation, is sent to everyone involved in the process.

      formal processes are in place to ensure:
      • that information is communicated externally in a timely manner and in compliance with the laws and regulations in force;
      • that sensitive information remains confidential;
      • that all information, including non-accounting information presented in support of financial communications, is checked
         before release;
      • that information meeting the definition of inside information is communicated to the market at the right time, in compliance with the
         relevant rules.


      iv) statutory auditors
      working separately from the group finance department, the statutory auditors, as part of their work to audit and certify the financial
      statements, carry out a review of the internal control procedures used to prepare and ensure the quality of the financial statements.

17.1. origin and development of csr at the
eurotunnel group

since it was established, the eurotunnel group has pursued a corporate social responsibility policy which seeks to reconcile financial
performance, social equity and environmental protection, within a framework of continuous improvement. well before csr emerged as
a concept, before the united nations global compact in 2000 and the new french legislation of 2001, or the french environmental
legislation of 2009 and 2010 (grenelle i and ii), eurotunnel – often a frontrunner in such endeavours – already brought together in its
approach economics, regional management and environmental responsibility.

the eurotunnel group puts social and environmental responsibility at the heart of its activities and interaction with different internal and
external stakeholders, and ensures this commitment is communicated clearly to its partners: employees, customers, suppliers,
shareholders, investors, regional government bodies, local authorities, associations and communities.

the eurotunnel group has an official csr policy, operated and supported at the highest levels of the organisation by the chairman and
chief executive officer. it comes into force in 2015 and sets out the principles, the challenges and the commitments of the group.
conformity to the policy will constantly monitored at the highest level of the group. csr targets will be defined each year and will form
part of the targets allocated to management and senior staff of group companies.

true to its principles, for more than 20 years it has pursued an exacting and concrete corporate social responsibility (csr) policy, which
it mainly exercises in the three strategic areas relating to its activities:
• people, i.e. each and every one of more than 3,900 men and women employed by eurotunnel group;
• nature, i.e. the environment and ecosystems with which its growing operations interact;
• region, i.e. all communities the group is connected to everywhere in france, in the uk and in europe.


17.1.1 people

as a responsible employer, the eurotunnel group is committed to provide a working environment that fosters personal development and
fulfilment in order to attract and retain good, qualified staff.

growth that creates jobs: in 2014, the expansion of the group’s activities was accompanied by an increase of more than 5% in the
group’s headcount. its human resources policies recognise each employee’s contribution, taking account of that employee’s
qualifications, level of responsibility and individual performance.

the loyalty of eurotunnel group employees is reflected in a low staff turnover rate: 5.2% in 2014 and an absenteeism rate of 3.9%.

in september 2014, all eurotunnel group employees received their very first ‘‘individual company report’’. in a standard format
irrespective of the company for which employees work, this four-page document sets out their functions and annual remuneration. it
contains all details of their salaries, total bonuses and benefits in kind, and also the contributions made by the company.


17.1.2 nature

from the very beginning, as an innovative rail company and responsible infrastructure manager, eurotunnel group stood out for its
understanding of sustainable development, which reconciles economic performance with territorial management and environmental
protection:
• an underground link that does not interfere in any way with the marine environment;
• a transport system that by its nature has a limited impact on the environment (it causes 20 times less pollution than ferries: the
   carbon footprint of a truck crossing the channel on a shuttle is 8.8 kg of co2 compared with 158 kg on a ferry);
• the choice of electric traction in the tunnel is a major factor in reducing the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions (carbon
   trust standard certification);
• in 2012, the eurotunnel group was one of the first private enterprises in the world to join the global union for sustainability and to
   publicly commit to reducing its global carbon footprint (scope of fixed link and europorte segments) by 3% a year;
• a policy to routinely reduce consumption of electricity (90% of the power consumed is generated from low-carbon nuclear or
   hydroelectric sources);
• the transition from 30 to 32 carrier wagons for truck shuttles, without a significant increase in energy consumption;
• the replacement of diesel engines for works and maintenance trains by battery-powered autonomous wagons;

      •     the development, at the beginning of 2013, of a more fuel-efficient shuttle driving technique, with a simulator equipped with a
            module dedicated to fuel-efficient driving.

      on 20 november 2014, eurotunnel le shuttle was named ‘‘most environmentally friendly carrier’’ at the internationalen busplaner 2015
      sustainability awards ceremony. the distinction acknowledges eurotunnel le shuttle’s daily commitment to the fastest and most
      environment-friendly channel crossing service. on 8 december 2014 the eurotunnel group also took the ‘‘human capital victories’’
      silver trophy for its csr policy.


      17.1.3 region

      as a committed partner in the economic and social environment in which it operates, the eurotunnel group has created several
      thousand direct, indirect and related jobs in kent and the pas-de-calais region(1) since its establishment. the group also exercises its
      social responsibility though concrete commitments and community support, such as the implementation since 2013, of a partnership
      agreement in july 2013 with apf entreprises, the economic network of disability support organisation association des paralysés
      de france.
      • community support: the eurotunnel group pays 10% of the revenues from the operation of the wind farm located on its coquelles
         site to secours populaire français in the form of energy vouchers. the group has established a partnership agreement with the
         secours populaire français. through its commitment to fondation agir contre l’exclusion (face), which provides assistance to
         those most in need, the eurotunnel group encourages its employees to get involved in humanitarian and charity projects.
      • responsible procurement policies and practices: relations between the group and its suppliers go beyond simply purchasing goods
         and services. the group requires all employees in all its entities to comply with the ethical standards set forth in a code of ethics.

      furthermore, the eurotunnel group’s sustainable development policy is based on respect for fundamental rights, as defined in the main
      international principles: the universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organization’s declaration on
      fundamental principles and rights at work. in its charter of ethics and behaviour, approved by the board of directors in 2013, the
      eurotunnel group sets out the common rules regarding respect for people, fair competition, internal controls and environmental
      protection.

      these principles and guidelines for action now apply to all employees of the group and its subsidiaries, as well as to their subcontractors
      and suppliers.


      17.1.4 data certification

      the verification of social, societal and environmental information by an independent third party became compulsory for french
      businesses following the publication in 2012 of the regulations implementing article 225 of the grenelle 2 law and the decree of
      13 may 2013. groupe eurotunnel was ahead of this new obligation and continues today in its drive to be proactive and transparent in
      these three areas.

      for 2014, groupe eurotunnel se decided to subject three new social indicators to closer scrutiny by the independent third party so as to
      obtain a reasonable rather than limited assurance in view of the obligations it is under. in 2014 a partially automated reporting system
      was also put in place for the input, collection and consolidation of environmental information, in the wake of collection of social
      information the year before.

      the eurotunnel group is committed to reporting the results of its approach in an effective manner by publishing information relating to
      the issues listed under article r 225-105-1 of the french commercial code. to this end, it asked an independent third party, to attest to
      the presence of this information and express a limited or reasonable assurance as to its reliability in relation to the group scope. the
      statutory auditors’ report features in section 17.7 of this registration document. a methodological note including reporting principles,
      choices of indicators, data collection and methodological details about indicators collected features in annex i of this registration
      document.

      a cross-reference table is provided in section 17.6 of this registration document in respect of the information required by article
      r225-105-1 of the french commercial code, the global reporting initiative indicators (version 3.1), the information provided in this
      chapter and the charter of ethics and behaviour of the group.

the group’s csr policy has no dedicated budget or specific investments: the costs associated with the csr policy come out of the
operating budget of the entity or department concerned. the aim is to make csr an essential component of all group activities.

the company communicates its csr policy through the management chain, effectively using the same channels as for the group’s
strategic objectives.

at 31 december 2014, the eurotunnel group had 3,949 employees. during the financial year, the group experienced growth in its
workforce of 5% compared with 2013. this is linked to the expansion of the group’s operations, in particular that of the europorte
subsidiaries.

the geographical breakdown was constant overall, with 62.5% of the workforce employed in france and 37.5% in the united kingdom
(2013: 63% and 37% respectively).

at 31 december 2014, women made up 20.5% of the total workforce (2013: 20.8%). the lower proportion of women reflects the
specificity of jobs within the group, notably those related to rail maintenance where there is a higher proportion of men.

      at the end of 2014, around 23% of the group’s workforce was aged under 35, and almost 52% was aged under 45, showing a slight
      increase in the workforce under 35 compared with 2013 (21%). the number of employees aged 55 and over also rose compared with
      2013. at 31 december 2014, they represented almost 14% of the workforce, compared with 13.1% in 2013 (492 employees). there
      were 191 employees aged over 59, which represents 5% of the workforce (against 167, or 4.46%, in 2013).

      the average age of the workforce is  44 years (45 in 2013). the group continues its work to address the management of the age
      pyramid, as indicated in chapter 4 of this registration document. the eurotunnel group is committed to retaining workers aged 55 and
      over as part of the workforce, and to improving the working conditions of older staff members. specifically, this entails improving the
      current workplace representation of older workers and fostering career progression throughout their working life. in 2012, discussions
      with the staff representative bodies of europorte france, socorail and europorte proximité led to the introduction of a three-year action
      plan concerning the employment of older staff members. in 2014, europorte france and socorail signed an agreement called the
      ‘‘contract de génération’’. a similar agreement was signed on 24 april 2014 between the esgie management and the trade union
      organisations, complemented by an addendum dated 19 september 2014.


      d) breakdown of workforce by category
      at 31 december 2014, managers accounted for over  20.4% of the group’s workforce, of which almost more than 20% were women.
      this breakdown reflects the specificity of jobs within the rail industry.

      *     year-end adjustment compared with the information published in the 2013 registration document.


      in line with its values, the eurotunnel group attaches a great deal of importance in the recruitment process to candidates’ openness to
      other cultures, their ability to work as part of a team and their sense of initiative.

      the recruitment policy is intended to equip the group with the best skills to support its development. as indicated in chapter 4 of this
      registration document, the group has put in place various measures to prevent any mismatch between the development of its activities
      and the human resources required to implement its strategy.

      the recruitment policy continues to operate in a controlled manner by adapting the level of the workforce and skills to the actual needs of
      the business.

      the group tends to favour permanent contracts, keen to demonstrate its commitment to its employees for the long term and guarantee
      them lasting employment. at 31 december 2014, more than 80% of all new employees were recruited on permanent contracts. the
      level of temporary employment (fixed-term contracts/temporary staff) was less than  5% in 2014 compared with 4.7% in 2013.


      f)     departures

      the balance between new hires (459) and departures (260) is positive. resignations (41.5% in 2014, 31.4% in 2013) represent the main
      reason for leaving the group. the proportion of redundancies went from 3.3% at 31 december 2013 to 2.70% at 31 december 2014.

g) staff turnover
in the 2014 financial year, the average staff turnover rate for the group was 5.2% (2013: 5.0%).


h) remuneration
the eurotunnel group’s remuneration policy is based on equitable and transparent remuneration, which ensures full cohesion between
individual and company objectives. its strategy consists in sharing its success with its employees and involving them in its growth.

recognition of individual performance is a major element of the group’s remuneration policy, and is intended to motivate all employees,
with a view to rewarding and retaining the group’s best talent. the differences in remuneration between workers are justifiable, and
reflect the responsibilities entrusted to them, their experience and potential.

in france, all employees received a collective increase in basic salary and all payments linked to working conditions from
1 january 2015. these were 0.5% for esgie staff and 0.5% for socorail staff respectively. the negotiations regarding epf and epp staff
took place in june 2014 regarding a 1% increase to be applied on 1 july 2014.

in the united kingdom, the management and unite negotiated a collective increase in salaries and payments linked to working
conditions of 2.4% for esl in april 2014. gbrf staff received an increase of 2.6% following an agreement between the management and
aslef. these increases were negotiated on the basis of inflation for esl and the retail price index for gbrf.

initiatives relating to profit-sharing, shareholdings, stock options and bonus shares described in section 17.2.8 of this registration
document are intended to involve all employees in the group’s financial performance.

a bonus system, half based on safety and service quality indicators and half on cash flow performance, may result in all esgie/esl
employees receiving a bonus of up to 6% of annual basic salary. for 2014, the results allowed the payment of an operational bonus of
1.07% and a financial bonus of 1.38%, totalling 2.45% overall. a management bonus is paid to management staff, as a percentage of
salary, depending on their grade.

      17.2.2 work organisation

      a) working hours
      the eurotunnel group’s policy on the organisation of working hours seeks a compromise between two main priorities: on the one hand,
      the desire to satisfy and best serve the company’s customers, and on the other, the need to maintain a work-life balance for
      its employees.

      the eurotunnel group ensures that all its subsidiaries comply with their legal and contractual obligations regarding working hours.
      subsidiaries located in the united kingdom comply with the local legislation in the countries in which they are based and/or the
      agreements signed with staff representative bodies.

      the group’s policy is driven by a flexible and proactive approach that enables the company – in particular the fixed link – to operate
      24/7, 365 days of the year, as required under the concession agreement.

      in france, employees’ working hours (with the exception of certain senior managers and directors) must not exceed an average of
      35 hours a week over the year, and in any event, not more than 1,600 hours a year.

      in the united kingdom, employment contracts provide that the average working week for esl employees is 37 hours, (or 1,924 hours
      per year), based on individual contracts and agreements in place with unite. for gbrf employees, operational staff work an average of
      35 hours a week, spread over four days (1,826 hours a year), while administrative staff work 37 hours per week spread over five days.

                                                                                                               2014                    2013

      the absenteeism rate of 3.9% in 2014 is slightly up on the figure for 2013 (3.5%). the main cause for absenteeism is illness, other than
      occupational illness.


      17.2.3 labour relations

      a) organisation of labour relations
      labour relations are very important for the group, particularly negotiations with staff representative bodies. the group has always
      worked to establish long-term and constructive relations with all its employees. internal surveys conducted on various occasions in
      france and in the united kingdom demonstrate the continued commitment of the group to strengthen corporate communication and
      dialogue, by allowing employees to speak freely.

                                                                                                                                                 17

every subsidiary follows this approach. several meetings have been held between employee representatives and members of the
management team which help strengthen dialogue with staff.

as a result of these efforts, the group has avoided labour disputes and strikes in 2014. the group considers that internal
communications are very important to further dialogue and information. internal communications are intended to nurture and strengthen
the commitment and engagement of all employees. the eurotunnel group uses different tools to communicate with staff (magazine,
intranet, project specific communications, etc.). the circulation of information relating to group strategy, objectives and results as well as
the promotion of achievements and/or innovating initiatives are examples of actions taken to keep the group workforce informed in
real time.


b) group labour relations forums
works councils and health and safety committees
all french subsidiaries have a works council and a health and safety committee, which meet according to the specific operational rules
governing each committee. in the united kingdom, the company council and the safety, health and environment committee are the
two organisations for esl employees with which permanent dialogue is established. these two committees meet once every
two months.

for gbrf, two employee representative organisations, the stakeholder business forum and the union company council, maintain a
productive dialogue between employees and management.

the fixed link’s european works council (ewc)
a real cross-border organisation, the fixed link’s ewc is a forum for information, consultation, exchange of views and dialogue. the
ewc operates alongside existing national staff representative bodies, in connection with the areas that it is responsible for. the
members of the fixed link european works council were re-appointed in december 2010. usually meeting twice a year, the council is
informed and consulted, as necessary, on cross-border issues that affect fixed link employees.

the group’s european works council comprises 16 full members and is informed about the group’s economic, financial and social
strategies. it met twice in the last financial year.


eurotunnel group committee
the committee was set up by unanimous agreement dated 31 january 2014 between the group’s management and four unions
representing employees. it is intended to operate as a forum for mutual information, to exchange views and to maintain dialogue
between staff representatives and management on strategic direction and major workforce issues. to this end, it is informed annually of
developments that have taken place and future outlook.

the eurotunnel group committee comprises six staff representatives and six deputies appointed by the unions. it also includes a union
representative from each of the unions. plenary meetings take place twice a year and are called by its chairman or his representative.

the eurotunnel group committee held its first meeting on 14 october 2014 in the presence of the chairman and chief executive officer.


the european company committee
following a combined meeting of shareholders on 29 april 2014, the transformation of groupe eurotunnel sa into a european company
came into force on 26 december 2014, the date of registration as a european company in the business and companies register. the
transformation process does not entail the creation of a new legal entity. the company’s terms of incorporation, the opening and closing
dates of the financial year, its share capital, the registered address and business purpose remain unchanged. the terms of members of
the board, corporate officers and auditors have been confirmed in the new company format.

the basic european company framework has a homogeneous format that is recognised in all eu member states. the eurotunnel group
has therefore adopted a legal status more in keeping with its dual nationality, its european nature and the economic and cultural reality of
the business.

on 1 december 2014 the special negotiating group and corporate officers of the company drew up an agreement concerning
procedures for the involvement of employees in the company transformed into a european company.

employee representatives on the european company committee are employees of the subsidiaries of the eurotunnel group se, who
are elected or appointed in accordance with the rules applicable in the state concerned for a term of four years, as of 1 january 2015.

the committee is composed of 12 permanent employee representatives and 12 deputies, elected or appointed in accordance with the
rules applicable in the state concerned.




                                                                               2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

17 corporate social responsibility

      the european company committee also has one union representative per trade union represented, appointed by the members of the
      european company committee.

      the european company committee is officially informed ahead of any major decisions in relation to the european company’s scope of
      consolidation, its legal or financial structures, and the possible consequences in terms of jobs.

      an ordinary plenary meeting of the european company committee is held twice a year. extraordinary meetings may be held when
      exceptional circumstances arise which are likely to affect the interests of employees.


      c) summary of collective agreements
      in france, esgie employees are represented by four trade unions and covered by a collective bargaining arrangement as part of a
      company-wide agreement. europorte employees are also represented by four trade unions and are covered by two collective
      agreements.

      at 31 december 2014, esgie employees were covered by collective agreements concerning the 35-hour week, night work,
      employment and skills planning, performance-related pay, professional equality and efficiency gains.

      during the 2014 financial year, 18 company agreements were signed by group subsidiaries on issues such as wages, performance-
      related pay, collective benefit plans, gender equality and working hours.

      in the united kingdom, due to the voluntary agreement on single union representation signed in 2000 by esl with unite, all employees
      of esl (with the exception of supervisory staff) are represented by unite during collective negotiations. employees may nevertheless
      belong to the union of their choice for their individual representation. for gbrf, a three-year wage deal signed in 2010 for three years and
      renewed in april 2013 for the same duration, was agreed with the train drivers’ union, aslef, for train crews and ground staff.


      d) community projects
      in france in 2014, esgie paid 1% of its restated total gross annual salary costs to the works council. for 2014, the council received
      c503,610 for developing and managing its community projects. esgie also contributes 0.2% of its total gross annual salary costs, or for
      2014 c125,902, to the operation of the works council.

      for 2014, socorail and europorte france respectively contributed 0.56% and 0.5% of their total gross annual salary costs to their works
      council for developing and managing community projects, of which 0.2% was for their operation.

      in the united kingdom, the company council, which receives contributions from esl equal to 0.8% of its total adjusted gross annual
      salary costs, received £221,668 in 2014 for developing and managing community projects. esl contributes 0.2% of its total gross
      annual salary costs, or £55,422, to the operation of the company council.

      gbrf holds regular events where employees and their families can meet outside work, including activity days, sports events and
      long-service dinners, as well events marking the introduction into service of locomotives throughout the united kingdom. gbrf provided
      £292,236 to fund these activities in 2014.


      17.2.4 health and safety

      safety is an absolute priority for eurotunnel group. fundamental to the fixed link concept, it remains a core operating principle and a
      key issue throughout the group. the efforts made in accident prevention and training have also established a real safety culture, first
      within the fixed link and then in the group’s subsidiaries.

      this culture, ingrained in each employee, governs their day-to-day conduct, making them highly vigilant and ensuring they act in
      accordance with safety regulations.

      the board of directors’ safety and security committee described in chapter 16 of this registration document ensures that measures
      promoting the safety of customers, employees, sub-contractors and all stakeholders are in place.

      the aim of each segment of the unified safety and sustainable development department is to define the company’s safety objectives,
      guarantee the implementation and application of safety regulations and measure performance within different services.

      the safety management system of the french and british europorte entities with a rail company licence is governed by the legislation of
      the different countries in which the activities are conducted.

the operating system for the shuttle was designed under the supervision of the intergovernmental commission (igc) and the safety
authority. each phase of the initial design was examined by the igc and was subject to a non-objection declaration.

the igc and the safety authority were put in place by the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement. the igc and safety
authority were charged with supervising the construction and operation of the system on behalf of the united kingdom and france. in
addition, audits are conducted by epsf, which has a specific mandate from the french delegation of the safety authority.

during the course of 2015, the igc will transfer its financial regulatory powers to the two french and british regulators (araf and orr).
once the transfer is made, the controls and conditions of circulation for railway undertakings shall be the responsibility of the araf and
the orr.

safety measures and procedures are updated regularly, and are part of the sms (safety management system), which is required to
retain the operating certificate issued by the igc, in accordance with the laws and regulations resulting from the transposition of the
european union’s railway safety directive (2004/49/ec) of 29 april 2004.

more generally, the system has detailed security and policing features meeting the requirements of the united kingdom and french
authorities. the following security measures were taken for the protection of the system: access control at the perimeter of the
terminals, or surveillance by closed-circuit television cameras.

safety and security measures for high-speed passenger trains and train operators’ rail freight services were developed by the
railway operators after discussion with the states, which approved them. the rail operators work with eurotunnel group as the
infrastructure manager to implement and continuously improve these safety measures.

the main security costs incurred in 2014 (securing the system) were approximately c12 million (c11.3 million in 2013) for the fixed link.

each group segment has its own safety department, which is committed to promoting a health and safety culture based on accident
prevention, the objective being to build a safe and hygienic workplace. each entity conducts a regular follow-up of safety performance in
the search for continuous improvement and implementation of any corrective measures necessary.

the group also places great importance on feedback, which is provided systematically within the group’s subsidiaries after an exercise
or a significant event. feedback enables the lessons necessary for the future to be learned and helps to develop organisational
procedures effectively, with a view to making them more efficient.

like safety, health is always a major concern for the group. every subsidiary has procedures and action programmes in place to limit and
prevent the occurrence of major risks relating to its employees’ activities and to improve their quality of life at work.

a perception survey, ‘‘le baromètre santé bien-être au travail’’ (the workplace health and well-being barometer), conducted from
28 may to 21 july 2014 by the malakoff médéric group among the esgie staff, revealed an organisational context perceived as stable
by the majority of employees, unlike most companies in the sector, to be highlighted together with an interest nurtured by the profession,
carried out in a good working environment, while at the same time identifying areas for improvement.

in france, a health and safety committee ensures the protection of employees’ health and safety, as well as improvements in their
working conditions. it analyses work-related risks and checks – also through surveys and inspections – compliance with the regulations
in place. the committee is consulted before any significant change in working conditions.

in the united kingdom, an occupational health service plays a key role in preventing occupational illness through education and the
promotion of health issues, as well as the implementation of appropriate controls intended to improve working conditions.

employees are provided with regular medicals from the occupational health service, and may also ask for an examination in addition to
these check-ups. for esgie in france and esl in the united kingdom, the group ensures there is a company doctor and two nurses on
site responsible for looking after employees’ health.


a) health and safety conditions in the workplace
all safety events are recorded and analysed in order to issue recommendations and produce action plans. furthermore, different safety
indicators are continuously and systematically monitored, particularly by the safety and security committee to the board, in order to
ensure an improvement in overall performance, notably regarding safety indicators for employees and sub-contractors and of the
transport system.

      b) agreements with unions/staff representatives
      in france, an agreement on the treatment of occupational stress in the business has been in force since april 2009 for esgie
      employees. this establishes the approach adopted by the company to deal with work-related disorders. in accordance with this
      agreement, a commission was created to prevent and treat occupational stress. thereafter, an agreement on the prevention and
      treatment of occupational stress was signed by all the unions and the human resources department on 2 march 2010. negotiations
      were started with a view to renewing this agreement during 2015.

      in the united kingdom, measures are in place to guarantee staff working conditions which comply with the applicable legislation and the
      human resources policy of each subsidiary.


      c)   work safety indicators

       2013                                                                                                              6.5                   0.4

      measures to prevent accidents and exercise vigilance have enabled the group, since 2012, to reduce significantly the number of
      work-related accidents resulting in time off. indeed, even if there was a slight reverse in 2014 due to higher volume of activities, the
      group since 2012, has seen a sharp improvement in the frequency rate, which was 10.8 in 2012, compared with 6.5 in 2013 and 8.0 in
      2014. the severity rate in 2014 remains constant compared with the previous year at 0.4.

      in france, 14 occupational illness cases were filed for group staff in 2014 (14 esgie, 0 socorail). no fatal accident occurred within the
      group in 2014.

      the group seeks to ensure that its safety and security rules and procedures are enforced by its sub-contractors, who are required to
      sign a contractual agreement on compliance with labour laws and regulations.


      17.2.5 training

      the eurotunnel group, which operates in an environment requiring high levels of technical skill, has always made training one of its key
      priorities, as indicated in chapter 4 of this registration document.

      the main focus of the group’s training policy is to strengthen the key skills of its employees and to maintain a high level of operational
      performance within teams, enabling them to contribute to the development of the business. its main priorities are to emphasise a shared
      safety and environment culture, and to improve the assistance given to employees to help them adapt to their job.

      the eurotunnel group has set up the centre international de formation ferroviaire de la côte d’opale (ciffco), a facility that ensures
      the management of the training plan and provides training for the concession, and supports the development of the rail freight industry
      and local train operators. it provides dedicated training programmes with a focus on rail-related activities in the national railways and
      other networks. in 2014, ciffco delivered 7,235 railway training days (compared with 3,077 days in 2013) to meet the training
      requirements of the group and the needs of external entities.

      on 8 september 2014, ciffco’s approval as a training centre was renewed. by renewing this, france’s public rail safety body epsf
      acknowledged the quality of the work carried out by the teams involved and the ciffco’s solid commitment. issued for a period of five
      years, the certification confirms the ciffco’s compliance with epsf requirements for all safety functions such as train driver, assistant,
      infrastructure maintenance, or rolling stock.

      train driver training given by ciffco was also entered in the official records of professional french certifications (rncp), which will allow
      official professional qualifications to be issued. thus ciffco is now the first and only private training body able to issue this certification
      along with the french public operator. registration of the professional certification recognises the functions of train drivers and their
      qualifications.

      in 2014, more than 220,000 hours were devoted to the professional training of the workforce, the equivalent of just over 55 training
      hours per employee on average (versus 36 hours in 2013) an increase of around 65% compared with last year. this increase was spread
      across, in varying degrees, all subsidiaries of the group where training activity supported the growth in staff and business. the
      subsidiaries of gbrf and europorte france for example more than doubled the number of hours dedicated to training in 2014, an

17.2.6 diversity and equal opportunities

a) gender equality
professional equality between men and women is an important lever in the group’s diversity policy. respect for the principles of gender
equality is reflected in the application of an equal opportunities policy in recruitment, access to training, remuneration and promotion.
within this framework, an agreement on professional equality to eliminate the gender pay gap was reached by esgie with unions in
june 2009, and will remain in force indefinitely. this was reinforced by the signing, on 10 july 2013, of a 12-month action plan pursuing
human resources policies that aim to guarantee non-discrimination and gender equality.

in the united kingdom, there is a particular focus on wage equality: the ‘‘rate for the job’’ system ensures equitable remuneration, as
does the hays system (which measures, in particular, the importance and the difficulty of assigned responsibility) for esl salaried staff.

the human resources policies of every group entity are based on the inviolable principle of gender equality, and the charter of ethics and
behaviour addressed to all group employees describes the principles that must inspire the behaviour of every employee in relation to
respect for people, of which the principle of non-discrimination is one of the most important.

at 31 december 2014, the number of women employed by the group was 808. there were 171 women in management positions,
representing 21.3% of management staff.


b) employment and integration of disabled employees
disability is another important aspect of the group’s diversity policy, which supports the integration, professional training and continued
employment of disabled people. the group formalised its disabled policy in france by signing a three-year agreement in 2010 with the
unions for 2011-2013 to promote the employment of people with disabilities. for esgie, this agreement establishes the group’s policy
regarding the professional integration of disabled people in france. the schedule for negotiations to renew this agreement was pushed
back to 2015.

at the same time as promoting the continued employment of disabled people, the group works with groups providing support to the
disabled, by approaching employment agencies for the disabled and/or job centres. an agreement, still current, was drawn up in 2010
for the benefit of disabled workers with afapei (association frontalière des parents et amis de l’enfance inadaptée) on behalf of esgie.
an agreement was also drawn up between cap energie and esgie for two contracts, valid up to 31 may 2015. one contract
concerns the upkeep of green spaces at the coquelles site (15,034 hours were spent at the site in 2014), and the other focuses on the
cleaning of network buses and service vehicles (1,500 hours at the site in 2014). on 23 july 2013, a framework partnership agreement
was signed between the eurotunnel group and the french association for disabled people association des paralysés de france (apf),
in which the group undertook to approach apf for any services falling within its sphere of competence. pursuant to this partnership, in
accordance with the commitments undertaken by the group esgie has issued frequent service requests to the apf, and this led to an
exponential increase in the value of these services in 2014 almost five times over with respect to 2013 (c23,600 vs. c111,500).

the rate of employment of disabled workers in 2014 for esgie, europorte france and socorail, calculated on the basis of data provided
in the annual compulsory employment declaration sent to agefiph (the french national association which manages funds for the
professional integration of people with disabilities), was 4.36%, 0.42% and 0.94% respectively (2013: 4.10%, 0.27% and 0.92%).

it is not possible to collect data for this indicator from the group’s british entities as there is no specific ‘‘disabled worker’’ status in the
united kingdom. however, they – like all other group entities – are bound by the commitments and fundamental principles of the
group’s charter of ethics and behaviour and have an equal opportunities policy intended to ensure that all employees are treated
identically.

      c) combating discrimination
      eurotunnel group is openly committed to combating discrimination in its charter of ethics and behaviour. moreover, the group is a
      signatory to the united nations global compact, and fully adheres to its ten fundamental principles, particularly those relating to human
      rights and rights at work.

      the group’s human resources policies are also geared towards combating discrimination, and are designed to guarantee equal
      treatment and opportunities for all employees at every stage of their career. the group never bases its decisions on criteria linked to
      race, nationality, religion, ethnic origin, political opinions or union activities. the only valid decision-making criteria for eurotunnel group
      are each employee’s professional qualities, qualifications and skills. in december 2014 the eurotunnel group took the silver trophy for its
      human resources policy in the ‘‘human capital victories’’ awards organised by leaders league (the publisher of ‘‘décideurs’’ magazine).


      17.2.7 international conventions

      the eurotunnel group, which signed the united nations global compact in march 2013, endorses the fundamental conventions of the
      international labour organization (ilo). within the sphere of working rights, this endorsement means respecting the four fundamental
      values of the ilo: freedom of association and recognition of the right to collective bargaining, elimination of all forms of forced and
      compulsory labour, effective abolition of child labour and elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. of
      these four values, freedom of association and elimination of discrimination are the two principles that most concern the group, and
      which it unreservedly endorses, bearing in mind that the company is based in europe where social laws have prohibited all forms of
      forced and compulsory labour and to combat child labour since the beginning of the 20th century.

      eurotunnel concentrates on promoting diversity as a lever for performance in order to better reflect the community in which it operates.
      for this reason it is committed jointly with réseau alliances to promoting a job accompaniment programme specially dedicated to young
      people of immigrant origin. named hiring dynamics group (groupe de dynamique d’embauche), this programme mobilises employees
      of the group for a period of nine months. it is a voluntary commitment for the employees involved in the programme. in 2015, the
      eurotunnel group decided to continue the commitment, made in 2014, to youth in partnership with réseau alliances.


      17.2.8 employee share ownership and profit-sharing

      a) share options
      the general meeting of shareholders of 26 may 2010 authorised the board of directors to grant, on one or more occasions, options on
      shares in the company to executive employees and corporate officers of get se and its subsidiaries, for a period of 38 months from the
      date of the said general meeting, provided the total number of shares over which options are granted does not exceed
      3,900,000 shares each with a nominal value of c0.40. pursuant to this authorisation, the board approved three grants in 2010, 2011
      and 2012.

the terms and conditions of the share option grants are set out in note s to the consolidated financial statements in paragraph 20.3.1 of
this registration document.


b) grant of free shares
the eurotunnel group pursues an active policy of engaging shareholder employees in order that they can share in the company’s
success. thus, on 29 april 2014, for the third time the board of directors awarded a total of 369,100 shares to all get se personnel and
related companies or groups (excluding executives or corporate officers of get se), allocating 100 shares to each employee.

the definitive vesting of these shares is subject to attendance and continued ownership conditions for a minimum period of 4 years. in
total, 667,430 shares representing 0.12% of the capital were acquired by staff on 28 april 2014; the shares in question cannot be
transferred for two years. as at 31 december 2014, 930,420 free shares representing 0.17% of the capital remained to be vested.

the terms and conditions relating to the grant of free shares are set out in note s to the consolidated financial statements in
paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.

employee shareholdings in get se
all staff employed by the french subsidiaries of get se can invest in shares in a company savings plan. any such subscriptions are
supplemented, within certain limits, by a contribution of 25% paid by the company. at 31 december 2014, 722,700 shares were held in
the plan, representing 0.13% of the share capital in issue on that date.


c) employee profit-sharing schemes
in france, a performance-related bonus plan was put in place for europorte sas on 1st january 2014; the europorte proximité
performance-related bonus plan is under negotiation and shall be applicable in 2015. in 2014, each esgie employee received
c1,823 from a performance-related bonus plan.

whilst this scheme is not directly transposable to the united kingdom, esl staff benefit from a performance-related bonus plan which
enabled them to receive £1,063 per employee for esl and £1,500 per employee for gbrf in 2014.

in the absence of any taxable income for the french companies, employees of those companies did not benefit from any profit-sharing
scheme in 2014.




17.3. information regarding social commitments to
support sustainable development

social engagement is profoundly rooted in the history and culture of the eurotunnel group. this engagement is essentially aimed at
promoting the integration of social responsibility issues within the group’s activities, dialogue with all its stakeholders and the socio-
economic development of the regions it deals with.

the eurotunnel group seeks to shape its environment in a positive manner. as an employer, it participates directly and consistently in
local economic development, and pursues its mission of developer in concert with stakeholders, while protecting the environment.
therefore, properties held by the group in coquelles (pas-de-calais) have been gradually transformed into a 700-hectare integrated
development zone, which includes, among other things, a shopping centre in france, with an average of 6 million visitors per year. this
territorial development role has continued with the planned development of the porte des deux-caps seaside eco-village in sangatte-
blériot-plage, pas-de-calais.

used by almost 350 million travellers, the tunnel has for nearly 20 years been a vital link between the united kingdom and mainland
europe. since the tunnel came into operation, it has created 8,100 direct and indirect jobs in the kent and pas-de-calais regions, and
led to the building of large-scale associated infrastructure: notably new roads, high-speed railway lines and international railway stations.




                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                129

17 corporate social responsibility

      the group is also involved in raising the awareness of its customers (more than 30,000 travellers every day on average) on sustainable
      development issues, by accommodating three wind turbines on the coquelles site (promoting renewable energy) and an apiary (for the
      protection of biodiversity). this awareness-raising is maintained by regular communication campaigns, through the display of
      information on-board the shuttles and in the terminals.

      the eurotunnel group supports, adheres to and actively participates in the lille world forum of responsible economy and the values it
      promotes. it also supports the fundamental values of the united nations global compact, as indicated in sections 17.2.6 and 17.2.7 of
      this registration document.


      17.3.1 social commitment: aligning the interests of the group with
      those of the community

      a)   links to the local community
      • stimulating the local job market:
      pursuing its role as a developer, eurotunnel group, through its subsidiary euro immo get, was chosen in january 2013 by the
      municipality of sangatte-blériot-plage to develop the seaside eco-village and golf course of the porte des deux-caps. this project aims
      to build an international-standard golf course, a luxury hotel, and an eco-friendly residential development of 500 dwellings. the
      operation is expected to generate employment in the area, particularly by making the area more attractive to tourism.

      pursuant to the regeneration agreement signed in 2006 with the french state, eurotunnel group continues to contribute financially and
      through its expertise to calais promotion, the development agency of the pas-de-calais region. this contribution was earmarked
      primarily for support to job creation. similarly, the group provides financial support and actively participates in the cross border jobs
      fair, a local initiative that facilitates the professional mobility of young people between france, the united kingdom and belgium.

      in france, europorte as a whole is developing its rail freight haulage activities, which enable disused marshalling yards and railway lines,
      as well as lines with restricted traffic, to continue operating or to be brought back into service. however, in view of the lack of political
      impetus on the part of the authorities responsible for the development of transport infrastructures, the steady deterioration or even
      disappearance of feeder networks could, as indicated in chapter 4 of this registration document, have a detrimental impact on epf’s
      revenue, which generates a third of its business from grain transportation.

      • public-private partnership
      under an agreement similar to a public-private partnership, the eurotunnel group is financing, alongside the french state, the
      nord-pas-de-calais region, the cic côte d’opale, and the urban community of dunkirk and the sncf réseau, feasibility studies on the
      modernisation of the fréthun-calais-dunkirk railway line, which would involve its electrification and an increase in rail freight path
      availability.

      • community support
      a key player in the natural, economic and human environment, the eurotunnel group exercises its social responsibility through concrete
      commitments and community support:
         – payment since 2010 of 10% of the land rental of the wind farm on its coquelles site to secours populaire, which distributes them
             in the form of ‘‘energy vouchers’’ to families in pas-de-calais. a fourth cheque for 3,000 euros was paid over on 11 march 2014.
             having expired, the partnership agreement between the eurotunnel group and secours populaire is in the process of being
             renewed for two more years (2015-2017).
         – active support of the french fondation de la 2ème chance, a recognised public-interest group committed to the rehabilitation of
             people who have suffered great hardship.
         – commitment to the work of the fondation agir contre l’exclusion (face), which offers assistance to those most in need. several
             part-time employment contracts were signed after 2013 between esgie and a person supported by face calais. the last
             contract to date was signed on 11 december 2014.
         – community support for the association papa tohanga, a social assistance association for people in the democratic republic of
             the congo of which the founding president is a member of the esgie staff. in 2014, 120 items of uniform were donated to the
             association.
         – joint activity carried out together with the french red cross benefiting customers of the concession’s french terminal. a
             partnership agreement was established on 1st january 2014 between esgie and the red cross. another agreement was signed
             on the same day with ‘‘moto école du calaisis’’ to make the facilities of the french terminal available to them.
         – engagement of its employees in humanitarian and charity projects for foundations such as macmillan, stode park, pink day and
             age uk, which fund medical research against cancer and provide support to patients, the elderly and the disabled.

   –   the british sharegift foundation collects securities offered by generous shareholders to charities. in 2013, it collected
       300 donations from eurotunnel group shareholders for a total amount of £15,000, which will be distributed to various charities
       suggested by the donors.

• sponsorship
the eurotunnel group financially supports the world forum for responsible economy of lille. launched by the réseau alliances, this
organisation aims to promote a responsible global economy, by sharing the best business practices of responsible companies.

• openness to the community
for the fourth consecutive year, on 20 september 2014 the tunnel terminal in coquelles was opened to nearly 900 visitors from across
the nord-pas-de-calais region as part of the european heritage days. this was made possible by the voluntary participation of some
40 esgie and esl employees. this initiative also took place at folkestone on 13 september, where 500 people were able to visit
facilities at the british terminal, including the rail control centre. in view of the event’s success, the number of places available for visitors
will be increased in future.


b) education
as a group committed to its environment and beyond that, society, eurotunnel supports education and culture, as it understands that
sharing knowledge is a key factor in boosting equal opportunities. its actions in this field mainly revolve around raising awareness of
sustainable development, railway-related training and economic and cultural exchanges between france and the united kingdom.

• raising awareness of csr among young people
in its efforts to protect the environment, the eurotunnel group not only strives to limit the impact of its activities on the environment, but
has also resolutely applied itself to shaping it for the better. samphire hoe provides a good example of what the group is capable of: a
35-hectare site at the foot of the dover cliffs, samphire hoe was created using 5 million cubic metres of blue chalk and marl extracted
from the channel sub-soil as the tunnel was dug. this piece of land on the coast has gradually been turned into a nature reserve.
day-to-day management of this protected site is the responsibility of the white cliffs countryside partnership, supported by many
volunteers from in and around kent.

samphire hoe welcomed more than 100,000 visitors in 2014. on 28 november 2014, the eurotunnel group and its partners opened a
new visitor centre in samphire hoe to provide groups from schools with a fully-equipped educational space all year round.

co-financed by eurotunnel and the heritage lottery fund as part of the up on the downs landscape partnership, the centre notched
up its very first educational function with a group of primary school pupils.

simple yet fully effective, the new ‘‘shelter’’ will be an educational space, a meeting place and a location for exhibitions and information,
allowing visitors to appreciate the scenery and local heritage around dover and folkestone.

• links with young people and educational establishments
created in 2011 by the eurotunnel group, an international railway training centre, ciffco contributes to the creation of skilled jobs and
professional development. it is a key driver in the development of railway transport and related professions and, more generally, seeks to
boost the economic development and reputation of the nord-pas-de-calais region. ciffco is equipped with eight training rooms and
eight mobile driving simulators. in 2014, it provided a total of 7,235 training days to 861 people from all over france, as well as from
belgium, switzerland, italy and the united kingdom.

furthermore, in terms of its impact on the region, it should be noted that ciffco’s activities in 2014 generated 7,000 overnight stays in
hotels and accommodation facilities located in the calais region (compared with 1,485 in 2013, which represents almost a five-fold
increase).

the eurotunnel group is a founding member of the fer de france association which was created in 2012 and brings together the leading
players in the french railway industry. work conducted by this association led to proposals for the french state to recognise different
professions in this developing sector.

in this field, europorte has been responsible for two major initiatives:
• implementation and development of a qualifying training programme in disciplines relating to railway engineering and maintenance,
    in close collaboration with the french national conservatory of arts and crafts (cnam).
• partnership with e2c grand lille (the greater lille ‘‘second chance’’ school) for the social and professional insertion of young people
    aged between 18 and 25 with no qualifications and no job, offering them professional training contracts or traineeships with the

      as part of its commitment to young people, the group develops relations with universities and schools in order to promote greater
      knowledge of the jobs it offers and help young people enter the world of work. it has therefore established several partnerships:
      • agreement with the ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées leading to the creation of a ‘‘rail transport sciences’’ teaching and
         research chair until 2018 devoted to the study of the rail industry. this chair aims to approach training and research on issues linked
         to infrastructure and transport services. the group is to contribute c150,000 a year to financing this chair for five years. this initiative
         confirms the group’s commitment to sharing its expertise to advance science and innovation, and position the railway industry as a
         profession for the future.
      • the group has partnerships with the catholic institute of arts and crafts (icam, lille) and the institute of business administration
         (iae, lille).

      every year, different group entities provide opportunities to embark on work-study programmes. contracts have been entered into with
      numerous secondary schools and universities:
      • polytech’lille;
      • cnam (ile-de-france);
      • ciffop (paris);
      • and various institutions, including ensam, ensiam, icam, télécom lille, esiee, isep, cfai and acm.

      the various subsidiaries of the group also take on interns, apprentices and young people under professional training contracts. in
      france, 84 interns, 89 apprentices and 75 young people under professional training contracts were taken on in 2014. these figures
      mark a sharp increase compared with the previous year, particularly in the number of apprentices, which increased from 55 to 89 and
      that almost doubled (75 against 40 in 2013) the number of people on training contracts, in addition, esgie welcomed three young
      graduates as part of the international business volunteering scheme. this enables french businesses to give a young person (up to the
      age of 28) a professional post abroad.


      c) transfer and sharing of technological and specialist skills
      the eurotunnel group lends its expertise in managing transport infrastructure and rail activities to research, training and different public
      bodies at the european, national and regional levels.

      in research and development, the eurotunnel group is a founding member of railenium, the european institute for technological
      research in rail infrastructure, located near valenciennes and chosen by the french state as ‘‘an investment programme of the future’’.
      the group is therefore actively participating in the design of a smarter, safer rail infrastructure which is also more sustainable
      and economical.

      the eurotunnel group is also collaborating with the european committee for standardisation as part of the working group responsible
      for drafting a proposed standard for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions of transport services.

      the eurotunnel group is an active member of i-trans, which is both a global competitiveness cluster and a benchmark cluster for rail
      transport in france. the group human resources director is part of the pilot working group of capfor the mandates of which are to
      strengthen existing structures to meet the expectations of industry players, create a regional talent pool and to develop the high level
      structures with an international scope.

      in france, the eurotunnel group is working with the freight transport committee of the french observatoire energie environnement
      transports, to which the french ministry of the environment entrusted the implementation of the obligation to display the carbon content
      of transport services, which came into force in october 2013.


      17.3.2 good business practices: engaging faithfully and responsibly

      relations between the eurotunnel group and its suppliers go beyond simply purchasing goods and services. in accordance with the
      principles set out in the ethical charter adopted by the board of the eurotunnel group, the acha 0019 procedure sets out the ethical
      standards the group expects of all its employees. these standards not only ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations,
      but – legal criteria apart – they make it possible to build a climate of trust in exchanges between group representatives and third parties.
      each group buyer or other member of staff undertakes to respect the code of ethics and to seek suppliers who share these
      commitments. the tender process is designed to guarantee the fair treatment of suppliers during consultations. the group is now
      operating as a collection of entities in various business sectors and geographical areas. these ethical standards are applicable to this
      group of entities and must be strictly adhered to by all operating entities and by staff at all levels of the organisation. failure by group
      employees to abide by these ethical rules can lead to disciplinary action.

in january 2012, the eurotunnel group signed the ‘‘charter for responsible supplier relations’’. this charter, which seeks to establish and
improve lasting relations between suppliers and buyers, includes ten commitments for responsible purchases, ensuring a genuine
partnership between customers and their suppliers with due regard to their respective rights and obligations. it is committed, in
particular, to ensuring financial equity towards suppliers, to respecting the principle of transparency, to incorporating environmental
issues and even to ensuring the territorial responsibility of its company. it thereby represents a measure intended to prevent corruption.

the eurotunnel group is also a member of steering committees for the ‘‘responsible supplier relations’’ charter and certification, and
has clearly demonstrated its wish to be a part of this certification process, as an extension of the implementation of the charter’s ten
engagements.

in representing the group’s csr values and engagements, the procurement divisions of the various entities have taken actions that,
beyond the reference made in all new contracts to the eurotunnel group’s charter of ethics and behaviour, require their suppliers to
comply with its fundamental principles and to sign the compliance policy (article 23). article 23.2.1 requires that suppliers ‘‘comply with
the french regulations on corruption, as well as uk corruption laws, notably the bribery act 2010.

as a signatory of the united nations global compact, the eurotunnel group endorses its fundamental principles, including the tenth
principle, which states that ‘‘businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery’’.

the concessionaires include as part of their tendering process for sub-contracted work on their sites a sustainable development
element. sub-contractors are also expected to commit contractually to respecting labour laws and regulations. europorte operates
principally on its customers’ sites, and thus, in the management of port infrastructure, europorte will pass on the port authorities’
requirements in its own sub-contracting agreements.


17.3.3 consumers: respecting all our customers’ interests

a) customer and consumer relations
the ‘‘terminal 2015’’ project, described in section 6.2.4 underlines customer satisfaction as one of its core concerns. in both france and
the united kingdom, the toll screens of the truck shuttles were redesigned, reducing the number of screens displayed to customers.
other initiatives undertaken at the french terminal throughout 2014 have contributed to improving safety and customer satisfaction. the
lay out of the waiting areas for example enabled waiting times inside and outside the terminal to be reduced. the planting of defensive
hedges and modifications to the ventilation system on board the truck shuttles has contributed to providing greater safety and better
customer comfort.


b) customer safety and security
the safety of its customers and their belongings is a top priority for the eurotunnel group.

every year, the eurotunnel group organizes a bi-national safety exercise, known as binat, in addition to the organisation described in
section 17.2.4 (health and safety committee).

on 25 january 2014, binat organised involved the evacuation of a high-speed passenger train, mobilising 565 extras, mediators and
observers, four stts vehicles (service tunnel transport system) and one stts ambulance.


17.3.4 human rights

a) human rights and fundamental principles of the international labour organization
in its charter of ethics and behaviour, the eurotunnel group reaffirms that it adheres to the principles and values of the universal
declaration of human rights of 1948, the fundamental conventions of the international labour organization (ilo), the guidelines of the
organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) for multinational companies, and the principles of the united nations
global compact, as indicated in section 17.2.6 ‘‘diversity and equal opportunities’’ of this registration document.


b) diversity, equal opportunities and combating discrimination
the eurotunnel group is officially committed to combating discrimination in its charter of ethics and behaviour and through equitable
human resources policies in recruitment, pay and training.

on the issue of disability, the group continues to promote the employment of disabled employees directly or by working with groups
providing support to the disabled as indicated in section 17.2.6 ‘‘diversity and equal opportunities’’ of the registration document.

      17.4. environmental information

      17.4.1 general environmental policy

      as part of its commitment to low-carbon transport, the group pursues an ambitious strategy combining development of its core activity,
      cross-channel transport, with external growth in its two main businesses and areas of expertise other than the fixed link: infrastructure
      management and rail transport.

      in line with this strategy, the eurotunnel group and the europorte subsidiaries are developing a broad-based offering of rail freight
      transport and associated logistics services throughout france and the united kingdom. the group is committed to leading the way in
      environmentally-responsible transport and makes its expertise and leadership available to its subsidiaries and customers to help them
      reduce the carbon footprint of their activities.

      regarding the costs undertaken to prevent the environmental impact of the company’s activities, these were incurred during the tunnel’s
      construction and basically consist of separate networks for collecting rain and waste water, retention ponds, treatment plants, etc. as
      indicated in section 17.1 of this registration document, there is no separate budget for the group’s csr policy.

      the group has made no provisions against environmental risks, nor did it pay out any court-ordered compensation for environmental
      damage. the obligation to put in place a financial guarantee, as defined in article l. 516-1 of the french environmental code, against
      any environmental damage does not apply to the group’s activities.

      the tunnel and its rail transport system provide certain intrinsic environmental advantages:
      • an underground link that does not interfere in any way with the marine environment; and
      • the use of electric power for haulage produces minimal atmospheric pollution and much lower greenhouse gas emissions than
         fossil fuels.

      as early as 2002, the concessionaires installed an environmental management system based on the requirements of the iso 14001
      standard, and trained environmental officers and internal auditors. an ‘‘environmental requirements’’ clause has also been introduced
      into agreements with its sub-contractors.

      every year, targeted audits are carried out in france and the united kingdom by the safety and sustainable development directorate. in
      2014, ten internal audits were carried out: six in the operational divisions and four in relation to sub-contractors. besides complying with
      legal and regulatory requirements (a regulatory review is carried out each month), as part of its continued commitment to the
      environment, esgie set up a safety and sustainable development directorate in 2006. safety is absolutely essential for the eurotunnel
      group, and combining it with a strong sustainable development policy shows how important these issues are for the company.

      as part of their induction to the company, every new employee learns about the company’s environmental policy, targets and the
      organisation put in place to minimise the environmental impacts of its activity.

      in france, europorte’s core activity, rail freight, is a perfect fit with the chief policy aim of france’s environmental round table programme
      (grenelle environnement), which seeks to develop more efficient and less carbon-intensive freight transport. europorte provides support
      and assesses the needs of its customers with the aim, wherever possible and economically viable, of switching freight from road to rail.

      europorte works in four main areas to contribute to the national commitment to rail freight:
      • to help develop intermodal transport (and so move more containers by train);
      • to act as a local train operator serving the regions and areas around ports with light and appropriate organisations and improving rail
         services to the major french ports, major entry points for high-volume freight;
      • to contribute to group thinking on developing high-speed rail freight between airports;
      • to contribute, via a path-quality agreement with sncf réseau, to more efficient management of train paths.

      prompted by the group, europorte has embarked on its own environmental strategy. alongside the implementation of transparent
      reporting on abstraction from and discharge into the environment, an environmental impact assessment of the activities of europorte’s
      french entities was completed in 2013, resulting in various measures being taken to mitigate this impact:
      • optimisation of energy consumption to reduce contributions to the greenhouse effect;
      • creation of appropriate mechanisms for sorting/collecting and treating the various types of waste produced;
      • selection of environmentally friendly products;
      • creation of green areas for parking and engine maintenance;

•   improved management of hazardous situations in conjunction with its customers;
•   raising awareness about eco-citizen practices among staff.

in addition to these general policy initiatives, specific objectives were set:
• socorail: to take environmental criteria into account when planning maintenance programmes for its shunting engines (oil leaks and
    particulate emissions from engines). a five-year investment plan was drawn up, which includes the complete renovation of two to
    three shunting engines per year on average, and the overhaul of components on a case-by-case basis. at the end of 2014, 40% of
    the socorail site was equipped with new-generation engines.
• europorte france: an eco-driving approach involving both raising the awareness of drivers of main line trains regarding the impact of
    their driving behaviour on energy consumption, and the installation of technical equipment allowing a reduction in consumption by
    locomotives, as well as driver assistance systems depending on the characteristics of the network and the train, making it easier to
    drive in a more eco-friendly fashion.
• in 2014, europorte and its longstanding partner malteurope fr-all set up a reflection cell for good csr practices, a working group
    that sets out to streamline csr action at each company and create synergies wherever possible.

since 2011, europorte’s central safety, quality and environment department, and more specifically the quality/environment service, has
been responsible for rolling out and implementing this policy at french subsidiaries. initiatives are taken up in each region by the regional
head of quality and safety.

the sqas rail (safety and quality assessment system) was carried out in 2014 across all europorte’s french subsidiaries. europorte is
thus involved in a process of continuous improvement, verified every 3 years by sqas. the assessment established an overall score of
86%, and will be conducted in addition to mase and iso 9001 certification as indicated in paragraph 4.2.6 of this registration
document.

within the framework of the regulatory developments ensuing from france’s environmental round table programme, socorail has been
ecophyto certified since 2013 for weed control activities conducted on the rail networks of certain ports and industrial sites. the system
put in place is intended to limit the use of phytosanitary products and better control their impact.

in the united kingdom, environmental risk management is at the heart of gbrf’s operations: every new traffic flow or change to existing
traffic flows is subject to a risk assessment, including environmental risks. this environmental risk management system has enabled
gbrf to gain iso 14001:2004 accreditation without interruption since 2006. the company is audited every six months by the british
standards institute, which ensures gbrf properly adheres to its environmental risk management system.

gbrf’s safety management department is responsible for the successful implementation of the annual environmental action plan. a
number of initiatives such as tests on the use of fuel additives, fuel management systems on board locomotives, replacement of
locomotive injection systems and economic driving techniques have now been carried out. the most recent initiative is new technology
using gps to help drivers optimise traction power.

the general policy of europorte subsidiaries on both sides of the channel lays down environmental considerations that require
europorte to be involved in controlling its environmental impacts, particularly in energy consumption. progress on the resulting
environmental action plans is monitored monthly by the europorte safety committee, chaired by the europorte chairman on the french
side, and by gbrf’s executive safety committee on the british side.


17.4.2 risk prevention, pollution and waste management

the group has a waste collection and treatment strategy that prioritises recovery or reuse. most waste products come from industrial
activities and vary in type and quantity from year to year depending on the projects being run at the time.

the quantity of hazardous industrial waste produced in france and the uk fell significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year
(by 21% and 34% respectively). this reduction, mainly in relation to europorte in france, was mainly due to a major fall in product waste



                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

      from the gray maintenance facility. the fall in the uk was due to the absence of any exceptional operations in 2014 at the fixed link’s
      british terminal, as was the case in 2013, when 135,000 litres of polluted water were used during maintenance at the facilities. the slight
      increase in the treatment of non-hazardous waste (around 17%) at group level was essentially due to europorte’s destocking at le
      havre and la rochelle of waste that had been stored there for several years, and to new projects carried out at the concession’s
      uk terminal.

      the eurotunnel group takes steps to address air quality and the emissions impact of its activities. notably, the diesel locomotives that
      pull concession works trains have been fitted with catalytic converters since 2007. elsewhere, measures were taken to bring the outflow
      chimneys used in the ventilation system for paint workshops into compliance with volatile organic compound emission standards.

      the noise of commercial activities and maintenance is also closely monitored around installations. a 2009 study showed that the
      activities of the fixed link breached no noise standards, either at the edge of the property or in regulated surrounding areas, during the
      day or at night. measurements were taken in compliance with (i) the technical annex to the ministerial order dated 23 january 1997 on
      limiting environmental noise by installations classified for environmental protection (icpe) without derogating from any of its provisions,
      and (ii) standard nf s 31-010 of december 1996 on the characterisation and measurement of environmental noise – specific
      measurement methods.

      pursuant to french law no 76-663, of 19 july 1976 relating to installations classified for the protection of the environment, both terminals
      in coquelles and sangatte are designated icpe sites due to the potential dangers and risks that its activities may pose to the
      surrounding area and to health, safety, nature and the environment, such as: refrigeration, air-conditioning, storage and use of
      flammable liquids, workshops and paints. these activities are set out in a list which, on the basis of the severity of the dangers or risks
      that they may represent, requires eurotunnel group to either make a declaration to or request authorisation from the préfecture of the
      pas-de-calais in respect of them. these activities are monitored by the regional authority for the environment, planning and housing
      (dreal).

      similarly, pursuant to french law no. 92-3 of 3 january 1992 on water, the concessionaire france manche must request the
      authorisation of the relevant administrative authority for any proposed construction, works or activities to be carried out outside of the
      icpe area, which may pose a danger to public health and safety, endanger the free flow of water, reduce the availability of water,
      substantially increase the risk of floods or seriously damage the quality or diversity of the marine environment.

      regarding air quality, in france, europorte has been using very low sulphur diesel in its main line locomotives and shunting engines since
      2011. almost all the waste produced comes from the maintenance of rolling stock and rail infrastructure. at industrial sites, waste
      management procedures are generally the responsibility of the customer. europorte only applies its own waste management
      procedures to its port rail infrastructure services at dunkirk, nantes-st. nazaire and le havre-rouen, and europorte proximité’s
      locomotive maintenance workshop at arc-les-gray. in both these activities, waste is sorted internally and then sent to a third party for
      treatment. in the same way, regarding gbrf, most waste is generated by the maintenance of rolling stock, which is done by
      sub-contractors. gbrf monitors sub-contractor waste tracking forms. measures to prevent soil pollution were strengthened at the
      europorte proximité workshop by the introduction of a system for the dry-washing of locomotives.

      regarding noise, one major source is wheel flats on wagons. europorte does not own wagons and its technical management therefore
      takes a three-pronged approach to this issue: (i) systematically refusing wagons with wheel flats of more than 60 mm, (ii) supporting
      customers and wagon-owners generally in anticipating and remedying these problems, and (iii) taking part in working groups on
      improving the quality of the wagon fleets.

      europorte has equipped all its equipment with noise dampers, which have cut noise pollution from escaping compressed air during
      brake tests prior to running by about half.

17.4.3 sustainable use of resources

as the eurotunnel group and its subsidiaries provide service activities which do not consume a significant quantity of raw materials, no
other indicator relating to the conservation of natural resources has been developed. nevertheless, a summary table of energy
consumption by the group is set out below:

                                                                                                                     total

group consumption sourced from groundwater fell by 18% compared to 2013, a year during which major cleaning works were carried
out at the fixed link, which were not renewed in 2014. although water is a plentiful resource in the pas-de-calais area, the eurotunnel
group has nevertheless tracked water consumption by the fixed link since it came into service. generally, the consumption of water
sourced from the public network increased by 4% this year against the previous year, mainly due to cleaning operations at the french
terminal.

the concessionaires have large land banks in france and the united kingdom, and have, since the tunnel’s construction, created
several dozen hectares of nature reserves for the conservation and promotion of biodiversity, including samphire hoe, described in
paragraph 17.3.1. b) of this registration document. in france, nature reserves are located within the concession perimeter and so are
not open to the public. they are, however, visited by numerous species of migratory birds in winter and shelter many breeding pairs
during the nesting season.

almost all water consumption at europorte subsidiaries is used for sanitary purposes in the buildings and sites used by staff.

europorte prioritises the use of electric locomotives wherever technical constraints and economic viability considerations allow.

europorte is also continuing to study the solutions that locomotive builders may be offering over the next five years for developing hybrid
electric/diesel engines.

*     since no gbrf. site is equipped with a counter, the europorte france ratio, for which the activities are close, was applied. this extrapolation method
      tends to accentuate the changes observed at the sites equipped with counters. for example, the reduction in water consumption observed at the gray
      workshop had an impact on the estimated water consumption of all the europorte and gbrf sites.


17.4.4 climate change

in 2011, the group’s management of greenhouse gas emissions was audited by the independent organisation carbon trust standard,
which set the baseline level of greenhouse gas emissions for the whole of the eurotunnel group’s activities at 2010 levels. future
progress will be measured against this baseline.

the eurotunnel group is developing a policy for monitoring and managing the greenhouse gas emissions of its subsidiaries in
anticipation of the publication of the implementing regulations for article 228 – ii of the grenelle 2 law regarding the information that must
be provided by any person providing or procuring the provision of transport services on the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted by the
mode(s) of transport used to perform this service.

17 corporate social responsibility

      the eurotunnel group is mindful of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by its activities. with the help of specialists using the
      assessment method (bilan carbone) accredited by ademe, a carbon footprint assessment was carried out in france and the
      united kingdom in 2006 / 2007. this assessment included emissions generated by electricity consumption used to haul shuttles,
      eurostar trains, and train operators’ rail freight services through the tunnel, emissions generated by workshops, diesel works trains
      and road vehicles used for staff transport, deliveries and catering. it also includes all emissions linked to the construction of infrastructure
      and the associated construction materials.

      the carbon footprint assessment identified the fixed link’s primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and was followed by an
      action plan focused on two factors that accounted for approximately 80% of the emissions: the use of energy provided by electricity and
      fossil fuels, and emissions from refrigeration fluids.

      in addition to the steps taken by the group since 2011 as detailed above, in 2009, the group was accredited by the carbon trust
      standard following an audit of the group’s management of greenhouse gas emissions and its performance over the previous three
      years, which confirmed a 44% reduction in emissions between 2006 and 2008. the eurotunnel group’s data for 2013 and 2014 will be
      audited again by carbon trust. our continuation of this process has greatly increased our efficiency and boosted our position in the
      transport sector as a benchmark in terms of controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

      in 2014 europorte’s french subsidiaries undertook the tk blue label set up by the european tk blue agency. the tk blue index
      appraises the technical, economic, environmental and social performances of its transport offer. europorte applies the work-related
      travel policy of the group, which encourages the use of public and rail transport for work-related travel by its staff.

      in the united kingdom, the concessionaires, as managers of infrastructure of major importance to the british economy, were asked by
      the british department for environment, food and rural affairs (defra), in line with the 2008 climate change act, to carry out a study of
      its infrastructure’s ability to withstand the foreseeable effects of climate change.

      gbrf will undergo a full energy audit in 2015 as part of the energy-saving opportunity scheme regulations (esos) 2014, to be
      conducted by independent experts. the audit will pinpoint the company’s main risks and opportunities in terms of reduction of energy
      consumption and environmental impact, and furnish a benchmark to gauge the results of its programme for continuous improvement.

      the eurotunnel group strives constantly to limit the impact of its activities on the environment. this year it reduced its greenhouse gas
      emissions by 6% compared to the previous year, i.e. more than 10,000 tonnes of co2 equivalent.

      the group has not been subjected to any fines of any type whatsoever nor has is it been subjected to any reports of non-compliance
      linked to its business.

      17.4.5 protection of biodiversity

      in this field, the eurotunnel group acts in accordance with the spirit and the text of the convention on biological diversity one of the main
      objectives of which is conserving biodiversity and sustainable use of its elements. the samphire hoe site is from this perspective a
      concrete example of the will of the group to act to promote biodiversity and to protect the environment. in 2014, the partnership
      between the concessionaires and the white cliffs countryside project (wccp) was given its tenth successive green flag award for its
      management of the samphire hoe site, which has made an impressive contribution to local biodiversity.

      doll’s house hill, the steep slope overlooking the folkestone terminal installations, is also an exceptional haven for animal and plant life
      recognised throughout the specialised scientific world. the concessionaires have undertaken to maintain and conserve this site – which
      forms part of a site of special scientific interest (sssi) like samphire hoe and the whole of the folkestone downs – again in partnership
      with the wccp.

the soil and plant life in biggins wood were lifted when the folkestone terminal was built and replanted close by, to conserve this
remnant of britain’s primary forest.

the whitemore marshalling yard in eastern england is managed for gbrf on behalf of network rail. this site includes a large number of
protected animal and plant species, and is classified as a site of special scientific interest (sssi).

in france, the ‘‘jardins ordonnés’’ with their seven hectares of water are a popular haven for migrating species and an essential
nest-building site for many birds.




17.5. indices

in 2014, the eurotunnel group was included in the following sustainable development indices: (i) the dow jones stoxx global esg
leaders, notably euro stoxx sustainability and stoxx europe sustainability; (ii) the gaia index, a socially responsible index for
mid-caps developed by idmidcaps and ethifinance for the fifth consecutive year. as a result, groupe eurotunnel se is regularly
monitored by several non-financial rating agencies.

in 2014, the eurotunnel group was placed seventh in the gaia index out of 113 companies in the sector.

the gaia index was established in 2009 by ethifinance with the support of sfaf and middlenext, and is a mid-cap index based on
non-financial data. it assesses companies’ level of commitment to sustainable development and social responsibility issues. the rating
is based on 119 criteria, including 29 relating specifically to the environment, 31 to social issues and 44 to governance.

for the fifth consecutive year, the eurotunnel group was among the 230 companies analysed and was selected as one of the 70 french
stocks to obtain the best non-financial ratings.

the gaia index, considered as a reference database in the world of sri (socially responsible investment), enables managers and
analysts to identify the most responsible companies and to take into account non-financial criteria in their analysis and investment
decisions. the panel reviewed represents revenues of more than c157 billion and more than one million jobs.

the eurotunnel group was included in the ftse4good index following its update performed in september 2014. the ftse4good index
measures the performance of companies with outstanding commitment to the environment, society and corporate social responsibility
(csr).

our work was carried out by a team of 7 people between october 2014 and march 2015.

we conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france and the legal order dated
may 13, 2013 determining the methodology according to which the independent third party body conducts its mission and, on the
reasoned opinion, in accordance with isae 3000(1).

we got acquainted with the direction that the group is taking, in terms of sustainability, with regard to the social and environmental,
consequences of the company’s business and its societal commitments and, where appropriate, the actions or programs that stemmed
from it.

we compared the csr information presented in the management report to the list set forth in article r. 225-105-1 of the french
commercial code.

in the event of omission of some consolidated information, we checked that explanations were provided in accordance with the third
paragraph of the article r. 225-105 of the french commercial code.

we checked that the csr information covers the consolidated scope, which includes the company and its subsidiaries within the
meaning of article l. 233-1 of the french commercial code (code de commerce) and the companies that it controls within the meaning
of article l. 233-3 of the french commercial code (code de commerce), subject to the limits set forth in the methodological note
presented in annex i of the management report.

based on our work, and taking into account the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required csr information has been

charge of the process of gathering information and, where appropriate, responsible of the internal control and risk management to:
• assess the appropriateness of the reporting criteria in terms of relevance, completeness, neutrality, clarity and reliability, by taking
   into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices;
• verify the set-up within the group of a process to collect, compile, process and check the csr information with regard to its
   completeness and consistency. we familiarized ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the
   compilation of the csr information.

we determined the nature and extent of tests and controls depending on the nature and importance of csr information in relation to the
characteristics of the company, the social and environmental issues of its operations, its strategic priorities in relation to sustainable
development, and the industry best practices.

concerning the csr information that we considered to be most significant (listed in annex):
• at parent entity level, we consulted source documents and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information
  (organization, policies, actions); we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative and verified, on the basis of sampling
  techniques, the calculations and consolidation of the information and we verified its consistency with the other information contained
  in the management report;
• at the level of a representative sample of entities(2) selected based on their activity, their contribution to consolidated indicators, their
  location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify the proper application of procedures and conducted substantive tests,
  using sampling basis, to verify the calculations performed and reconciled data with supporting evidence.

the selected sites contribution to group data equals to 61% of headcount and from 56% to 84% of the quantitative environmental
information tested.

regarding the other csr consolidated information, we assessed its fairness and consistency based on our knowledge of the group.

finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the omission of certain information.

      we deem that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have learned by exercising our professional judgment allow us to formulate a
      conclusion providing limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work. because of the use of
      sampling techniques, and because of other limits inherent to any information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a
      material misstatement in the csr information cannot be completely eliminated.


      conclusion
      based on our work, we did not identify any material misstatements that would lead us to believe that the csr information, taken as a
      whole, has not been fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.


      3.   reasonable assurance report on selected csr information

      regarding information selected by the group and identified by the symbol , we conducted similar work as described in paragraph 2
      above for csr information that we consider to be most significant but of greater depth, especially regarding the number of tests.

      the selected sites contribution to group data equals to 61% of headcount and between 56% to 84% of the quantitative environmental
      information identified by the symbol .

      we deem this work allows us to express a reasonable assurance on the information selected by the company and identified by the

      conclusion
      in our opinion, the information selected by the group and identified by the symbol  was prepared, in all material respects, in

registration document) in respect of the 78,026,402 shares held in registered form by aero continuously since 22 september 2009. in
addition, the declarant specified, pursuant to article 223-14 iii and iv of the general regulations, that it ‘‘held:

in the same letter, the following declaration of intent was made: ‘‘aero declares that:
• no financing method was used to the extent that the exceeding of thresholds results from allocation of double voting rights for
    ordinary shares held in registered form;
• neither the goldman sachs group, inc. or aero, who is controlled at the highest level by the goldman sachs group, inc., are acting
    jointly with a third party;

    which the holdings are held by two funds (gs global infrastructure partners i, l.p. et gs international infrastructure partners i, l.p.)
    managed by gs infrastructure advisors 2006 llc (together ‘‘gsip’’);
• aero has no intention to acquire further shares or voting rights;
• neither the goldman sachs group, inc. nor aero plans to take control of the groupe eurotunnel sa;

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements for the year
      ended 31 december 2014


      this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements issued in french and is
      provided solely for the convenience of english-speaking users.

      the statutory auditors’ report includes information specifically required by french law in such reports, whether modified or not. this
      information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph
      discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. these assessments were considered for
      the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance
      on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures.

      this report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the group’s management report.

      this report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, french law and professional auditing standards
      applicable in france.

      to the shareholders,

      in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
      31 december 2014, on:
      • the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of groupe eurotunnel se (ex groupe eurotunnel sa);
      • the justification of our assessments;
      • the specific verification required by law.

      these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these
      consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


      1 opinion on the consolidated financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
      misstatement. an audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit
      evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the
      appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation
      of the consolidated financial statements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
      basis for our audit opinion.

      in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of
      the group as at 31 december 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with international financial
      reporting standards as adopted by the european union.


      2 justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l.823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce), we bring to your attention
      the following matters.


      valuation of concession tangible assets
      in accordance with accounting policies described in note b.3.v of the consolidated financial statements and with note n.1 of such
      consolidated financial statements, the eurotunnel group performed an impairment test in order to ensure that the recoverable value of
      concession tangible assets was still greater than their book value. we examined the conditions of implementation of this test based on
      discounted future cash flows after tax and capital expenditures as well as the main assumptions and parameters used. we further
      examined sensitivity analysis performed. we also verified that note n.1 of the consolidated financial statements gives appropriate
      information.


      valuation of europorte in france assets and maritime segment ‘‘myferrylink’’ assets
      in accordance with accounting policies described in note b.3.v of the consolidated financial statements and with note n.2 of such
      consolidated financial statements, the eurotunnel group performed an impairment test in order to ensure that the recoverable value of
      both europorte in france’s assets and the maritime segment ‘‘myferrylink’’’s assets were still greater than their book value. we

examined the conditions of implementation of this test based on the market value of those assets, estimated by reference to studies
performed by independent experts. we also verified that note n.2 of the consolidated financial statements gives appropriate
information.

deferred taxes valuation
the group recognizes net deferred tax assets in balance sheet as described in note b.3.xiv and note k of the consolidated financial
statements. our work consisted in assessing the consistency and assumptions used by the eurotunnel group’s management with the
business plan in order to verify tax assets’ recoverability. we also verified that note k of the consolidated financial statements gives
appropriate information.


presentation of maritime segment and its assets
the group presented in note a of the consolidated financial statements information related the procedure with the british competition
and markets authority and mentioned the absence of accounting impact as at 31 december 2014. we have verified the presentation of
the maritime segment and its assets regarding ifrs 5. we also verified that note a of the consolidated financial statements gives
appropriate information.

these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed
to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.


3 specific verification
as required by law we have also verified, in accordance with professional standards applicable in france, the information presented in
the group’s management report.

we have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      notes to the financial statements

      the conversion of groupe eurotunnel sa into a european company, as voted by the shareholders’ combined ordinary and extraordinary
      general meeting held on 29 april 2014, took effect on 26 december 2014, the date on which the french trade and companies registry
      registered the company as a european company. the conversion does not result in the creation of a new legal entity. the duration of the
      company, the dates of the accounting period, the share capital, the registered office and the purposes of the company remain
      unchanged. the terms of the current mandates of the company’s directors and statutory auditors have been confirmed within the
      european company.

      groupe eurotunnel se is the consolidating entity of the eurotunnel group, whose registered office is at 3 rue la boétie, 75008 paris,
      france and whose shares are listed on euronext paris and on nyse euronext london. the term ‘‘groupe eurotunnel se’’ or ‘‘get se’’
      refers to the holding company which is governed by french law. the term ‘‘group’’ or ‘‘the eurotunnel group’’ refers to groupe
      eurotunnel se and all its subsidiaries.

      the main activities of the group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the fixed link’s infrastructure and transport
      system in accordance with the terms of the concession (which will expire in 2086), as well as rail freight and maritime activities.


      a. important events
      maritime activity: procedure before the uk competition and markets authority
      seafrance was liquidated on 9 january 2012. in july 2012, eurotunnel purchased three ferries as part of the asset disposal procedure
      conducted by the french tribunal de commerce, and sub-contracted the operation of the ferries to an independent company, scop
      seafrance. the ferries are owned by three subsidiaries of euro-transmanche holding sas, and the commercial activity is carried out by
      another subsidiary of euro-transmanche holding sas, myferrylink sas.

      on 9 january 2015, the competition appeal tribunal rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group and scop seafrance and
      confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
      the port of dover within the next six months. the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
      the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrance’s business, an interpretation that the group has always contested.

      the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
      ferries. due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries
      within a period of five years, any such sale before 2017 would need to be authorised by the tribunal.

      these decisions, which were taken after the end of the 2014 financial year, do not impact the consolidated financial statements at
      31 december 2014. financial information relating to the myferrylink segment is presented in note d below.

      on 6 february 2015, scop was granted permission by the uk court of appeal to appeal the decision of the competition appeal
      tribunal.


      b. basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
      b.1 statement of compliance
      the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those ifrs standards as adopted by the european union
      up to 31 december 2014. ifrs as adopted by the european union differ in certain aspects from those published by the iasb.
      nevertheless, the group has checked that the financial information for the periods presented would not have been substantially different
      if they had been prepared in accordance with ifrs as published by the iasb.

      the consolidated financial statements were finalised by the board of directors on 17 march 2015, and will be submitted for approval to
      the shareholders’ general meeting.


      b.2 basis of preparation and presentation of the consolidated accounts
      the consolidated accounts consist of the consolidation of the accounts of get se and its subsidiaries as set out in the table in note c
      below. the accounting periods of eurotunnel companies run from 1 january to 31 december.

      eurotunnel has control over the nature and price of the services it provides, and therefore does not meet the criteria set out in ifric 12
      relating to concession contracts.

   financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
                      and liabilities, financial position and results
                                                                                                                                                      

the following standards and interpretations published by the iasb and adopted by the european union became applicable to the group
on 1 january 2014:
• amendments to ias 32 ‘‘offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities’’, ias 36 ‘‘recoverable amount disclosures for
   non-financial assets’’ and ias 39 ‘‘‘novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge accounting’’.
• ifrs 10 ‘‘consolidated financial statements’’ which will replace ias 27 ‘‘consolidated and separate financial statements’’ for the
   part relating to consolidated financial statements as well as interpretation sic 12 ‘‘consolidation-special purpose entities’’.
• ifrs 11 ‘‘joint arrangements’’ which will replace ias 31 ‘‘interests in joint ventures’’ as well as the interpretation sic 13 ‘‘jointly
   controlled entities – non-monetary contributions by venturers’’.
• ifrs 12 ‘‘disclosure of involvement with other entities’’.
• revision to ias 27 renamed ‘‘separate financial statements’’ and ias 28 ‘‘investments in associates and joint ventures’’.

no significant impact resulting from the initial application of these standards has been identified.

the interpretation ifric 21 ‘‘levies imposed by governments’’ published by the iasb has been adopted by the european union for
mandatory application for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2015. this interpretation states that the obligating
event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the levy. the
group does not expect any significant effect to arise from the application of this standard.

the main texts which may be applicable to the group that have been published by the iasb but are not yet in force (not adopted by the
european union) are listed below. their potential impacts are being analysed.
• ifrs 9 ‘‘financial instruments: classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities’’. subject to its being adopted by the
   european union, this standard will be mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2018 following the
   decision by the iasb in february 2014.
• ifrs 15 ‘‘revenue from contracts with customers’’ for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2017.
• revision to ifrs 11 ‘‘joint arrangements’’ for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2016.
• revision to ias 16 ‘‘property, plant and equipment’’ and ias 38 ‘‘intangible assets’’ for accounting periods commencing on or after
   1 january 2016.

no other standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards are applicable to the group.


i.  exchange rates
get se’s company accounts and consolidated accounts are prepared in euros.

the accounts of the group’s british subsidiaries, and notably those of gbrf, ctg and its subsidiaries, are prepared in sterling and are
converted into euros as follows:
• retained reserves brought forward and concession property, plant and equipment and related depreciation, at historical rates.
• all other assets and liabilities at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period.
• income statement items, with the exception of the concessionaires’ depreciation, at the average rate for the year.
• exchange differences arising from the application of the above are included in the cumulative translation reserve in the statement of
   financial position.
• the closing and average c/£ exchange rates for 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

 g/£                                                                                                             2014                      2013

ii. use of estimates and judgements
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. the board of directors periodically
reviews its valuations and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered relevant for the determination of
reasonable and appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value.

the actual results could differ significantly from these estimates depending on different conditions and hypotheses. the use of
estimations concerns mainly the valuation of intangible and tangible property, plant and equipment (see notes m and n), the evaluation

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      b.3 significant accounting policies
      i.  business combinations and goodwill
      business combinations are recorded in accordance with the acquisition accounting method as set out in revised ifrs 3. under this
      method, the assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value.

      goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
      acquired. it is valued in the functional currency of the entity acquired and is accounted for in the statement of financial position.

      where the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the acquisition price, a negative goodwill is
      immediately recorded in the income statement.

      costs directly attributable to business combinations are accounted for in the period’s operating result.


      ii. interests in equity-accounted companies
      interests in equity-accounted companies include investments in entities in which the group has significant influence and jointly
      controlled entities. these investments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, including any goodwill arising. their carrying amount
      is then increased or decreased to recognise the group’s share of the entity’s profits or losses after the date of acquisition. should the
      losses be greater than the value of the group’s net investment in the equity-accounted entity, these would only be recognised to the
      extent that the group has entered into a commitment to recapitalise the entity.

      should there be an indication that an investment is impaired, its recoverable value is tested and impairment losses are recognised as a
      deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding investments.

      the eurotunnel group presents its share of the net result of equity-accounted investments whose operational nature is an extension to
      the group’s activity on a specific line of the income statement, between the ‘‘operating profit’’ and ‘‘operating profit after share of result of
      equity-accounted companies’’ lines.


      iii. intangible assets relating to commercial contracts
      intangible assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the commercial contracts.


      iv. tangible property, plant and equipment, and depreciation
      items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. property, plant and
      equipment is depreciated on a systematic basis in order to write down the costs of assets over their expected useful lives as follows:

      *      the concession expires in 2086.
      **     the depreciation period has been determined for each ferry based on an expected useful life of 30 years from their first date of entry into service.

      the expected useful lives of the assets are kept under review and revised when necessary, according to experience.

      concession property, plant and equipment whose useful life is greater than the duration of the concession, is depreciated over the life of
      the concession on a straight line basis. depreciation on assets whose useful life is less than the duration of the concession (‘‘renewable
      assets’’) is calculated on a straight line basis.

      as all property, plant and equipment will be written down to £nil at the end of the concession, depreciation of the final renewal cost of
      renewable assets will be based on the residual duration of the concession.

   financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets

                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                          20


the calculation for depreciation of the ferries takes account of their estimated residual value at the end of their useful lives, determined on
the basis of their scrap value.

subsidies on capital expenditure received during the year have been allocated to the asset to which they relate.


v. impairment of tangible property, plant and equipment
in accordance with ias 36, the carrying amounts of assets and groups of assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

in the eurotunnel group each activity segment represents a cash-generating unit (cgu), although, in certain circumstances, the cgu
may be made up of a single operating legal entity.

if any indication of impairment exists, an impairment test is carried out: the net book value of the asset is compared to its recoverable
amount. the recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and their value in use. the net selling price is
determined by reference to studies carried out by independent experts.

the value in use of cgus is calculated by discounting operating cash flows after taxation and capital expenditure incurred to replace
assets as forecast in the cgu’s business plan and validated by the group’s management as part of its operational management. the
period covered by the business plan is three years. for concession assets, cash flows are extrapolated on the basis of an assumption of
growth over the residual duration of the concession. for non-concession assets, the extrapolation is complemented by a terminal value
which is calculated on the basis of infinite free cash flows that continue growing at a moderate rate below inflation. the discount rate
retained is the wacc calculated per cgu at each year end. an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its recoverable amount.

goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test. the recoverable value is calculated for the cgu to which the goodwill belongs.


vi. retirement liabilities
the group provides for its legal and contractual obligations for retirement indemnities of employees under french contracts, and for the
defined benefit retirement schemes of employees under uk contracts operated by ctg and esl and gbrf’s retirement scheme. the
liability for defined benefits, recorded in the statement of financial position, is the present value of the obligation under defined benefit
plans at the end of the financial year less the fair value of plan assets. these liabilities are valued using the actuarial method of projected
unit of credit on the basis of actuarial valuations made at the end of each financial year. the current service cost of the period and the
interest on the obligation are accounted for in the ‘‘staff benefit expense’’ line of the consolidated income statement. valuation of the
liability for defined benefit plans in respect of (i) actuarial gains and losses, (ii) the actual return on plan assets and (iii) changes in the effect
of the asset ceiling benefits are recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.


vii. provisions
provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the related future
cash flows can be reliably estimated.


viii. financial instruments
financial assets
in accordance with ias 39, the group’s financial assets have been classified in one of the following four categories:
• financial assets at fair value through profit and loss;
• loans and receivables;
• held-to-maturity investments;
• available-for-sale financial assets.

the classification defines the accounting treatment of these instruments. the classification is designated by the group at the date of
initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. the purchase and sale of financial assets are
accounted for on the transaction date, being the date on which the group has contracted for the purchase or sale of the asset.


financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
these are financial assets held by the group for the purpose of generating a short-term profit, or assets designated to this category
at inception.

these assets are measured at their fair value with changes in the carrying amount being taken to the income statement.



                                                                                    2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      these financial instruments include short-term treasury investments which are classified as current assets in cash equivalents.


      loans and receivables
      loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not listed on an active market and that are not
      held for trading purposes and are not available for sale.

      these assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
      for short-term receivables that do not have a contractual rate of interest, the fair value is assimilated to the original invoiced amount
      except where the effective interest rate has a significant impact.

      these assets are subject to impairment tests if there is an indication of impairment losses. an impairment loss is recognised whenever
      the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount.

      receivables arising on shares and trade receivables are included in this category. they are shown as financial assets and as trade
      receivables.


      held-to-maturity investments
      held-to-maturity investments are financial assets, other than loans and receivables, with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
      maturity that the group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. at the end of the reporting period, the group has not
      designated any financial asset to this category.


      available-for-sale financial assets
      all financial assets that are not classified in another category are classified as available-for-sale. they are measured at their fair value.
      unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the asset’s sale or derecognition. however when there is objective evidence
      that an available-for-sale asset may be impaired, the cumulative net loss is recognised in profit or loss. impairments on equity securities
      cannot be reversed in subsequent accounting periods. the impairment criteria defined by the group for securities and shares (securities
      with variable returns) correspond to a prolonged or significant loss. for debt instruments, the impairment is only charged to the income
      statement when impairment is indicated that is related to a counterparty risk.

      fair value, for listed securities, equates to the market price. for unlisted securities, the fair value is determined by reference to recent
      transactions or by using valuation techniques incorporating reliable and observable market data. however, when no reliable estimate of
      the fair value of a security can be made, it is measured at historical cost. these assets are subject to impairment tests to establish their
      recoverability.

      this category includes shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other financial assets.


      financial liabilities
      financial liabilities include, in accordance with ias 39:
      • loans and bank overdrafts;
      • derivative liabilities.


      borrowings
      borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost according to the effective
      interest rate method.

      for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate, interest costs are recognised at a constant interest rate until maturity of the debt
      using the effective interest rate method. the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts all of the contractual cash flows due
      on the debt until its maturity. these cash flows are calculated on the basis of the estimated cash flows due on each instrument
      constituting the debt. the calculation takes into account the transaction-related costs and all other premiums and discounts.

      for financial liabilities that are at a variable interest rate, cash flows are periodically re-estimated to reflect changes in market interest
      rates, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

      for financial liabilities that are at a fixed interest rate indexed to inflation, cash flows are periodically re-estimated to take account of actual
      fluctuations in the inflation rate, thereby changing the effective interest rate.

interest rate hedging instruments
all the derivative instruments are designed to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. they are measured at market value and are used as
cash flow hedges.

cash flow hedges: the derivative instruments designed to hedge the floating rate element of the debt are accounted for as cash flow
hedges. the portion of the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value that is deemed to be an effective hedge is taken directly
to equity until the underlying transaction is recognised in the group’s financial statements. the portion deemed ineffective is accounted
for in the income statement for the period. the gains and losses included in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period
when the hedged item affects the income statement. the interest rate hedging instruments described in note u on financial liabilities,
meet the criteria set out in ias 39 and are therefore accounted for as cash flow hedges.


ix. share-based payments
share options are accounted for in accordance with ifrs 2. the options are valued at their fair value at the date on which they are
granted (see note b.4 below) and any variations in value occurring after the grant date are not taken into account. the value is charged to
employee benefits expense on a straight line basis between the date of the grant and the maturity date (the vesting period), with an equal
and opposite entry directly to equity.


x. treasury shares
get se shares held by the group are accounted for at cost as a reduction in equity. subsequent disposals are taken directly to equity
and no profit or loss is recognised.


xi. foreign exchange
transactions in foreign currencies are converted into the reporting currency of each individual company at the rate of exchange ruling at
the date of the transaction. assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than those mentioned in note b.2i above are
translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting period. exchange differences are dealt with in the income statement.


xii. revenue recognition
revenue comprises the value of sales of services in the normal course of business. revenue is recognised on the date the service is
rendered; that is to say when the transport occurs. therefore when travel tickets are issued for the shuttle and the maritime activities,
they are accounted for in ‘‘deferred income’’.


xiii. net gains or net losses on each category of financial instrument
interest income and charges recognised in profit or loss include:
• interest on the financial assets and liabilities accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. the calculation
     of the effective interest rate includes all commissions and margins payable or receivable between the contracting parties which are
     an integral part of the effective interest rate, and all transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. the transaction costs
     are the marginal costs directly attributable to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial asset or liability.
• changes in the fair value of derivatives categorised as hedges (for the ineffective portion).


xiv. income tax
income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. income tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

current tax
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of
the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

additional tax payable on the distribution of dividends is accounted for when the dividends are recognised as a liability.


deferred tax
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except as provided by ias 12 ‘‘income taxes’’.

the tax rates used are those in effect at the end of the reporting period.

net deferred tax is determined at the level of each tax group.

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable
      profits will be available against which the differences can be used, at the level of the tax entity.

      deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses are recognised according to the likelihood of their recoverability assessed on the basis of the
      group’s budget and medium-term plans. the assumptions in these plans used are the same as those used for testing the value
      of assets.


      b.4 measurement of fair value
      the group’s accounting policies require the measurement of its financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at their fair value. the fair
      value has been measured, both for their valuation and for the presentation of information in the notes to the accounts, in accordance
      with the following methods. when necessary, more detailed information relating to the assumptions used in the measurement of fair
      value is given in the notes on the asset or liability concerned.


      non financial instruments
      tangible property, plant and equipment
      the fair value of tangible property, plant and equipment acquired following a business combination is measured by taking the higher of
      the net selling price or the value in use.


      intangible assets
      the fair value of intangible assets acquired following a business combination is measured using the present value of forecast future cash
      flows after taxation to be generated by the assets concerned.


      share-based payments
      the fair value of stock option plans is measured by applying the binomial black & scholes model and the monte carlo approach. the
      basis of calculation includes the share price on the grant date, the exercise price of the options, expected volatility of the underlying
      shares, expected period before exercise, expected dividends and share yield, and the expected turnover of beneficiaries. performance
      conditions which are not related to the market are not included in the fair value measurement.

      financial instruments
      financial assets accounted for at their fair value are classified in accordance with the following levels of fair value:
      • level 1: fair value using quoted prices (unadjusted) observed in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
      • level 2: fair value using data (‘‘inputs’’) other than quoted prices included in level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability,
         either directly (in the form of price) or indirectly (determined from the price).
      • level 3: fair value from valuation techniques which rely completely or in part on non observable data such as prices on an inactive
         market or the valuation on a multiples basis for non quoted securities.


      cash and cash equivalents
      cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities less than or equal to three months from date of
      acquisition which do not carry a significant risk of variation in value and which are used by the group to manage short term
      commitments. money market funds are evaluated at their market value at the end of the reporting period.


      trade and other receivables
      the fair value of trade and other receivables is measured on the basis of their expected recoverable value. this fair value is measured for
      the purpose of the information in the notes to the accounts as part of the receivables acquired following the business combinations.

derivative instruments
the fair value of hedging instruments is measured on the basis of valuations supplied by the financial counterparties integrating the credit
risk (cva) or the counterparty risk (dva).


b.5 financial indicators
the main financial indicators used are the following:


i.  ebitda/operating margin
ebitda (or operating margin) as used by the group is calculated by adding back depreciation charges to the trading profit.


ii. distinction between the trading result and the operating result
the group considers that it is helpful to include an additional result line in the presentation of its income statement within the operating
result, in order to understand better its financial performance. this line is called the ‘‘trading result’’, and excludes income or charges
which are non-recurrent in terms of their frequency and nature and for which the amount is significant. the group therefore applies
recommendation number 2013-03 of the french national authority for accounting standards, the autorité des normes comptables.

k. income tax expense
k.1 effect on the income statement
i.  tax provisions of the concession agreement and other provisions
the concession requires that the group’s concessionaires (ctg and fm) share equally the cost price of the project and all revenues and
costs relating to the operation of the fixed link between the british and french companies. operating revenues and costs are
recognised in the income statement of the partnership and are shared equally between the concessionaires. revenues and costs which
do not relate to the operation of the concession are not subject to these sharing arrangements.

article 15 of the french finance act 2013 on the limitation of the deductibility of financial expenses does not apply to the subsidiary fm
as assets acquired under a concession contract are outside its application scope.

the current tax charge relates to amounts paid or to be paid in the short term to the tax authorities for the year, according to the rules in
force in the different countries and specific conventions. in 2013, the current tax charge related to tax to be paid outside france and
the uk.

at 31 december 2013, the group accounted for a deferred tax asset for the first time which resulted in a credit of c83 million in respect of
the french and uk tax groups.

the french tax group being fiscally profitable at 31 december 2014, the proof of tax has been prepared for the year 2014 on the basis of
the tax rate in force, including additional contributions, of 38.00%. however, the main reversals of temporary differences being planned
beyond the period of additional contributions, the deferred tax calculation for the french tax group was made on the basis of 34.43%.

for the british tax group, in view of its fiscal deficit at 31 december 2014, at 31 december 2013 and for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017
on the basis of the group’s estimates, deferred tax was calculated on the basis of the tax rate of 20% corresponding to the rate in effect
from 1st april 2015.

      concession property, plant and equipment
      the impact of taxation on property, plant and equipment corresponds mainly to the conditions relating to the deductibility of the fixed
      link’s depreciation costs in the french tax group (reintegration of impairment costs) and in the british tax group (profile of tax deductions
      in respect of depreciation, including capital allowances).

      deferred tax resulting from temporary differences on property, plant and equipment will reverse over the period until the end of the
      concession in line with the profile of the group’s depreciation charges and taxable results.


      profit arising from the restructuring
      the financial restructuring in 2007 gave rise to profit in the consolidated accounts of c3,323 million. at 31 december 2014, the taxation
      of c1,364 million of this amount remains deferred within the french tax group. the taxation of this residual profit is dependent upon the
      repayment of a loan between the concessionaires (fm and ctg) and groupe eurotunnel se, which in turn is subordinated to the term
      loan which matures in 2050.

      deferred tax in respect of tax losses
      deferred tax assets recognised in respect of carried forward tax losses within the french and british tax groups amount to c275 million
      at 31 december 2014 (c29 million for the french tax group and c246 million for the british tax group).

      the recognition of these assets for each of the tax groups is based on:
      • the forecasts of taxable profits derived from the group’s three-year business plan for its different activities; this plan is based on the
         same assumptions as those used in the impairment test of assets (see note n below). on the basis of these forecasts in respect of
         taxable profits, the group has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of carried forward losses which are expected to be utilised
         in the next 3 years for both the french and british tax groups.
      • the forecasts for use of carried forward losses to cover the reversal of temporary differences on the british tax group.

french carried forward tax losses
in france, the deficits can be carried forward indefinitely but their future use is limited to 50% of the profit for the period beyond the first
million euros.

get se is the parent company of the consolidated tax group which it forms with all the group’s french subsidiaries.

at 31 december 2014, the cumulative tax losses of the tax group which can be carried forward indefinitely amount to c2,927 million
(31 december 2013: c2,933 million), consisting essentially of:
• cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of c910 million generated by the get se consolidated tax group
   since 1 january 2008 and chargeable to the taxable profits of the members of this group (31 december 2013: c916 million); and
• cumulative tax losses which can be carried forward indefinitely of c1,986 million (31 december 2013: c1,987 million) generated by
   the old tnu sa consolidated tax group. these deficits may only be applied to the taxable profits of fm, société immobilière et
   foncière eurotunnel sas and europorte sas.

potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the french tax group amount to c979 million (on a base
of c2,842 million).

british carried forward tax losses
in england, the tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

at 31 december 2014, the tax losses carried forward for the british companies amounted to £2,694 million (31 december 2013:
£2,694 million).

potential unrecognised tax assets in respect of the carried forward tax losses of the british tax group amount to c445 million (on a base

       these options is conditional on attaining the targets described in note s.1 below;

(ii)   on the assumption of the acquisition of all the free shares allocated to staff. 667,430 of the free shares issued to staff in 2012 were
       acquired by them during the period. details of free shares are given in note s.2 below); and

(iii) on the assumption of the acquisition of preference shares allocated to staff and still in issue at 31 december 2014 in accordance
      with the applicable terms of conversion as described in note s.3 below and taking into account the average share price over the
      period. conversion of these preference shares is subject to achieving certain targets and remaining in the group’s employment.

      m. intangible assets and goodwill
      m.1 intangible assets
      intangible assets represent mainly the estimation of the fair value of the main commercial contracts held by gbrf on the date of its
      acquisition by the group, 28 may 2010. this value was calculated on the basis of the discounted future cash flows generated by these
      contracts after deduction of general costs and taxation, and using inflation and contract renewal assumptions. these intangible assets
      are depreciated on a straight line basis over 12 years, being the estimated remaining duration of the contracts used in the valuation.

      m.2 goodwill
      the goodwill of c18,193,000 at 31 december 2014 is attached to the cgu represented by the company gbrf.

      the group performed a test of value in use of this cgu at 31 december 2014. on the basis of a discount rate of 9.5%
      (31 december 2013: 9.5%) and a long-term growth rate of 2%, the calculations show that the value in use is higher than the carrying
      value of the goodwill.

      the group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions (discount rate and long-term
      growth rate) of plus or minus 0.5%. this analysis did not reveal a likely scenario which could lead to an impairment of goodwill.

on the expiry of the concession period (2086). in the uk, the government has required ctg to transfer to it the title to freehold land and
property acquired for the purpose of construction and operation of the project and in exchange has granted leases for the duration of the
concession. on the expiry of the concession, the interest of the concessionaires in all movable property and intellectual property rights
necessary for the operation of the concession will become, without payment, the joint property of the two states.

*     including d3.128 billion of exceptional depreciation on tangible fixed assets.


at 31 december 2014, eurotunnel did not identify any indication of impairment of its tangible concession assets, but nevertheless
carried out a valuation in order to ensure that the recoverable value of the assets remained higher than their net accounting value.

the valuation carried out at 31 december 2014 confirmed that the recoverable value of assets remained higher than their net accounting
value on the basis of a discount rate of 6.77% (31 december 2013: 6.77%) and on the basis of revenue growth of approximately 2% for
the period after the three year plan.

the group also carried out a sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible changes to key assumptions (discount rate and revenue growth
rate) of plus or minus 0.5%. this analysis did not reveal a likely scenario which could lead to an impairment of concession assets.

      the net value of property, plant and equipment under finance leases was c4,558,000 at 31 december 2014 (31 december 2013:
      c5,227,000).

      in the context of the situation described in note a above, eurotunnel carried out a valuation in order to ensure that the recoverable value
      of its maritime assets remained higher than their net accounting value at 31 december 2014. the market value of these assets was
      estimated using studies by independent experts. these valuations have confirmed that the market value of the three ferries (the berlioz,
      the rodin and the nord pas de calais) remains higher than their net accounting value at 31 december 2014.

      at 31 december 2014, eurotunnel did not identify any indication of impairment of its europorte assets, but nevertheless carried out a
      valuation in order to ensure that their recoverable value remained higher than their net accounting value. the market value of europorte’s
      assets, estimated using studies by independent experts, was found to be at least equal to the net accounting value at
      31 december 2014.

      q. share capital
      q.1 management of capital
      the group’s policy is to maintain a solid capital base in order to retain the confidence of investors, creditors and of the market and to
      support the future development of the activity. capital can include the share capital, share premium and retained earnings. the board of
      directors monitors return on equity and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.

      the group buys its own shares on the market. the timing of these purchases depends on the market price. these transactions are
      carried out as part of the share buyback programme of which the liquidity contract is part (see note q.2 below).

      assumptions used for the fair value measurement on the grant date
      the fair value on grant date of the rights granted to staff as part of the plan (the 1,500,000 ordinary shares on conversion of the
      preference shares) was calculated by using the monte carlo valuation model. the assumptions used to measure the fair value of the plan
      on grant date were as follows:

the valuation at the end of the financial year has been prepared by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements
of the amended ias 19 in order to assess the liabilities and assets of the schemes as at the end of the reporting period.

the fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change,
and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently
uncertain, were:

sensitivity to changes in the main assumptions
reasonably possible changes to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period, all things being equal,
would have affected the defined benefit liability by the amounts shown below.

expected cash outflows and risks associated with pension liabilities
the investment strategy for managing the assets of the pension schemes is defined by the trustees of the pension fund. the maturities
of the contributions and the level of funding of schemes are negotiated between the group and the trustees on the basis of actuarial
valuations carried out every three years. contributions are intended both to recover the deficit related to rights acquired in the past and
to cover the service costs in future years.

the group estimates that contributions to be paid into the defined benefit schemes in the 2015 financial year will be c8 million, of which
c6 million will be in respect of current service costs for the period and c2 million will be in respect of the recovery of the deficit in the
channel tunnel group pension fund. the weighted average duration of the both the gbrf plan and the esl plan is 22 years.

undertakings and prohibitions under the term loan
the term loan provides for a number of undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for this type of financing. these relate to:
• the creation of new or the continuation of existing guarantees on the assets of the eurotunnel group;
• to the transfer of the assets of the eurotunnel group and to the acquisition by the eurotunnel group of new assets;
• to the granting of loans, guarantees or warranties to third parties, and
• the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the term loan, including inter alia the
   railway usage contract.

in relation to the term loan, the eurotunnel group must respect two financial ratios, one of which, if not met, would constitute an event
of default (see section on ‘‘event of default and acceleration’’ below). the second ratio is the ratio of operating cash flow to the total
synthetic debt service on the term loan. get se is required to ensure that at each six-monthly test date after 31 december 2007, this
ratio is not less than 1.25. for the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated taking into account the hypothetical amortisation on the
term loan and on the basis of a rolling 12 month period prior to the date of the test. failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly testing
date would lead to restrictions on the use of the group’s excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the term
loan until such time as the test is met once again. these restrictions include, in particular, the ability of the eurotunnel group to pay
dividends and to finance new activities. failure to meet this test on three consecutive six monthly testing dates would trigger a
prepayment event, under which the group’s excess available cash flow would have to be used towards prepayment of the term loan
until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

voluntary prepayment of the term loan
clause 7.2 of the credit agreements provide for voluntary prepayments to be made on the term loan for a minimum amount of £5 million
or c7.5 million, without penalties but subject to the payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

guarantees and security relating to the term loan
guarantees:
under the intercreditor deed, the main companies in the group each jointly and severally guarantee the obligations of fm and ctg as
borrowers of the term loan vis-à-vis the lenders, the arrangers and the hedging counterparties of the term loan.


security granted by eurotunnel group under french law:
(i) assignment of trade receivables by way of security under which (a) fm assigns the receivables held by it under the concession
    agreement and the railways usage contract as well as its the trade receivables held by it against the freight transporters and coach
    operators, its insurance receivables and the intercompany receivables held by it against french companies of the eurotunnel
    group, (b) ctg assigns the same categories of receivables as fm with the exception of trade receivables owed by the freight
    transporters and coach operators and (c) other members of the eurotunnel group qualifying as guarantors assign their insurance
    receivables and intercompany receivables held against french companies of the eurotunnel group;

(ii)   unregistered mortgages over fm’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short-or medium-term development projects;

(iii) a registered pledge over fm’s rolling stock;

(iv) a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in france under the name of any borrower or guarantor of the term loan;

(v)    a pledge on shares in the eurotunnel group members held by the borrowers or guarantors of the term loan;

(vi) a pledge on the main eurotunnel trademarks; and

(vii) a pledge on receivables held by fm under certain pieces of land comprised in the ‘‘zac 1’’ and which is the subject of long term
      construction leases (baux à construction).


security granted by eurotunnel group under english law:
the main companies in the group grant security over all of their assets held at the date of execution of the term loan as well as over their
future assets and over certain of their contractual rights.


security over the other assets of the eurotunnel group:
all of the shares of member companies of eurotunnel group that are not subject to security as described above (with the exception of
europorte sas and its subsidiaries) are pledged by way of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the term loan and
guarantors under the intercreditor deed.

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      event of default and acceleration
      the term loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, permit the lenders to declare
      the term loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the security, and/or to demand the implementation of the substitution
      mechanism provided for under the terms of the concession.

      the events of default include:
      • any non-payment under the term loan;
      • a failure to comply with any provision of the term loan, the intercreditor deed or related documents. these provisions impose
         restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, acquisitions, disposals and other transfers, mergers, borrowings, and the
         granting of guarantees and new security by the companies of the eurotunnel group, and include, in particular:
           (i) a financial covenant which requires get se to ensure that at each six-monthly test date after 31 december 2007, a ratio of
                 operating cash flow to total debt service on the term loan is not less than 1.10, such ratio being calculated by reference to a
                 rolling 12 month period preceding the testing date; and
           (ii) certain undertakings and representations relating to the tax treatment of the eurotunnel group to the extent that a breach is
                 reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of fm, ctg or the eurotunnel group;
      • a representation or warranty is made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor under the terms of the term loan,
         or any related finance document or any other document delivered by or on behalf of a borrower or an obligor under the terms of the
         finance documents (which contain representations and warranties that are customary for this type of document), which proves to
         have been incorrect or misleading at the time at which it was made or deemed to have been made;
      • the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness in excess of a specified amount of any of the companies within
         eurotunnel group (other than groupe eurotunnel se);
      • the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal proceedings in
         relation to any borrower or guarantor under the term loan;
      • the illegality or invalidity of the term loan, any related security or the subordination created under the intercreditor deed;
      • eurotunnel becoming permanently unable to carry on the business of operating the tunnel, the destruction of the tunnel, or the
         cessation of a material part of its business by a borrower or a guarantor;
      • a guarantor ceasing to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of groupe eurotunnel se;
      • any act or omission of france or the united kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the term loan incapable of
         performing its obligations under the term loan and associated documents; and
      • the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against any eurotunnel group member or its assets, which is reasonably likely
         (i) to be adversely determined against the relevant company and (ii) to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of fm,
         ctg or eurotunnel group.

      the term loan also includes other events of default which are customary for this type of financing.

      the debt service cover ratio and the synthetic service cover ratio for groupe eurotunnel se at 31 december 2014 were 1.76 and 1.58
      respectively, and thus the financial covenants for the period were respected.


      ii. other loans
      ‘‘other loans’’ amounting to c38.2 million at 31 december 2014 in the above table represent:
      • a bank loan drawn by europorte sas in 2012 in order to finance the purchase of locomotives by its subsidiaries. this loan bears
          interest at a fixed rate of 4.37% and is repayable over a period of seven years.
      • a bank loan drawn by gb railfreight ltd in 2014 in order to finance the purchase of locomotives. this loan bears interest at a fixed
          rate of 4.241% and is repayable over a period of seven years.


      iii. finance leases
      ‘‘finance leases’’ amounting to c5.5 million at 31 december 2014 in the above table represent finance lease contracts entered into by
      gb railfreight ltd in 2012 in order to finance the purchase of locomotives. they are repayable over 10 years.


      u.2 interest rate exposure
      the eurotunnel group has hedging contracts in place to cover its floating rate loans (tranches c1 and c2) in the form of swaps for the
      same duration and for the same value (euribor against a fixed rate of 4.90% and libor against a fixed rate of 5.26%). no premiums
      were paid to obtain these contracts. the nominal value of hedging swap is c953 million and £350 million.

      these derivatives generated a charge of c63 million in 2014 which was accounted for in the income statement (2013: charge of
      c63 million).

in accordance with ifrs 13, the group takes into account credit risk (dva) and counterparty risk (cva) in the valuation of financial
instruments. in practice, this recommendation particularly affects the valuation of derivatives to the extent that they are measured at fair
value including a probabilistic weighting of estimated cash flows.

in the case of a default by the eurotunnel group, counterparties to the hedging contracts have priority over all holders of debt and
securities and guarantees granted to holders of debt under the concession contract and the intercreditor deed. in this respect, the
group believes that the risk of loss for the counterparties in the event of default is insignificant and therefore has not recorded a discount
to the fair value of hedging instruments under the dva.

the table in note w.2 below gives the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives are expected to occur, and the
periods in which the amounts initially recognised in equity are expected to impact the income statement.


v. matrix of class of financial instrument and recognition categories and fair value
the table below presents the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and their level in the hierarchy of
fair value. it does not include information about the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value
to the extent that the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

on 28 june 2007, eurotunnel took out a long-term loan totalling c3,810 million (nominal value at the end of the reporting period on
31 december 2014), from a banking consortium comprising goldman sachs international and deutsche bank ag, with a spread of
139 basis points. this debt is accounted for at its amortised cost.

the term loan is not quoted or traded on an active financial market and it is particularly difficult to identify any observable market
equivalents, taking into account the specificities and characteristics of the eurotunnel group’s debt and in particular its 30 to 40-year
maturity profile (see note w.2 below).

the group’s estimate of the fair value of the long-term loan is based on a level 3 fair value.

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      the modelling techniques used involve the discounting of future cash flows determined at the calculation date. the discounting
      parameters are derived from a zero-coupon curve and an estimated credit spread based on a sample of comparable bbb rated
      companies (the eurotunnel group’s rating has remained unchanged since 2007) with an adjustment to take into account the particularly
      long maturity of the group’s debt.

      on this basis, the eurotunnel group estimates the fair value of the term loan to be c5,400 million compared to a carrying value at
      31 december 2014 of c4,084 million. as an indication, if the rate used (including the credit spread) was 100 basis points higher, the fair
      value of the term loan would be approximately c700 million lower. with regard to the methodology used, the eurotunnel group does
      not prejudge the conditions that may be obtained on the market. furthermore, the characteristics of the current funding agreements
      govern any prepayment or refinancing operations on the term loan, and the resulting gains that may arise for the group.

      w. financial risks
      w.1 exchange rate exposure
      approximately half of the eurotunnel group’s revenues are denominated in sterling, whereas more than half of its operating expenses
      and capital expenditure are in euros. the term loan is denominated in sterling for a total of £1.467 billion and in euros for a total of
      c1.926 billion (at 31 december 2014). all the external financial instruments are denominated either in sterling or in euros. as a result, no
      exchange gain or loss can arise on revaluation of the external financial instruments. the residual foreign exchange risk relates to the
      revaluation of intra-group balances, the residual value of which at 31 december 2014 is c58 million; a 10% change in the euro/sterling
      parity would result in unrealised exchange gains or losses of approximately c6 million.

      the eurotunnel group has and will continue to make every effort to closely match the currencies in which its revenues and costs are
      denominated and will use currency hedging transactions to manage its foreign exchange risk where necessary. groupe eurotunnel se
      prepares its consolidated accounts in euros. fluctuations in the value of the sterling/euro rates have an impact on the value in euros of
      revenues, costs and financial income and costs, as well as on elements of the group’s reported assets and liabilities. by way of example
      and all else being equal and on the basis of accounting information at 31 december 2014, the table below presents the effect that a
      change of plus or minus 10% in the exchange rate would have on the main financial indicators.

      **     tranches c1 and c2 are at a variable rate of interest, and are presented in the liquidity table on the basis of a long-term interest rate at the end of the
             reporting period.


      the credit agreements allow, on condition that the debt service cover ratio is not less than 1.25, to apply for (i) a renewable credit line of
      up to c75 million, and (ii) a structurally subordinated additional credit line of up to £225 million (or equivalent in euros).


      w.3 interest rate risk exposure
      the risk of an unfavourable movement in rates during the duration of the term loan is covered by the fact that tranches b1 and b2 are at
      a fixed rate of interest, tranches a1 and a2 which are indexed on inflation are at a fixed rate of interest, and tranches c1 and c2 are at a
      variable rate of interest but are covered by fixed/variable rate hedging contracts. short-term receivables and debts are not at risk from
      interest rate exposure.

      the contractual cash flows associated with the swaps are paid simultaneously with the contractual cash flows of the variable rate loans
      and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period where the interest on the debt affects the result.

a variation of +0.5% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative instruments of
c242 million. a variation of 0.5% in rates would lead to a change in the portion accounted for in equity relating to the derivative
instruments of c277 million.

the notes in other financial assets carry a variable rate of interest and a change of +/ 0.5% in rate would lead to a change in financial
income on the income statement of +/c0.85 million.


w.4 inflation risk
the inflation risk relates to the interest and the repayments of principal on the two indexed tranches (a1 and a2) respectively
denominated in pounds and euros. by way of example, a variation of 1% in the inflation rate would have an impact of c16 million on the
amount of the principal of these two tranches.


w.5 credit risks
credit risk represents the risk of financial loss to the group in the event that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
honour its contractual obligations.


i.     trade receivables
the group’s exposure to customer credit risk arises from its customers in the united kingdom and eurozone countries, with the
following exceptions:
• the group’s main customers, the railways, accounted for 25% of the group’s revenue in 2014.
• most of the group’s car customers pay for their tickets in advance, in particular via the internet; consequently, the credit risk in
     relation to these customers is very limited.

the group applies a credit policy which requires that every new customer is subject to a credit check before being able to benefit from
the group’s standard credit terms. the group’s credit risk exposure to account customers is managed by means of continuous
monitoring of their financial situation and of their outstanding debt in regard to their credit limits and payment terms.


ii. investments
the group limits its credit risk exposure by only investing in i) short-term deposits and certificates of deposit with a maximum term of
6 months with counterparties with a minimum short-term rating of p-1 from moody’s or ii) in monetary sicavs (the french equivalent of
mutual funds) and money market funds with a minimum long-term rating of aaa from moody’s or aaa from s&p.

funds invested by the group in any one monetary sicav or money market fund should not exceed £100 million per sicav or fund in
pounds sterling or c120 million per fund or sicav in euros. investments in short term deposits or certificates of deposit should not
exceed £65 million or c78 million with any one bank group.


iii. credit risk exposure
the carrying value of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk exposure. the maximum credit risk exposure at the end of
the reporting period is as follows:

report of the statutory auditors on the annual parent company financial
statements for the financial year ending 31 december 2014

this is a free translation into english of the statutory auditor’s report on the financial statements issued in french and it is provided solely
for the convenience of english-speaking users. the statutory auditor’s report includes information specifically required by french law in
such reports, whether modified or not. this information is presented below the audit opinion on the financial statements and includes an
explanatory paragraph discussing the auditor’s assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. these assessments
were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate
assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures.

this report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the management report and in the
documents addressed to shareholders.

this report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, french law and professional auditing standards
applicable in france.

to the shareholders,

in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by annual general meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended
31 december 2014, on:
• the audit of the accompanying financial statements of groupe eurotunnel se (ex groupe eurotunnel sa);
• the justification of our assessments;
• the specific verifications and information required by law.

these financial statements have been approved by the board of directors. our role is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.


1 opinion on the financial statements
we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france; those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit
involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. we believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the company as
at 31 december 2014 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with french accounting principles.


2 justification of our assessments
in accordance with the requirements of article l.823-9 of the french commercial code (code de commerce), we bring to your attention
the following matter.

note b.3 and d of the financial statements relating to the investments in subsidiary undertakings presents the approaches of the
company relating to the value in use of the investments and the other financial assets. we assessed the approaches used by the
company and the appropriateness of the information given in this note to the financial statements.

these assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the
opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

3 specific verifications and information
we have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in france, the specific verifications required by
french law.

we have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the
management report of the board of directors, and in the documents addressed to shareholders with respect to the financial position
and the financial statements.

notes to the financial statements
the conversion of groupe eurotunnel sa into a european company, as voted by the shareholders combined ordinary and extraordinary
general meeting held on 29 april 2014, took effect on 26 december 2014, the date on which the french trade and companies registry
registered the company as a european company. the conversion does not result in the creation of a new legal entity. the duration of the
company, the dates of the accounting period, the share capital, the registered office and the purposes of the company remain
unchanged. the terms of the current mandates of the company’s directors and statutory auditors have been confirmed within the
european company.

groupe eurotunnel se is the consolidating entity of the eurotunnel group, whose registered office is at 3 rue la boétie, 75008 paris,
france and whose shares are listed on euronext paris and on nyse euronext london. the term ‘‘groupe eurotunnel se’’ or ‘‘get se’’
refers to the holding company which is governed by french law. the term ‘‘group’’ or ‘‘the eurotunnel group’’ refers to groupe
eurotunnel se and all its subsidiaries.

the main activities of the group are the design, financing, construction and operation of the fixed link’s infrastructure and transport
system in accordance with the terms of the concession (which will expire in 2086), as well as rail freight and maritime activities.

get se provides various services to its subsidiaries such as administrative and financial management, corporate strategy and
shareholder relations. in 2014, get se charged its subsidiaries c17.6 million for these services, of which c14.1 million was charged to
the concessionaires.


a. important events
a.1 maritime activity: procedure before the uk competition and markets authority
seafrance was liquidated on 9 january 2012. in july 2012, eurotunnel purchased three ferries as part of the asset disposal procedure
conducted by the french tribunal de commerce, and sub-contracted the operation of the ferries to an independent company, scop
seafrance. the ferries are owned by three subsidiaries of euro-transmanche holding sas, and the commercial activity is carried out by
another subsidiary of euro-transmanche holding sas, myferrylink sas.

on 9 january 2015, the competition appeal tribunal rejected the appeal made by the eurotunnel group and scop seafrance and
confirmed the decision of the competition and markets authority that the eurotunnel group must cease operating these ferries out of
the port of dover within the next six months. the decision of the competition and markets authority was based on the assumption that
the eurotunnel group had acquired seafrance’s business, an interpretation that the group has always contested.

the eurotunnel group decided not to appeal this decision and announced that it intends to seek a buyer for myferrylink and the three
ferries. due to the condition imposed by the tribunal de commerce at the time of their purchase in 2012 prohibiting the sale of the ferries
within a period of five years, any such sale before 2017 would need to be authorised by the tribunal.

these decisions, which were taken after the end of the 2014 financial year, do not impact the consolidated financial statements at
31 december 2014.

get se financed the acquisition and rehabilitation of these assets, and assures the financing of this new activity. the resulting intra-
group loan between get se and its euro-transmanche holding sas subsidiaries stood at c139 million at 31 december 2014.

at 31 december 2014, get se accounted for a depreciation of c19.5 million in relation to this loan, corresponding to the losses incurred
by this activity in 2014, in addition to the c46 million depreciation already accounted for relating to the 2012 and 2013 financial years.

on 6 february 2015, scop was granted permission by the uk court of appeal to appeal the decision of the competition appeal
tribunal.


a.2 dividend
in 2014, get se received a dividend of £80 million (c101 million) from its subsidiary the channel tunnel group limited.

20 financial information concerning the eurotunnel group’s assets
   and liabilities, financial position and results


      b. accounting methods and policies
      the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in france. transactions are recorded in
      the accounts are valued in accordance with the historical cost convention and the accounts are prepared on the going concern basis.


      b.1 use of estimates
      the preparation of financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts of assets and
      liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period. the board of directors periodically reviews its valuations
      and estimates based on its experience and various other factors considered relevant for the determination of reasonable and
      appropriate estimates of the assets’ and liabilities’ carrying value.

      the actual results could differ significantly from these estimates depending on different conditions and hypotheses. the use of
      estimations concerns mainly the valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings and of associated debts and loans.


      b.2 valuation of intangible assets
      intangible assets consist of goodwill (see note c below). a provision for depreciation is recorded when the value in use of the underlying
      assets to which the goodwill is allocated is less than its accounting value.


      b.3 valuation of investments in subsidiary undertakings
      get se assesses the value in use of its investments in subsidiary undertakings on the basis of several criteria, such as the net book
      value of the asset, the adjusted book value of the asset, the discounted net financing cash flows, or external evaluations. a depreciation
      of intra-group loans where applicable or a provision for impairment may be made when the net assets of the subsidiary undertaking
      is negative.


      b.4 investments in securities
      investments are stated in the statement of financial position at cost. if the market value is lower than the acquisition cost, a provision for
      depreciation is booked for the difference. ‘‘investments in securities’’ and ‘‘cash and cash equivalents’’ include any accrued interest
      due thereon.


      b.5 treasury shares
      get se holds its own shares acquired as part of a share buy back programme and a liquidity contract.

      treasury shares which are reserved explicitly for a share option plan are accounted for as investments in securities at their
      purchase price.

      in the absence of an explicit allocation to staff or to a share capital reduction, the shares purchased as part of the buy back programme
      are accounted for at cost in financial fixed assets.

      shares acquired as part of the liquidity contract, the aim of which is to reduce excessive volatility in get se’s shares, are accounted for
      at cost in investments and the gain or loss on sale of these shares is calculated on a fifo basis.

      at the end of the financial year, these shares are valued on the average share price during the last month. a provision is made if this
      valuation is below the book value, except for those shares which are allocated to stock option plans, the free shares and shares that are
      to be cancelled.


      b.6 share-based payments
      as part of the share option plan, get se makes a provision for risk and charges relating to share option grants as soon as it is probable
      that there will be an outflow of resources from the business in the future. when treasury shares are granted as part of a share option plan,
      a provision is made for the difference between the exercise price proposed to the beneficiaries and the net accounting value of the
      treasury shares granted.


      b.7 tax integration convention
      under the terms of the group tax integration convention, tax charges are recognised in the individual financial statements of
      consolidated companies, on a stand-alone basis. any tax savings or losses realised by the group are recognised immediately in the
      parent company’s income statement for the financial year.

b.8 provisions
provisions are recognised when there exists a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event and when the future cash
flows can be reliably estimated.


b.9 conversion of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies
receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for on the basis of the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction, and are then re-valued at the rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.

unrealised exchange differences resulting from this revaluation are recorded in the cumulative translation reserve. a provision for risks
and charges is recognised if the conversion shows unrealised losses.


c. goodwill
the goodwill of c116,552,000 which resulted from the merger of tnu sa into get se in 2009 was accounted for as an intangible asset.


d. investments in subsidiary undertakings
at 31 december 2014, shares in subsidiary undertakings are analysed as follows:

            registration document. this agreement is intended to harmonise (i) the rules for current accounts between group companies, (ii) the interest rates of
            the various intra-group debts and (iii) where possible, the other conditions of these intra-group debts in order to facilitate the financial and accounting
            management of group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the group’s companies. this agreement falls within the scope of
            r. 225-31 of the french commercial code relating to regulated agreements and commitments.


      amended bond debt (abd)
      the abd corresponds to the original bond holdings purchased by egp as part of the 2007 financial restructuring with the proceeds from
      the issue of the nrs. this receivable was transferred by egp to get se in 2008 and in 2009 on the basis of a valuation by an expert.
      the abd, the nominal value of which at 31 december 2014 was c1,361 million and £242 million, is accounted for by get se taking into
      account the discount on its purchase.

      during 2014, c14 million was paid to get se by france manche sa in respect of a partial repayment of the abd, which generated an
      exceptional profit of c2.4 million relating to the share of the discount realised by get se (see note p below).

      information presented as if the company was taxed separately and on the basis of a tax rate, applicable to taxable transactions, of 34.43%.


      carried forward losses of the tax consolidation group
      at 31 december 2014, the cumulative tax losses of the tax group which can be carried forward indefinitely and are chargeable to the
      taxable profits of the members of this group amount to c910 million (31 december 2013: c916 million).


      profit arising from the restructuring
      the financial restructuring in 2007 led to a restructuring profit in the accounts of the eurotunnel group of c3,323 million. at
      31 december 2014, c1,364 million of this amount remains deferred within the french tax group. the taxation of this profit is dependent
      on the repayment of the amended bond debt (see note e.1 above) between the concessionaires (france manche sa and channel
      tunnel group limited) and groupe eurotunnel se, which in turn depends on the repayment of the term loan by the concessionaires
      which matures in 2050.


      q.3 other information
      in january 2014, the company received notification of a tax audit from the french tax authorities relating to the financial years 2011 and
      2012. at 31 december 2014, the audit is still underway.

the calculations were made on the following basis:

(i)    on the assumption of the exercise of the maximum number of options issued and still in issue at 31 december 2014 (when the
       average price of the shares during the period exceeds the exercise price of options which was not the case in 2013). the exercise of
       these options is conditional on attaining the targets described in note h.3i above;

(ii)   on the assumption of the acquisition of all the free shares allocated to staff. 667,430 of the free shares issued to staff in 2012 were
       acquired by them during the period. details of free shares are given in note h.3ii above); and

(ii)   on the assumption of the acquisition of preference shares allocated to staff and still in issue at 31 december 2014 in accordance
       with the applicable terms of conversion as described in note h.3iii above and taking into account the average share price over the
       period. conversion of these preference shares is subject to achieving certain targets and remaining in the group’s employment.

      the adjustment relates to the existence of treasury shares.

      the dividend policy is determined by the board of directors; it takes into account the group’s investment needs, the economic context
      and other facts deemed relevant.

      the group’s objective is a policy of annual dividend distribution of two-thirds of its free cash flow.

      however, this objective is by no means a commitment by the group; future dividends will depend, in particular, on the group’s results
      and financial position.




      20.8. legal and arbitration proceedings

      20.8.1 proceedings relating to the safeguard plan

      elliott international l.p., the liverpool limited partnership and tompkins square park, on the one hand, and companies belonging to
      the eurotunnel group, on the other hand, pursuant to a settlement agreement, have agreed to definitively end litigation regarding the
      safeguard proceeding opened in august 2006 and the safeguard plans that were then subsequently approved; this settlement
      agreement does not result in any of the parties thereto bearing a burden of significant undertakings.


      20.8.2 uk competition commission

      in 2012, the group arranged to purchase certain assets, including three ferries, belonging to former maritime company seafrance. on
      8 november 2012, the french competition authority authorised this purchase subject to certain commitments. risks to competition in
      the passenger market were ruled out. for freight transport, the eurotunnel group has agreed, for a period of five years, not to offer any
      discounts on its cross-channel rail freight transport rates that would be contingent on the customer also using its maritime transport
      service. specifically, it may not base annual rate negotiations on the volume of freight transported by myferrylink. the eurotunnel group
      has also agreed not to discriminate in any way against customers who do not use myferrylink for their cross-channel maritime freight
      transport. to make sure it honours these commitments, the prices charged to freight customers will have to be negotiated by different
      sales teams for each mode of transport and are covered by separate contracts. an independent trustee is in charge of monitoring these
      commitments.

      the matter was referred to the uk competition commission (which has since become the competition and markets authority, or cma).
      on 19 february 2013, the cc revealed the results of its preliminary analysis, finding that the entry of a new operator, myferrylink, would
      substantially lessen competition and that the sale of seafrance assets to another operator would have been better for competition in the
      cross-channel market. the group challenged this analysis. on 6 june 2013, the cma announced its decision to ban groupe
      eurotunnel se (or any related entity) from directly or indirectly operating ferry services from the port of dover for a period of ten years
      using the berlioz or rodin, or for a period of two years using any other vessel.

following an appeal by groupe eurotunnel se and the scop seafrance, on 4 december 2013 the competition appeal tribunal
quashed the cma’s decision of 6 june 2013. the tribunal found that the cma, by failing to demonstrate that groupe eurotunnel se had
acquired an enterprise rather than individual assets, had not demonstrated that it had jurisdiction in the matter. the tribunal therefore
remitted to the cma the question of whether the eurotunnel group had acquired an enterprise.

on 27 june 2014, the cma reaffirmed its jurisdiction considering that eurotunnel had taken over seafrance and that this takeover was
within the uk merger rules enabling it to examine the operation. the cma concluded that myferrylink must cease its activities in a
period of six months from the date of the order being issued by the cma giving its decision. eurotunnel group and the scop appealed
this decision to the competition appeal tribunal.

to consult with stakeholders, the cma issued on 23 july 2014, the draft ruling to ban the eurotunnel group from serving the port of
dover with its ferries. in this context, groupe eurotunnel made a number of observations to the cma.

on 18 september 2014, the cma issued a final order dismissing all of the observations of the eurotunnel group. this order prohibits
myferrylink continuing its activity with this destined to apply six months after a possible decision rejecting an appeal by eurotunnel
against the decision of the cma.

on 9 january 2015, the cat recognised the validity of the arguments presented by the group, but felt that they were not of a nature to
quash again the position taken by the cma on 18 september 2014. the cat forced the group to withdraw from this activity. before the
ban to operate within six months was made, and to value the work done, the eurotunnel group decided to seek a buyer for the
myferrylink company. the scop has again appealed the decision to the court of appeal and the hearing was held on 11 and
12 march 2015. the date of the decision is as yet unknown.


20.8.3 igc

on 4 june 2013, the igc announced that eurostar had lodged a claim against the fee structure resulting from the 2014 network
statement relating to the use of the tunnel.

in accordance with the rule of procedure of 25 october 2005 (intergovernmental commission rule of procedure for the consideration
of appeals brought under article 12 of the regulation on the use of the channel tunnel by international groupings or railway
undertakings, signed at london on 25 october 2005), the intergovernmental commission (igc) set the timetable and arrangements for
examination of the appeal filed with the igc by eurostar (‘‘eil’’).

substantively, the claim argued that the pricing information contained in the 2014 network statement was not compliant with regulation,
since it failed to mention how the costs incurred by the rail infrastructure manager were related to the fees charged. it does not challenge
the level of charging nor the amount of revenue. the eurotunnel group has contested both the nature of the loss alleged by eil and the
jurisdiction and independence of the igc to hear the claim.

on 5 december 2013, the igc confirmed that eurotunnel ought to recover, through its fees, the long-term costs of the fixed link from
rail operators using the tunnel, in accordance with the procedures established under the railway usage contract. the eurotunnel
group applies this long-term cost recovery method in accordance with article 8.2 of european directive 2001/14/ec. the railways are
still able to audit these costs. the eurotunnel group provides the igc with the necessary information in strict compliance with european
directives. the eurotunnel group is continually improving the quality of its network statement to make it as comprehensive as possible;
for the record, the network statement has been published on the eurotunnel group’s website since the market opened up to
competition in 2007.

as a precaution, the eurotunnel group has brought a procedural appeal against the igc decision before the court of appeal of paris.
the parties are awaiting the procedural timetable to be determined by the court of appeal of paris.

      commission against france and the united kingdom on the basis of
      article 258 of the treaty on the functioning of the european
      union (tfeu)

      in their response to the european commission in september 2013, france and the united kingdom rejected all grievances raised by the
      commission and confirmed the validity of the charging structure of the fixed link with regard to european directives.

      during the first half of 2014, the european commission announced to the french and british states that it was abandoning complaints
      mentioned in the reasoned opinion issued against them on 20 june 2013 regarding pricing arrangements of railway companies in
      the tunnel.


      20.8.5 impact on the financial situation and profitability of the

21.2. constitutional document and by-laws

the eurotunnel group wished to benefit from a status more in line with (i) its economic and cultural identity and (ii) the expectations of its
stakeholders, and would also boost its international image and considered in 2014, that the european company legal framework could
meet this expectation since it has the advantage of benefiting from the basis of a homogenous entity that is recognised by all eu
member states.

the ordinary and extraordinary general meeting held on 29 april 2014 approved (resolution eighteen) the proposed conversion of the
company into a european company, and accordingly, the revised by-laws. this decision took effect on 26 december 2014.

get se is still be governed by the french law provisions relating to ‘‘sociétés anonymes’’ with a board of directors, compatible with the
se regulations; the conversion of the company into a european company did not result neither in its dissolution nor in the incorporation
of a new legal entity; the duration of the company, its corporate object and its registered office have not been modified, nor the share
capital which remained the same and is composed of the same number of shares, with a nominal value of c 0.40 each.

      21.2.3 rights and obligations attached to the shares (article 11 of
      get se’s by-laws)

      transforming the company into a european company does not affect the rights of shareholders, who will have the same number of
      shares in the company, and the same proportions of voting rights. their liability is still restricted to their economic contributions. this

      voting rights attached to shares making up the equity, or to the distribution of company profits to shareholders, which remains
      unchanged.

      a period of four years to ordinary shares if market performance conditions of the shares are met. those preference shares are referred to
      as b shares under the company by-law.

      preference shares may be converted into ordinary shares, depending on the evolution of the market price of the get se ordinary
      shares, after a period of four years from the grant date (29 april 2014) of the preference shares by the board of directors of the company
      (‘‘conversion date’’, 29 april 2018), without prior request of the holder. the average price of the ordinary shares on the grant date or the
      conversion date will be determined by reference to the higher value of the given averages, as follows:
      • at the average of the 6 (six) months preceding the grant date or conversion date;
      • at the average repurchase price of ordinary shares held in treasury by the company at the grant date or the conversion date,
          pursuant to articles l. 225-208 and l. 225-209 of the french commercial code.

      the conversion ratio will be a maximum of 5,000 ordinary shares per preference share for a target objective 100% met, with a tapering
      scale corresponding to the percentage of the objective met and set such that, as appropriate, the entire amount of ordinary shares may
      be allocated.

      the target objective for the market price of ordinary shares of the company on the conversion date, calculated according to the above
      terms is set at c11.50.

b shares carry no voting rights at ordinary and extraordinary general meetings of holders of ordinary shares, although they carry voting
rights at special general meetings of holders of b shares. holders of b shares meet at a special meeting for any proposed modification to
the rights attached to b shares. moreover, in accordance with the provisions of article l. 228-17 of the french commercial code, any
company merger or spinoff plans pursuant to which b shares cannot be exchanged for shares carrying specific equivalent rights will be
subject to approval by any special general meeting concerned.

b shares issue entitlement to only one five thousandth of the amount of any distribution or, where applicable, asset sharing, decided to
the benefit of each ordinary share. b shares have no preferential subscription rights in any rights issue or operations with rights to
ordinary shares; the conversion ratio, however, may be adjusted so as to maintain the rights of holders of b shares, in accordance with
legal and regulatory conditions, as stated in article 37 of the company’s by-laws. with respect to ownership of assets, b shares issue
entitlement to the proceeds of liquidation in proportion to the amount of share capital they represent.


21.2.4 allocation of profits (article 31 of get se’s by-laws)

the following deductions are made from the profits of each financial year, minus prior losses if any, in the order set out below:
• five per cent at least to constitute the reserve account required by law;
• the amounts determined by the general meeting to constitute such reserves for which it determines the distribution and use; and
• the amounts that the general meeting decides to carry forward.

the balance, if any, shall be distributed among all of the shareholders in proportion to the number of shares held by each of them.

if the balance sheet prepared during or at the end of the financial year and certified by the statutory auditors indicates that get se, since
the end of the previous financial year, after any necessary depreciation and reserves and after deducting any previous losses and
amounts required to constitute the necessary reserves pursuant to applicable laws or the by-laws, has made a profit, interim dividends
may be distributed before the accounts for the financial year have been approved. the amount of the interim dividend may not exceed
the amount of profit as defined above.

the conditions for the payment of dividends in cash are set by the shareholders’ general meeting, or failing that, by the board of
directors. b shares issue entitlement to only one five thousandth of the amount of any distribution.

payment of dividends in cash must be carried out within a maximum period of nine months following the end of the financial year, unless
extended by a court authorisation.

a merger or demerger of get se has no effect on the double voting right that may be exercised at shareholder meetings of the surviving
companies if the by-laws of such companies so provide.

any share converted into bearer form or which is transferred shall lose the double voting right conferred on it as described in the
preceding three paragraphs. however, the double voting right is not lost and the time proceeds are not affected by a transfer by
inheritance, liquidation of assets held jointly by spouses or inter vivos gifts in favour of a spouse or relative entitled to inherit.

22.1. the treaty of canterbury

the principal purpose of the treaty of canterbury is to authorise the construction and operation of the fixed link by private
concessionaire companies, without any government funds.

under the terms of the treaty of canterbury, the states guarantee fm and ctg, as concessionaires, under national and eu law,
freedom to determine their commercial policy, tariffs and the nature of the services they offer to customers.

the treaty of canterbury also includes various other provisions relating to the fixed link such as:
• the establishment of the igc, to deal with all issues relating to the construction and operation of the fixed link in the name of the
   states and by express delegation of their authority;
• the establishment of the safety authority to advise and assist the igc on all issues relating to the safety of the construction and
   operation of the fixed link. the safety authority also assists in drawing up regulations applicable to the safety of the fixed link and
   monitors compliance of such regulations with applicable national or international rules and regulations. the members of the safety
   authority are appointed on an equal basis by each of the states;
• the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to settle disputes between the states and the concessionaires relating to the concession
   agreement;
• the taxation by the two states of profits and revenues generated by the construction and operation of the fixed link is governed by
   applicable legislation, including any double taxation treaties for the prevention of tax evasion in force between the two states and
   relating to direct taxes, together with any related protocols;
• compliance by the two states with the principle of non-discrimination with respect to taxes relating to charges payable by customers
   of other directly competing modes of crossing the channel;
• the absence of any withholding tax by the two states on the transfer of funds and financial payments required for the operation of the
   fixed link, either between the two states, or coming from or going to other countries, other than the general taxation of payments
   represented by such transfers or financial payments; and
• the commitment of the states to cooperate in a number of areas, including defence, security, policing, border controls, interpretation
   or application of the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement.




22.2. the concession agreement

the concession agreement was signed on 14 march 1986 between the states and the concessionaires, pursuant to the treaty
of canterbury.

initially entered into for a period of 55 years, the concession agreement was extended by 10 years and then 34 years by successive
amendments dated, respectively, 29 june 1994 and 29 march 1999, duly ratified by legislative provisions in france and the
united kingdom. the term of the concession agreement was therefore extended first from 55 to 65 years, then from 65 to 99 years and
expires in 2086.

pursuant to the terms of the concession agreement, the concessionaires have the right and the obligation, jointly and severally, to
design, finance, construct and operate the fixed link, and the concessionaires do so at their own risk and without any government
funds or state guarantees regardless of the risks that may materialise during the performance of the concession agreement. in
particular, the concessionaires are solely liable for any loss or damage caused to users of the fixed link or third parties resulting from
its operation.

accordingly, the principal obligations of the concessionaires under the concession agreement are:
• to operate and maintain the fixed link and employ all means necessary to permit the continuous and fluid flow of traffic in safe and
   convenient conditions; and
• to comply with applicable laws and regulations in relation to the operation of the system and in particular in relation to customs,
   immigration, security, sanitary and road transport controls and rescue services.


22.2.1 tariffs and commercial policy

the concessionaires are free to set their fares. national laws relating to price and fare controls by public authorities do not apply to the
fixed link. however, these provisions are without prejudice to the application of national or eu rules relating to competition and abuse of



                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                               

      dominant positions. the concessionaires must not discriminate between users of the fixed link, in particular with respect to their
      nationality or direction of travel. they may however adjust tariffs in accordance with normal commercial practices.


      22.2.2 role of the igc

      the igc, established by the treaty of canterbury, was created to monitor, on behalf and with the authority of the states, all issues
      relating to the construction and operation of the system. the igc is made up of representatives of each of the states on an equal basis.

      the igc acts as concession authority vis-à-vis the eurotunnel group on behalf of and under the control of the states, and its duties in
      this regard are:
      • to supervise the construction and operation of the system;
      • to take decisions on behalf of the states in relation to the performance of the concession agreement, including the right to impose
          penalties on the concessionaires in the event of a breach of their obligations under the concession agreement;
      • to approve the proposals of the safety authority;
      • to prepare or participate in the preparation of all regulations applicable to the system and monitor their application, including those in
          relation to maritime and environmental matters; and
      • to issue advice and recommendations concerning the states and the concessionaires.

      in 2014, the group paid c5.7 million to the states as a contribution to the costs of running the igc.


      22.2.3 penalties

      any failure by the concessionaires to perform their obligations under the concession agreement shall entitle the states to impose
      penalties, but no other measure under the concession agreement.

      if a breach is identified by the igc, it shall inform the concessionaires in writing, specifying the nature and subject of the breach. after the
      concessionaires have been heard, the igc may issue a formal notice to remedy the breach within a sufficiently long period of time which
      may not be less than thirty days.

      if at the end of such period, the concessionaires have not remedied the breach identified by the igc, it may impose a penalty on the
      basis of a fixed initial daily sum of between 10,000 and 100,000 ecus at 1986 values (changed to euros at a rate of one to one on
      1 january 1999) and proportionate to the seriousness of the breach giving rise to the penalty.


      22.2.4 early termination of the concession agreement and
      compensation

      each party to the concession agreement may request the arbitration tribunal, established pursuant to the treaty of canterbury, to
      declare the termination of the concession agreement in exceptional circumstances, such as war, invasion, nuclear explosion or natural
      disaster. in such cases, in principle, no compensation is owed to the concessionaires. however, the states may pay the
      concessionaires an amount representing the financial benefits, if any, that they may derive from such termination.

      each of the states may terminate the concession for reasons of national defence. in such case, the concessionaires may claim
      compensation under the conditions laid down in the treaty of canterbury. the treaty of canterbury specifies that such compensation
      shall be governed by the law of the relevant state.

      each of the states may terminate the concession agreement in the event of a fault committed by the concessionaires. the concession
      agreement defines a fault as a breach of a particularly serious nature of the obligations under the concession agreement or ceasing to
      operate the fixed link. the states may issue a formal notice to the concessionaires giving them a period of three months, which may be
      extended up to a maximum period of six months, to remedy the breach. this formal notice is also sent to the lenders that financed the
      construction and operation of the fixed link. if, within such period, the concessionaires have not remedied the breaches complained of,
      the states may terminate the concession agreement, subject to giving prior notice to the lenders of their right of substitution.

      any termination of the concession agreement by the states, other than in a situation described above, gives the concessionaires the
      right to payment of compensation. such compensation shall be for the entire direct and certain loss actually suffered by the
      concessionaires and attributable to the states, within the limits of what can reasonably be estimated at the date of the termination,

including the damage suffered and operating losses. to calculate this compensation, account is taken of the share of liability of the
concessionaires, if any, in the events which led to the termination.


22.2.5 assignment and substitution by lenders

the concession agreement provides that each of the concessionaires has the right to transfer the concession agreement or the rights
it confers, with the agreement of the states.

in addition, upon the occurrence of one of the events set out below, and for as long as the effects of the event persist, or any other action
or intention that could lead to the termination of the concession agreement, the lenders, approved as such by the states pursuant to the
concession agreement (the ‘‘lenders’’) may request of the states that substitution be operated in favour of entities controlled by them
(the ‘‘substituted entities’’) if: (i) the concessionaires fail to pay, within a contractual grace period, any sum due and payable under the
terms of the finance documents, (ii) the concessionaires do not have and cannot procure sufficient funds to finance the forecasted
operating costs of the fixed link, and the related finance charges, (iii) it appears that the date of full and final payment of all claims of the
lenders must be postponed for a significant length of time or (iv) in the event of the fixed link being abandoned, suspension of
payments, liquidation, enforcement of security by other creditors or similar events.

the substituted entities must prove to the states, at the time of the substitution, that they have sufficient technical and financial capacity
to continue performance of the concession agreement.

the amendment to the concession agreement dated 29 march 1999 granted an extension to the term of the concession agreement
for the sole benefit of the concessionaires, such that the extension would not apply if the lenders exercised their substitution right.

in accordance with article 32 of the concession agreement, the lenders of the term loan have been approved by the states as lenders
able to benefit from the substitution right under the terms set out in the concession agreement.


22.2.6 taxation and sharing of profits

taxation and customs matters are decided by the states in accordance with the provisions of the treaty of canterbury. if it appears that
changes in tax or customs legislation have a discriminatory effect on the fixed link, the relevant state will examine the issue with the
concessionaires. furthermore, in accordance with article 19 of the concession agreement, as a matter of principle the concessionaires
share equally between ctg and fm at cost price, all expenses and all revenues from the fixed link for the period during which they
operate it. to this end, the consequences of any indirect taxation on the supply of goods or services levied only on one of the
concessionaires will be taken into account in the costs to be shared. any equalising payment made between fm and ctg will be
treated as a capital expense or a revenue payment as determined by the tax legislation of the two states.

with respect to the period between 2052 and 2086, the concessionaires will be obliged to pay to the states a total annual sum,
including all corporate taxes of any kind whatsoever, equal to 59% of all pre-tax profits.


22.2.7 litigation

disputes relating to the application of the concession agreement must be submitted to an arbitration tribunal which will apply the
relevant provisions of the treaty of canterbury and the concession agreement. provisions of french or english law may, if necessary, be
applied, if this is dictated by the performance of specific obligations under french or english law. relevant principles of international law
and, if the parties so agree, the principles of equity may be applied.




22.3. railway usage contract

the railway usage contract was entered into on 29 july 1987 between the concessionaires and the brb and sncf rail networks. it
sets out the basis on which the railways undertake and are authorised to use the fixed link. the railway usage contract specifies the
conditions under which the concessionaires allow the trains of the railways to use the fixed link from the date the railway usage
contract came into force until 2052, and the conditions under which the railways undertake to supply certain railway infrastructure to
the concessionaires, and develop certain services.



                                                                                 2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se
                                                                                                                                                    


22 material contracts

      the railway usage contract also sets out the obligations of the railways, with respect to the railway infrastructure and the rolling stock
      utilised to ensure a sufficient level and quality of traffic in the tunnel. likewise, the concessionaires subscribe to a number of
      commitments relating to maintenance of the fixed link. pursuant to the railway usage contract, the railways are authorised to use up
      to 50% of the capacity of the fixed link per hour and in each direction, up until 2052.

      under the terms of the railway usage contract, the railways are obliged to pay the concessionaires fixed annual charges and variable
      charges depending on the number of passengers travelling on passenger trains and the freight tonnage carried through the fixed link.
      adjustment mechanisms for annual charges are set out in the event that the fixed link is unavailable. finally, under the railway usage
      contract, the railways must pay a contribution to the concessionaires’ operating costs. to this end, the railways make monthly
      provisional payments to the concessionaires against operating costs for the current period. payments are subsequently adjusted to
      take account of real operating costs, with the final amount of the contribution determined in accordance with the formula set out in the
      railway usage contract.

      the railway usage contract is governed by french law.

      in addition, the strategy for the re-launch of freight services offers a simplified pricing structure mechanism for goods trains, with a toll per
      freight train rather than per tonne of freight, based on a charging regime published annually by eurotunnel in its network statement.

      a substantial majority of the eurotunnel group’s revenues emanating from its rail network (see chapter 6) is made up of the annual fixed
      and variable charges as referred to above.

      in the context of the privatisation of the british railways, brb entered into back-to-back contracts with certain entities, including network
      rail, db schenker rail uk (formerly ews) and eurostar international ltd (formerly eurostar uk ltd), under the terms of which brb
      delegated to them operational execution of some of its obligations to the concessionaires. as part of the agreement with the british and
      french governments regarding the extension of the concession agreement until 2086, the eurotunnel group undertook, under certain
      conditions, to work with the entities to which execution of these obligations had been delegated, to ensure the development of
      passenger train services and goods train services.

      in accordance with eu directives governing the liberalisation of the international rail transport market, eurotunnel publishes its network
      statement annually offering equivalent conditions of access to its rail network as those set out by the railway usage contract for other
      railway companies.




      22.4. the term loan and ancillary agreements

      fm and ctg entered into the term loan dated 20 march 2007 (as modified by the amendments dated 27 june 2007, 20 august 2007,
      30 november 2007, 31 january 2008, 13 may 2009, 20 april 2011 and 24 september 2014), under which credit facilities in a principal
      amount of £1,500 million and c1,965 million (the ‘‘senior facilities’’) were made available to fm and ctg on 28 june 2007 by goldman
      sachs credit partners l.p. and deutsche bank a.g. (london branch) (together, the ‘‘initial lenders’’) in order to (i) reimburse the
      outstanding debt of tnu sa, tnu plc and their subsidiaries prior to the financial restructuring of the business in 2007 of a principal
      amount of c9.073 billion at 30 september 2006 (the senior debt, the fourth tranche debt, the tier 1a debt, the tier 1 debt and the
      tier 2 debt), (ii) finance the cash payments provided for in the safeguard plan to the holders of the tier 3 debt and the owners of
      eurotunnel bonds issued prior to the financial restructuring of the business in 2007, and (iii) pay the costs and expenses of the financial
      restructuring of the company in 2007 and certain interest due in respect of the old financial debt.

      the financing of the senior facilities has been arranged by goldman sachs international and deutsche bank ag (london branch)
      (the ‘‘mlas’’).

      for the purposes of the management of the senior facilities, these loans were securitised on 20 august 2007.


      22.4.1 principal provisions of the term loan

      summary of the tranching and the financial conditions of the term loan
      the senior facilities consist of:
      • a tranche a1 loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate linked to inflation in the united kingdom;
      • a tranche a2 loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate linked to inflation in france;
      • a tranche b1 loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a fixed rate;

•   a tranche b2 loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a fixed rate;
•   a tranche c1 loan denominated in sterling, bearing interest at a variable rate; and
•   a tranche c2 loan denominated in euros, bearing interest at a variable rate.

the tranches c1 and c2, bearing interest at a variable rate, are hedged as indicated in a) of the present paragraph.

the weighted average interest rate applicable to the senior facilities, including commission, calculated on the basis of interest and
commission payable in respect of the term loan and the fee letter relating to the commitment letter of the mlas dated
25 november 2006 (as amended and accepted on 16 december 2006) is estimated to be 5.47% per annum excluding the hedging
contracts (taking into account for these purposes applicable rates as of the date of this registration document).

expenditure relating to the servicing of debt under the term loan, including payments in relation to the hedging contracts, is expected to
be approximately c247 million for 2015 (based on the interest rate in force on the date of the present registration document), including a
principal repayment of c34 million.

the borrowings denominated in sterling have been made available to ctg and those in euros have been made available to fm.

repayment of the term loan
the funds borrowed under the term loan will be repayable in accordance with their respective repayment schedules.

repayment of the tranche a1 and a2 loans will begin 11 years after the start of availability of such loans and will be completed at least
35 years after the date of signature of the term loan.

repayment of the tranche b1 and b2 loans began in 2013, six years after the date on which the term loan was signed.

repayment of the tranche c1 and c2 loans will begin respectively 39 and 34 years after the date on which such loans become available
and will be completed in june 2050.

prepayment of the term loan
the amounts borrowed under the senior facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at the instigation of the relevant borrower, subject to the
payment of certain market standard prepayment premia.

the amounts borrowed under the senior facilities may also be subject to mandatory prepayment, under certain conditions and in
certain proportions, in particular from funds arising from insurance proceeds, permitted asset transfers, expropriation of such assets,
compensation under the concession agreement and, in certain instances, excess cash flow.

if the eurotunnel group does not meet certain financial targets, excess cash flow must (i) during the first years following drawdown on
the senior facilities, be paid into a secured account set up for prepayment of amounts lent under the senior facilities and
(ii) subsequently be used directly for such prepayment until the eurotunnel group once again meets the above mentioned financial
targets.


undertakings and prohibitions under the term loan
the term loan includes certain undertakings and prohibitions which are customary for a loan of its nature, in particular restrictions
relating to:
• the creation or maintenance of liens on the assets of the eurotunnel group;
• the sale or transfer of eurotunnel assets and the acquisition by the eurotunnel group of new assets;
• the granting of loans, securities or guarantees for the benefit of third parties; and
• the amendment of contracts which were conditions precedent for utilisation of the loans under the term loan, including inter alia the
    railway usage contract.

in addition, pursuant to the terms of the term loan, the eurotunnel group is required to meet the following financial covenants: at each
reference date, the debt-service coverage ratio must not be less than 1.10 from 28 june 2012. for the purposes of this test, the ratio is
calculated, on a rolling 12-month period, on a consolidated basis taking into account (i) as regards the calculation of available cash flow
for the servicing of debt, the borrowers and guarantors in connection with the senior facilities, and (ii) as regards the calculation of debt
servicing, the eurotunnel group. get se has respected the debt-service coverage ratio for 2014.

while the term loan restricts any increase in the financial indebtedness of the eurotunnel group, it permits, subject to certain conditions,
the borrowing of revolving facilities up to a maximum amount of c75 million (the ‘‘revolving credit facility’’).




                                                                              2014 registration document – groupe eurotunnel se


22 material contracts

      the term loan permits the eurotunnel group to pay dividends, provided that such dividends are paid out of excess cash flow
      (as defined in the term loan) or funds arising from a permitted disposal under the term loan (insofar as these funds have not been
      allocated to mandatory prepayment) on the condition that no default is continuing under the term loan and that the debt-service
      coverage ratio is not less than 1.25. for the purposes of this test, the ratio is calculated on the basis of a rolling 12-month period, on a
      consolidated basis, such consolidation to include (i) as regards the calculation of available cash flow for the servicing of debt, the
      borrowers and guarantors in connection with the senior facilities and (ii) as regards the calculation of debt service, the eurotunnel group
      (with amortisation being calculated by reference to the greater of (i) the hypothetical amortisation of the loan based on an annuity and
      (ii) the contractual amortisation). failure to meet this ratio on a six-monthly testing date would not constitute an event of default but would
      lead to restrictions on the use of the group’s excess available cash flow on the date of the next interest payment on the term loan until
      such time as the test is met once again. if these conditions are not met on an interest repayment date in connection with the term loan,
      the excess cash flow and funds will be placed into an account dedicated to so-called ‘‘capex’’ expenditure. failure to meet this test on
      three consecutive six-monthly testing dates would trigger a prepayment event, under which the group’s excess available cash flow
      would have to be used towards prepayment of the term loan until the testing date on which the ratio is met once again.

      event of default and acceleration
      the term loan contains a number of events of default which, in certain instances subject to grace periods, enable the lenders to declare
      the term loan immediately due and payable, to enforce the liens described below or to demand the start of the substitution mechanism
      provided for under the terms of the concession agreement and described in paragraph 22.2.5 of this registration document.

      the events of default include in particular:
      • any failure to pay the term loan;
      • a failure to comply with any provision of the term loan, the intercreditor agreement or related documents. these provisions impose
         limits relative to indebtedness, acquisitions, sales and other transfers, mergers, loans, guarantees and the granting of new sureties
         by the member companies of the eurotunnel group, and include in particular:
           (i) a financial commitment pursuant to which get se is obliged to ensure that at each half-yearly test date subsequent to
                31 december 2007, the ratio of cash flow from operational activities over the total cost of servicing the debt resulting from the
                senior facilities is not below 1.10 from 28 june 2012, the said ratio being calculated by reference to the twelve-month period
                preceding the date of the test; and
           (ii) certain commitments related to the tax treatment of the eurotunnel group and where non-compliance is reasonably likely to
                substantially affect the financial situation of fm, ctg or the eurotunnel group;
      • a declaration or statement made or deemed to have been made by a borrower or a guarantor in relation to the term loan, or any
         other financial document related to it or any other document presented by or on behalf of a borrower or a guarantor in relation to the
         said financial documents (which contain the declarations and statements that are usual for this type of financing), which proves to
         have been erroneous or misleading at the time when it was made or deemed to have been made;
      • the occurrence of a cross default under any other indebtedness (greater than a certain amount) of any of the companies within the
         eurotunnel group (other than get se);
      • the inability of any borrower or guarantor to pay its debts as they fall due, the insolvency or the opening of any legal proceedings in
         relation to any borrower or guarantor under the term loan;
      • the illegality or invalidity of the term loan, any related liens or the subordination created under the intercreditor agreement;
      • the permanent impossibility of carrying on the business of operating the tunnel, or the destruction of the tunnel, or the cessation of a
         substantial part of its activities by a borrower or a guarantor;
      • a guarantor ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of groupe eurotunnel se;
      • any act or omission of france or the united kingdom which renders a borrower or guarantor under the term loan incapable of
         performing its obligations under the term loan and related documents; and
      • the occurrence of litigation (or similar proceedings) against any eurotunnel group member company or its assets, which is
         reasonably likely to be adversely determined against the relevant company and to have a substantial adverse effect on the financial
         position of fm, ctg or the eurotunnel group.

      the term loan also provides that no event of default may be deemed to have occurred because of (i) the safeguard procedure having
      been initiated for the benefit of certain tnu group companies or the implementation of the safeguard plan, (ii) the commencement or
      continuation of any litigation (including any appeal thereof) prior to the disbursement date for the term loan disputing the validity of the
      safeguard procedure or the safeguard plan, (iii) any act or omission of any tnu group company under the safeguard procedure which
      is required by the legal provisions relating to the safeguard plan or which is made for the purpose of implementing the safeguard plan,
      and (iv) any failure by any tnu group company to make a payment when due where such payment has not been made solely because
      that company is prevented from making such payment by the legal provisions relating to the safeguard plan.

      the term loan also includes other events of default that are usual for this type of funding.

a) hedging arrangements in respect of the term loan
fm and ctg, prior to the drawdown under the term loan, each entered into various hedging arrangements in order to hedge their
respective exposure to interest rate fluctuation in connection with their payment obligations under the term loan as indicated in
note u.2 of the consolidated accounts figuring in paragraph 20.3.1 of this registration document.


b) agreement between creditors
prior to drawdown under the term loan, the eurotunnel group entered into an intercreditor deed with its bank lenders and its intra-
group creditors (the ‘‘intercreditor deed’’) pursuant to which the claims of all intra-group creditors are subordinated to the claims of the
bank lenders.

the intercreditor deed also provides for the security and the guarantees described below to be held by a security trustee for the benefit
of the lenders under the term loan, and, ultimately once in existence, the revolving credit facility.


22.4.2 guarantees and security relating to the term loan

guarantees
under the intercreditor deed, get se, fm, efl, ctg, esgie, eurotunnel se, esl, eurotunnelplus limited and gamond insurance
company (the ‘‘original guarantors’’) each jointly and severally guarantee the commitments made by fm and ctg, in their capacity as
borrowers under the term loan vis-à-vis the initial lenders, the arrangers, the agents and the hedging counterparties of the term loan.
egp, tnu sa and tnu plc, each of which were original guarantors, have been merged with get se, and eurotunnelplus distribution
sas, which was also an original guarantor, has been merged with eurotunnel se.

the term loan provides that, following its execution, certain of the eurotunnel group companies (other than the original guarantors) will
be required also to become guarantors of the term loan if, in particular, their contribution to the ebitda, gross value of assets or
turnover of the eurotunnel group increases above a specified pre-determined threshold.

in order to guarantee their obligations as borrowers under the term loan and guarantors under the intercreditor deed, the initial
guarantors have granted security, the terms and scope of which, unlike the security granted in connection with the debt prior to the
financial restructuring of the business in 2007, will take into account the operational needs of the business of the eurotunnel group.

security granted by the eurotunnel group under french law
to secure their obligations as borrower under the term loan or guarantor under the intercreditor deed, the initial guarantors owning
french assets have granted the following security:

i)     assignment of trade receivables by way of guarantee under which (i) fm assigns its receivables under the concession agreement
       and the railway usage contract as well as its trade receivables owed by the freight transporters and coach operators and its
       insurance receivables and intercompany receivables held by it on the french subsidiaries of the eurotunnel group, (ii) ctg assigns
       the same categories of receivables as fm with the exception of its trade receivables owed by the freight transporters and coach
       operators, and (iii) other members of the eurotunnel group qualifying as guarantor assign their insurance receivables and
       intercompany receivables held against french companies of the eurotunnel group;

ii)    unregistered mortgages over fm’s main real estate assets that are not the subject of short- or medium-term development projects;

iii)   a non-possessory lien over fm’s rolling stock;

iv)    a pledge on all bank and investment accounts open in france in the name of any borrower or guarantor under the term loan;

v)     a pledge on shares in the eurotunnel group members held by the borrowers or guarantors under the term loan;

vi)    a pledge on the main eurotunnel group trademarks; and

vii) a pledge on receivables held by fm under certain pieces of land comprised in the ‘‘zac 1’’ and which is the subject of long-term
     construction leases (baux à construction).

security granted by the eurotunnel group under english law
to secure their obligations as borrower under the term loan or guarantor under the intercreditor deed, the initial guarantors have each

22 material contracts

      security over the other assets of the eurotunnel group
      all of the shares of members of the eurotunnel group that are not subject to security as described above (with the exception of
      europorte sas and its subsidiaries) have been pledged by way of security for the obligations of the borrowers under the term loan and
      guarantors under the intercreditor deed.




      22.5. master intra-group debt agreement

      intra-group debts existed between the various companies of the group. some of them were expressed in contracts concluded between
      2007 and 2009 for the financial restructuring or simplification of the structure of the group (‘‘intra-group debts’’). certain of these intra-
      group debts for which contracts were concluded in 2007 were reorganised in 2009 as part of the transactions prior to the merger of
      tnu sa into get se which gave rise to the conclusion of new contracts for intra-group loans.

      the intra-group debts, because they were concluded over a period from 2007 to 2009 and partly re-organised in 2009, had different
      characteristics as to interest rate and maturity which complicated the financial and accounting management of group companies.

      group companies have therefore concluded a contract entitled the ‘‘master intra-group debt agreement’’ the principal object of which
      is the harmonisation of (i) the rules for current accounts between group companies, (ii) the interest rates of the various intra-group debts
      and (iii) where possible, the other conditions of these intra-group debts in order to facilitate the financial and accounting management of
      group companies and to reflect the financial policy between the group’s companies.




      22.6. maritime activity

      on 11 june 2012, the paris commercial court issued an order authorising the liquidator of seafrance to sell three ferries belonging to the
      former shipping company, in insolvent liquidation since 9 january 2012, to the eurotunnel group. the eurotunnel group purchased the
      berlioz, rodin and nord-pas-de-calais ferries, in addition to other sundry assets, for c65 million, with an inalienability clause for the
      vessels lasting five years, on the basis of the provisions of article l. 641-10 of the french commercial code. the purchase of these
      ferries was carried out by three subsidiaries of get se: euro-transmanche sas, euro-transmanche 3 be and euro-transmanche
      3 npc.

      the maritime activity has been structured around a chain of marine charters, based on a ‘‘bareboat’’ charter with the scop seafrance
      workers’ cooperative.

      under the terms of the bareboat chartering contract, the charter operator (the party providing the vessel hire) undertakes to make
      available to the charterer (the party hiring the vessel) a ship, for a given period of time, with no fittings or crew. three bareboat charter-
      parties have been entered into in this manner between the companies owning the ferries and the scop seafrance workers’
      cooperative. under the terms of these charters, euro-transmanche sas, euro-transmanche 3 be and euro-transmanche 3 npc have
      handed over the fitting out and nautical management of their ferries to scop seafrance, while the latter is prohibited from
      sub-chartering the ferries in any way and from any commercial operation of said ferries without the prior agreement of the three ferry-
      owning companies. in addition, the charterer guarantees the charter operator against any third-party claims which may arise as a result
      of operation of the ferries.

      myferrylink sas sub-charters ferry capacity to ensure that marine transport services are marketed to third parties. the marketing of
      freight crossings is performed directly by myferrylink sas, while the marketing of passenger crossings is sub-contracted to dover
      calais ferries ltd.

      myferrylink sas has no stake in the in the share capital of the scop nor any veto right in strategic decisions of the latter. myferrylink
      sas buys crossings from the scop and markets its services. myferrylink sas employs its own sales and administrative staff, and it
      alone determines its corporate business strategy. the scop acts only as an external provider/subcontractor which operates the cross-
      channel services, while the eurotunnel group owns the vessels, and benefits from the profits and suffers the potential losses of
      this activity.

i methodological note to chapter 17
  corporate social responsibility



      annexe i – methodological
      note to chapter 17
      corporate social responsibility
      ◦                                                                                                                     ◦
      the eurotunnel group’s social and environmental reporting is based on information stipulated in article 225 of french law no. 2010-788
      of 12 july 2010, known as ‘‘grenelle 2’’, and the transparency principles of the global reporting initiative (gri).

      for this year, the eurotunnel group has decided to submit three new workforce indicators to detailed testing by an independent third
      party as a proactive step to ensure reasonable rather than moderate assurance of the obligations. moreover, the group has introduced a
      partially automated reporting system for the inputting, gathering and consolidation of environmental data. this tool has been deployed
      to the contributors of each subsidiary within the scope of reporting.

      the group also decided to make a further step towards greater transparency of its approach and relevance of the information provided
      by introducing, for next year, four new social indicators.

      the group’s csr data is consolidated under the responsibility of the group human resources department.


      consolidation period for csr reporting
      the period used for annual reporting of workforce and societal data is the calendar year (1 january 2014 to 31 december 2014).

      environmental data, however, is reported on a rolling year basis (from 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014) as data and supporting
      evidence for the full year is not available within a timescale compatible with the publication date of the registration document.


      scope of consolidation
      data is consolidated for all group entities, including myferrylink for certain social information as at 31 december 2014. on the
      environmental side, the absence of reporting and the transitory nature of the situation of the ferries with the entry into force on
      1 january 2015 of the marpol marine pollution regulations, justified the exclusion of myferrylink from the scope of consolidation for the
      2014 financial year.

      choice of indicators
      the purpose of the indicators is to monitor the commitments made by the group and its progress in terms of environmental and
      workforce performance. the indicators were chosen by the group because they are appropriate to its activities and serve the needs of
      stakeholders as well as it regulatory obligations.

      workforce indicators have been chosen to:
      • measure the results of the human resources policy and the group’s social commitments,
      • take account of cultural differences and local disparities (different national law, varying legal obligations, etc.).

      environmental indicators have been chosen to:
      • serve environmental policy and reflect progress in the group’s different activities; the indicators chosen are appropriate to the
         group’s activities,
      • allow monitoring of the group’s performance on key environmental issues.


      internal consolidation and control
      workforce information is collected from each entity through the computerised data feedback system, which includes consistency
      checks. the data is checked and validated by the group entities and consolidated across the entire scope by the group human
      resources department.

      each entity’s environmental information is collected through the computerised data feedback system. the data is checked and validated
      by each group entity and is then consolidated by the group human resources department.

during consolidation of workforce and environmental data, consistency checks are carried out at the group level. comparisons are
made with the results from previous years and discrepancies deemed significant are analysed and examined in greater detail.

societal information is collected, checked and validated at the level of each entity. it is then centralised by the group human resources
department.

further information and methodological limits of the indicators collected
the methodologies used for some workforce and environmental indicators may in practice be limited by:
• a lack of harmonisation in national/international definitions and legislation,
• the representativeness of the measurements taken or limited availability of external data needed to calculate the indicator,
• the qualitative and therefore subjective nature of some data,
• the practical methods used to collect and input this data.

the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases is based on the methodology developed by the carbon trust.

waste generated by operations on customers’ sites in respect of monitoring of the activities of contractors, is excluded from the scope
of reporting.

the sites for which natural gas consumption data was not available for all or part of the reporting period have been estimated on the
basis of average consumption using the ademe’s ‘‘bilan carbone’’ method.

water consumption for un-metered sites was extrapolated by applying a ratio of water consumption in m3 per employee present on site.
this ratio was calculated from sites which are metered.

as none of gbrf’s sites are equipped with metres, europorte france’s ratio has been applied as their activities are similar.

gbrf’s electricity consumption was limited to sites equipped a meter. however, this covers more than 97% of the staff attached to a site
(i.e. the total number of staff less mobile and home-working staff).

some data which was not available for all or part of the reporting period and which was necessary for the calculation of absenteeism,
frequency rate and the management-to-staff ratio, has been estimated in accordance with the methodologies described in the reference
sheets.

the number of staff in 2013 was adjusted to 3,747, compared to 3,744 previously reported. this change related to staff of british entities
following a refinement of the methodology. the change, which is not material, was only made in the reporting system and not in the
group’s publications.

in the calculation of the rate of absenteeism for the four french europorte entities, the number of scheduled hours is obtained by
multiplying the number of full-time equivalent staff by the number of theoretical hours.

moreover, the gross payroll and employer’s charges are not reported for eight employees located in different european countries (spain,
netherlands and germany) due to the collection methods. however, the scope of these indicators covers 99.8% of the group’s staff.

the training budget is the sum of logistics costs, external costs and the related staff costs. this last component has been estimated in
2013 and 2014 for the entity gbrf on the basis of gross payroll divided by the number of hours worked, and then multiplied by the total
number of training hours conducted by the subsidiary.

external audit
in order to ensure that it provides reliable information, each year the eurotunnel group requests the opinion of independent third party
regarding the quality of its workforce and environmental information collection and reporting procedures. in 2014, the audit was carried
out by mazars. the 2014 assurance report expresses reasonable assurance for three environmental and seven social indicators
(information marked ), and limited assurance for the other indicators verified.

annexe iv – csr policy: principles,
challenges and commitments
◦                                                                                                                           ◦
csr at the heart of the group plan
corporate social responsibility (csr) requires companies to integrate environmental and social issues into their business model and
plan. a self-regulation initiative which in its early days was adopted on a voluntary basis, csr has been enshrined in a regulatory
framework initiated in france since 2001-2002 by the law on new economic regulations (ner). the verification of sociological, social
and environmental data by an independent third party has gone on to become obligatory for french businesses following the publication
in 2012 of the decree implementing article 225 of the grenelle 2 law and subsequently the ruling of 13 may 2013. eurotunnel group has
exceeded this obligation and its initiative goes beyond simple verification.

eurotunnel group places social responsibility at the heart of its activities and in its interactions with its various internal and external
stakeholders and provides clear information about its commitments to its partners: employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders,
investors, territorial collectivities, governments, associations and communities. true to its principles, it has operated a policy for more
than twenty years which is both challenging and supportive of corporate social responsibility, which it applies in three main areas, the
strategic areas of focus linked to its activities:
• people, i.e. each of the more than 3,900 eurotunnel group collaborators;
• nature, in other words the environment and the eco-systems with which its increasing activities interact;
• region, or all communities with which the group has a relationship, particularly in france, the uk and europe.

eurotunnel group has developed a csr policy which is based on the respect of fundamental rights as defined by the major founding
international texts: the universal declaration of human rights and the international labour organization’s declaration on fundamental
principles and rights at work.

the eurotunnel group board of directors and its chief executive officer fully support the principles stated in these international codes
and standards. the object of this policy is to translate this support into a set of operational procedures defining a common approach for
all group entities.

compliance with this policy will be continuously monitored under the close scrutiny of the group’s board of directors supported by the
committee for sustainable development. stakeholders shall also be informed of the policy via the group’s various annual reports.

the csr targets will be defined each year and will form part of the targets set for the directors and managers of the various group
entities. they shall be monitored and evaluated during individual annual reviews.

each manager shall be charged with ensuring that the stated principles are communicated to all employees and are further understood
and observed by them.

challenges
eurotunnel group has identified five major challenges which correspond to core issues set out in the major founding texts and the
various international frameworks and standards (global compact; grl, iso 26000). these challenges can be split into several
categories: social, regional, environmental, economic and ethical.
• social challenges: respect the rights of employees
• regional challenges: develop close links with the region
• environmental challenges: reduce the impact of the business activity on the environment
• economic challenges: manage relationships with customers
• ethical challenges: continue with policy development and value sharing within the group in connection with stakeholders.

answering these challenges has been and remains a priority for eurotunnel group which, since its inception, has been committed to a
social responsibility policy reconciling economic performance, social equity and environmental protection as part of a programme of
continuous improvement.


social challenges
for the group, responding to the social challenges involves a commitment to fully support a work environment which fosters the
personal development and growth of its workers. the human resources policies are developed on the basis of criteria which support

iv csr policy: principles, challenges and commitments

      truly equal opportunities and treatment for all employees. in its charter of ethics and behaviour, eurotunnel group has effectively
      committed itself to combating all forms of discrimination. in the same charter, it strongly reasserts its adherence to the principles and
      values of the universal declaration of human rights 1948 and to the fundamental conventions of the international labour organization
      as well as to the principles of the united nations global compact.

      in order to reinforce the development of its workers and to guarantee a stable and safe working environment for them, eurotunnel group
      has made the issue of improving security and health at work a major concern with the renewed and expressed target of zero accidents.
      mindful of the progression of its employees’ performance, the group considers the individual annual review to be an essential
      management tool for human resources and has therefore set a target for all managers in the company of 100% reviews.

      the group invests heavily in young people and is developing its relationships with universities and schools with the aim of fostering a
      better understanding of its business and of better integrating young people into the world of work. this is why an agreement was signed
      in january 2013 with the ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées creating for a period of 5 years an education and research chair for the
      science of railway transport dedicated to the study of railway activity. the aim of this chair is training and research on the topics
      associated with infrastructure transport service. this initiative attests to eurotunnel group’s willingness to share its expertise in order to
      advance science and innovation and position the railway sector as a forward-looking business.

      eurotunnel group also is also strongly focused on training for careers in the railway sector. created by the group in 2011, the
      international railway training centre ciffco contributes to the creation of skilled jobs and professional integration. it plays a leading role
      in the development of railway transport and its associated businesses and, more generally, plays a part in the economic development
      and influence of the nord-pas-de-calais region.


      regional challenges
      as a committed partner in its economic and social environment, eurotunnel group has always been a leading economic actor and local
      employer. as part of its mission, it fully subscribes to a logic of ‘‘community involvement’’, understood as defined by iso 26000:
      ‘‘proactive outreach work undertaken by an organisation within the community with the aim of preventing and solving problems,
      fostering partnerships with local organisations and stakeholders and being a good citizen of the community’’.

      eurotunnel group has contributed to the creation of several thousand direct, indirect and induced jobs in kent and the calais region and
      has, as part of its role as a developer, strongly contributed to the growth of the local economy at either end of the tunnel and to the
      positive transformation of the environment in which it operates.

      eurotunnel group is conscious of the fact that community involvement is not limited to responsibility for the impact of its activities on the
      environment but involves responsible behaviour and good citizenship. it is also constantly seeking ways to strengthen its integration into
      its immediate environment by means of firm commitments and actions of solidarity geared towards the community. the group also
      supports education and culture and is conscious that sharing knowledge is a factor which promotes more equal opportunities.

      eurotunnel group estimates that its regional commitment is essential as it contributes to the company’s overall performance, to the
      internal climate and social cohesion and to the loyalty of its employees.

      in order to meet these challenges, eurotunnel group is committed to strengthening links with local communities by actively supporting
      associations, schools, universities and organisations with which it closely collaborates on both sides of the fixed link.


      environmental challenges
      in a world with limited natural resources, companies cannot ensure their continuity without making constant efforts to control their
      energy consumption and reduce the impact of their activities on the environment. for eurotunnel group it is clear: it is impossible to have
      success in the long term without better control of environmental impacts.

      committed to ‘‘low-carbon’’ transportation, the group is pursuing an ambitious strategy which combines developing its core activity –
      cross-channel transport – and external growth beyond the fixed link in its two major disciplines and areas of expertise: the
      management of infrastructures and railway operations.

      prior to the construction of the tunnel, expense was incurred in order to prevent the harmful consequences of business activities for the
      environment. there are two separate sewer systems for storm water and waste water, retention ponds, treatment stations, etc.
      furthermore, an environmental management system based on the requirements of standard iso 14001 was put in place by the
      concessionaires in 2002.

                                                                                                                                               iv

for 2015, eurotunnel group is committed to acting in line with the principles of sustainable development and in accordance with the
3 principles of the global compact relating to the environment. in order to achieve this, the group has four commitments:
• to reduce the environmental impacts of its own operations by focusing on reducing greenhouse gases, reducing its energy
   consumption, increasing its fleet of electric vehicles and optimising waste management;
• to raise awareness amongst staff of their responsibilities as eco-citizens;
• to choose innovative and environmentally friendly products;
• to strengthen actions which support the protection of diversity.

in addition to these commitments, eurotunnel group will pay special attention to the environmental approach of its suppliers and will ask
them to implement actions which would support the protection of the environment.


economic challenges
eurotunnel group places a focus on each individual customer at the heart of its development plan. quality of service is both an everyday
and a strategic priority and expectation for its teams within all of its subsidiaries.

rooted in a bi-national culture where the concept of ‘‘customer’’ prevails, eurotunnel group is continually investing in adapting its offer,
the quality of customer services, punctuality, smoothness, comfort and security around a central objective: to constantly increase the
high level of quality of service which forms the basis of its economic growth. a golden rule is applied: every innovation and every
investment project must demonstrate that it benefits customers before being adopted. this continuous improvement initiative is of
particular importance today when, more than 20 years after the commencement of the operation, a new generation of customers
is emerging.

this commitment was solidified in 2013 by the launch of important projects in the various group subsidiaries, such as the creation of a
customer experience department, the renovation of terminals and truck shuttle wagons, a mobile telephone service throughout the
tunnel, etc.

the first private railway operator in france and the uk, europorte, a subsidiary of eurotunnel group, makes the difference with quality
of service.

committed to a continuous improvement initiative, eurotunnel group is carrying out a transformation project in its terminals where the
reception capacity will be increased in order to offer, as of 2015, more departures and toll lanes and secure parking to respond smoothly
to the expected growth in freight traffic.

eurotunnel group and its subsidiary service companies aim to achieve a higher level of quality of service for 2015. customer satisfaction
is an absolute priority for the group. for 2015 it has set a central goal for the sector of a customer satisfaction rate of 90% for
passengers, 95% for transporters and 85% for commercial freight drivers.

in order to meet the challenges of responsible supply, the group is further committed to undertaking work over the course of the next
two years (2015-2016) in order to identify and evaluate its main suppliers in the field of sustainable development.


ethical challenges
in order to define its priorities, eurotunnel group is involved in and is continuing an ongoing dialogue with its internal and external
stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, local communities, competitors, public authorities and trade
unions. this dialogue helps the group to better understand societal developments and the associated challenges, to develop new
topics and to start reflecting on the pilot projects.

eurotunnel group’s aim is to be viewed as a benchmark and a model within the transport industry in the area of corporate social
responsibility and intends to maintain its role as a major player in cross-channel transport and its position as global leader in piggyback
transport.

this ambition requires clearly stated commitments. eurotunnel group has achieved this by means of this policy by committing to
develop a climate of trust and loyal relationships with all of its internal and external stakeholders. it is particularly committed to:
• staying loyal to its customers and partners;
• instigating, maintaining and encouraging an open dialogue with the various stakeholders;
• strengthening its community involvement;
• strictly observing the fundamental rights as defined in the major international principles: the universal declaration of human rights
   and the international labour organization’s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work;
• reporting its economic, social and environmental results with the greatest transparency.
