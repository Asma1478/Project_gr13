beyond the blueprint g r o w i n g s u s ta i n a b ly
fluor is more than a business. we have a relationship with the world. we work with stakeholders who
want what we want: a healthy place to live and work. an opportunity to thrive.

uncertainty isn’t new. constraints have always been a part of our industry’s reality. so we continue
to go beyond the blueprint to optimize what’s possible. together, we and our stakeholders will grow
sustainably into the future. our eyes are open. our responsibility is clear.




about the cover
completed in 2013 by the american bridge/fluor joint venture, the east span of the san francisco-oakland bay bridge
is the largest and longest single-tower, self-anchored suspension (sas) bridge in the world. it’s shown on this report’s
cover next to the old east span. this complex project required new levels of innovation, exacting precision in work
performance and construction quality, and extensive coordination among governments, communities and the private
sector. we are proud to have delivered an iconic bridge that is built to withstand major seismic events and serves as an
emergency lifeline route for disaster responses. we believe the new east span represents a bridge to what’s possible
when we work together to realize the promise of a sustainable future.


we are grateful to markus spiering for allowing fluor use of his photo for our sustainability report.
