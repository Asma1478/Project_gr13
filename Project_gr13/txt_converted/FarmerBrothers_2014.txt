how can we keep farming
families from going hungry?
imagine getting paid once a year for your job—at a price that’s always
changing as a result of market forces. would you be able to make the
money last? invest in your business? feed your family? many small growers
across central america—especially women, who do a large portion of the
harvesting work on coffee farms—struggle to stretch their income and food
stores until the next coffee harvest, particularly when coffee prices are low.
to survive, some leave their families to work bigger farms. others work just
for food so they can keep their families fed. and almost all of them, along
with their children, know what it feels like to go to bed without dinner.

 how can coffee adapt
 to a changing climate?
 from the smooth, chocolaty taste of central american coffee to the fruity,
 wild flavors that come from east africa, the coffee we drink is as nuanced as
 the regions from which it originates. but what if all that changed? a rapidly
 warming planet, extreme weather patterns, and stronger strains of diseases
 like coffee leaf rust threaten the variety and quality of coffee worldwide,
 the livelihood of growers, and the viability of coffee supply chains.
