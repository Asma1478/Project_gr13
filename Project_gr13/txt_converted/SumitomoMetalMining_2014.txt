 q4        what do you wish to instill to employees
           as the essence of csr?


a       i think the essence of csr comes down to the actions
        that employees ordinarily choose to take as individual
        human beings and individual members of the smm
        group. that simultaneously requires the development of
a vision for businesses and a corporate culture that are
characteristic of sumitomo metal mining. it is important that
employees have contact with society and readily engage in
communication with people around them, and by doing so
come to understand and sympathize with others, and to share
and resonate with others, while constantly thinking about how
they should act.

        had passed masatomo’s letter to the sumitomo family, who in

        sumitomo and the business it owned were split into separate
        entities in the meiji era (1868 – 1912), the sumitomo family
        code was split into the kaken, or family charter, to be observed
        by the house of sumitomo, including the head of the family;
        and the kaho, or family code, which business operators and
        employees had to observe. the ﬁrst and second articles of the
        latter (the family code) exist today as the “business principles,”

   besides overcoming these technical issues, a number of                    strengths as a combination of all three.
smm’s unique advantages contributed to the success of
mass production.
   the ﬁrst was the persistence of smm’s development
engineers, including abe, in insisting upon considerations for
future mass production. this was based upon the
understanding that a product will only be able to make a
contribution to the company, to customers and to society
once it can be mass produced, an important point that abe,                                             by mass producing materials the market
too, stressed to his employees.                                                                        needs at low cost, i hope we create
   the second advantage was that smm smelted and reﬁned                                                more employment and thereby make a

   the third advantage was that smm was already in                                                     head of the nca project dept., materials div.

basic approach

smm group business centers on the utilization of the earth’s valuable, yet limited, resources. effective use of resources
is therefore considered an important issue for management as we seek sustainable business development. based on this
understanding, the smm group has included “effective use of resources” as one of its six key csr areas and is
advancing recycling efforts. as the vision for 2020 depicts “a company that generates resources using innovative
technology,” we are developing technologies that will assist with the effective utilization of minerals which have not
previously been converted into resources, such as low-grade and complex ores. we are also endeavoring to recover
precious and other valuable metals from items such as used home appliances and electronic devices, and develop and
refine recovery technologies.

progress in fy2013
in fy2013, the development of copper resources at sierra gorda, chile, and nickel production in taganito, in
the philippines, were projects of high significance. the key here is the development of technology for
recovering as many valuable metals as possible from low-grade ores and putting them to effective use. for
example, besides establishing technology for economically recovering the mere 1% nickel content from nickel
ores, we have started operation of a pilot plant in the philippines where we carry out verification testing of
technology with the aim of recovering as much of the 40% iron and 1-2% chromium content in residues.
employing our own original technologies to make effective use of resources is the very heart of our business,
and we believe that we can both contribute to society and enhance our corporate value by pursuing this in a
sincere manner.
response to stakeholder comments
making effective use of resources along the entire supply chain is another issue we must consider. nickel
extracted from ores is used to make lithium nickel oxide, a cathode material for secondary batteries used in
automobiles. we have developed technology and worked with customers to establish a system for recycling,
allowing us to retrieve materials from batteries that have reached the end of their lives and turn them into new       harumasa kurokawa

        smm uses a hydrometallurgical technique called hpal1 to recover nickel and cobalt from low-grade nickel oxide
        ores. smm was the ﬁrst company in the world to commercialize the hpal technique, making it possible to turn
        previously unused piles of low-grade nickel oxide ore into resources. at present, smm is conducting operations
        using the hpal technique at two facilities: coral bay nickel corporation (cbnc)2 on palawan island in the
        philippines, and taganito hpal nickel corporation (thpal)3 on mindanao island in the philippines.

                                            what is your evaluation of the smm group’s activities during fy2013?
                                            topics have been set in accordance with the group’s business characteristics, and on the whole, a high level of
                                            activity has been conducted. in addition to a high degree of environmental management, smm’s characteristics have
                                            been expressed well, for instance, in aspects where your main business has direct bearings on environmental
                                            preservation, as observed in the sale of materials for products with low environmental impact. although it was
                                            unfortunate that your unit energy consumption worsened during fy2013, what stood out for me was smm’s
                                            approach of actively working to reduce co2 emissions even as your business expands. you also raise the challenge
                                            of considering the effects of reductions in co2 emissions from many aspects, not just in terms of investment
                                            profitability. i look forward to seeing the progress in your characteristic approach of generating considerable
                                            environmental benefit through your products.
                                            in your view, what does society require in regard to environmental preservation?
                                            you have covered the major issues concerning environmental preservation as viewed on a company and group
                                            basis. besides the initiatives in your respective mineral resources, smelting and refining, and materials businesses, i
         keisuke takegahara                 think there will be a growing call for you to demonstrate the outcomes smm provides to society from a more
                       general manager,     comprehensive perspective of the whole material cycle. i would like to see you present to society a broader form of
     environmental initiative & corporate
     social responsibility-support dept.,   your vision for 2020 that also includes upstream and downstream effects.

basic approach

many potentially harmful substances are handled by smm group businesses during mineral resource processing and
manufacturing. even a small accident carries the risk of seriously affecting local people and the environment. in order to
ensure that this risk never materializes, smm group emphasizes the need to prevent contamination by supplying
equipment and management systems, and by providing training for relevant staff members.
   every year, drills are held in order to learn how to minimize the effects and prevent external impacts in the unlikely event
an incident did occur. we have also worked to improve facilities, and we are installing a system that automatically shuts off
the discharge if any abnormalities are detected just before the wastewater port. we will continue to control environmental
risks properly and to strengthen our activities toward risk reduction.

                                                 subcommittee chairman’s comment
progress in fy2013
measures dealing with the issue of global warming, such as those promoting the conservation of energy, are an
important social responsibility that companies ought to fulfill. nevertheless, there are getting fewer and fewer
highly effective energy-saving measures in which investment decisions can be made based primarily on
business profitability, and in fy2013 alone, our unit energy consumption ended up worsening in part due to the
effects of a scheduled suspension of operations. going forward, i believe we should promote investment
decisions that consider a variety of merits on a comprehensive, company-wide basis. as for products that
contribute to energy savings, our products, including wiring materials used in led lighting and other applications,
have been recognized for their high efficiency, and have become more widespread during fy2013. also, our
positive electrode material for secondary batteries is being used in new electric vehicles, and sales are growing.
response to stakeholder comments
while i agree that environmental impact assessments of the entire material cycle are important, since we are an
upstream business, it is quite difficult to conduct such assessments. as for our scope for reducing co2
emissions further, we are studying the possibility of conducting assessments using a simplified method based          takashi sugiura
on coefficients for each product application. we are also considering utilizing renewable energy in collaboration     chairman, environmental preservation subcommittee;

  in the smelting and reﬁning business, our energy requirements          2,000

will inevitably rise due to the degradation of ores, the raw material,
and the promotion of the use of recycled materials. striking a
balance between lessening environmental impact and securing

for announcing the industry target of “a 15% reduction in unit co2         500

emissions by fy2020 in comparison to fy1990.” smm has already
achieved this target in the japanese smelting and reﬁning

   in fy2013, 97 kilotons of waste underwent ﬁnal disposal, a
 decline of about 1.4 kilotons from fy2012. iron clinker3 from
 shisaka smelting and zinc slag from the harima smelter
 accounted for the majority of this. one major factor in the decline
 was a decrease in the volume of debris generated in the
 dismantling of facilities following completion of the switch to oxide
 ore-only processing at the harima smelter (see fig. 7).

                                       overseas facilities now account for around 40% of the workforce and sales. therefore, in regard to social and
                                       community contribution, too, it is essential that regional factors are taken into account and that you manage to
                                       communicate your overall approach to themes both within and outside the company. on that note, your current
                                       theme of developing the next generation is a good one. please use this as a central theme and try to find a
                                       unique format that works for the smm group. as for support for reconstruction in the wake of a disaster, activities
                                       during times of normality come into play. developing systems allowing employee participation are important, but
                                       for these to be effective, you need mechanisms and devices to encourage participation. it is this effort and
                                       ingenuity which determines a plan’s success or otherwise.
                                       in your view, what does society require in regard to contribution to society and local communities?
                                       considering the nature of the smm group’s core businesses—mineral resources, smelting and refining, and
                                       materials—and the six key csr areas, i think the material issues come down to protecting the natural
                                       environment, correcting rich-poor disparity, respecting cultures unique to specific regions, and training human
                                       resources to achieve these, all based on the idea of “think globally, act locally.” a diverse workforce and two-way

basic approach

the smm group has long been contributing to local communities while advancing its business, not only by securing
housing for employees and their families, but also by supporting infrastructure that benefits the entire region in such a wide
range of areas as medical care, education and culture. we have also shown concern for regional environments. smm
group continues to incorporate consideration toward local communities into activities today in line with the smm group
corporate philosophy and management vision, and the csr policy. due deliberation is made during meetings of various
kinds to ensure that decisions made within various projects do not act counter to smm group policy or philosophy.

                                                 subcommittee chairman’s comment
progress in fy2013
smm does business in many different regions both inside and outside japan and we believe we have to
carry out ongoing contribution activities rooted in local areas. we spent the equivalent of 1% of recurring
profit on social contribution activities inside and outside japan again in fy2013, and we intend to maintain
that level while seeking close communication with stakeholders and persisting with activities that match
local needs.
response to stakeholder comments
developing human resources who are going to sustain the next generation is a major theme of smm’s
social contribution and, in particular, it is one aspect of our active efforts to provide support for education
and resolve poverty-related issues in developing nations where we operate. providing assistance to
communities affected by major natural disasters is our other company-wide theme, and through these two
themes we will practice “think globally, act locally.” as systems for encouraging employee participation in
social contribution activities, we already have a csr awards system for honoring outstanding activities
and a volunteer leave program, but we are also looking into introducing a long-term leave program as a
way to further promote volunteering in social contribution activities and international cooperation. by              koji imai

                                  when purchasing goods, i make it a point to select from fairtrade* products. this is because i think that, if a
                                  system can be established whereby producers can generate profits producing goods in their own countries,
                                  then they can become self-reliant and can get better living conditions.

                                         foster awareness and a different mentality among employees in order to cultivate everyday human rights sensitivities
                                         that go beyond business settings. there are also some areas where the attainment level and progress of measures
                                         is somewhat hard to comprehend.
                                           establishing key performance indicators (kpi) with specific targets during the planning stage allows more objective
                                         evaluation of attainment and progress, so i hope you will give this some thought.
                                         in your view, what does society require in regard to respect for people and human rights?
                                         in mineral resources and mining businesses, the biggest impacts on the environment and society occur within the
                                         supply chain. for the nickel refining project in the philippines, smm provided assistance for the relocation of local
                                         residents after first having gained their consent and understanding. in situations where human rights risks are
                                         extremely high, it is important that you develop systems and create opportunities for dialog that allow you to listen to
                                         the concerns and complaints of people in the community, and also that you devise preventive measures and
                                         response measures, such as implementing comprehensive human rights training when hiring security personnel,

progress in fy2013
aiming to become a company worthy of being called “world leader in the non-ferrous metals industry” and an
“excellent company of japan,” we made steady progress again in fy2013 on basic initiatives in the form of
human rights training at smm group companies in japan and overseas to firmly instill knowledge about the
smm group human rights policy, as well as promotion of diversity at smm, for example through hiring of
female management track employees and foreign exchange students, and creation of posts that can be filled by
disabled employees. we also stepped up our support for the careers of women through ongoing enhancements
to the various programs and implementation of training. as a result, we were selected for the second
consecutive year as a nadeshiko brand for encouraging female employees to play active roles in the workplace.
  furthermore, in fy2013 we devised and conducted test runs of a human rights due diligence system for within the
smm group. in fy2014, we will begin full-scale implementation of the system, conducting ongoing studies to
determine the level of human rights awareness and to identify any related issues in the contexts of the smm group
human rights policy and international standards, such as iso 26000. appropriate action will be taken as required.
additionally in fy2014, we are looking into extending this system to encompass the entire supply chain and plan to
implement due diligence studies, prioritizing suppliers according to their higher importance.

international employee development
the globalization of business has created a need for human
resources who can actively pursue smm’s business strategy at
overseas facilities and within markets for each of our main
businesses.
  acknowledging that the development of such human resources
needs to start as early as possible, smm implements a short-term
overseas training program whereby all new management track
employees are seconded overseas for a two-month period. more
than just an opportunity to polish up language skills, the program
is designed to bring about general improvements to the
employees’ ability to accommodate other cultures and their ability
to act under their own initiative in an overseas setting.
  training in business skills, which are perhaps one common                               ledda (3rd from left in front row) with members of the personnel dept.
language within a global business, is also readily incorporated into
the different types of management training and training for
employees promoted to new positions. international employee
development is thus approached from a number of angles, not
simply from the language aspect.

        human rights education and due diligence
       the smm group is striving to establish workplaces free of
       human rights infringements and to cultivate employees with
       strong human rights awareness. in 2013, with an aim of
       raising awareness and ensuring compliance with the smm
       group policy on human rights, an instructor's manual was
       compiled in japanese, english, chinese and spanish
       under the supervision of an outside expert on human rights,
       and education was delivered targeting all group
       employees. furthermore, in order to build a framework for
       managing human rights based on various international
       standards, we examined speciﬁc details for human rights
       due diligence (survey) among employees, and as part of
       this process, the smm group went out on location and                                                                    ▲ plant engineering outcomes forum

doing good
                            when overseas trainees have just arrived in japan and are in the same workplace as me, i make it a point to
                            actively communicate with them, not just about work, but also about the good things i have noticed about japan
                            since coming here and the good things about smm that i have personally experienced since joining. i do this to
                            make use of my experiences as a non-japanese employee, and so they can adapt quickly to life in japan and

                                                   what is your evaluation of the smm group’s activities during cy2013?
                                                   i have visited the sites of many corporations and accident numbers currently remain level right across the country. i
                                                   sense stagnation of activities and a poor ability to pass down knowledge. in my view, there needs to be a break away
                                                   from human-dependent “zero accident activity,” and the key to that lies in the very basis of that activity—identifying
                                                   and reducing hazards. a common problem i find is that a lot of activity is superficial rather than focused on pinning
                                                   down the true causes. in the case of smm, while the number of accidents is on a declining trend, i have felt during
                                                   my observations and guidance at business locations since 2010 that similar problems keep arising. although the
                                                   issues do vary from location to location, there is a strong desire to deal with them through a united effort of everyone
                                                   from top down to the people at the front line of operations.

                                                   in your view, what does society require in regard to occupational health and safety?
                                                   as smm continues to develop as a global corporation, occupational health and safety initiatives are going to be a

                                                 subcommittee chairman’s comment
progress in cy2013
areas we focused on in the occupational health & safety subcommittee in cy2013 were the smm anzen
dojyo seminar for developing leaders who will take charge of health and safety management at sites, and risk
assessment education to assist the assessment of and action against risk factors by top executives at each
facility. employees attending the anzen dojyo are asked to plan and administrate safety activities matching
the actual circumstances at their own site. top executives at workplaces also have stronger awareness now.
risk assessments, too, are continually improved through ongoing dialogue with ordinary workers, for example
about ways to deal with remaining risks, thereby reducing the number of risk factors. this is to ensure that
risks are not simply addressed through initiatives forced on workplaces from above. in 2013, while there were
fewer lost-time accidents, the total number of accidents increased. through activities suited to individual sites,
i would like to work on preventing accidents before they occur.

response to stakeholder comments
in cy2013, we started to review the safety of machines and equipment through joint efforts with the
engineering division. we are working to unify rules and standards that will allow us to maintain safety of
equipment at each facility, including electrical wiring and piping, right from the design stage. we will seek                           takashi sugiura

        in conducting activities at the pogo mine, safety is regarded as
        paramount importance for everyone. needless to say, in order
        to carry out operations safely, each individual worker must use
        protective equipment properly, but they must also understand
        how important their actions are for both themselves and their
        families. with this in mind, we conduct monthly safety
        campaigns for the purpose of repeatedly raising awareness in
        the workplace for potential risks. during these campaigns,                                         chris kennedy

        recurrent injuries, and communicates the results of these
        discussions to all employees. through these activities, the risk
        awareness of employees was clearly heightened.
          in addition, by participating in various other meetings and
        engaging in direct dialog with employees, and by undertaking
        on site checks as part of their inspections, management and
        the health, safety and loss control manager are also actively
        involved in the early detection, discussion and measures for
        any rule violations. through these activities, we are working to

     my way of
     doing good
                               three years ago, i began climbing the 100 steps from the train platform for the yokosuka line on basement level
                               4 to the ticket gate on the ground level at the jr shimbashi station, which is the station closest to work.
                               although my original intent was to promote my own health, since i do not use the escalator, i feel like i am also
                               doing my bit (albeit small) for the conservation of energy and the alleviation of congestion. nowadays, i routinely
                               use stairs, even on my days off.

                                         the mineral resources business and smelting and refining business are businesses with a potentially large impact on
                                         local communities and the environment, and that is why it is extremely important to appropriately engage in
                                         communication with local people to gain the understanding and backing of the community. on this point, it is highly
                                         admirable that individual operating locations are building relationships of trust according to the local circumstances,
                                         as demonstrated by taganito hpal nickel corporation (thpal) and coral bay nickel corporation (cbnc). holding

                                         admired as an indication of smm’s openness toward the outside. in regard to dialogue with individual stakeholders, i
                                         believe smm is already achieving a high standard.
                                         in your view, what does society require in regard to stakeholder communication?
                                         first, i think it is important for head office to have an accurate grasp of communication activities implemented at
                                         each facility and to strike a balance between adapting to local circumstances and achieving company-wide
                                         consistency. smm does not simply react passively to demands made by the local community, but takes the initiative
                                         in its community contributions, even looking beyond the closure of a mine, for example, in its development of industry
                                         and education of human resources. it naturally follows that properly communicating this will increase society’s trust.

basic approach

prior to the launch of csr activities at smm in 2008, deliberations were held relating to the smm group corporate
philosophy, group management vision, csr policy and vision for 2020, and the following entities with an interest in
smm’s activities were identified as stakeholders: customers, shareholders, employees, local communities, creditors,
business partners, citizen groups, and the government. smm aims to maximize its corporate value and has established
targets that specify the “ideal company” for each stakeholder category.

                                                 subcommittee chairman’s comment
progress in fy2013
in fy2013, we primarily worked to strengthen communication with three stakeholder categories—employees,
shareholders and investors, and citizen groups. we endeavored to build relationships with each stakeholder
category, for example through employee awareness surveys, plant tours and strategy briefings for
shareholders and investors, and the hosting of in-house lectures with the cooperation of ngos. these kinds
of initiatives have even been recognized by outside parties, as illustrated by our winning a best ir award
(hosted by the japan investor relations association).
response to stakeholder comments
we have a system in place whereby case examples of initiatives for communicating with the community are
regularly compiled through written surveys and shared with all facilities, for example via the in-house bulletin.
while difficulties do arise due to the varying cultures, traditions and other background aspects from region to
region, i hope we can deploy best practices across the organization, where applicable, and strengthen
dialogue.
  to earn greater trust from society, it is also extremely important that we undertake appropriate disclosure of
non-financial information. there is extensive demand among shareholders and investors in europe and other
overseas locations for integrated reporting, which involves reporting on current business activities and future                  takashi ito

 issues and targets
as mentioned above, the human rights & human
resources development subcommittee within the csr
committee started deliberating on implementation of
company-wide activities in line with the smm group policy
on human rights in october 2013, and a working group
was set up comprising business divisions, which are
responsible for procuring raw materials, and the
purchasing department. advice is also sought from a
third-party organization as a way to incorporate an
objective outlook.
  through these efforts, we aim to build up a framework

    nervously. it has therefore become an occasion for
    meaningful opinion exchange. the feedback from

      by having the president listen to the concerns and
    comments of employees at each site ﬁrst-hand and
    having him directly convey
    his own thoughts to
    employees, we want to help
    energize the company

    sound relationships of trust
    between employees and
    the group’s top executive.

the company’s responsibility
the company is responsible for the preparation of the indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the “company’s reporting criteria”), as
described in the report, which are derived, among others, from the sustainability reporting guidelines version 3.0 of the gri and environmental reporting
guidelines of japan’s ministry of the environment; self-declaring a gri application level in conformance with the application level criteria stipulated by the
gri; reporting on the alignment of the company’s policies to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm
position statements; reporting on the company's identiﬁcation and prioritization of material issues; reporting on the company's approach and management of
its material issues; and reporting on the completeness of material sustainability information in the report.
our responsibility
our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the indicators based on the procedures we have performed. we conducted our
engagement in accordance with ‘international standard on assurance engagements (isae) 3000, assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of
historical financial information’, ‘isae 3410, assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements’, issued by the international auditing and assurance
standards board, and the ‘practical guidelines for the assurance of sustainability information’ of j-sus. the limited assurance engagement consisted of
making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the report, and applying analytical and other procedures,
and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. the level of assurance provided is
thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. our assurance procedures included:
• interviewing with the company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for the preparation of the report and reviewing the
  company’s reporting criteria.
• inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the indicators.
• performing analytical reviews of the indicators.
• examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the indicators in conformity with the company’s reporting
  criteria, and also recalculating the indicators.
• visiting to the company’s harima smelter selected on the basis of a risk analysis.
• evaluating the overall statement in which the indicators are expressed.
• evaluating the company’s self-declared gri application level against the application level criteria.
• assessing the alignment of the company’s policies to the icmm’s 10 sd principles and the applicable mandatory requirements set out in icmm position
  statements through documentation reviews and interviews.
• interviewing with the company's responsible personnel and reviewing documents with respect to the company’s process of identifying and prioritizing its
  material issues and its approach to and management of its material issues.
• assessment of whether or not all the material sustainability information deﬁned by j-sus is included in the report.
conclusion
