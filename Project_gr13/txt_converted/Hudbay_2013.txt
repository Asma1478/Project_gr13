in my role as aboriginal liaison officer, i’m focused on helping hudbay build relationships
with first nations communities near our manitoba projects and operations. in manitoba, they
are mathias colomb cree nation, opaskwayak cree nation and pimicikamak cree nation,
and we are continuing to work with other manitoba first nations. in saskatchewan, the
communities we have relationships with are the peter ballantyne cree nation, namely pelican
narrows, sandy bay and deschambault lake. we want to foster dialogue based on trust and
respect, and work together with first nations communities to achieve mutual goals.

recognizing that we needed to go back, before we could go forward, one of my first projects
after joining hudbay was to organize aboriginal cultural awareness workshops for company
leaders. since then, i’ve also worked with first nations groups to overcome some of their
misconceptions about mining. this has included inviting them to our site for mine tours and
developing an educational toolkit that explains the mining process and how we work. in the
coming year, i’ll be visiting first nations high schools to talk about mining as a career option.
the sector represents canada’s largest private employer of aboriginal canadians.

the company and neighbouring first nations communities have much to learn from each
other, and the willingness to talk and listen is a great start.

i joined hudbay in 2011 to lead one of the teams that manage relations with the
communities in constancia’s direct and indirect areas of influence. i’m proud to say that
we’ve come a long way in a very short period of time.

over the course of seven months and 28 roundtable meetings, we negotiated more than
1,000 hectares of surface rights agreements with the communities of chilloroya and
uchucarco. without these agreements, the project could not have proceeded. not only do
the agreements give hudbay rights to community-owned land for the life of mine, they also
represent a significant investment in the development of both of these communities, and
that’s good for everyone involved.

we’re now in the process of negotiating inter-institutional agreements with communities
in our indirect area of influence. these arrangements would commit us to working together
on social development projects. all in all, it’s challenging but exceptionally satisfying work.

safety has long been a priority for me, particularly since a family member was seriously
injured in a workplace accident, at another company in south africa. i’ve worked for hudbay
for almost five years, and am currently the maintenance supervisor at the flin flon mill.

i was a safety representative when my department sent me to the pass masters course.
pass, which stands for positive attitude safety system, is based on having regular
facilitated discussions to increase each person’s involvement in recognizing and managing
workplace risks. from the course, i came to realize that if we combined pass with all of the
other safety processes we have in place at hudbay, we could have an exceptionally safe
and productive work environment.

for me, the key to success is knowing pass and the company’s systems from a to z, and
being a good and consistent role model of safe behaviour.

i joined hudbay in early 2012 after having spent more than 30 years training and
counselling vulnerable people in colombia – mainly elders, children, households led by
women, and people who have been displaced by violence. my role at hudbay is to begin to
build relationships with communities in the areas where the company is doing grassroots
exploration. we want to establish a climate of trust and co-operation and maintain direct
contact with local families.

my work involves informal discussions with residents, formal meetings, visits to homes,
participatory workshops and community lunches. sometimes the focus is on introducing
people to hudbay and the type of work we are planning. at other times, i conduct
workshops on healthy family living, conflict resolution, communication and other life skills,
to foster dialogue and help people live together peacefully. i also identify informal leaders
in the community and gather socioeconomic data to help us better understand the people
around our operations and how we can best help them improve their quality of life.

we’re laying the groundwork for constructive relationships, and the community feedback
to date has been highly favourable.

community relations in peru

the new mining model set forth by the government of peru
calls for high standards of social inclusion in mining projects.
to ensure that we meet expectations and address the needs
of our various constituents, we are implementing targeted
strategies for key stakeholder groups.

direct area of influence
the two communities within our direct area of influence
are uchucarco and chilloroya, both of whom signed life of
mine land use agreements with us in 2012 in exchange for
portions of their community-owned land. the agreements
set out hudbay’s commitments to local employment and
use of local suppliers and to investments in health,
education, production and social development projects,
among other things. development committees comprising
hudbay and community representatives approve and
oversee the projects being carried out within the context
of the agreements.

seven communities in our indirect area of influence. we

it’s my job to ensure that the constancia project meets its commitments with regard to
environmental protection and complies with all applicable standards and regulations.

one of our key areas of focus is water management. large volumes of water are needed
for mining operations. at the same time, fresh water is absolutely essential to the health
and sustainability of the nearby communities and ecosystem. it’s our responsibility to
ensure that we do everything we can to manage this valuable resource wisely. we have a
first-rate team in place and i really enjoy working with them to create an environmentally
responsible mine.

reduce, reuse, recycle and responsibly dispose of the waste
they generate.                                                              flin flon air emissions

closure and reclamation

all mines have finite lives, and all hudbay mines and
development projects have closure plans and supporting
financial provisions. once mining is finished, we aim to
leave behind land that will support productive uses for
future generations. although we have successfully closed
and remediated 19 mines in the course of our history, we
learn something new with each project. we also continue
to monitor many of our previously closed sites, although we
cannot take action without the approval of current owners
and regulators.

in june 2012, the trout lake mine ceased operation after
more than 30 years. shortly afterwards, the mine closure
process began with the cleanup and safe disposal of
chemicals and fuel oils. over the next two years, we will
remove surface structures, seal mine openings, stabilize
underground workings, treat waste water, and then slope,
contour, cap or cover and vegetate the site, in accordance
with the approved mine closure plan. once closure and
reclamation are completed and the government approves the
work, we will continue water treatment and environmental
monitoring activities at the closed property.

this performance data section contains         data is measured or estimated, and operations are asked to
year-over-year performance data, primarily     explain significant deviations in year-over-year trends. the
                                               performance data is reported at a mix of operational and
in the form of tables.

                                               we provide safety and environmental incident definitions
                                               so that all operations report incidents consistently. we
                                               calculate greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions using published
                                               factors for emissions.

                                               most of the performance data for water and energy is

                                               electricity-related ghg numbers. we do generate electricity
                                               at some of our project sites (such as constancia and reed)

                                               numbers are calculated based on conversion factors.

                                               data for the indicators is collected and compiled using

1	totals for 2009, 2010 and 2011 include all sites reported in that year. details may not be shown for sites disposed of prior to 2012.
2 	in fiscal 2011, hudbay adopted the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) with a transition date of january 1, 2010. the data shown in this
    report for 2010 and subsequent years is therefore in conformity with ifrs. the year 2009 is in conformity with canadian gaap and has not been restated
    under ifrs. accordingly, 2009 data may not be comparable with the information for fiscal 2010 and subsequent years.
3	revenues and operating costs differ from those in our financial statements due to gri definitions. for example: revenues include gross financial income
    as well as product sales; operating costs exclude depreciation and impairment, include exploration costs net of tax credits. profit before tax is as
    presented in hudbay financial statements.
4	profit-based taxes are reported on an annual cash taxes paid basis starting in 2012, which conforms with the amounts reported in hudbay’s financial
    statements. consumption-based taxes are reported on the net payments to governments considering both tax credits generated from consumption taxes
    paid along with consumption tax collected on sales. no consumption taxes are reported if no payments are expected on a net basis, and no payments are
    disclosed if the amounts paid are recoverable in the future.
5 taxes were not detailed by country for 2009, 2010 and 2011.
6 for 2009, 2010 and 2011, municipal taxes and penalties and interest paid are included in the total line for “taxes paid”.
7	these figures do not include land use payments to government.
8 for 2009 and 2010, charitable donations are included in the community investments lines above. donations were not detailed by country in 2011.

1	totals for 2009, 2010 and 2011 include all sites reported in that year. details may not be shown for sites disposed of prior to 2012.
2	safety statistics do not include chile and colombia. they will be included in reporting for 2013.
3	the increase in reportable occurrences in 2012 was influenced by changes in our reporting criteria (which are partly based on definitions in manitoba law
   which changed in 2012), and by the increase in activity at our constancia project.
4	data identifying aboriginal and visible minorities is collected only in canada and the united states. percentage composition is calculated based on
   worldwide workforce.
5	all fines are related to us federal mine safety and health administration (msha) inspections at our st. lawrence zinc (slz) operation in balmat, new york.
   under msha any deficiency is subject to a set financial penalty (whereas in other jurisdictions there would be a corrective action order). the totals shown
   reflect all deficiencies in each year, with specific penalties ranging from $60 to $6,000 per deficiency.
6	in 2012 the number of operating site closure plans is shown separately from the number of development site closure plans. these numbers were combined
   in years 2009 to 2011. from the total of 11 sites with closure plans in 2011, three sites were sold and two sites were added for a net reduction of one
   closure plan.

1	totals for 2009, 2010 and 2011 include all sites reported in that year. details may not be shown for sites disposed of prior to 2012.
2	hudbay’s manitoba operations produce copper and zinc concentrate from ore mined by hudbay. the copper concentrate is sold as concentrate and the zinc
   concentrate is further processed at our flin flon hydrometallurgical zinc plant, along with additional purchased concentrate, to produce high-grade zinc
   metal. because of these multiple input and output streams, we have used metal in concentrate based on our mine production as the measure of production
   volume for the purpose of calculating energy intensity.
3	water withdrawals does not include some mine dewatering. water discharge includes surface runoff that accumulates in containments. water discharged
   from the tom valley exploration property is not reported – the value is being reviewed.
4	the sale of our ontario-based zochem operation in 2011 left most of our electricity consumption in manitoba. with nearly all manitoba’s electricity
   generation hydro based, the emission factor for our electricity consumption is now very low.
5	increase reflects gradual leakage due to routine equipment wear found and corrected at the oxygen plant chiller. more frequent monitoring has
   been implemented.
6 nox emissions are not tracked as the government of canada does not consider the mining sector to be significant emitters of nox.
7 significant spills are those that are reportable to government agencies, whether by law or in accordance with company policy.
8	the increase in hazardous waste disposal from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to disposal of materials related to decommissioning obsolete portions of the
   plant in flin flon.
