                         the company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. an asset is
                         treated as current when it is:
                         - expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;
                         - held primarily for the purpose of trading;
                         - expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period; or
                         - cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months
                             after the reporting period.
                         all other assets are classified as non-current.
                         a liability is current when:

                         - it is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
                         - it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or
                         there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.
                           the company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
                           deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.
                           the operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash
                           equivalents. the company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
                     (b) fair value measurement
                         fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
                         market participants at the measurement date. the fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction

                                                                                                                                                       63




wabco india limited 18.08.2017.p65   63                                                               21/08/2017, 7:21 am

                                                                   wabco india limited

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
                           -   in the principal market for the asset or liability; or
                           -   in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.
                           -   the principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the company. the fair value of an asset or a liability
                               is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that
                               market participants act in their economic best interest.
                           a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic
                           benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use of selling it to another market participant that would use the asset
                           in its highest and best use.
                           the company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate under the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available
                           to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
                           all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the
                           fair value hierachy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as
                           a whole:
                           > level 1- quoted (unadjusted) market price in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
                           > level 2 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly
                           or indirectly observable.
                           > level 3 - valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
                           for assets and liabilites that are recognized in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the company determines whether
                           transfers have occured between levels in the hirerachy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is
                           significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
                           the company's management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as
                           investments and deposits measured at fair value, and for non-recurring measurement.
                           for the purpose of fair value disclosures, the company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the
                           nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.
                           this note summarizes accounting policy for fair value. other fair value related disclosures are given in the relavant notes to
                           the financial statements.
                     (c) revenue recognition
                         revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the revenue
                         can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. revenue is measured at the fair value of the
                         consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxes or duties
                         collected on behalf of the government. the company has concluded that it is the principal in all of its revenue arrangements
                         since it is the primary obligor in all the revenue arrangements as it has pricing latitude and is also exposed to inventory and
                         credit risks.
                           in line with ind as 18, the company has assumed that recovery of excise duty flows to the company on its own account. this
                           is for the reason that it is a liability of the manufacturer which forms part of the cost of production, irrespective of whether the
                           goods are sold or not. since the recovery of excise duty flows to the company on its own account, revenue includes excise
                           duty. however, sales tax/ value added tax (vat) is not received by the company on its own account. rather, it is tax collected
                           on value added to the commodity by the seller on behalf of the government. accordingly, it is excluded from revenue. revenue
                           recognised by the company is net of price revision and claims.
                           the specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.

                           (i) sale of goods
                               revenue from sale of goods is recognised when all the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been
                               passed to the buyer, usually on delivery of the goods and collectability of resulting receivable. claims on the company for
                               price revision are accounted when facts and circumstances indicate that a price reduction is probable and the amount is
                               can be reasonably estimated. the claims by the company are recorded when it is accepted and it is reasonably certain
                               that the amounts will be collected.

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           (ii) tool development income
                                tool development income is recognized on completion of tooling program and its satisfactory performance and when the
                                substantial risk and rewards of ownership in the tool is transferred to the buyer as per the terms of the contract.

                           (iii) revenue from sale of services
                               1.    revenue from software services
                                     revenue from sale of services is recognized as and when related costs are incurred and services are performed in
                                     accordance with the terms of specific contracts.
                               2.    revenue from reasearch and development services
                                     revenue relating to research & development services are recognized on a fixed hourly basis as per the contractual
                                     terms.
                               3.    revenue from business support services and other service income
                                     revenue from sale of services is recognized as and when related costs are incurred and services are performed in
                                     accordance with the terms of specific contracts.

                           (iv) interest income
                                for all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, interest
                                income is recorded using the effective interest rate (eir). eir is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash
                                payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross
                                carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. when calculating the effective interest
                                rate, the company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument
                                (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. interest
                                income is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss.

                           (v) profit on sale of investments
                               profit on sale of investments is recognised only at the time when the investments are realised.

                     (d) foreign currency transactions and balances
                         financial statements are presented in inr which is also the functional currency of the company. transactions in foreign currencies
                         are initially recorded by the functional currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition. however, for
                         practical reasons, the company uses a monthly rate if the monthly rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction.
                           monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange
                           at the reporting date.
                           exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetory items are recognised in statement of profit or loss.

                     (e) inventories
                         inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
                           costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
                           raw materials: cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
                           and condition. cost is determined on weighted average basis.
                           finished goods, work in progress and contract work in progress: cost includes cost of direct materials and labour and a
                           proportion of manufacturing overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but excluding borrowing costs. cost is determined

                     (f) provisions
                         provisions are recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it
                         is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
                         estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. the expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of
                         profit and loss net of any reimbursement.
                         if the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when
                         appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. when discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of
                         time is recognised as a finance cost.
                         warranty provisions
                         provisions for warranty related costs are recognized as and when the product is sold or service is provided. provision is based
                         on historical experience. the estimate of such warranty related costs is reviewed annually. a provision is recognized for
                         expected warranty claims on products sold, based on past experience of the level of repairs and returns. assumptions used
                         to calculate the provision for warranties are based on current sales levels and current information available about returns.the
                         company generally offers 18 - 24 months of warranty for its products.

                     (g) contingent liabilities
                           a contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence
                           or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the company. it includes a present obligation
                           that is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. it also
                           arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. the
                           company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.

                     (h) government grants and subsidies
                           government grants are recognised where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached
                           conditions will be complied with. when the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as an income on a systematic
                           basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. when the grant relates
                           to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
                           when the company receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at fair value amounts and
                           released to profit or loss over the expected useful life in a pattern of consumption of the benefit of the underlying asset i.e.
                           by equal annual instalments. when loans or similar assistance are provided by governments or related institutions, with an
                           interest rate below the current applicable market rate, the effect of this favourable interest is regarded as a government grant.
                           the loan or assistance is initially recognised and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the
                           difference between the initial carrying value of the loan and the proceeds received. the loan is subsequently measured as per
                           the accounting policy applicable to financial liabilities.
                           income from export incentives such as duty drawback and served from service exports from india scheme (seis) are
                           recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied
                           with.

                     (i)   taxes
                           current income tax
                           current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation
                           authorities. the tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at
                           the reporting date in the country where the company operates and generates taxable income. current income tax relating
                           to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in
                           equity). management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax
                           regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017


                           deferred tax
                           deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
                           their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all
                           taxable temporary differences, except:
                           when the deferred tax liability arises from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the
                           time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
                           deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any
                           unused tax losses. deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
                           against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can
                           be utilised, except:
                           when the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or
                           liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting
                           profit nor taxable profit or loss.
                           the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
                           probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. unrecognised
                           deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that
                           future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
                           deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is
                           realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
                           reporting date.
                           deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive
                           income or in equity). deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off
                           current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation
                           authority.
                           deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is
                           realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
                           reporting date. deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
                           tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

                     (j)   cash and cash equivalents
                           cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise of cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits with an
                           original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

                     (k) property, plant and equipment
                           property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes,
                           are stated in the balance sheet at cost (net of duty / tax credit availed) less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
                           impairment losses.
                           properties in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any
                           recognised impairment loss. cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance
                           with the company’s accounting policy. such properties are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and
                           equipment when completed and ready for intended use. depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property
                           assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
                           the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready for intended use before such date is disclosed under capital work-in-
                           progress.

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
                           when significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the company depreciates them
                           separately based on their specific useful lives. likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the
                           carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied and the same is
                           depreciated based on their specific useful lives. all other expenses on existing property, plant and equipment, including day-
                           to-day repair and maintenance expenditures, are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period during which such
                           expenses are incurred.
                           an item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when
                           no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. gains or losses arising from de-recognition of property, plant
                           and equipment are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and
                           are recognized in the statement of profit and loss when the asset is derecognized.
                           the company identifies and determines cost of asset significant to the total cost of the asset having useful life that is materially
                           different from that of the life of the principal asset.
                           the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and equipment recognised as of april
                           1, 2015 (the transition date) measured as per the previous gaap and use such carrying value as its deemed cost as of the
                           transition date.
                           depreciation is provided using the straight line method as per the useful lives of the assets estimated by the management,
                           or at the rates prescribed under schedule ii of the companies act, 2013. the useful life estimate for major classes of assets
                           are as follows:
                           asset block                                                             useful life estimated by management (years)

                           in respect of the assets falling under the plant and machinery block, the useful life of the asset has been determined based
                           on a technical assessment. in respect of other blocks, the company believes that the existing useful life adopted by the
                           company is more representative of the useful life of the asset as compared to useful life prescribed in schedule ii and
                           continues to depreciate these assets over the existing useful life which is shorter than the schedule ii useful life.
                           leasehold lands classified as finance lease are amortised on a straight line basis over the primary lease period of 99 years.
                           the residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial
                           year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
                           intangible assets
                           intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately, is capitalised and carried at cost less accumulated
                           amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
                           lives. the estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of
                           any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
                           costs incurred towards purchase of computer software are amortised using the straight-line method over a period based on
                           management's estimate of useful lives of such software being 2 / 3 years, or over the license period of the software, whichever
                           is shorter.
                           the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all of its intangible assets recognised as of april 1, 2015 (the
                           transition date) measured as per the previous gaap and use such carrying value as its deemed cost as of the transition date.

                           de-recognition of intangible assets
                           an intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. gains
                           or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds
                           and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.
                           impairment of tangible and intangible assets carried at cost
                           the carrying amounts of assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment based on internal /
                           external factors. if any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the company estimates
                           the asset’s recoverable amount. an impairment loss is recognized wherever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its
                           recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the greater of the asset’s or cash-generating units (cgu) recoverable value
                           and its value in use. an asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (cgu) fair value less
                           costs of disposal and its value in use. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present
                           value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to
                           the asset. after impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life.
                           a previously recognized impairment loss is increased or reversed depending only for change in assumptions or internal/external
                           factors. however, the carrying value after reversal is not increased beyond the carrying value that would have prevailed by
                           charging usual depreciation if there was no impairment.

                     (l)   borrowing costs
                           borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial
                           period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. all other borrowing costs
                           are expensed in the period in which they occur. borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in
                           connection with the borrowing of funds. borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an
                           adjustment to the borrowing costs.

                     (m) leases
                           the determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
                           inception of the lease. the arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of
                           a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly
                           specified in an arrangement. in respect of agreements entered into by the company before the date of transition to ind as,
                           the company has evaluated the transaction based on facts and conditions as at the transition date.
                           company as a lessee
                           a lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. a lease that transfers substantially all the
                           risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the company is classified as a finance lease.
                           finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or,
                           if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and
                           reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. finance
                           charges are recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying
                           assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the company's general policy on the borrowing costs.
                           a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. however, if there is no reasonable certainty that the company
                           will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
                           the asset and the lease term.
                           operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the
                           lease term.


                                                                                                                                                             69

                                      the above schemes as an expenditure when the employee renders related service. if the contribution payable to the
                                      schemes for services received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit
                                      payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. if on the other hand
                                      the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for the services received before the balance sheet date,
                                      then the excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to reduction in future payment
                                      or cash refund.
                           iv. termination benefits

                                     remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts
                                     included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included
                                     in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding
                                     debit or credit to retained earnings through oci in the period in which they occur. remeasurements are not reclassified
                                     to profit or loss in subsequent periods.
                                     past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:
                                     the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and
                                     the date that the company recognises related restructuring costs.
                                     net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. the company
                                     recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the consolidated statement
                                     of profit and loss:
                                     service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine
                                     settlements; and net interest expense or income.

                     (o) share based payments
                           employees (including senior executives) of the company receive compensation under the scheme of the ultimate holding
                           company, wabco holdings inc., usa in the form of stock units, whereby employees render services as consideration for equity
                           instruments (equity-settled transactions).
                           performance stock units (psus), the vesting of which would occur at levels ranging from none to 200% of the number of
                           granted psus depending upon the achievement of three year cumulative earnings per share goals approved by the compensation,
                           nominating and governance committee of the board of directors of wabco holdings inc.m usa. the company assesses
                           expected achievement levels at the end of each reporting period.
                           resticted stock units(rsu's) vests to the employees on a proportionate basis over the period of 3 years proivded the
                           employees continues in employement.
                           the company measures and recognizes the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees
                           including rsus, psus based on estimated fair values obtained by the ultimate holding company being the administrator of
                           the scheme.
                           the cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in employee stock units reserves in equity, over the period in
                           which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled in employee benefits expense. the cumulative expense recognised
                           for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has
                           expired and the company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. the statement of profit
                           and loss expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and
                           end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.

                     (p) financial instruments
                           a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument
                           of another entity.
                           financial assets
                           initial recognition and measurement
                           all financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through
                           profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. purchases or sales of financial
                           assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular
                           way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

                                                                                                                                                                71

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           subsequent measurement
                           for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified into two categories:
                           debt instruments at amortised cost
                           debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl)

                           debt instruments at amortised cost
                           a ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

                           a)   the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows,and“b)
                                contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
                                (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
                                this category is the most relevant to the company. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently
                                measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method. amortised cost is calculated by taking into
                                account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir amortisation
                                is included in finance income in the profit or loss. the losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit and
                                loss. this category generally applies to trade and other receivables. for more information on receivables, refer
                                to note 8.

                           debt instrument at fvtpl
                           fvtpl is a residual category for debt instruments. any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization
                           as at amortized cost or as fvtoci, is classified as at fvtpl.
                           in addition, the company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or fvtoci criteria,
                           as at fvtpl. however, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency
                           (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).
                           the company has not designated any debt instrument as at fvtpl.
                           debt instruments included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the p&l.

                           derecognition
                           a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a company of similar financial assets) is primarily
                           derecognised (i.e. removed from the company's balance sheet) when:
                           the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
                           the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received
                           cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either (a) the company has
                           transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the company has neither transferred nor retained
                           substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
                           when the company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
                           arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. when it has neither
                           transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the company
                           continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the company's continuing involvement. in that case, the company
                           also recognises an associated liability. the transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects
                           the rights and obligations that the company has retained.
                           continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original
                           carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the company could be required to repay.

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017

                           impairment of financial assets
                           in accordance with ind as 109, the company applies expected credit loss (ecl) model for measurement and recognition of
                           impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
                           a)   financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, deposits, trade receivables
                                and bank balance.
                           b)   trade receivables.
                                the company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on:
                                trade receivables
                                the application of simplified approach does not require the company to track changes in credit risk. rather, it recognises
                                impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
                                for recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the company determines that whether
                                there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. if credit risk has not increased significantly,
                                12-month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss. however, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ecl is
                                used. if, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase
                                in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month
                                ecl.
                                lifetime ecl are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial
                                instrument. the 12-month ecl is a portion of the lifetime ecl which results from default events that are possible within
                                12 months after the reporting date.
                                ecl is the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to the company in accordance with the contract
                                and all the cash flows that the entity expects to receive (i.e., all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original eir. when
                                estimating the cash flows, an entity is required to consider:
                                all contractual terms of the financial instrument (including prepayment, extension, call and similar options) over the
                                expected life of the financial instrument. however, in rare cases when the expected life of the financial instrument cannot
                                be estimated reliably, then the entity is required to use the remaining contractual term of the financial instrument.
                                cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
                                as a practical expedient, the company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its
                                trade receivables. the provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade
                                receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. at every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are
                                updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.
                                ecl impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognized during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the
                                statement of profit and loss (p&l). this amount is reflected under the head ‘other expenses’ in the p&l.
                                financial assets measured as at amortised cost, contractual revenue receivables and lease receivables: ecl is presented
                                as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. the allowance reduces
                                the net carrying amount. until the asset meets write-off criteria, the company does not reduce impairment allowance from
                                the gross carrying amount.
                                for assessing increase in credit risk and impairment loss, the company combines financial instruments on the basis of
                                shared credit risk characteristics with the objective of facilitating an analysis that is designed to enable significant
                                increases in credit risk to be identified on a timely basis.
                                financial liabilities
                                initial recognition and measurement
                                financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and
                                borrowings, payables, as appropriate.

                                                                                                                                                                   73

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
                                all financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of
                                directly attributable transaction costs.
                                the company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables.
                           subsequent measurement
                           the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:
                           financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated
                           upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are
                           incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
                           gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.
                           financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial
                           date of recognition, and only if the criteria in ind as 109 are satisfied. for liabilities designated as fvtpl, fair value gains/
                           losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in oci. these gains/ losses are not subsequently transferred
                           to p&l. however, the company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. all other changes in fair value of such
                           liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. the company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value
                           through profit and loss.
                           derecognition
                           a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. when an
                           existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an
                           existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original
                           liability and the recognition of a new liability. the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement
                           of profit or loss.
                           reclassification of financial assets
                           the company determines classification of financial assets and liabilities on initial recognition. after initial recognition, no
                           reclassification is made for financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. for financial assets which are
                           debt instruments, a reclassification is made only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets.
                           changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. the company's senior management determines change in the
                           business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant to the company's operations. such changes
                           are evident to external parties. a change in the business model occurs when the company either begins or ceases to perform
                           an activity that is significant to its operations. if the company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification
                           prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change
                           in business model. the company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or
                           losses) or interest.

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
                           financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently
                           enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets
                           and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

                     (q) cash dividend and cash distribution to equity holders
                           the company recognises a liability to make cash or non-cash distributions to equity holders of the parent when the distribution
                           is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the company. as per the corporate laws in india, a distribution
                           is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. a corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.
                           non-cash distributions are measured at the fair value of the assets to be distributed with fair value re-measurement recognised
                           directly in equity.
                           upon distribution of non-cash assets, any difference between the carrying amount of the liability and the carrying amount of
                           the assets distributed is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

                     (r) earnings per share
                           basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders by the
                           weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period.

                           for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit for the period attributable to equity shareholders and
                           the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity
                           shares, if any.

                     (s) standards issued but not yet effective
                           the amendments to standards that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the company’s financial
                           statements are disclosed below. the company intends to adopt these standards, if applicable, when they become effective.
                           the ministry of corporate affairs (mca) has issued the companies (indian accounting standards) amendment rules, 2017
                           and has amended the following standard:

                           amendments to ind as 7, statement of cash flows
                           the amendments to ind as 7 requires an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate
                           changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
                           on initial application of the amendment, entities are not required to provide comparative information for preceding periods.
                           these amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 april 2017. application of this amendments will not
                           have any recognition and measurement impact. however, it will require additional disclosure in the financial statements.

                           amendments to ind as 102, share-based payment
                           the mca has issued amendments to ind as 102 that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditions on the
                           measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction, the classification of a share-based payment transaction with
                           net settlement features for withholding tax obligations, and accounting where a modification to the terms and conditions of a
                           share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash settled to equity settled. the amendments are effective
                           for annual periods beginning on or after 1 april 2017. the group is assessing the potential effect of the amendments on its
                           consolidated financial statements.
                           the company will adopt these amendments from their applicability date.

                the estimated provision for the obligations is recognised once the products are
                sold. the estimated provision takes into account historical information, frequency
                and average cost of warranty claims and the estimate regarding possible future
                incidence of claims. the provision for warranty claims represents the present
                value of management's best estimate of the future economic benefits. the
                outstanding provision for product warranties as at the reporting date is the balance
                unexpired period of the respective warranties on the various products which
                range from 18 to 24 months.

                of ddt to the taxation authorities. the company believes that ddt represents additional payment to taxation authority on behalf of the share-
                holders. hence ddt paid is charged to equity.

               basic eps amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average
               number of equity shares outstanding during the year.
               diluted eps amounts are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the company by the weighted average number of
               equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued on conversion of all the
               dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

           30. significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
               the preparation of the company’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
               reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
               uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets
               or liabilities affected in future periods.
                judgements
                in the process of applying the company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant
                effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
                fair value measurement of financial instruments
                when the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in
                active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the dcf model. the inputs to these models are taken from
                observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. judgements
                include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the
                reported fair value of financial instruments. see note 37 for further disclosures.
                estimates and assumptions
                the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of
                causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. the company
                based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. existing circumstances and
                assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of
                the company. such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

                                                                   wabco india limited

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
           (all amounts are in lakhs of indian rupees unless otherwise stated)
                impairment of non-financial assets
                impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value
                less costs of disposal and its value in use. the fair value less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data from binding sales
                transactions, conducted at arm’s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. the
                value in use calculation is based on a dcf model. the cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five years and do not include
                restructuring activities that the compant is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset’s performance of the
                cgu being tested. the recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the dcf model as well as the expected future cash-inflows
                and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. these estimates are most relevant to goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful
                lives recognised by the company.
                deffered income taxes
                the company’s tax expense for the year is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. the calculation of the total tax expense
                necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items. a deferred tax asset is recognised when it has become
                probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. recognition, therefore. involves judgeinent regarding the
                prudent forecasting of future taxable gains and profits of the business.
                defined benefit plans
                the cost of the defined benefit plan and other post-employment benefits and the present value of the obligation are determined using actuarial
                valuations. an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. these include the
                determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term
                nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. all assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
                further details about defined benefit obligations are given in note 32.

           31. employee benefits obligation
               defined benefit plan
                a.   gratuity
                     the gratuity plan is governed by the payment of gratuity act, 1972. under the act, employee who has completed five years of service is
                     entitled to specific benefit. the level of benefits provided depends on the member’s length of service and salary at retirement age.
                b.   provident fund
                     in respect of employees covered under company’s employees provident fund trust contribuions to the company’s employee provident
                     fund trust are made in accordance with the fund rules. the interest rate payable to the beneficiaries every year is being notified by the
                     government.
                     in the case of contribution to the trust, the company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the
                     investments of the trust and the notified interest rate and recognizes such obligation, determined based on an actuarial valuation, as an
                     expense.
                                                                                                                       year ended                    year ended

           38. financial risk management objectives and policies
               the company's principal financial liabilities, include trade and other payables. the company has various financial assets such as trade receiv-
               ables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations. the company also holds fvtpl investments.
               the company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. the company’s senior management oversees the management of these
               risks. the company’s senior management ensures that the company's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and proce-
               dures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the company's policies and risk objectives. it is the
               company’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes may be undertaken. the board of directors reviews and agrees policies
               for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
                 market risk
                 market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. market
                 risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. financial instruments affected by
                 market risk include loans, deposits and fvtpl investments.
                 interest rate risk
                 interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest
                 rates.
                 the company has no borrowings and hence not exposed to interest rate risk.
                 foreign currency risk
                 foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
                 the company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the company’s operating activities (when revenue
                 or expense is denominated in a foreign currency).
                 the majority of the company’s revenue and expenses are in indian rupees, with the remainder denominated in us dollars. the company has
                 exports revenue and import purchases in foreign currency which act as a natural hedge and the management believes the currency risk is
                 mitigated on account of such natural hedge and does not further hedge its currency risk.
                 as variations in foreign currency exchange rates are mitigated and the remaining risk, if any, is not expected to have a significant impact on the
                 results of operations, a sensitivity analysis is not presented.
                 unhedged foreign currency
                 as at the balance sheet date, the company's net foreign currency exposure that is not hedged is as follows:
                 particulars                                                                                          march 31, 2017                    march 31, 2016

                 credit risk
                 credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.
                 the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including
                 deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.
                 liquidity risk
                 liquidity risk refers to the risk that the company cannot meet its financial obligations. the objective of liquidity risk management is to maintain
                 sufficient liquidity and ensure funds are available for use as per requirements.

                in order to achieve this overall objective, the company’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial
                covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital structure requirements. breaches in meeting the financial
                covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. there have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any
                interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current period.
                no changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended march 31, 2017 and march 31,

           notes to financial statements for the year ended 31st march 2017
           (all amounts are in lakhs of indian rupees unless otherwise stated)

           44. ind as notes
                 a. property, plant and equipments
                      under indian gaap, leasehold land were not required to be evaluated as operating or finance lease and accordingly, the company had
                      classified the land taken on lease from adityapur industrial area development authority, adityapur, jamshedpur as part of property, plan
                      and equipment (ppe). however, under ind as, leasehold land has been classified as operating lease. accordingly, the company has
                      reclassified the amount paid for the leasehold land from ppe to other current assets and other non-current assets. also, the company has
                      reclassified the amortization on leasehold land from depreciation and amortization expense to rent under other expenses.
                 b. security deposits
                      under indian gaap, interest free lease security deposits (that are refundable in cash on completion of the lease term) are recorded at their
                      transaction value. under ind as, all financial assets are required to be recognised at fair value. accordingly, the company has fair valued
                      these security deposits under ind as. difference between the fair value and transaction value of the security deposit has been recognised
                      as prepaid rent. the prepaid rent is amortised over the period of the deposit.
                 c. investments carried at fair value through p & l
                      under indian gaap, the company accounted for investments in quoted mutual funds as investment measured at the lower of cost or market
                      value. under ind as, the company has measured such investments at fair value. the difference between fair value and indian gaap
                      carrying amonut has been recognized in retained earnings.
                 d.   government grant
                      under indian gaap, the company recognised the capital investment subsidy as in the nature of promoter’s contribution and treated it as
                      capital reserve. under ind as, the grant set up as deferred income is recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life
                      of the asset.
                 e.   deferred tax
                      indian gaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach, which focuses on differences between taxable profits
                      and accounting profits for the period. ind as 12 requires entities to account for deferred taxes using the balance sheet approach, which
                      focuses on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. the application
                      of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on new temporary differences which was not required under indian gaap.
                      in addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences. according to the accounting policies, the company has to
                      account for such differences. deferred tax adjustments are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in retained earn-
                      ings or a separate component of equity. on the date of transition, the net impact on deferred tax liabilities is of inr 9.83 lakhs (march, 31
                      2016: inr 2.23 lakhs).
                 f.   proposed dividend
                      in the case of the company, the declaration of dividend occurs after period end. therefore, the liability of inr 421.70 lakhs for the year
                      ended on march 31, 2015 recorded for dividend has been derecognised against retained earnings on april 1, 2015 and recognised in the
                      year of payment i.e. 2015-2016.
                 g. sale of goods
                      under indian gaap, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. however, under ind as, sale of goods includes excise duty. excise
                      duty on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of statement of profit and loss. thus sale of goods under ind as has increased by
                      inr 16,708.01 lakhs with a corresponding increase in other expense.
                 h. other comprehensive income
                      both under indian gaap and ind as, the company recognised costs related to its post-employment defined benefit plan on an actuarial
                      basis. under indian gaap, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to profit or loss. under ind as, remeasurements
                      [comprising of actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined
                      benefit liability] are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through oci. thus
                      the employee benefit cost is reduced by inr 95.12 lakhs for the year 2015-16 and remeasurements gains/ losses on defined benefit plans
                      has been recognized in the oci net of tax.
