                 for the second consecutive
                 year we reached the
                 targeted profitability range.



                    our ongoing pulp technology project at metsä group’s bio­
                 product mill progressed well. the cmpc quaiba pulp mill
                 project completed in brazil in 2015 received an award from
                 the project management institute (pmi) as one of the best
                 projects in the world. in 2016, our services team succesfully
                 managed the first shutdown of the mill.
                    during the year, we received an order from cmpc for a
                 white liquor plant for its laja pulp mill project in chile, and
                 from sappi in south africa a demonstration-scale plant order
                 for next-generation dissolving pulp cooking.

                 our strong work in sustainability received recognition
                 to valmet and our customers, sustainability is at the core of
                 the operations. our sustainability360° agenda covers all as-
                 pects of business and integrates our sustainability work with
                 our strategic targets. in 2016, we carried out an extensive
                 review of the agenda and introduced a new three-year action
                 plan going forward. we also continued our special focus on
                 developing sustainable procurement practices globally.
                    during the year, valmet received two important third-par-
                 ty recognitions for our sustainability work and reporting:
                 valmet was included in the dow jones sustainability world
                 index for the third consecutive year with a record high result,
                 and on the cdp climate a-list for its actions and strategy to
                 mitigate climate change.

                 important steps in customer excellence
                 our key tool to improve our performance is the set of four
                 core focus areas we call “must-wins”. they are aimed at im-
                 proving our customer work, our position as an innovation
                 and technology leader, our internal processes, and our culture
                 and ourselves as a winning valmet team.
                    in customer excellence, we finalized the first phase of a
                 longer project to take our way to serve our customers into
                 the next level. we introduced four core commitments to our
                 customers and crystallized our services offering under three
                 categories: performance services, reliability services and new
                 technology. this sounds simple, but it was a major effort, and
                 it means a large internal transformation and training process
                 around the world.

                advanced and competitive technologies based
                on innovations
                valmet has a systematic approach to research and technology development. transforming an idea into a commercial
                product consists of various steps often including pilot tests in valmet’s own r&d centers, and may in some cases
                take several years. over the years valmet has been able to introduce both small product improvements and
                revolutionary innovations to the market. our innovations improve the competitiveness of our technologies and satisfy
                customer needs.




                       cutting lead times and time to market with
                       3d printing

                       3d printing, also called additive manufacturing, is
                       an example of an emerging technology that we can
                       utilize in our product development. valmet has already
                       adopted 3d printing technology to manufacture
                       molding patterns and selected spare parts. the
                       benefits of 3d printing include shorter lead times,
                       rapid on-demand deliveries, and cutting the time to
                       market of new products.

                must-win: excellence in processes


                supplier audit starts best practice approach

                valmet conducts over 50 supplier sustainability audits globally every year as part of its sustainable supply chain
                management program. sfup in poland is one of the companies that has been audited. this manufacturer of steel
                equipment for the paper, chemical and power generation industries, is one of the key suppliers to valmet. one year after
                the audit, sfup has succeeded to implement a more sustainable approach to its business operations than before.




                       action plan triggers renewal process

                       the sustainability audit findings were related to business
                       ethics and compliance, human and labor rights, health
                       and safety, as well as environmental management. the
                       findings led to a jointly agreed corrective action plan for
                       sfup. valmet supported the company throughout the
                       implementation process by providing guidance. sfup
                       completed all corrective actions agreed and the final
                       outcome was verified in a reaudit in 2016. valmet was
                       pleased to see sfup completing all corrective actions
                       only eight months after the first audit, and during this
                       time even exceeding valmet’s requirements.




                                                                                     corrective actions enhances to responsible

                                                                                     sfup made a leap in developing more responsible

                                                                                     its processes, the company made progress in increased
                                                                                     engagement with its employees, and also introduced a
                                                                                     new code of conduct. sfup introduced a new supplier
                                                                                     code of conduct for its suppliers and partners, and also
                                                                                     started to follow up on the requirements. through these
                                                                                     actions, sfup inspired also its suppliers to develop more

                       results exceed audit requirements

                       sfup decided to certify its operations according to
                       the environmental management system iso 14001,
                       and received certification in june 2016. sfup also
                       started to implement a health and safety management
                       system, with the target to receive ohsas 18001
                       certification by 2018. “this is hard work, but we
                       see it all as an investment in the company. we have
                       gained clear benefits and added value through better
                       performance and new processes,” says aleksandra

                must-win: winning team


                valmet steps forward with the global challenge

                the year 2016 was the first year that valmet participated in the global challenge, a workplace health and
                engagement program. for the 100 days between may 25 and september 1, around 1,500 valmet employees counted
                their steps as they competed in teams of seven in a virtual race around the world. physical activity was rewarded
                with steps, which counted towards daily totals, with mini-challenges and team competitions adding to the fun.
                the program also gave tips and practical advice for nutrition, sleep, activity and overall wellbeing.




                       214 teams equals a lot of team spirit

                       the global challenge not only brought out the
                       competitive side in us but also brought us closer
                       together as colleagues. the challenge became a
                       conversation starter, which led to small talk and

             local hse committees implement global actions, and they plan, monitor and advise on local hse issues, such as
             training, environmental efficiency actions and health promotion. the participation of all our people in hse management
             practices and initiatives is fundamental to safe and responsible operations. one measure of this engagement is safety

             must-win: excellence in processes


             ensuring responsible business operations
             wherever we operate
             in 2016, we defined a new global sustainability assessment process to ensure that we are able to operate according
             to our code of conduct whenever we expand our current operations or establish a new legal entity in a new country.
             the sustainability assessment process is based on a checklist covering five main topics based on human rights,
             labor rights, health and safety, environmental management and business ethics. the piloting of the new assessment
             process took place in jakarta in 2016.




                   local conditions are identified

                   the target of the new sustainability assessment is to
                   create a comprehensive understanding of the current
                   practices and the stakeholders' expectations on
                   valmet. when expanding our business presence, we
                   need to understand local market practices to identify
                   our economic, social and environmental impacts, as
                   well as potential risks. the sustainability assessment
                   is part of a smooth entry or expansion to the market.

                                                                             a first pilot

                                                                             valmet is setting up a new services center in jakarta,

                                                                             served as a first pilot for valmet's new assessment
                                                                             process in 2016. the assessment team was led by the
                                                                             sustainability function and included representatives

                                                                             functions. the assessment led into concrete actions to
                                                                             manage the potential risks of the investment.




                   understanding stakeholder expectations

                   a comprehensive stakeholder dialogue helps to ensure
                   that valmet is operating in a responsible manner.
                   the assessment in jakarta included meetings with
                   selected external stakeholders: suppliers, the local
                   main contractor of the services center, local municipal
                   representatives, a grass roots non-governmental
                   organization (ngo), and other partners. the
                   discussions helped to learn about current practices
                   and the stakeholders’ expectations on valmet.
