vice-chancellor’s message



                   i am delighted to introduce deakin’s first        deakin university’s inaugural annual
                   sustainability report. while deakin has           sustainability report describes our activity
                   always considered its environmental impact        in 2013 and contains standard disclosures
                   on both a broad and deep level, it is progress    from the global reporting initiative (gri) g4
                   to see our efforts measured and collated in a     sustainability reporting guidelines. the gri
                   single report.                                    is the best practice international framework
                   our world is now a much smaller place and         for sustainability reporting, using globally
                   decisions around business sustainability          agreed metrics. by aligning our reporting
                   now and into the future will be global            with the gri, deakin is signalling it is serious
                   decisions with impacts far beyond where           in its commitment to sustainability.
                   we might imagine and in ways we may               this approach is a key commitment in our
                   not easily comprehend. corporate social           strategic vision: live the future agenda 2020.
                   responsibility is no longer a ‘nice to have’,     this sustainability reports sets us apart
                   it is an imperative for any organisation that     in the sector as we take the leadership
                   aims for long term sustainability.                position as the first university globally to
                   successful organisations in the 21st century,     produce a report in response to the gri
                   be they universities, not-for-profits, or         g4 guidelines. it is the first, and early,
                   corporations, will all need a corporate           chapter in the deakin sustainability story
                   conscience – the world is coming to realise       and we will work to review and improve
                   that profit is no longer enough, people and       each annual sustainability report as we
                   planet are equally important.                     convert commitment to action and positives
                                                                     outcomes.
                   deakin is growing. while the university
                   has continued to perform well on financial
                   and most social metrics, our performance
                   with environmental management will need
                   careful attention in the future. limiting our
                   impacts by reducing consumption and waste
                   is an important part of the picture, however
                   the energy and emissions impacts of our
                   investment in facilities will dominate our
                   immediate focus.

involvement from our deakin communities is critical to determining ‘what matters most’ across our environmental, economic and social
sustainability performance. seeking feedback from our stakeholders means consistently engaging with our students, staff,
local communities and our many government, business and industry partners.

our management policies and processes
our first environmental sustainability enabling policy was published
in 2009 and commitments were made as discussed above. these
aspirations were supported by the environment strategy however our
rapid and significant growth period has challenged our performance
against some targets. furthermore, the targets set in our environment
strategy have since been reviewed as part of the sustainability
reporting process. it is clear that we have work to do to improve
our energy use and emissions reductions in particular. management
processes to address our performance will include a continued focus
on tertiary education facilities management association (tefma)
benchmark reporting, as well as a long-term improvement program
measured against the gri reporting framework.
deakin’s procurement policy includes sustainability as a required
principle. our policy states that we will endeavour to procure goods
and services that are aligned with the objectives of the environmental
sustainability enabling policy and sustainable procurement strategy.
the policy commits us to undertake procurement to demonstrate
value for money, probity, sustainability and equity principles.the
university supply chain is effectively decentralised with most business
units across the organisation having direct responsibility for the
purchase of goods and services required by the individual business
units. procurement services are responsible for the overall strategic
direction of procurement and provide an oversight of the supply
chain to ensure policy compliance, best value for money outcomes
and that sustainable procurement initiatives are delivered for the
university. there were no significant changes in suppliers, or location
of suppliers during 2013. as a fair trade accredited organisation, our
trade relationships are global.      a snapshot story of our fair trade
accreditation can be found on our website deakin.edu.au/about-
deakin/sustainability.
in december 2013, the vice-chancellor approved the revised
investment policy. the approach to investment includes endeavouring
to ensure investments incorporate appropriate environmental, social
and governance (esg) considerations. these considerations will be
part of an esg investment plan that balances financial outcomes with
esg imperatives.
our approach to sustainability reporting
we take a long-term view with our reporting plan, setting realistic and
achievable goals and aiming for incremental improvements. in this
context, the 2013 report contains standard disclosures from the gri
g4 guidelines.
identifying sustainability stakeholders and the most effective
means of engagement is an ongoing process due to the complexity
of a multi-campus university and the early stage of maturity with
our sustainability reporting. we recognise we have work to do
in documenting our processes of engagement and ensuring we
focus our reporting activities on what is relevant to sustainability
stakeholders. stakeholder groups with an interest in deakin’s
sustainability performance were identified as: students, staff, local
communities and government.4
these stakeholders were identified on the basis of their interaction
with the university, through our activities, people/relationships and/
or by the location of our campuses. 5

the importance of security
deakin university is generally a safe place to work, study and enjoy
the campus facilities, with very little risk of being subject to threats
or violence. however there have been occasions where staff and
students have been subject to threats or have felt threatened. in
these situations it is important to know what to do, so our staff are
trained and educated about appropriate safety procedures.
similarly, students need to feel safe and secure at all times and
deakin security officers are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week
and are based at all campuses. these officers are easily identified
by their uniforms, which have a deakin security badge on them.
security officers are trained on deakin security policies, procedures
and emergency arrangements as well as to level 2 first aid. internal
contact for security officers is extension 222 and security can also be
contacted externally.
deakinsafe is a program of work approved in august 2013 comprising
a capital investment of more than $1.6 million. during 2013, project
planning commenced for rollout in 2014 with a state-of-the-art
emergency and safety communication centre as the centrepiece.
safezone is a free app for all deakin university students and staff
that connects directly to the security team if a person needs help on
campus. the app makes it easier to contact security and helps them
to respond, by sending the person’s name and location directly to the
response team members. by installing the safezone app (available
on apple and android devices), registered users also receive critical
notifications from the university.      a snapshot story on campus
security can be found on our website deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/

activities including engagement with student clubs and societies and
the use of deakin central hubs, both in the cloud and on campus.
deakin’s global citizenship program was established to provide access
to a range of international experiences and a way of articulating
those experiences and their value to future employers. in its fourth
year, the program has more than 2,000 registered students and 144
awardees. in 2013, working with the rotary club of geelong, students
of the program helped build a new pre-school in south taveuni in fiji.
in july 2013, deakin was awarded 11 grants totalling $223,500 from
the department of industry, innovation, climate change, science,
research and tertiary education. these 2014 asiabound grants will
enable students to have a first-hand study experience of asia through
programs in art, health, architecture, sociology, civil engineering and
business.




  ‘the 2013 australian graduate survey results reveal that deakin
  has the highest overall student satisfaction rate amongst
  victorian universities for the fourth consecutive year. this is an
  enormous achievement – our teachers and support staff have
  done us proud and our students have received an education that
  is useful to them.’

intangible effects on the social and environmental fabric around each
campus. in warrnambool and geelong particularly, the presence of
the university is an important part of what makes a city appealing to
people and hence to the businesses which seek to employ them.
     a snapshot story about deakin’s community presence can be

we are also actively exploring ways to involve the local community
in our campus life – for example the film night held at burwood in
orientation week was open to the community and the restaurant and
business facilities in the new burwood highway frontage building will
be open to the public.
deakin strives to generate optimism and wellbeing in all our
communities and address any community concerns up front with a
win-win approach. we have a community engagement plan for the
whole university and dedicated engagement managers in each key
community in which we operate. we are also developing a university-
