             new eyes for industry




csr report

    message from the president
                              realizing csr through our core business
                              the range of uses for lenses is growing steadily wider, including not just photographic lenses but
                              also lenses for use in security cameras and automotive cameras, etc. reflecting this situation,
                              we at tamron see ourselves as having a mission to realize a corporate social responsibility (csr)
                              strategy that contributes to bringing joy to as many people as possible, and also provides benefits
                              for society as a whole and for the environment, through our core business of making lenses as the
                             “new eyes for industry.”to this end, we are developing design, development and production
                              systems for the creation of high-quality, environmentally-friendly products, and further improving
                              our quality not only in japan, but worldwide; in the future, tamron will continue to develop new
                              products that really strike a chord with our customers, while also giving them security and peace
                              of mind.
                              with regard to the environment, tamron has set itself the target of reducing company-wide
                              carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 1% per year on a unit sales basis, compared to
                              the benchmark year of fy2012, so that, by 2020, co2 emissions will have been reduced by
                              approximately 7% compared to fy2012. unfortunately, whereas fy2015 should have seen
                              emissions fall by a cumulative 3% according to the target, they actually rose by 5.6%. almost the
                              entirety of tamron’ s co2 emissions are accounted for by the electric power used in the company’
                              s production processes. tamron will be working hard in the future to realize more effective
                              production and achieve its medium-term emission reduction targets.
                              we are also in the process of building a better supply chain: one that emphasizes compliance
                              with relevant laws and regulations (both in japan and overseas), upholds international standards
                              relating to socially-responsible procurement (such as those concerning conflict minerals etc.),
                              respects human rights and provides a satisfactory working environment, and pays due attention
                              to fair operating practices.


                              supporting csr through effective human resources
                              cultivation and appropriate working practices
                              tamron has for many years now sought to cultivate“self-disciplined employees,”by which is
                              meant employees who strive to adopt a professional mindset and are able to carry out their work
                              in a professional manner. this cultivation of“self-disciplined employees”is very important for
                              the company, and derives from an approach to business management that recognizes the vital
                              importance of employees. in this way, tamron is able to ensure that our employees respond fully
                              to customers’needs, and work actively to make a positive contribution to society as a whole.
                              the guiding principle behind our company’    s activities is the concept of“team tamron.”it is vital
                              that, when carrying out our work, we always think in terms of what is best for the tamron group
    president & ceo           as a whole. creating an environment where female employees can thrive is particularly important;
                              one example of how tamron has worked to achieve this goal is the establishment of the“tamron
    tamron co., ltd.
                              kids day-care center”at tamron’    s head office in fy2015. tamron is also working to boost the
    shiro ajisaka             share of senior managers who are female, and is providing incentives to ensure that employees
                              make full use of the childcare leave system. we are also working to change employee mindsets
                              regarding their work so that not working overtime comes to be seen as perfectly normal; we are
                              committed to making work-styles more efficient and eliminating unnecessary, pointless“work
                              for work’ s sake.”helping employees to achieve a work-life balance in which there is a clear
                              distinction between work and home life helps make people more enthusiastic about their work
                              and encourages flexible, creative thinking, thereby creating a“virtuous circle”in the workplace.

                              tamron continues to be an active supporter of the10 principles laid out in the u.n. global
                              compact as part of its global expansion. we recognize that these 10 principles represent
                              guidelines that truly multinational corporations must put into practice, and as such, we have
                              reflected these principles in our action declarations and thoroughly educate our employees on
                              the principles. compliance at our overseas sites is particularly important and our compliance
                              action guidelines incorporating specific activities have been made known to all so that we can
                              fulfill the expectations and trust of our stakeholders around the world.
                              in compiling this csr report, we focused on engagement with stakeholders. we would greatly
                              appreciate your comments and suggestions for how we can further improve our csr management
                                                                                                                              s
                              in addition, regarding the disclosure of non-financial information, which is encouraged by japan’
                              corporate governance code, tamron intends to continue to disclose information proactively, with
                              this report playing a key role.
