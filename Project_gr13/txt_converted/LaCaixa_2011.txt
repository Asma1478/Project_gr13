in parallel, and in relation to energy saving derived from the
consumption of computing equipment, these were
programmed in 2009 to ‘hibernate’ automatically over the
weekend. this measure has represented a 20.45% saving of
energy, which means over 5 million kwh. in 2010, there have
been 500 branches hibernating overnight on weekdays,
meaning a reduction of 5.9 million kwh or 22.15% of initial
consumption.

laser printers have also been programmed to go into energy
saving mode after 30 minutes of inactivity. the remaining
electrical devices, which have to be switched off manually, have
been labelled with stickers reading: “switch off before
