                    singtel’s green data centre




                        the kim chuan telecommunications centre 2 was officially commissioned in january 2010.
                        the new data centre was awarded the green mark gold by the building and construction
                        authority in singapore, under which a building is rated based on criteria such as energy and
                        water efficiency as well as environment protection and innovation.

                        among some of the key conservation features in this centre are:
                        • use of more efficient chillers that surpass the ss530 standard
                        • air-distribution system that is 31.48% more energy efficient than the commonly used
                          air-distribution systems, resulting in an estimated energy saving of 7 gwh per year
                        • sleep modes and variable voltage variable frequency (vvvf) motor features incorporated
                          into the lifts
                        • high frequency ballast provided for 100% of fluorescent luminaries
                        • energy efficient luminaries such as t5/t8
                        • motion sensors for lighting

                    renewable energy initiatives
                    we installed a grid-tied solar photovoltaic system (40
                    kw peak capacity) at our pasir ris telephone exchange
                    in 2009. 195 photovoltaic panels have been installed on
                    the roof which allow the system to collect energy to
                    power up 182 personal computers for ten hours or half
                    the lighting system per day at this exchange. in total,
                    we harnessed 49,750 kwh with this system last year.
                    this translates into a reduction of our carbon footprint

                    making a difference for the cancer patients: aileen tan and chua sock koong present cheque to scs


                        about 200 singtel employees and top management members supported the inaugural
                        ‘singtel-singapore cancer society 2009 race against cancer’. on 23 august 2009, they
                        joined an estimated 3,500 participants for the charity run at east coast park to raise funds
                        for singapore cancer society (scs). as their encouragement to cancer survivors and those
                        battling the illness, participants could choose to run a 5km or 10km route.

                        lending their support at the event were group ceo chua sock koong and group director of
                        human resource aileen tan, who is also the deputy chairperson of stlf. stlf’s s$200,000
                        donation was channeled towards a new ‘scs help the children and youth’ programme to
                        help children and youths with cancer or whose parents are suffering from cancer. scs helps
                        more than 1,000 needy cancer patients and reaches out to some 40,000 individuals through its
                        community outreach and awareness programmes.

                        “running in this charity race is good for the heart – both in terms of healthy exercise and
                        the great feeling you get from helping those in need.”

                      in singapore, singtel supported earth hour 2010 and heightened awareness among our employees
                      as well as customers of the importance of environmental conservation. the lights at our landmark
                      buildings were switched off from 8.30pm to 9.30pm on 27 march 2010, sending the message that we
                      care about climate change.
                      in conjunction with this, we ran a two-week campaign encouraging employees and customers to
                      play their part for the environment. we also worked with our creative agency to produce a special
                      video clip which was uploaded on youtube.
                      during the lead-up to earth hour 2010, we installed a special utility consumption meter on the
                      staff portal to show daily power and water consumption levels at comcentre. the data collected
                      was converted into the equivalent in light bulbs and swimming pools to help our people
                      understand the impact of singtel’s energy and water consumption levels.
                      optus and our regional associates ais, bharti airtel, globe and telkomsel also supported earth
                      hour 2010. we encouraged our employees in australia to join a staff competition by sharing on
                      “what is the one everyday habit you have changed to improve your environmental footprint?”
                      with energy efficient prizes to be won.
