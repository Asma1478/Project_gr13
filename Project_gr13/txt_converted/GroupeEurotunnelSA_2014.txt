a energy-saving, discreet lighting
the power consumption of the 14,200 lights on the two terminals
had been increasing, and their emitted halos can be perceived
as light pollution. actions have therefore been taken since 2010
to reduce consumption and minimise the luminosity of lamps
at night, while maintaining a high level of comfort and safety for
our customers. by reducing the number of light points and
replacing them with more modern devices, the total reduction
in power consumption represents a drop in co2 emissions of
216 tonnes a year and nearly €70,000 in savings.

     the eurotunnel group generated the creation of 3,744 direct jobs and more than 5,000 induced
     jobs in kent and in the calais region, on top of the 10,000 to 12,000 jobs mobilised for five years
     while building the infrastructure. a vital link between the uk and continental europe, the fixed
     link also led to the development of highways, high-speed railway lines, stations and more,
     and continues to generate wealth on both sides of the channel. the group has strengthened
     its regional roots by getting involved in multiple initiatives with all its stakeholders: customers,
     employees, suppliers, shareholders and the region.
