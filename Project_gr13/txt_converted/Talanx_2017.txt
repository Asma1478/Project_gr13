                               ulated and economically disadvantages areas, in two ways.
                               firstly, the insurance companies ensure comprehensive
                               insurance provision via the different sales channels; in
                               the case of the retail germany division, this also includes
                               remote advice. in addition, in 2016 the bancassurance com-

                               ers; with immediate effect, customers can use the new apps
                               from the three bancassurance brands to encrypt documents

                               and more efficient handling of customer concerns.
