     message
     to the stakeholders

                           dear honorable stakeholders,

                           we have published the fourth csr report that covers csr initiatives and accomplishments. we deeply appreciate our stakeholders’
                           warm concern and consistent support to our social responsibility management.

                           since the shipbuilding contracts aggregated, domestic and international shipping industries have faced the worst economic
                           condition and restructured in the entire scale. despite the continuous tough management situation, doosan engine has
                           strengthened the foundation for sustainable management and made versatile efforts to gain financial competitive edge over the
                           last year, thereby achieving a turnaround by reaching a break-even point.

                           difficulties in shipping industry are expected to continue this year as well. we anticipate that global economy will be more
                           uncertain and the level of market competition for securing contracts inevitable for existence will be much more fierce.
                           nevertheless, we will enhance the profitability of low-speed engine business and fortify the effort to secure contracts and activate
                           scr business by upgrading the competitive edge of our merchandise so that we can overcome the current depression and
                           enhance the competitiveness of our core business in preparation for upcoming full-scale recovery in shipping market. we will also
                           expand our ‘after market’ business based on the demand for engine parts and for charged service to generate new profits.

                           besides, we won’t be negligent in social responsibility management initiatives for the sustainable and sound growth of doosan
                           engine. last year, as a means of strategic response to various issues regarding sustainability, we have set csr-focused tasks and
                           gradually implemented specific plans, thereby securing a sustainable operational foundation. especially, we have focused on risk
                           management in human right for ensuring our employees’ human right and concentrated on the promotion of energy efficiency in
                           our workplace and the establishment of csr management system in the supply chain.

                           risks threatening the corporate existence have lasted ceaselessly and the only company challenging against these risks has been
                           able to survive. doosan engine will make much more effort to realize the vision: ‘no. 1 engine in the world’, which provides
                           the highest level of engine through continual change and innovation. doosan engine will continue to communicate with all our
                           stakeholders through regular publication of csr reports. we will comply with ungc ten principles and direct all our resources to
                           achieving mutual prosperity with all the stakeholders. your steadfast support and concern will be greatly anticipated.

                   taking effect from 2016, the imo’s tier iii regulation will require nox emissions from marine
                   engines to be reduced by 80% compared to the existing tier i regulation, in order to prevent
                   atmospheric pollution. doosan engine, a top tier engine maker with advanced engineering, analysis
                   and applied control technology, has completed the development and successfully commercialized
                   of the marine scrs since 2011. the scr is an environmental system that converts nox(no and
                   no2) in emissions into harmless n2 and h2o by using catalyst.
