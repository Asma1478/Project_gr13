        introduction

        from the very start, the thk group (usually referred to in
        these pages simply as thk) has always conducted its opera-
        tions with the aim of contributing to society through its core
        business activities.
           this year’s thk csr report includes an eight-page feature
        section examining thk’s efforts to honor its corporate social
        responsibilities in two key areas. the first part looks at ways
        in which thk products are used in the field of robotics, a new
        area of business for thk. the second part recounts the ex-
        periences of people who rely on thk’s seismic isolation sys-
        tems for protection against earthquakes, which occur all too
        frequently in japan amid the ongoing risk of a catastrophic
        seismic event.
           the section entitled “management system” includes a dis-
        cussion of risk management efforts, while “involvement in so-
        ciety” focuses on thk’s relationships with its various stake-
        holders. “harmony with the environment” examines thk’s
        environmental initiatives in fiscal 2012 and presents some
        quantitative results.
           the thk csr report is an essential tool for communicat-
        ing with everyone who is connected in any way to thk and
        its activities. reader comments and feedback will be greatly
        appreciated—please take the time to fill out the enclosed
        questionnaire.

        devices, which have been miniaturized, fit neatly inside
        the robot itself, eliminating the need for the big external
        control boxes used to operate conventional robots. the
        programs that govern the robot’s movements are stored
        inside as well, enabling the robot to move independently.
        from among the comprehensive array of robot systems
        available, modules specifically addressing the intended
        uses can be selected and combined. this provides a sim-
        pler and more efficient way to build the right robot for the
        task at hand.
           the technology behind seed solutions was developed
        through collaborations on robot projects with the japan
        aerospace exploration agency and japan’s national in-

           thk and jaxa

         thk has collaborated with the japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa) on joint research aimed at developing a
         robotic hand. this effort arose out of a proposal thk submitted to jaxa’s aerospace open laboratory program, which
         organizes promising space-related projects through collaboration among government, academia, and private indus-
         try. jaxa wanted to study the creation of a nimble yet powerful robotic hand for use in outer space, as an alternative to
         having crew members perform work outside the spacecraft. thk, having already developed technology enabling the
         use of robotic hands for disaster relief and remote medical care, was confident that it could build on these achieve-
         ments and readily accepted the challenge.
            through the aerospace open laboratory program, a compact, high-thrust linear-motion actuator was developed to
         enable the fingers of the robotic hand to flex and extend. according to jaxa’s specifications, the robotic hand had to
         be no larger than the type of glove worn by astronauts when working outside the spacecraft, and had to provide the
         same grip strength. by combining the motor with a miniature ball screw, thk was able to devise a compact yet suf-
         ficiently powerful actuator that met the required conditions. then, just as the joint research on the actuator-equipped
         robotic hand was beginning to bear fruit, thk received a request to build a robotic hand for jaxa’s rex-j project, an
         experimental effort to use helper robots for extra-vehicular activity at kibo, the japanese module that forms part of
         the international space station.
            the rex-j project involved sending a prototype helper robot into space to dock with kibo and experimenting with
         the actual use of the robot to support crew members working in outer space. when the robotic hand was built, it
         was subjected to heat, vibration, and vacuum, to approximate the conditions in which it would be used, and adjust-
         ments were made to adapt it to the simulated outer space environment. in july 2012 the prototype helper robot was
         launched into space aboard the kotonori 3 unmanned cargo spacecraft. all the scheduled experiments were success-
         fully carried out over the next seven and a half months, concluding in march 2013.
            thk is working to further refine the linear-motion actuator technology that
         emerged from its collaboration with jaxa, with the aim of contributing to the de-
         velopment of robotic hands that perform useful functions in outer space and here
         on earth as well.

                                          when i joined thk, the joint research project with jaxa conducted though the aero-
                                          space open laboratory program was already underway. my first assignment was work-
                                          ing on the design of a robotic glove that would make it possible to operate the robotic
                                          hand in a natural, intuitive way. when the operator put on the glove and moved his or
                                          her fingers, the robotic hand moved its fingers exactly the same way. the representa-
                                          tive from jaxa at that time, who was the same age as me, was a very accomplished
                                          guy. i remember working like crazy so he wouldn’t show me up. the glove, along with
                                          the robotic hand that thk developed, is now stored at jaxa’s laboratory facility. it’s

         seed solutions. it requires skills different from those involved in development work. there are still a lot of things i don’t
         understand, and i make a lot of mistakes, but i carry on and keep my head down. i feel that more and more people
         are pulling for me, both within and outside thk, and that makes it all worthwhile.

you perform physical labor you have to be able to grip
things with a certain amount of force. a hydraulic motor
could provide plenty of gripping power, but in outer space
we need to be able to attach different tools to the end of
the robot’s arm so it can perform a variety of tasks, and
a hydraulic motor would never fit inside the arm. this is
what drew our attention to thk’s linear actuators.

  thk’s seismic isolation technology: recommended by all the architects

                                      myotoku had a seismically isolated building constructed at our office complex in
                                      iwate prefecture, for three reasons. first, to provide a temporary place of refuge
                                      for employees in the event of a major earthquake like the great east japan earth-
                                      quake. second, to protect our server computers, which are essential for business
                                      continuity. third, to have a place where we can immediately hold emergency
                                      meetings even after a large-scale disaster, to ensure that the business keeps
                                      functioning. in addition to seismic isolation, the building was equipped with solar

statutory auditor, myotoku ltd.       panels and its own electric power generator, as well as tanks to collect rainwater
                                      and a three-day food supply for the employees, should they need to take refuge
                                      in the facility. the servers had been housed at our headquarters in tokyo, but
earthquakes can strike anywhere in japan. we wanted them protected by the most effective means available, so we
built the seismically isolated building in iwate and stored them there.
   the idea of using thk’s seismic isolation technology came from the architects who submitted designs for the build-
ing—all of them recommended using thk. of the three architectural firms we dealt with, two incorporated thk devic-
es into their designs from the outset. the third originally favored rubber dampers
made by another company but eventually revised its design and switched to thk,
because, given the total weight of the building, thk’s system was more suitable.
as a manufacturer of vacuum pump systems and related products, myotoku was
familiar with an essential component of thk seismic isolation devices, the lm
guide, which is used in some of our production machinery. it’s easy to see how
the system works, and we now feel we’re prepared for another earthquake.                 equipped with seismic isolation, solar panels, rain-

                                                                                                     continuity, the new building houses myotoku’s

  grateful for consideration as well as quality

                                      citizen machinery miyano has had a long and close relationship with thk. over
                                      90% of our machine tools use thk’s lm guides, and we hold events where our
                                      engineers and theirs get together to exchange ideas and discuss technical issues.
                                         this is the first time we’ve used seismic isolation devices. we have a lot of faith
                                      in thk products, though, so we had no doubts about the quality. the installation
                                      work had to be coordinated with the moving of three-dimensional measuring
                                      equipment from another plant, however. we couldn’t spare much time for the
kenji aoki                            project, and it took a while to get company approval for the seismic isolation

                                         the three-dimensional measuring device
now protected by seismic isolation is used to perform final inspections on our in-
house jigs. if it gets shaken up in an earthquake, it loses all accuracy and has to
be recalibrated, which takes a week and is very costly. from a cost-performance
standpoint as well, we’re glad we opted for seismic isolation.

           seismic isolation in action: protecting servers

                                              our old building was built to survive a level-6-minus earthquake (measured
                                              on the japanese scale), and the new one is designed to withstand a level-7
                                              quake. when it was built we decided to have a seismic isolation device in-
                                              stalled under the entire floor of the transmission room, where we keep our
                                              server computers and critical transmission equipment. the aim is to prevent
                                              any disruption of telephone, internet, or cable television service to 70,000

         toyohashi cable network inc.           there were three things that led us to select thk’s seismic isolation device.
                                              first, through simulations of three major earthquakes that had previously oc-
                                              curred—the 1995 great hanshin-awaji earthquake, the 2007 niigata-chuet-
         su-oki earthquake, and the 2011 great east japan earthquake—we were able to ascertain the effective range
         of motion once the devices were installed. second, the devices consist of individual modules that can be freely
         configured, which appealed to us. third, they could easily accommodate our transmission cables.
            the thk sales representatives and technicians we met all conveyed real enthusiasm for their seismic isolation
         products. they stayed on site throughout the installation work, despite the
         midsummer heat, and showed a determination not just to sell their prod-
         ucts but to seriously take care of the customer’s needs.
            thk develops its own products, and they have the flexibility to address
         a customer’s specific needs. i hope they’ll offer even more guidance on
         construction methods in the future and keep finding more customers for
         their seismic isolation equipment, to help alleviate natural disasters here the entire transmission room floor is protected by seis-

           fulfilling a mission to preserve the temple for posterity

                                                it is our mission to ensure that the temple honnoji, the main temple of the hokke
                                                sect of buddhism, and the icons it houses, are continually passed on to future
                                                generations. honnoji is the main temple for over 50 branch temples in hyogo pre-
                                                fecture, including the island of awaji, some of which were completely destroyed
                                                in the great hanshin-awaji earthquake. as we endeavored to recover, thanks to
         (from left) chief abbot nisou sugahara disaster-relief funding and other financial assistance, we contemplated protec-
         and chief steward taikou akada
         honno-ji temple, headquarters          tive measures against natural disasters. ultimately we opted for earthquake-re-
         of the hokke buddhist sect             sistant renovations based on seismic analysis, to protect the temple and its icons
                                                from the effects of a major earthquake.
                                                    our temple has been rebuilt seven times, but it includes structures that have
         endured for over 600 years and is thus considered a valuable cultural asset. accordingly, some people were appre-
         hensive about incorporating metal seismic isolation and damping devices into the temple’s entirely wooden construc-
         tion. whether to take protective measures against a major disaster or preserve the original structure of a precious
         cultural property posed a very difficult dilemma, but after much testing and
         a great deal of debate we determined that incorporating seismic isolation
         and damping would not compromise the temple’s status as a cultural asset.
         quake-proofing and seismic isolation work was carried out as part of a ren-
         ovation project begun in 2008 to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding
         of the temple. the entire main hall is now protected by thk seismic damping
         devices employing ball screws, while our icons are protected by seismic iso-
         lation devices employing lm guides.
             we hold sermons in our main hall for visiting schoolchildren, attended by
         as many as 500 people. we can now welcome all such visitors with greater honnoji: seismic damping has been provided under the
                                                                                             floor and roof, and seismic isolation tables support the
         peace of mind.                                                                      statuary in the main hall.

  using seismic isolation technology to protect even lightweight artwork

                                      we deal in electrical equipment and electronics, including systems for protecting
                                      buildings, and we use thk products. to be able to sell our goods, we have to
                                      understand how they work. lately we’ve been involved with a new exhibition
                                      facility housing ceramics and other items of traditional craftwork, which are being
                                      preserved as cultural assets. we’ve used thk seismic isolation devices to keep
                                      these valuable works safe from the effects of a major earthquake.
                                         there are many different ceramic pieces displayed inside the facility, some

                                      weight items, it would send them flying, so ordinary seismic isolation devices
                                      wouldn’t suffice. i don’t think thk had previously made a device designed to
hold a lightweight load like ceramic ware, but they persevered through trial and error. eventually it became clear that
placing each piece on its own isolation table was the wrong approach. they decided to use multiple linked tables
instead, and this enabled them to perfect a seismic isolation system providing equal protection to pieces of widely
varying weight.
   after the great east japan earthquake in 2011, i was saddened to hear from people who trade in and collect art and
craftwork that a lot of pieces were no longer being displayed, having been packed
up in crates out of concern that another major earthquake might occur. it’s a great
pity when works of art and fine craftsmanship, created for people to see and en-
joy, are stowed away out of sight for protection. our exhibition facility offers proof
of the effectiveness of seismic isolation devices. i hope people will come and see
how well they work so more people will understand that, with these devices, it’s
safe to put these beautiful pieces on display again.                                    exhibition facility equipped with seismic isolation.

  in their own words                          a participant in the volunteer leave system

                                   when the great east japan earthquake struck in 2011, i wanted to help out somehow, part-
                                   ly because my parents are both from fukushima prefecture in northeastern japan, where
                                   some of the worst destruction occurred. i signed up to work in the region as a volunteer.
                                      ota ward, the part of tokyo where i live, has a mutual aid agreement with the city of hi-

                                   2012, i worked as a volunteer in four weekend sessions there, from friday to sunday. when
                                   i saw the actual conditions in the disaster area and talked with the people who had been
                                   affected, i realized a lot more volunteers were needed, so in june 2012 i took volunteer leave
                                   for five days and joined a one-week project devoted to clearing vegetation and transporting

     fun. that made me so happy.
        these days i sign up for a weekend session every one or two months. a lot of companies don’t have a volunteer leave
     system, and a lot of the other volunteers were envious when i
     told them about our system at thk.
        the recovery effort hasn’t progressed as fast as i had hoped.
     i didn’t think they’d still need volunteer assistance two and a
     half years after the disaster struck. i hope more people will
     help out with the activities going on around them and realize

                                            1. preserving the environment is one of our most important tasks. we will strive to accurately determine the environ-
                                               mental impact of our products, services, and overall business activities and to ensure that every unit within the
                                               group establishes and observes appropriate environmental targets.
                                            2. we will abide by all laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and establish and observe voluntary
                                               environmental standards, reviewing these whenever necessary in pursuit of more efficient and effective environ-
                                               mental management.
                                            3. we will continually strive to develop products that help reduce environmental burdens.
                                            4. we will continually strive to reduce our overall energy usage as well as specific energy consumption and reduce
                                               our greenhouse-gas emissions.
harmony with the environment




                                            5. we will continually conserve and recycle resources, primarily by reducing and recycling waste from our manufac-
                                               turing divisions, and strive to prevent environmental pollution.
                                            6. to extend our environmental efforts throughout the entire group, we will assist and help guide efforts by affiliates and
                                               partner businesses and cooperate and collaborate with the communities where thk conducts business.
                                            7. this basic environmental policy will be communicated to every division in the thk group through education, train-
                                               ing, and other means of raising environmental awareness. we will disclose relevant environmental data to parties
                                               both within and outside the group in a timely manner.
