cybercom’s sustainability vision
and strategic objectives




ceo comment
for cybercom to be able to grow with
continued profitability, it is important to
take responsibility for how people and the
environment are affected by the company’s
activities. we therefore work with long-term
sustainability issues and believe it is impor-
tant to report and follow up on cybercom’s
sustainability efforts.

cybercom’s csr work during the year




  governance and management
  goal: raising awareness and engagement
  in order to increase internal awareness and engagement for our work, we have established csr ambas-
  sadors at the company. our csr ambassadors work with csr issues both internally and externally.
  outcome: csr ambassadors and csr managers have held talks internally across the organisation.
  cybercom has been invited to give talks externally, such as for sos children’s villages in almedalen and
  for the accounting firm kpmg, and representatives of cybercom have been interviewed in the press
  about the company’s csr work. this in turn has increased awareness of cybercom’s work externally, and
  has improved engagement in sustainability issues internally.
  development: cybercom has for the second consecutive year appointed csr ambassadors who work
  internally and externally with csr issues. the purpose of this is that the ambassadors will help develop
  cybercom’s sustainability efforts and help to increase awareness of the company’s sustainability efforts
  internally and externally.


  goal: improving awareness of our values and principles
  cybercom’s values, norms and principles were laid down in the code of conduct that was introduced
  in 2004 and revised in 2010. in order to enhance awareness and understanding of this, we initiated an
  internal communications campaign.
  outcome: the campaign was conducted during the year, and the main principles and guidelines of the
  code were communicated and discussed internally at the various offices. the campaign has helped to
  increase awareness and understanding of the code of conduct, partly through the discussions that arose
  in connection with the campaign.
  development: the next step is to spread awareness of cybercom’s values, norms and principles
  externally through our code of conduct; partly to customers and partly by requiring that our contractors
  comply with the requirements and expectations of our code of conduct.




  economic
  goal: more video conferences
  introduction of the lync video conferencing system to increase the proportion of conferences over the
  internet and reduce the proportion of conferences that require travel.
  outcome: since the end of 2011, employees at all cybercom offices have had access to lync.
  development: in 2012, we estimate that more virtual conferences will take place and conference
  travel will be reduced. this will in turn help to reduce emissions due to travel, and will reduce the group’s
  travel expenses and reduce the economic burden on society.

  environmental
  goal: reducing emissions
  in the long run reduce travel emissions through the introduction of the lync it-based conference system.
  reducing environmental impact by scrapping equipment in an environmentally sound manor.
  outcome: emissions per employee increased in 2011 from 0.482 tonnes to 0.51 tonnes. scrapping
  reduces negative environmental impact.
  development: in 2012, all employees have access to lync and the objective of reducing travel per
  employee has been initiated.


  goal: reviewing cybercom’s environmental impact
  identifying services that can reduce the negative environmental impact of our customers.
  outcome: we identified server hosting services. packaging of services for government agencies, mu-
  nicipalities and counties to reduce negative environmental impacts through services for remote meetings,
  meeting management (paperless), sustainability reporting and compliance with environmental policies.
  the swedish tax authority’s dialog project, an e-government service. rovdjursforum, a national database
  of predatory animals that creates the conditions for sustainable and long-term wildlife management. a
  video conferencing system for telia.
  development: cybercom will develop a government agency mailbox that individuals can choose to
  direct their communications to. cybercom in sweden will reduce its environmental impact through this
  type of service. cybercom’s sales force will continue to develop and provide information about services
  that also contribute to reduced negative environmental impact for the customer, such as hosting of
  customers’ servers.




  employees and the workplace
  goal: measuring employee perspective of cybercom
  implementing a group-wide employee survey to capture how employees feel, develop and perceive
  cybercom as a workplace in any country where we operate.
  outcome: cybercom’s first group-wide employee survey has been conducted, with the overall result
  that cybercom is just below the average for companies that have carried out a similar staff survey
  through research firm zondera.
  development: cybercom aims to improve the result in the employee survey in 2012 including skills
  development and career planning.

  customers and suppliers
  goal: improving customer satisfaction
  implementing a group-wide customer satisfaction survey to find out what customers think of cybercom
  and what the company can improve in relation to them.
  outcome: cybercom’s rating is slightly above the average for other companies that used research
  firm innolink’s customer satisfaction survey. 99 percent of cybercom’s customers would recommend the
  company to their colleagues.
  development: in 2012, cybercom continue working with the precision of its delivery and to better
  meet customer expectations.




  community involvement
  goal: improving circumstances for children in developing countries
  developing cooperation with sos children’s villages.
  outcome: in 2011, cybercom was one of the companies that represented sos in almedalen.
  cybercom’s staff made an additional collection for books and computers for sos children’s villages.
  development: informing employees about more approaches to support the children helped by
  sos children’s villages.


  goal: improving circumstances for children in the nordics
  encouraging employees to acquire a payment card that cybercom developed with the swedish
  childhood­cancer foundation, where sek135 per card goes to the foundation.
  outcome: in 2011, the swedish childhood cancer foundation received sek 75,000 through
  ­employees’ credit card purchases.
  at the end of 2011, 551 employees had this card.
  development: continuing to promote the card among our staff in order to increase the funds raised
  for the foundation. start similar cooperation in our other operating countries for community engage-
  ment.

stakeholder interview with
second ap fund




one of cybercom’s major shareholders
is the second ap fund. the shareholder
representative for this government pension
fund, christina olivecrona, is also a sustain-
ability analyst therefore also makes her
assessments from a sustainability perspective.
for this reason, cybercom thought it would
be interesting to interview christina to get
a better understanding of our stakeholders’
views on our sustainability performance.


what does sustainability mean
to you as a shareholder?
the second ap fund believes that companies can
generate attractive returns by taking into account
sustainability issues. we therefore think it is positive
that companies such as cybercom are identifying and
working with the opportunities and risks in the area of
sustainability.

cybercom’s code of conduct in brief


  cybercom’s code of conduct is based on the un global compact principles on human rights,
  labor, environment and anti-corruption. the code is for the employees. in 2012, cybercom also
  intends to adapt the code to the company’s suppliers. one of cybercom’s goals in 2012 is that the
  company’s suppliers are to meet cybercom’s code of conduct.

  all cybercom employees are responsible for acting in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
  they are responsible for gaining knowledge of the local conditions in the places where cybercom oper-
  ates. in the event of an individual issue demanding it, they will seek legal advice.

  cybercom follows the agreements for this listing and undertakes to provide relevant knowledge to all em-
  ployees concerned. cybercom must present and report financial and corporate information in compliance
  with the provisions laid down in national legislation, stock-exchange listing requirements and international

  cybercom does not tolerate any forms of discrimination. all employees have equal rights and must never
  be subjected to unjust treatment due to gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin or disability. all emplo-
  yees must show respect for each other and for cybercom’s business partners and will take responsibility
  for combating discrimination. cybercom works unabatedly to combat discrimination. this permeates
  the company’s policies and processes during, for example, recruitment, setting of wage rates, and skills
  enhancement.
  cybercom offers salaries that comply with the minimum wage, as laid down in national legislation, with
  correctly prepared employment contracts. cybercom also ensures that working hours are not unreasonable
  and are at minimum compliant with national legislation. cybercom seeks to give all employees time for
  rest with economic compensation.
  cybercom shall not in any way utilise forced labour and will always ensure that the working relationship
  between employee and organisation is at the employee’s own free will.

  standards. cybercom works proactively to prevent accidents and work-related illnesses. all employees are

the un global compact’s 10 principles


  at the world economic forum in davos in 1999, the un’s secretary general, kofi
  annan, challenged the business community to take global responsibility. the secre-
  tary general’s initiative led to the formation of the global compact, which includes
  principles of human rights, labour rights, environment issues and corruption in
  business. the principles are based on the un declaration of human rights, the ilo
  core conventions on human rights in the workplace, the rio declaration and the un
  convention against corruption.
