                               that’s why we’ve been contemplating easy-to-use design for over 30 years,
                             delivering products and creating spaces that are safe, comfortable and fun for all
                             ages and regardless of physical mobility.
                               the specialized toto universal design research center promotes human
                             research and pursues new heights in user-friendliness every day.
                               this is what toto refers to as universal design.

                               this inevitably has an impact on the environment, both positive and negative.
                               while ensuring a comfortable living environment, toto aims to protect the
                             natural environment as well.
                               for that reason, development focuses on water-conserving and energy-saving
                             products, as well as environmental technologies, such as photocatalyst

                               toto has set its own targets for reduction of environmental loads in all
                             business activities from production to logistics and sales.

management training for our managers and supervisors as part of our line-care. with regarding
health promotion, toto implements various health promotion programs, such as walking
