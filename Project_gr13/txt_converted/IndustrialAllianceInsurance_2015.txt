report

                      invested in you,
                      through sustainable
                      development
                      it is with great pleasure that we present to you the ia financial group 2014 social
                      responsibility report. you may remark that this report, which was previously included
                      as part of our annual report, is now being released as a separate publication. the
                      reason for this is very simple: we have so many positive things to share with our
                      clients, partners and investors with respect to social responsibility that we have
                      decided to create a full-fledged document to cover this topic, which is increasingly
                      part of our lives and our way of doing things as a company.
                      in the following pages you will note that at ia financial group, no matter which area
                      of sustainable development we’re talking about, our goal is to put our values into
                      action on a day-to-day basis through engagement. just as these values guide us
                      in our business objectives, they also motivate our approach to contributing to the
                      economy, supporting communities and protecting the environment.
                      in this way, we want to not only set an example as a company, but also to encourage
                      the initiative of each of our employees. it is the ideas, commitment and engagement
                      of us all that will push us forward together toward a sustainable world.

soundly managing our investments
our guiding principle in managing our investments
is to do so with prudence and discipline, always
keeping a long-term perspective.
we have developed a global vision for the control
and monitoring of our various investment risks
(interest rate, stock market, foreign exchange,
credit, liquidity, etc.). in addition to analyzing and
quantifying these risks, we have implemented
strategies that enable us to effectively manage them.
