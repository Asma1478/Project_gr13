goodman’s values centre around respect, appreciating each
other’s contribution, recognising differences between people,
working as a team, demonstrating drive and determination,
being customer focused and innovative, but all against a
context of being honest, fair and clear with one another. how
an employee demonstrates these behaviours is now part of the
performance review process and we have made sure that our
expectations are clearly displayed and referred to in actions
and words.
improved performance management
the effectiveness of our performance management system to
assess employees’ performance against their objectives was
also upgraded and improved during the year. employees were
strongly encouraged to outline their career aspirations and
create plans to achieve them. the usage of the performance
management platform has been greater than before, as a
better process means better outcomes for employees. in
2017, we plan to link a wider talent management platform to
the performance management platform. the values represent
a portion of the overall review to reinforce their importance.

statutory profit
goodman’s statutory profit attributable to securityholders for fy16 is $1,274.6 million, an increase of $66.6 million compared
with the prior year. the items that reconcile goodman’s operating profit to the statutory profit include net property valuation
gains and intangible asset impairments, net gains/ losses from the fair value movements on derivative financial instruments and
unrealised foreign exchange movements on interest bearing liabilities and other non-cash adjustments or non-recurring items,
which mainly relate to goodman’s long term incentive plan (ltip), profit on disposal of investment properties and the transfer of
currency losses from the foreign currency translation reserve to the income statement on the restructure of the brazil operations
(refer to note 21).

risks
goodman identifies operational risks for each of its divisions as part of its strategy process. the key risks, an assessment of their
likelihood of occurrence and consequences and controls that are in place to mitigate the risks are reported to the board annually.
goodman has established formal systems and processes in order that the risks are managed at each stage of its decision
making process. this is facilitated by a group investment committee comprising senior executives, chaired by the group chief
executive officer, which considers all major operational decisions and transactions. the group investment committee meets on
a weekly basis.
the board has in place a risk and compliance committee to review and monitor all material risks in goodman’s risk management
systems, including sustainability risks, work, health and safety, market risks and operational risks.
the key risks faced by goodman and the controls that have been established to manage those risks are set out below:

short-term incentive
financial targets
financial targets include operating eps, return on assets, net tangible assets per security and gearing across the
consolidated entity.
however, sti awards to executives are dependent on goodman achieving an operating eps target. the board considers that
operating eps measures the direct contribution of executives to the financial performance of goodman. strong performance
in operating eps generally correlates with stronger returns to securityholders and, subject to market factors and conditions,
security price increases.
the operating profit target is set at the start of the financial year with reference to appropriate returns for goodman’s business
segments, having regard to the stage of the property cycle, general economic conditions and growing the business in a
prudent manner.
non-financial targets
non-financial targets include execution of strategic initiatives which position goodman for future sustainable growth,
implementation of business process improvement initiatives and appropriate compliance and risk management controls.
in addition to the above, the performance of executives against behavioural expectations outlined within goodman’s corporate
values has been considered in the determination of remuneration outcomes. the board considers that executives should
demonstrate high standards of personal behaviour that are consistent with these values and therefore places emphasis upon
these characteristics.
discretionary nature of award
the board recognises that expertise within goodman can lead to exceptional individual and divisional performance within a
specific financial year and accordingly retains discretion on the determination and payment of sti awards for executives, even
where goodman’s financial metrics may not have been met or other adverse circumstances occur. conversely, awards of sti
may be withheld notwithstanding that targets may have been met.

                                   other key aspects of executive’s remuneration continued
long-term incentive
the ltip was last approved by securityholders in 2015. there have been no alterations or modifications to prior year awards
under the ltip.
performance hurdles
the ltip incorporates both an operating eps and a relative tsr hurdle.
the operating eps hurdle, which applies to 75% of each award, requires that the actual operating eps over a three year period
meets the cumulative target set by the board. the target for each financial year is the same as that used for the purpose of the
sti and is set at the start of each financial year.
in determining operating eps, the share based payments expense is excluded from operating profit as the performance rights
are generally settled through the issue of new securities, and those performance rights which as at the start of the financial
year have achieved the required performance hurdles but have not yet vested are included in the weighted average number of
securities, reflecting the future dilution impact on securityholders. for fy16, the 1,781.2 million weighted average securities
used in calculating operating eps, includes securities that have vested during the year plus 10.9 million securities which have
achieved the required performance hurdles and will vest in september 2016 and september 2017.
the method for calculating the operating eps has been applied consistently throughout the period in which the ltip has been
in place and the methodology is used for setting the target and financial performance forecast at the commencement of each
financial year.
the relative tsr hurdle, which applies to 25% of each award, is based on the relative tsr of goodman against that of other
s&p/asx 100 entities over a three year period.
vesting
the operating eps performance hurdle will be satisfied in full when the cumulative operating eps over three consecutive
financial years meets or exceeds the target set by the board. if the cumulative target is not met, then there is nil vesting against
this hurdle. the board believes that it would currently be inconsistent with securityholders’ expectations for there to be partial
satisfaction of the hurdle where the target operating eps had not been met.
the relative tsr performance hurdle operates over a range of outcomes such that where goodman’s performance is:
+ from the 1st to 50th percentile, there is no vesting;
+ from the 51st percentile (i.e. above-average performance), there is 50% vesting, with an additional 2% vesting for each
  additional percentile rank to the 76th percentile; and
+ from the 76th percentile and above, there is 100% vesting.
partial vesting against this hurdle only commences once above-average returns are achieved. the board considers the
s&p/asx 100 index is the most appropriate comparator group given that:
+ goodman is ranked by market capitalisation within the top 100 asx listed entities;
+ goodman competes for investment capital against the top 100 asx listed entities; and
+ the comparator group is sufficiently broad to include a sample of businesses with geographic diversity and business
   complexity.
vesting of all performance rights is contingent on executives remaining employed by goodman at the relevant vesting dates
at the end of years three, four and five. as a result, in order to derive the full benefits of an award, an executive must remain
employed over a five year vesting period.
hedging of unvested performance rights
the board’s policy set out in the securities trading policy is that executives may not enter into any arrangement to limit their
exposure to risk in relation to unvested performance rights, options or securities issued under an employee incentive plan.
in accordance with their terms of employment, executives are required to comply with goodman’s policies.

1. the tsr (sourced from bloomberg) is based on the distributions paid to securityholders and the security price movement during each financial year
   and assumes securityholders reinvested distributions. the calculated tsr is compared to the tsr of other entities in the s&p/asx 100 index (s&p/
   asx 200 index for grants made in 2013 and prior financial years) for the purpose of determining the relative tsr performance hurdle under the ltip.

 the use of at risk remuneration that incorporates a strong focus on continued improvement in operating eps over the long term
 has driven decision making that aims at sustainable 6% operating earnings growth. this has benefited securityholders through
 the increasing distributions and security price which together have resulted in an average 19.8% per annum total securityholder
 return over the last five years.
 group chief executive officer remuneration
 the non-statutory analysis below sets out the group chief executive officer’s cash remuneration in each of the past five
 financial years. this includes the base pay and cash bonus (sti) that relate to each financial year plus the value of the
 performance rights (lti) that vested during the financial year. this value of performance rights is determined by multiplying the
 number of securities that vested by the market price of the securities at the date of vesting. this is different from the statutory
 presentation of remuneration included on page 35, where the values of the performance rights are determined using option
 pricing models at the date the award is made and then amortised over the vesting periods.

 over the five year period, the level of sti has generally been at the upper end of the bonus range in line with the operational
 achievements. however, in fy16 the group chief executive officer has not received any sti but instead will receive all his
 incentive based remuneration in the form of at risk lti, with the relevant award of performance rights to be made in fy17.
 in respect of the vested lti, $5.2 million (2015: $4.6 million) of performance rights vested during fy16, based on the mid-market
 price of a goodman security of $5.96 at the vesting date on 1 september 2015. the increase in the cash value of the lti is due
 to both an increase in the number of performance rights awarded and the increase in the goodman security price, reflecting the
 consistently strong performance over the past five years.
 short-term incentive awards to executives
 sti awards are made to executives based on their performance and contribution to the business during the financial year,
 including the achievement of agreed performance targets and strategic initiatives that relate to both financial and non-
 financial criteria for their business units, other parts of the business and goodman as a whole. specialisation exists within the
 management structure; however, overall success is heavily dependent upon the input from other regions and the group function.
 goodman’s integrated business model means that achievements are often a product of collective effort.
 for fy16, the committee considered that the performance of the executives in relation to various strategic initiatives
 represented an overall performance that achieved the agreed performance targets and sti awards for the executives are
 towards the upper end of the cash bonus range.

long-term incentive awards to executives
while executives are awarded performance rights (under the ltip) in recognition of current performance, vesting is dependent
on the achievement of cumulative operating eps and/or relative tsr performance hurdles accrued over a three year period as
well as continued employment at the time of vesting of each tranche at the end of years three, four and five.
proposed awards of performance rights in fy17
the awards of performance rights that the board intends to make in fy17 with regard to the executives’ performance in fy16
are set out below. these proposed awards are not reflected in the current year statutory or non-statutory remuneration tables as

based on the achievement of the performance hurdles, 94.5% of the fy14 performance rights will vest into goodman securities,
subject to meeting the employment conditions, and will be delivered to executives in three tranches on an annual basis
commencing from september 2016. executives must remain employed on each of the three vesting dates in september 2016,
2017 and 2018 respectively for the performance rights to vest.
2015 and 2016 ltip grants
for the grants made in fy15 and fy16, the performance periods run to 30 june 2017 and 30 june 2018 respectively. for both
grants, the operating eps hurdles have been met or exceeded to date and relative tsr hurdles are on track to be partially
achieved. however, the performance hurdles for both grants will need to be assessed over the full three year performance
periods to determine whether they are satisfied.
the movements in the number of performance rights during fy16 are summarised as follows:

 key elements of non-           + the policy is structured to ensure independence of judgement in the performance of their duties.
 executive director             + non-executive directors receive fixed fees for being on the board and additional fees for
 remuneration policy               membership of committees.
                                + the fees take into account the size and scope of goodman’s activities and the responsibilities and
                                   experience of the directors. periodically, these fees are benchmarked against data for comparable
                                   entities provided by external advisers.
                                + as approved by securityholders at the 2006 annual general meeting, total remuneration (including
                                   superannuation) payable by goodman to all non-executive directors in aggregate must not exceed
                                   $2.5 million per annum. for the current financial year, total non-executive directors’ remuneration
                                   was $2.1 million.
                                + the increase in non-executive director fees compared to the prior financial year is due to the 5%
                                   increase in both base fees and board committee fees from 1 july 2015.
                                + non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any sti or lti schemes which may
                                   otherwise be perceived to create a bias when overseeing executive decision making.
                                + the board has a policy, set out in the directors’ securities acquisition plan, for non-executive
                                   directors to accumulate a significant long-term holding of goodman securities so that they have an
                                   alignment of interests with those of securityholders. under the policy, each non-executive director
                                   is required to acquire securities such that their holding is equal in value to twice their annual base
                                   fees. the value of securities for this purpose equals the higher of purchase cost or market value at
                                   the end of each financial year. this holding may be acquired at any time but where not held at the
                                   beginning of a financial year, the policy is for 25% of base fees (net of tax) during the financial year
                                   to be applied to the on-market purchase of securities.

notes in relation to the table analysis of performance rights over goodman securities
1. the fair value is determined at grant date and calculated using a combination of the standard black scholes model with a
   continuous dividend/distribution yield and a monte carlo model which simulated total returns for each of the s&p/asx 100
   entities, and discounted the future value of any potential future vesting performance rights to arrive at a present value.
2. as performance rights have an exercise price of $nil, goodman securities are automatically issued to employees when the
   performance rights vest. accordingly, the percentage of performance rights that vested during the financial year equals the
   percentage of securities issued during the financial year.
3. the value of performance rights vested is calculated using the closing price on the asx of $5.96 on 1 september 2015, the day
   the performance rights vested.
4. as goodman securities are automatically issued to employees when the performance rights vest, the expiry date is deemed to
   be the vesting date.

3. profit per security
basic profit per security is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the securityholders by the weighted average
number of securities outstanding during the year. diluted profit per security is determined by adjusting the profit or loss
attributable to the securityholders and weighted average number of securities outstanding for all dilutive potential securities,
which comprise performance rights issued under the ltip and securities contingently issuable on conversion of hybrid securities.
under australian accounting standards, the issued units of git and the cdis over the shares of glhk are presented as non-
controlling interests and as a consequence the directors are also required to present a profit per share and a diluted profit
per share based on goodman limited’s profit attributable to the shareholders, which excludes the profit attributable to git
and glhk.
details of these calculations are set out below:

5. income tax
income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity,
in which case it is recognised in equity.
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the financial year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous financial years.
deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. the following temporary differences are not accounted for:
+ goodwill;
+ the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit; and
+ differences relating to investments in controlled entities to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities. deferred tax assets or liabilities in respect of investment properties held at fair value are calculated on
the presumption that the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through sale. a deferred tax asset is
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
additional income taxes that arise from dividends/distributions are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related
dividends/distributions.
git
under current australian income tax legislation, git is not liable for income tax, including capital gains tax, provided that
securityholders are presently entitled to the distributable income of git as calculated for trust law purposes. tax allowances
for building and plant and equipment depreciation are distributed to securityholders in the form of tax deferred components
of distributions. any taxable capital gains are distributed.

 values of the developments in the feasibility studies are based
 on assumptions to determine capitalisation rates, letting up
 periods and incentives that are consistent with those observed
 in the relevant market adjusted for a profit and risk factor. this
 profit and risk factor will vary depending on the nature, location
 and size of the development but is generally in a market range
 of 10% to 15%.
 this practice of determining fair value by reference to the
 development feasibility is generally also applied for goodman’s
 investments in managed partnerships. however, certain
 partnerships do obtain independent valuations for investment
 properties under development each financial year.

other information regarding directly held investment properties
the fair value measurement approach for directly held investment properties has been categorised as a level 3 fair value
based on the inputs to the valuation method used (see notes 1(g) and 6(c)). the majority of goodman’s directly held investment
properties are in australia and the valuation technique used in measuring the fair value, as well as the values assumed for the
significant unobservable inputs, are summarised in the table below:
valuation technique                significant unobservable input                                                 2016              2015
income capitalisation              range of net market rents (per square metre per annum)                  $40 to $300       $42 to $300
                                   capitalisation rate (weighted average)                                       6.70%             7.30%
the estimated fair value would increase if net market rents were higher and/or if capitalisation rates were lower. the estimated fair
value would decrease if the net market rents were lower and/or if the capitalisation rates were higher.
in addition there are assets in sydney, nsw that have been rezoned for residential mixed use. certain of these sites have
seen significant value uplifts as a result of the change in zoning, with the valuations of these sites determined by reference to
comparable sales data, as summarised in the table below:

(f) investments accounted for using the equity method
investments accounted for using the equity method comprise associates and jvs, which are collectively referred to as managed
partnerships.
associates
an associate is an entity in which the consolidated entity exercises significant influence but not control over its financial and
operating policies. in the consolidated financial statements, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
investments in associates are carried at the lower of the equity accounted amount and recoverable amount. under this method,
the consolidated entity’s share of post-acquisition gains or losses of associates is recognised in the consolidated income
statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in consolidated reserves. cumulative post-
acquisition movements in both profit or loss and reserves are adjusted against the cost of the investment.
jvs
a jv is an arrangement in which the consolidated entity has joint control, whereby the consolidated entity has rights to the net
assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. in the consolidated financial statements,
investments in jvs are accounted for using the equity method. investments in jvs are carried at the lower of the equity accounted
amount and recoverable amount. the consolidated entity’s share of the jvs’ net profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement from the date joint control commences to the date joint control ceases. movements in reserves are recognised
directly in the consolidated reserves.
transactions eliminated on consolidation
unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and jvs, including those relating to contributions of non-monetary
assets on establishment, are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entity’s interest. unrealised gains relating to associates
and jvs are eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment. unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains, unless they evidence an impairment of an asset.

 aum
 for continental europe – logistics, the average annual increase in aum of 8.0% (2015: 8.1%) over the forecast period is broadly
 consistent with the prior year forecasts and is a result of the ongoing development activity, albeit this is partly offset by the
 selective rotation of assets. for the purpose of the forecasts, capitalisation rates are expected to be stable over the period.
 for united kingdom – logistics, the forecasts assume that over the next five years, the division will increase its aum from
 £100 million to approximately £815 million, as gukp draws down committed equity from its investors to fund the expected
 development activity. for the purpose of the forecasts, capitalisation rates are expected to be stable over the period.
 performance fees
 investment management performance fee revenue has been excluded from the cash flow forecasts used to assess the value
 in use.
 operating expenses
 operating expenses in continental europe – logistics and united kingdom – logistics are forecast to increase over the forecast
 period by an average of 3.0% per annum and 0.8% per annum respectively as the divisions increase aum.

 long-term growth rates have been used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the five year forecast.
 for continental europe, the growth rate has been estimated using the weighted average (based on value of aum) of the current
 consumer price index for each of the countries in which the division operates. the decrease compared to the prior year reflects
 the low growth environment across the eurozone. for the united kingdom, the growth rate is based on an average of the
 consumer price index over the past five years, and similarly has declined over the past year.
 the forecast cost of developments in year five represents the estimated total funding requirements for both directly held
 developments and developments within managed partnerships. the cost of developments in australian dollars has remained
 relatively stable.

 capital management
 11. net finance expense
 finance income
 interest is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method, and, if not received at balance date,
 is reflected in the statement of financial position as a receivable.
 finance expense
 expenditure incurred in obtaining debt finance is offset against the principal amount of the interest bearing liability to which
 it relates, and is recognised as a finance cost on an effective interest rate basis over the life of the facility or until the facility
 is significantly modified. where a facility is significantly modified, any unamortised expenditure in relation to that facility and
 incremental expenditure incurred in modifying the facility are recognised as a finance cost in the financial year in which the
 significant modification occurs.
 finance costs relating to a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset using a weighted average cost of debt.
 qualifying assets are assets which take a substantial time to get ready for their intended use or sale. all other finance costs are
 expensed using the effective interest rate method.

is secured by a property asset and are non-recourse to the consolidated entity. as at 30 june 2016, the balance drawn is
a$94.6 million (brl 224.1 million) denominated in brazilian real. the notes expire on 9 august 2030 with ongoing monthly
repayments of both capital and interest. interest on the notes is accruing at a rate (plus margin) equivalent to that on the brazilian
government’s treasury bonds (also known as ntn-b) that were of similar duration at the time of issuing the notes. the interest on
the notes and the rental income earned by the secured property asset are both inflation linked.

capital management
the consolidated entity’s principal capital management
objectives are to maintain a strong capital base and provide
funds for operating activities (including development
expenditure), capital expenditure and investment opportunities
as they arise. this is achieved through an appropriate mix of
debt, equity and hybrid instruments.
the consolidated entity is able to alter the capital mix by
issuing new goodman securities or hybrid securities, through
the operation of a distribution reinvestment plan, adjusting
the timing of development and capital expenditure and selling
assets to reduce borrowings. goodman also manages capital
through its distribution policy in which distributions made
to securityholders are based on the greater of 60% of the
consolidated entity’s operating profit or taxable income of git.

at 30 june 2016, goodman’s notes issued in the united states 144a/reg s bond market and also foreign private placements
denominated in japanese yen create both an interest rate and a foreign currency risk exposure. goodman’s policy is to minimise
its exposure to both interest rate and exchange rate movements. accordingly, goodman has entered into both usd/eur and
usd/gbp ccirs, to provide a capital hedge against assets denominated in euros and british pounds sterling. details of these
ccirs are set out below:

sensitivity analysis
throughout the financial year, if the australian dollar had been 5% (2015: 5%) stronger against all other currencies, with all
other variables held constant, the profit attributable to securityholders, excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised
foreign exchange movements, would have decreased by a$21.9 million (2015: a$12.6 million decrease). if the australian dollar
had been 5% (2015: 5%) weaker against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, the profit attributable to
securityholders, excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised foreign exchange movements, would have increased by
a$21.9 million (2015: a$12.6 million increase).

 interest rate risk
 goodman’s interest rate risk arises from variable rate borrowings and also fixed rate to floating rate ccirs that hedge the
 currency risk associated with the usd denominated notes. the consolidated entity adopts a policy of ensuring that between
 60% and 100% of its current year exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis. the consolidated
 entity enters into interest rate swaps (irs) to manage cash flow risks associated with the interest rates on borrowings that are
 floating. the irs contracts are for 90 day intervals and involve quarterly payments or receipts of the net amount of interest.
 as at 30 june 2016, the consolidated entity’s interest rate risk exposure based on existing interest bearing liabilities and derivative
 financial instruments is set out below:
                                                                              interest bearing              impact of derivatives           net interest

 sensitivity analysis
 based on the consolidated entity’s interest bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments at 30 june 2016, if interest rates
 on borrowings had been 100 basis points per annum (2015: 100 basis points per annum) higher/lower, with all other variables
 held constant, the consolidated entity’s profit attributable to securityholders for the financial year would have been a$5.6 million
 lower/higher (2015: a$7.7 million).
 price risk
 the consolidated entity is not materially exposed to price risk.

 (b) liquidity risk
 liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
 the consolidated entity’s objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund working capital, capital expenditure, investment
 opportunities, debt expiries and distributions. this is achieved through the monthly preparation of a three year cash flow forecast
 to understand the uses of funds and to identify potential shortfalls in funding. this allows the consolidated entity to plan for
 renewal of debt facilities, negotiation of new debt facilities, new issues of securities, including the distribution reinvestment plan,
 and other potential sources of funding.
 goodman’s treasury function is responsible for reporting details of all debt maturities to the board at its regular meetings.
 goodman’s treasury function is also responsible for reporting to the board all the information and term sheets relating to
 any financing arrangements being contemplated or negotiated by the consolidated entity, for its review and approval.
 the consolidated entity seeks to spread its debt maturities such that the total debt maturing in a single financial year
 does not exceed board approved policy levels.
 the contractual maturities of financial liabilities are set out below:

 notes to the consolidated financial statements
 continued



 capital management continued
 14. financial risk management continued
 (c) credit risk
 credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to perform as contracted.
 the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets, excluding investments, of the consolidated entity which have been
 recognised on the statement of financial position, is the carrying amount.
 the consolidated entity has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of all potential customers and is not materially exposed
 to any one customer. the consolidated entity evaluates all customers’ perceived credit risk and may require the lodgement of
 rental bonds or bank guarantees, as appropriate, to reduce credit risk. in addition, all rents are payable monthly in advance.
 the consolidated entity minimises credit risk by dealing with major financial institutions in relation to cash and short-term
 borrowings. concentration of credit risk exists from time to time on receivables for the proceeds of disposals of investment
 properties. the credit risk is minimised as legal title is only transferred upon receipt of proceeds for the sale of those assets and
 typically goodman will have either received a cash deposit or be the beneficiary of a bank guarantee for 10% to 20% of the total
 proceeds.
 from time to time, the consolidated entity also makes loans to managed partnerships, typically to fund development projects.
 in making its investment decisions, the consolidated entity will undertake a detailed assessment of the development feasibility
 and credit risks associated with the relevant counterparties.
 the credit risks associated with financial instruments are managed by:
 + transacting with multiple derivatives counterparties that have a long-term investment credit rating; and
 + utilising international swaps and derivatives association (isda) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit
   exposure to credit risk through netting of amounts receivable and amounts payable to individual counterparties (refer below).
 master netting or similar agreements
 the consolidated entity enters into derivative transactions under isda master netting off agreements. under these agreements,
 where certain credit events occur (such as a default), all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated and a single
 net termination value is payable in full and final settlement.
 as the consolidated entity does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset, the fair values associated with derivative
 financial instruments have been presented gross in the statement of financial position. however, if a credit event occurred, the
 isda master netting off agreement would allow a$124.1 million (2015: a$144.5 million) of financial assets and financial liabilities
 in relation to the consolidated entity’s derivative financial instruments to be offset.

there were no transfers between the levels during the year.
valuation techniques used to derive level 2 and level 3 fair values
the level 2 derivative financial instruments held by the consolidated entity consist of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest
rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined using generally accepted pricing models which discount
estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and current market interest rates and/or foreign
currency rates, adjusted for specific features of the instruments.
15. dividends and distributions
distributions are recognised when they are declared by the distributing entities and before deduction of any withholding tax.
any non-recoverable withholding tax is included in income tax.
(a) dividends declared by the company

(b) share based payments
share based payment transactions
the fair value of performance rights over securities at the grant date is expensed with a corresponding increase in the employee
compensation reserve. the share based payments expense is calculated over the period to the vesting date and is adjusted to
reflect the actual number of performance rights for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected
to be met. the accumulated share based payments expense of performance rights which have vested or lapsed is transferred
from the employee compensation reserve to (accumulated losses)/retained earnings. the fair values of performance rights are
measured at grant date using a combination of black scholes pricing models and monte carlo simulations.
at 30 june 2016, the consolidated entity had two share based payment schemes, the ltip and the gtep. in addition, a specific
long-term incentive plan exists for goodman’s employees in new zealand. details of these schemes are set out below:
ltip
performance rights issued under the ltip entitle an employee to either acquire goodman securities for $nil consideration
or, in certain jurisdictions, to receive an amount in cash equal to the value of the securities, subject to the vesting conditions
having been satisfied. further details regarding the vesting conditions are included in the remuneration report section of the
directors’ report.
the movement in the number of equity settled and cash settled performance rights under the ltip was as follows:

the fair value of services received in return for performance rights granted under the ltip is measured by reference to the fair
value of the performance rights granted. the estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured as follows:
+ operating eps tranche: these rights have been valued as a granted call option, using the standard black scholes model with
  a continuous dividend/distribution yield; and
+ relative tsr tranche: these rights have been valued using a monte carlo model which simulated total returns for each of the
  asx 100 stocks, and discounted the future value of any potential future vesting performance rights to arrive at a present value.
  the model uses statistical analysis to forecast total returns, based on expected parameters of variance and co-variance.
at 30 june 2016, a liability of $16.0 million (2015: $11.6 million) was recognised in relation to cash settled performance rights.
gtep
under the gtep, a number of australian based employees are also offered up to $1,000 annually of restricted securities.
the intention of the gtep is to broaden employee alignment with securityholders. under tax legislation, employees with
adjusted taxable income of less than $180,000 per annum are not subject to income tax when these restricted securities
are granted. this tax exemption requires that there be no forfeiture conditions and that participating employees be restricted
from dealing with the securities for three years.
goodman’s new zealand long term incentive plan
under goodman’s new zealand long term incentive plan, employees receive approximately half of their lti in the form of
performance rights over gmt units that vest subject to meeting performance hurdles based on the achievement of distributable
earnings targets by gmt and the relative total unitholder return from holding gmt units compared to other nzx property vehicles.
on vesting, delivery of units in gmt will be made from units held by the consolidated entity or acquired on market.

 20. other non-controlling interests
 goodman issued hybrid securities in goodman plus trust, a controlled entity of git, that meet the definition of equity for the
 purpose of the consolidated entity. the hybrid securities are preferred, perpetual non-call securities which are listed on the asx.
 goodman plus trust pays, at its discretion, distributions at a market rate plus a margin. the hybrid securities may be exchanged
 or repurchased in certain circumstances. accordingly, these hybrid securities have been classified as equity and presented
 as other non-controlling interests. incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of hybrid securities are recognised as a
 deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
 for the year ended 30 june 2016, the movement in goodman plus was as follows:
                                                                                                                                      consolidated

 results for the year
 2. profit before income tax
 gross property income
 gross property income comprises rental income entitlements under operating leases, net of incentives provided, plus
 recoverable outgoings.
 rental income entitlements under operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contract.
 where operating lease rental income is recognised relating to fixed increases in rentals in future years, an asset is recognised. this
 asset is a component of the relevant investment property carrying amount. the cost of lease incentives provided to customers is
 recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease as a reduction of gross property income.
 recoverable outgoings are recognised as income when the relevant outgoings are recorded as an expense.
 disposal of inventories
 the disposal of inventories is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. the gain or
 loss on disposal of inventories is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset at the time of disposal
 and the proceeds on disposal (less transaction costs and any provision for future rental guarantees) and is included in the income
 statement in the period of disposal.
 disposal of investment properties
 the disposal of an investment property is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
 the gain or loss on disposal of investment properties is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the property
 at the time of the disposal and the proceeds on disposal (less transaction costs and any provision for future rental guarantees) and
 is included in the income statement in the period of disposal. any previously unrealised valuation gains or losses are transferred
 from the asset revaluation reserve to accumulated losses/retained earnings.

3. segment reporting
the consolidated entity reports the results and financial position of its operating segments based on the internal reports regularly
reviewed by the group chief executive officer in order to assess each segment’s performance and to allocate resources to them.
an operating segment is a component of the consolidated entity that engages in business activities from which it may earn
revenues and incur expenses. all operating segments’ operating results are regularly reviewed by the group chief executive
officer to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete
financial information is available.
segment results that are reported to the group chief executive officer include items that are directly attributable to a segment
and the portion that can be allocated to the segment on a reasonable basis. unallocated items include fair value adjustments and
impairments, interest and tax expense, interest bearing receivables and payables, derivative financial instruments, provisions for
distributions to unitholders, provisions for distributions on hybrid securities, corporate assets, head office expenses and income
tax assets and liabilities.
the consolidated entity is based in australia and has divisions in australia, new zealand, asia, continental europe, the united
kingdom and north america.
the activities and services undertaken by the divisions are direct and indirect ownership of investment properties. information

other information regarding directly held investment properties
the fair value measurement approach for directly held investment properties has been categorised as a level 3 fair value based
on the inputs to the valuation technique used (see notes 1(h) and 5(c)). the majority of the consolidated entity’s directly held
investment properties are in australia and the valuation technique used in measuring the fair value, as well as the values assumed
for the significant unobservable inputs, are summarised in the table below:
valuation technique                significant unobservable input                                                 2016              2015
income capitalisation              range of net market rents (per square metre per annum)                  $40 to $300       $42 to $300

the estimated fair value would increase if net market rents were higher and/or if capitalisation rates were lower. the estimated fair
value would decrease if the net market rents were lower and/or if the capitalisation rates were higher.
in addition there are assets in sydney, nsw that have been rezoned for residential mixed use. certain of these sites have seen
significant value uplifts as a result of the change in zoning, with the valuations of these sites determined by reference to comparable
sales data, as summarised in the table below:

(f) investments accounted for using the equity method
investments accounted for using the equity method comprise of associates and jvs, which are collectively referred to by the
consolidated entity as partnerships.
associates
an associate is an entity over which the consolidated entity exercises significant influence but not control over their financial and
operating policies. in the consolidated financial statements, investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
investments in associates are carried at the lower of the equity accounted amount and recoverable amount. under this method,
the consolidated entity’s share of post-acquisition gains or losses of associates is recognised in the consolidated income
statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in consolidated reserves. cumulative post-
acquisition movements in both profit or loss and reserves are adjusted against the cost of the investment.
jvs
a jv is an arrangement in which the consolidated entity has joint control, whereby the consolidated entity has rights to the net
assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. in the consolidated financial statements,
investments in jvs are accounted for using the equity method. investments in jvs are carried at the lower of the equity accounted
amount and recoverable amount. the consolidated entity’s share of the jvs’ net profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated
income statement from the date joint control commences to the date joint control ceases. movements in reserves are recognised
directly in the consolidated reserves.
transactions eliminated on consolidation
unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates and jvs, including those relating to contributions of non-monetary
assets on establishment, are eliminated to the extent of the consolidated entity’s interest. unrealised gains relating to associates
and jvs are eliminated against the carrying amount of the investment. unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains, unless they evidence an impairment of an asset.

notes to the consolidated financial statements

operating assets and liabilities continued
6. receivables
receivables comprise loans to related parties and trade and other receivables and are recognised on the date that they are
originated, initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition, receivables are
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses.
the consolidated entity derecognises a receivable when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the receivable expire or it
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the receivable in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of the receivable are transferred.
impairment
the carrying amounts of receivables is assessed at each balance date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
if such indication exists, the receivable is written down to the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the
original effective interest rate. the impairment is recognised in profit or loss in the reporting period in which it occurs.
calculation of recoverable amount
the recoverable amount of the consolidated entity’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of
estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial
recognition of these financial assets). receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
impairment of receivables is not recognised until objective evidence is available that a loss event has occurred. significant
receivables are individually assessed for impairment.
reversals of impairment
impairment losses are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been
a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount.

loans to related parties
the consolidated entity’s loans to related parties principally relate to loans to gl, glhk and their controlled entities and loans
to associates and jvs. the interest rates on loans to related parties were 1.3% to 9.1% per annum (2015: 1.1% to 10.1%
per annum). during the current financial year, the consolidated entity reversed impairment losses of $202.3 million previously
recognised on loans to gl as there is no longer any indication that the debt will not be recoverable.

 trade and other payables are recognised initially on the trade date at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
 subsequent to initial recognition, trade and other payables are measured at amortised cost.
 the consolidated entity derecognises trade and other payables when the contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled
 or expire.
 financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when,
 the consolidated entity has legal right to offset the amounts and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and

 8. net finance income/(expense)
 finance income
 income from the provision of loan facilities including establishment fees, line fees and interest income is recognised over the
 relevant service period on an effective interest rate method, and, if not received at balance date, is reflected in the statement of
 financial position as a receivable.
 finance costs
 expenditure incurred in obtaining debt finance is offset against the principal amount of the interest bearing liability to which
 it relates, and is recognised as a finance cost on an effective interest rate basis over the life of the facility or until the facility
 is significantly modified. where a facility is significantly modified, any unamortised expenditure in relation to that facility and
 incremental expenditure incurred in modifying the facility are recognised as a finance cost in the year in which the significant
 modification occurs.
 finance costs relating to a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset using a weighted average cost of debt.
 qualifying assets are assets which take a substantial time to get ready for their intended use or sale. all other finance costs are
 expensed using the effective interest rate method.

 rate risks arising from operating, investing and financing activities. in accordance with its treasury policy, the consolidated entity

 accounting purposes. the consolidated entity’s share of the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives in

sensitivity analysis
throughout the financial year, if the australian dollar had been 5% (2015: 5%) stronger against all other currencies, with all
other variables held constant, the profit attributable to unitholders, excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised foreign
exchange movements, would have decreased by a$18.6 million (2015: a$4.5 million decrease). if the australian dollar had been
5% (2015: 5%) weaker against all other currencies, with all other variables held constant, the profit attributable to unitholders,
excluding derivative mark to market and unrealised foreign exchange movements, would have increased by a$18.6 million
(2015: a$4.5 million increase).
interest rate risk
the consolidated entity’s interest rate risk arises from variable rate borrowings and also fixed rate to floating rate ccirs that
hedge the currency risk associated with the usd denominated notes and jpy denominated private placement. the consolidated
entity adopts a policy of ensuring that between 60% and 100% of its current year exposure to changes in interest rates on
borrowings is on a fixed rate basis. the consolidated entity enters into interest rate swaps (irs) to manage cash flow risks
associated with the interest rates on borrowings that are floating. the irs contracts are for 90 day intervals and involve quarterly
payments or receipts of the net amount of interest.

 sensitivity analysis
 based on the consolidated entity’s net interest rate exposure at 30 june 2016, if interest rates on borrowings had been 100 basis
 points per annum (2015: 100 basis points per annum) higher/lower, with all other variables held constant, the consolidated entity’s
 profit attributable to unitholders for the financial year would have been a$2.7 million lower/higher (2015: a$6.7 million).
 price risk
 the consolidated entity is not materially exposed to price risk.
 (b) liquidity risk
 liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the
 consolidated entity’s objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund working capital, capital expenditure, investment
 opportunities, debt expiries and distributions. this is achieved through the monthly preparation of a three year cash flow forecast
 to understand the uses of funds and to identify potential shortfalls in funding. this allows the consolidated entity to plan for
 renewal of debt facilities, negotiation of new debt facilities, new issues of securities, including the drp, and other potential
 sources of funding.
 goodman group’s treasury function is responsible for reporting details of all debt maturities to the board at its regular meetings.
 goodman group’s treasury function is also responsible for reporting to the board all the information and term sheets relating to
 any financing arrangements being contemplated or negotiated by the consolidated entity, for its review and approval.
 the consolidated entity seeks to spread its debt maturities such that the total debt maturing in a single financial year does not
 exceed board approved policy levels.

there were no transfers between the levels during the year.
valuation techniques used to derive level 2 and level 3 fair values
the level 2 derivative financial instruments held by the consolidated entity consist of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest
rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined using generally accepted pricing models which discount
estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and current market interest rates and or foreign
currency rates, adjusted for specific features of the instruments.

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
hkfrss requires management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
the estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on
an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the
revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision
and future periods if the revision affects both current and
future periods.

4. income tax expense
income tax for the period comprises current tax and movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities. current tax and movements
in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items recognised in other
comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the relevant amounts of tax are recognised in other comprehensive
income or directly in equity respectively.
current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at
the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from deductible and taxable temporary differences respectively, being the differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their tax bases. deferred tax assets also
arise from unused tax losses and unused tax credits. apart from differences which arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities,
all deferred tax liabilities and all deferred tax assets, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised, are recognised.
the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying
amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. deferred tax assets
and liabilities are not discounted.

measurement of fair value
(i) fair value hierarchy
investment properties comprise stabilised investment properties and investment properties under development. the fair value
measurement for investment properties has been categorised as a level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation
technique used.
(ii) valuation techniques and inputs used in level 3 fair value measurements
the following table shows the valuation technique used in measuring the fair value of investment properties, as well as the
significant unobservable inputs used:
			                                                                                                                   weighted average

sensitivity analysis
throughout the financial year, if the australian dollar had been 5% (2015: 5%) stronger against all other currencies, with
all other variables held constant, the consolidated entity’s profit attributable to shareholders would have decreased by
$11.2 million (2015: $5.3 million). if the australian dollar had been 5% (2015: 5%) weaker against all other currencies, with all
other variables held constant, the consolidated entity’s profit attributable to shareholders would have increased by $11.2 million
(2015: $5.8 million).
interest rate risk
the consolidated entity’s interest rate risk primarily arises from variable rate borrowings with related parties.
sensitivity analysis
based on the consolidated entity’s interest bearing borrowings at 30 june 2016, if interest rates on borrowings had been
100 basis points per annum (2015: 100 basis points per annum) higher/lower, with all other variables held constant, the
consolidated entity’s profit attributable to shareholders for the financial year would have been $7.8 million lower/higher
(2015: $9.9 million lower/higher).
price risk
the consolidated entity is not exposed to price risk.
(b) liquidity risk
liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the
consolidated entity’s objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity resources for working capital, meet its financial obligations and
liabilities, pay distributions and provide funds for capital expenditure and investment opportunities. management seeks to achieve
these objectives through the preparation of regular forecast cash flows to understand the application and use of funds and
through the identification of future funding, primarily through loans from related parties in goodman group.

(c) credit risk
credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties failed to perform as contracted.
the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial assets, excluding investments, of the consolidated entity which have been
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, is the carrying amount (refer to note 7).
the consolidated entity has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of all potential customers and is not materially exposed to
any one customer. the consolidated entity evaluates all customers’ perceived credit risk and may require the lodgement of rental
bonds or bank guarantees, as appropriate, to reduce credit risk. in addition, all rents are payable monthly in advance.
from time to time, the consolidated entity also makes loans to jvs, typically to fund development projects. in making its
investment decisions, the consolidated entity will undertake a detailed assessment of the development feasibility and credit risks
associated with the relevant counterparties.
(d) fair values of financial instruments
except for investments in unlisted securities which are carried at fair value, the consolidated entity’s financial instruments are
carried at cost or amortised cost. the carrying amounts of the consolidated entity’s financial instruments carried at cost or
amortised cost were not materially different from their fair values as at 30 june 2016 and 2015.
(i) valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs

1. goodman group drp was active for the august 2015 and february 2016 distribution. in relation to these distributions, $95.5 million (2015: $89.4 million)
   was in the form of stapled securities in goodman group. the consolidated entity’s share of the equity raised amounted to $11.5 million (2015:
   $11.2 million).
2. during the year, the company issued 9,866,049 (2015: 8,885,569) shares to employees of goodman group under the goodman group long term
   incentive plan (ltip) and goodman group tax exempt plan.

 the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per
 share at meetings of the company. all ordinary shares rank equally with regard to the company’s residual assets.
 (b) equity settled share based payment transactions
 share based payment transactions
 the fair value of rights and options over stapled securities, granted to employees of the consolidated entity by goodman group
 at the grant date is recognised as a share based payment expense in the results of the consolidated entity with a corresponding
 increase in equity. the share based payment expense is calculated over the period to the vesting date and is adjusted to reflect
 the actual number of rights or options for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met.
 the fair values of rights and options are measured at the grant date using a combination of monte carlo simulations and black
 scholes pricing models.
 goodman group provides equity based remuneration through the issue of stapled securities under the ltip. details of the ltip
 are set out below.
 ltip
 the ltip, which provides for the issue of performance rights, was first approved at the 2009 annual general meeting of goodman
 group and subsequently at the 2012 annual general meeting. each performance right issued under the ltip entitles an employee
 to acquire a goodman group stapled security for nil consideration subject to the vesting conditions having been satisfied. the
 ltip also provides for the issue of options, though this has not been utilised to date. if options were to be issued, each option
 would entitle an employee to acquire a goodman group stapled security on payment of the exercise price for the option subject
 to the vesting conditions having been satisfied.
 under the terms of the ltip and decisions made by the directors of goodman group in accordance with the plan, the issues of
 performance rights on 23 september 2015 and 25 november 2015 to employees and directors respectively were subject to the
 following broad terms:
 + the exercise of 25% of the total performance rights will be conditional on goodman group achieving a total securityholder
   return (tsr) in excess of that achieved by 50% of listed entities in the s&p/asx 100 index and the exercise of 75% of the total
   performance rights will be conditional on goodman group achieving an operating earnings per share (eps) outcome at least at
   the target level notified to the market over a three year ‘testing period’ which ends on 30 june 2018 and continued employment
   (subject to special circumstances e.g. death, total and permanent disability, redundancy or retirement). to the extent that
   goodman group achieves the aggregate target operating eps, 100% of the tranche will vest; to the extent goodman group
   exceeds the 51st percentile in tsr, there are proportionate increases in vesting of performance rights up to 100% at the 76th
   percentile under the grants made pursuant to the rules and disclosed to the market;
 + performance rights lapse on the earlier of approximately five years from the offer or the termination of the employee’s
   employment (unless such termination is due to special circumstances); and
 + performance rights issued during the year vest in three equal tranches on 3 september 2018, 2 september 2019 and
   1 september 2020.

the fair value of services received in return for performance rights granted under goodman group’s ltip is measured by reference
to the fair value of the performance rights granted. the estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured as follows:
+ relative tsr tranche: these rights have been valued using a monte carlo model which simulated total returns for each of the
  s&p/asx 100 stocks and discounted the future value of any potential future vesting performance rights to arrive at a present
  value. the model uses statistical analysis to forecast total returns, based on expected parameters of variance and co-
  variance; and
+ operating eps tranche: these rights have been valued as a granted call option, using the standard black scholes model with
  a continuous dividend yield.

1. in prior periods, unrealised gains or losses on investment properties were transferred from retained earnings to the asset revaluation reserve. from 1 july
   2015, the consolidated entity has amended its practice such that these unrealised gains or losses are maintained in retained earnings and any relevant
   amounts included in the asset revaluation reserve at 1 july 2015 have been transferred back to retained earnings.
2. the common control reserve arises from the acquisition of entities from other members of goodman group under the pooling of interest method. the
   amount in the common control reserve reflects the difference between the consideration paid and the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the
   acquired entity at the date of acquisition.

 the movements in reserves of the consolidated entity and the company are analysed below:

we conducted our audit in accordance with hong kong
standards on auditing issued by the hong kong institute

that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. the procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated financial
statements that give a true and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by
the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements.
