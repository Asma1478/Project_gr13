reduction of oa paper
techno associe strives to reduce office paper consumption
by using both sides of paper when making copies and
printouts, and by using projectors at meetings instead of
making copies for meeting attendees.
    we used 66 tons of paper in fiscal 2013 (down 0.7 tons
over the previous year), and paper consumption per unit of
sales remained at the previous year’s level.
    we plan to digitalize more of our administrative
documentation in order to eliminate unnecessary printing.
