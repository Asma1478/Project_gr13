nancial data has played an increasingly important role in evalu-
ating a company’s activities, hitachi chemical co., ltd. began

both annual and sustainability report components from the
annual report 2012. our hope is that this report will provide
stakeholders with a deeper understanding of the company’s
economic, environmental and social activities that reflect our
corporate visions and slogan.

mented the hard copy version with a pdf format posted on our
homepage. the english report contains the financial section.

pany’s securities report.

have adopted a selective approach based on an analysis of
both our external and internal environments and with a view
to creating value for our stakeholders. please refer to page 14.

                  our vision is to contribute to society through the development of superior technologies and products.
                                   our mission is to create new and innovative "value" as a frontrunner.
                                        at all times, the key value we heed and promote is "trust."


                                                              corporate slogan




                               the slogan is a short, symbolic representation of the company's corporate vision that reads,
                              "with a pioneering spirit to explore uncharted areas, we develop innovative product solutions
                                     in a timely manner that provide optimum value for our customers and society."

                                           hitachi chemical group has brought to market innovative products,
                                                     one after another, under its vision of contributing
                                       to society through the development of superior technologies and products.

                          stance and business activities to our customers, shareholders and the societies in our business regions.

strategy




       new medium-term management plan (fiscal 2013-2015)
       guided by its corporate vision, the hitachi chemical group formulated a new three-year medium-term management plan to steer
       management and business decisions in each fiscal year of the plan. next, we reflect on the previous medium-term management plan
       that ran from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2012 and then discuss the new medium-term management plan that started in fiscal 2013.




                        review of previous medium-term management plan (fiscal 2010-2012)
                        although targets were achieved in fiscal 2010, the first year of the plan, net sales and operating income fell
                        short of our forecasts for fiscal 2011, owing to the great east japan earthquake, nuclear reactor meltdowns and
                        flooding in thailand, and for fiscal 2012, owing to weak demand in the pc and other electronics markets and
                        automotive-related industries. although these external factors had a significant impact, the hitachi chemical
                        group also lacked the ability and agility to create new products and businesses, and was unable to fully tap into
                        demand in emerging countries, a key driver of growth, in the high functional materials and automotive parts
                        business fields. within this context, we have clearly identified issues to tackle and formulated specific measures
                        to take under the new medium-term management plan.

                                                                 new high-margin products in the high-end field while improving our ability to adapt to
              high functional                                    trends in markets and technologies. we also aim to expand sales of high-value-added

special feature



       stakeholders’ dialogue


      moving ahead the next 50 years
       marking its 50th anniversary, the year 2012 represented a major milestone for the hitachi chemical group. a manage-
       ment workshop was held in which all executive directors, including the president, discussed the past, present and future
       of the hitachi chemical group, and senior management’s thoughts were summed up in a management message. in this
       special feature, we convey the impressions aired during an exchange of opinions between key figures and executive
       officers that used the management message as a basis for discussion.




       entire group workforce’s participation in management
       to encourage the participation of all employees in management, a communication workshop—in which the entire group workforce could participate —was held
       following the 50th anniversary. for the event, each of the participants expressed his or her thoughts about the future in one word (p.20), derived from their
       respective feelings about the management message, and shared them with senior management. the work of art in the background of the photo above is a com-
       munication art photo mosaic created from images next 50 years of hitachi chemical. the artwork comprises photos from 16,341 employees, or 96% of the total
       workforce. some of these are at the foot of pages 20 to 22.

 business continuity management
the hitachi chemical group works to minimize the risk of any
disruption to its ongoing business as a part of efforts to garner
the trust of its customers and society, and prepares for the un-
likely event of a risk materializing.
       as a part of these endeavors, the group has put in place
a business continuity plan (bcp) to address such contingencies
as a large-scale earthquake or major pandemic, such as a new
influenza global pandemic. in fiscal 2012, we worked to in-
crease our state of readiness.
       at the same time, we conduct simulated training exer-
cises based on bcp scenarios in order to heighten the level of        simulated training exercise
our preparedness in a crisis. in fiscal 2012, hitachi chemical did
two training exercises, one each in november and march.
other group companies, including shin-kobe electric machin-
ery co., ltd. and hitachi powdered metals co., ltd., have start-
ed to conduct their own simulated training exercises.

            the previous table does not include non-marketable securities because no quoted market price is available and it is extremely difficult in estimating
      fair value. the carrying amount of non-marketable securities at march 31, 2013 and 2012 totaled ¥9,493 million ($100,989 thousand) and ¥8,562
      million, respectively.
