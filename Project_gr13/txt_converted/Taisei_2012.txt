message from the president




      creating a vibrant environment for
      all our stakeholders
      the great east japan earthquake has made all of us here at taisei keenly aware of
      the roles and responsibilities that the construction industry has to fulfill in today’s
      society. after all, our industry does more than just construct buildings; we develop a
      wide variety of different architectural structures, all of which help to foster the vibrant
      economy needed to ensure that industry prospers and that people enjoy a comfort-
      able lifestyle. since being established in 1873, taisei has taken on the great task of
      building assets for our society’s development, combining a strong sense of duty with
      cutting-edge technology. with a view to achieving the taisei group ideal of creating
      a vibrant environment for all our stakeholders, we remain fully committed to creating
      urban environments that can better withstand natural disasters. not only that, in light
      of the world’s pressing need to create a low-carbon society, we aim to contribute to
      the realization of a sustainable society through measures such as the development of
      zero energy building (zeb) technology. finally, in keeping with our willingness to take
      up any challenge, we will continue our efforts to create attractive urban environments
      of exceptional value that will stand the test of time.

            challenges for
            the development of
            zero energy buildings
             the ministry of economy, trade and industry has formulated a vision in which zero energy building (zeb*) technology will be
             used in the construction of all new public facilities by 2020 and for all new facilities (including private facilities) by 2030. field
             experiments are also being conducted in various areas across japan for the development of smart communities designed
             to generate and use energy efficiently and comfortably. taisei corporation is working to facilitate the development of zeb
             technology with the aim of optimizing the use of energy in buildings in smart communities.
             * zebs are designed to reduce the consumption of primary energy, such as oil and natural gas, to zero by making full use of energy conservation and
               generation technologies to supply energy required for air conditioning and lighting.




            towards the development of zeb technology
             taisei corporation has succeeded in reducing energy consumption by half (energy consumption reduced by 52% in 2010) in the taisei
             sapporo building completed in 2006 before all other competitors. in order to further promote the development of zeb technology,
             taisei plans to build a zeb demonstration facility on the grounds of the taisei technology center. our initial plan was to complete the
             development of zeb technology by 2020. however, in view of the recent energy conditions, including power supply shortages as well as
             the ongoing global warming, we are striving to complete the development by 2014.

challenges for the development of urban-style zeb technology
based on the recognition that zebs are most often required in urban areas, taisei is working to develop zeb technology for urban archi-
tecture. the zeb demonstration facility, which is being planned to be built within the taisei technology center, is designed as a building
that allows the maximum use of natural energy, including sunlight and natural ventilation, with the support of various advanced tech-
nologies. we also apply cutting-edge technologies for saving energy and using renewable energy and propose new work styles in order
to create an attractive working environment that does not require “enduring” energy saving.

     the new value of zeb technology is to change
     the way of thinking about how to use energy.
     the development of zero energy building (zeb) technology for urban areas requires more
     advanced, higher-level integration of architecture and facility technologies. zeb technology
     not only reduces energy consumption to zero, but also enables people living in buildings to
     understand how their behavior affects the environment, thereby helping them think about
     how to use energy and urging them to change their lifestyles. zeb construction projects are
     currently being implemented in various countries around the world, including the united
     states, singapore and south korea. in order to play the leading role in the world, it is therefore                           takaharu kawase

optimizing the use of building energy with next-generation bems
contributing to the optimization of local energy use
taisei corporation has created a next-generation bems within the taisei technology center by installing cutting-edge facility systems
for the yscp along with next-generation heat and electricity storage systems. the bems is designed to provide comfort and to make
optimum use of energy at the same time through the optimized control of three elements: energy generation (heat and electricity
generation), energy storage (heat and electricity storage) and energy use (facility management). in addition, by supporting demand
response* through regional collaboration using cems, the bems makes it possible to optimize the energy use of entire local communi-
ties (this demonstration experiment is a joint project with toshiba corporation).

               in addition to constructing buildings designed to make efficient use of air, underground heat and sunlight, taisei corporation
               has also been working to develop various original technologies, including systems that provide optimum control of lighting
               and air conditioning. we are contributing to optimizing energy use through making positive proposals for customers.

               for air conditioning
               the ishikari datacenter, located in hokkaido, has installed
               an outdoor air-cooling system that benefits from the area’s
               cool climate, thereby achieving a substantial reduction in
               energy consumption. taisei’s outdoor air-cooling system
               mixes waste heat from servers with outside air and provides
               server rooms with cooled air maintained at appropriate
               temperature and humidity levels, thereby eliminating
               almost all costs required for air conditioning throughout
               the year. the system contributes to reducing it costs in

           step 1 understanding natural disasters to better identify risks
predicting and assessing the damage and destruction caused by earthquakes and tsunamis helps to improve natural disaster
preparedness. taisei corporation is continuing to develop a variety of numerical simulation techniques—such as tsunami analysis,
long-period ground motion analysis and liquefaction analysis—in order to help develop more resilient urban communities.


tsunami simulation
it is well known that the risk of a tokai, tonankai or nankai earthquake causing a catastrophic disaster is increasing year by year. coun-
termeasures to mitigate this risk are essential. tsunami simulations could make a significant contribution to risk assessment.

tsunami shelter
taisei’s tsunami shelter provides an emergency evacuation space in areas that may be flooded by tsunami
waves. the shelter is cylindrically shaped so as to reduce the water pressure of tsunami and is designed to
have multiple layers of evacuation floors so as to accommodate as many people as possible within a small
area.




                                                                                                                                                                                                        tsunami shelter



          step 4 improving effectiveness
taisei is working to develop information systems required to ensure business continuity as well as buildings that can withstand
disasters.

                                                the bcp of a construction company inherently contributes to society.

                                                taisei: we started a project to develop our bcp in 2005 in accordance with the business con-
                                                tinuity guidelines published by the cabinet office. at that time, however, we were groping in
                                                the dark because we have neither factories or other production sites, nor conduct business
                                                activities with our own facilities and equipment like railroads and airlines. we have about
                                                1,000 worksites nationwide, but they are only temporary facilities, so our business environ-
                                                ment changes easily. what are we supposed to do for business continuity in these circum-
                                                stances? our answer to this question is to protect completed structures as well as structures
                                                under construction. this task itself contributes to the business continuity of our customers.
                                                in the event of a disaster, we rush to our customers to repair their buildings and cooperate
                                                in repairing bridges, roads and other social infrastructures. we believe this is our mission as
                                                a general constructor. we also feel socially responsible for tackling challenges that none has
                                                ever faced, such as radioactive decontamination.

                                       we should construct buildings prepared for emergencies and
                                       recognize what the public expects of bcp.
                                       kawakita: it is important for companies to expand the scope of their bcps beyond them-
                                       selves, their group companies and their customers to local communities. the real strength
                                       of a community does not lie in the size of its population, but in how strongly its residents are
                                       connected to each other. from among housing, food and clothing, a community can rely
                                       on others for food and clothing, but cannot do so for the sense of security obtained from
                                       a building. since the buildings taisei corporation constructs may become evacuation sites,
                                       you have to think about what functions and human relationships are needed in places where
                                       people gather in emergencies. you are also expected to propose energy supply solutions not
                                       easily affected by disasters, such as energy supply diversification and local consumption of
                                       local products.
                                       kawaguchi: i think what it comes down to the idea that buildings need to be prepared for
                                       emergencies from now on. i also think business operators are attracted to eco-friendly disas-
                                       ter countermeasures like energy supply diversification. this is where business opportunities
                                       exist, so taisei corporation should provide attractive technical solutions.


the primary role of civil engineering is to make people happy.
now is the time to emphasize that point.
ogata: the civil engineering industry is proud to support people’s lives by constructing
roads, bridges and other infrastructures, and is responsible to do so. the things that are really
important are often invisible and therefore often not understood, but the primary role of
civil engineering is to make people happy and contribute to society. now that the disaster
has deprived people of their normal life styles, builders and users are in the same boat for
the first time ever. if the construction industry declines, it could threaten safe living in terms
of measures for snow and other natural disasters. to build a good society, the construction
industry will need to deepen its relationship of trust with the public through dialogues and
teach them more about the industry.
kawaguchi: the march 11 earthquake has reminded us that infrastructures are not always
available. as public works have been associated with “dokenya,” a derogatory name for build-
ers, it is important to get the public to understand the primary functions of public works, such
as urban and civil engineering, through dialogues with them.




      taisei’s response to the comments
      we are committed to contributing to building a sustainable society
      with a sense of responsibility and pride.
      we have been providing technical support in various fields,                     although some parts of our bcp were not satisfactory when

               research and development

               we are conducting various technological development
               projects to make our society a better place to live.

                    our ict-based total management system for dam construction ”4d-dis” (tentative
                    name) can manage structures in units of 50 cubic centimeters at a minimum and search
                    and list construction information on each cube in a short time. in addition to conven-
                    tional computerized construction, 4d-dis offers new functions such as quality assur-
                    ance, more efficient supervision and administration, sharing of information and elec-

                    measures against liquefaction of land for housing and existing structures
                    improved soil mixing method by opening impellers in the ground
                    in conjunction with nittoc construction co., ltd., we developed a soil improvement method that
                    can be applied to places with underground pipes and other obstacles. this method uses our origi-
                    nal mixers to develop consolidated improved soil columns by mixing cement or other solidification

                    floor impact sound prediction system ”tsounds-floor”
                    tsounds-floor is a floor impact sound prediction system that assesses the insulation performance of build-
                    ings against heavy floor impact sounds generated by walking or jumping. this system can assess steel struc-
                    tures as well as reinforced concrete structures covered by the prediction method of the architectural institute
                    of japan using the finite-element analysis technologies. this system can also reasonably reduce the increas-
                    ing thickness of concrete floors without impairing insulation performance against heavy floor impact sounds.

significant reduction of labor in classification of photographic records
cloud-based application ”field pad”
we developed “field pad,” an application for iphone and ipad, to improve construction manage-
ment and quality control. with this application, you can download design drawings to smartpads
or smartphones to display the places where photos were taken on top of the drawings and auto-
matically prepare and edit reports and other documents with information related to such photos.
sagyosho net, the cloud service for the field pad application, was awarded the grand prix in the
user category of the 5th asp saas cloud awards in 2011.



tecorep (taisei ecological reproduction) system, high-rise building disassembly system
reusing materials from demolished buildings closed high-rise building disassembly technology
we developed a closed high-rise building demolition technology to meet increasing demand for the demolition and rebuilding of high-
rise buildings. this eco-friendly technology makes it possible to reuse demolished building materials and reduce co2 emissions from
demolition work through effective use of the energy generated from lowering dismantled building materials to the ground. we applied
this technology to a demolition project of an office building (105 m) in tokyo. in this project, for which the demolition of the aboveground
part was completed in december 2011, the technology successfully reduced dust dispersal by more than 50%, reduced noise by 20 deci-
bels, reused energy generated through crane
operation (for lighting and other purposes),
and shortened the typical-floor cycle process
from six to four and a half days. in 2012, we
plan to demolish a hotel (139 m) in tokyo with
this technology.
this technology won infrastructure technol-
ogy development award of japan and best
excellence prize

regeneration of city and natural environment
“otemachi forest” (tentative name)
we are proceeding with the ”otemachi 1-6 project” (tentative name) in chiyoda city alongside tokyo tatemono
co., ltd. and plan to complete the project in 2014. in pursuit of regenerating the city and the natural envi-
ronment at the same time, this project develops a 38-story complex and
“otemachi forest” (tentative name) with an area of about 3,600 m2 on about
1.1 ha of land. this forest is a genuine forest consisting of various kinds of
greenery from tall trees to ground cover plants. this natural environment
regenerated in the city is expected to reduce the heat island effect, create a
rich ecosystem and produce other environmental benefits. when planning
this project, we used our own technologies such as a greening planning
technology based on a theory of quantification for attracting birds and the
thermal environment simulation system “t-heats.”




engineering
innovative, economical water treatment systems for urban aquariums
high-performance filtration system, sea water recycling system and artificial sea water production system
taisei corporation has developed its own proprietary technologies for the treatment of water,
such as its water-saving high-performance filtration system and its sea water recycling system.
in recent projects, such as the implementation of taisei’s artificial sea water production system,
significant reductions have been achieved in not only the amount of sea water transported
to inland urban aquariums, but also all associated co2 emissions. an effective combination of
these technologies can reduce the amount of sea water used at such aquariums and minimize
wastage. these systems have now been adopted at kyoto aquarium (shimogyo ward, kyoto
city), sumida aquarium (sumida city, tokyo) and other large inland aquariums.                        harmony between water and life—penguins and seals

                    taisei rotec corporation constructs roads as well as manufactures and
                    recycles asphalt mixtures, operating fukushima central ascon, one of the
                    largest asphalt mixture plants in the tohoku region. the plant was severely
                    damaged by the great east japan earthquake, but the company kept it in
                    operation anyway to supply materials necessary for post-quake recovery
                    while building a new plant as the same time. the new plant was com-
                    pleted in december 2011.
                    excellent in seismic performance and operational safety, the new plant is
                    the latest model of eco-friendly plants that thoroughly suppresses dust
                    and noise and is equipped with an “active drier,” the latest drier system

                    building condominiums strong against earthquakes
                    taisei u-lec co., ltd.
                    an investigation into the damage caused by the great east japan earthquake in
                    areas recording a seismic intensity of 6 or higher revealed that no buildings con-
                    structed by taisei u-lec suffered actual damage.
                    the company’s pc method creates walls and floors using pc panels made of high
                    strength concrete that form strong box structures. these box structures can disperse
                    seismic forces equally in all directions, so they are more resistant to earthquakes than
                    steel structures and other rigid-frame structures that consist of columns and beams.
                    this method can minimize the amount of noise from placing concrete and the
                    amount of dust generated when the shuttering is removed, because it is an industri-
                    alized construction method that manufactures floors and walls, the basic elements
                    of buildings, at its own factories before assembling them at construction sites.                              hulic court yukigaya

           operating results
           although the japanese economy showed tentative signs of recovery this year from its decline caused by the great east japan earthquake, the
           economy has yet to get on a full-fledged recovery path due to reasons including the economic slowdown overseas and the effects of the yen’s
           appreciation.

           in the domestic construction market, although a positive trend toward a recovery in demand emerged due to reconstruction demand following the
           earthquake and as a reaction to a rapid decrease in investment after lehman shock, it is expected that it will take some time for reconstruction
           projects to get into full swing. furthermore, the private sector continued to face a difficult business environment as the competition for orders
           intensifies.


           orders and sales
           for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2012, orders stood at 1,379.5 billion yen, an increase of 10.0% year-on-year, due to rises in orders across all
           of the company’s consolidated business segments. net sales in the year under review amounted to 1,323.5 billion yen, an increase of 8.7% year
           on year.


           operating income, ordinary income and net income
           operating income in the fiscal year ended march 31, 2012 totaled 36.4 billion yen, an increase of 0.5% year on year, caused by gross profit
           remaining more or less flat year on year, due to the affect of the deteriorating performance of the real estate development business in spite of the
           rising overall sales for the fiscal year under review. ordinary income in the fiscal year ended march 31, 2012 stood at 30.2 billion yen, an increase
           of 25.8% year on year, as a decrease in foreign exchange losses led to an improvement in non-operating income for the fiscal year under review.

           net income for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2012 amounted to 1.1 billion yen, a decrease of 89.1% year on year, affected by a recognition of
           impairment loss and a tax system reform-related reversal of deferred tax assets for the fiscal year under review.




           outlook for fiscal year ending march 31, 2013
           during the fiscal year ending march 31, 2013, the japanese economy is expected to show a recovery overall, supported reconstruction demand
           post the great east japan earthquake and the rebounding output. the recovery’s pace, however, is anticipated be moderate given the risk of an
           economic deterioration resulting from the persistently strong yen and the world economic slowdown.

           the domestic construction market is likely to remain faced with a challenging operating climate due to uncertainties over the implementation of
           the post-great east japan earthquake reconstruction efforts, coupled with the concerns about japanese enterprises potentially revising their
           capital expenditure plans in the face of power supply restrictions and raw material price fluctuation risks.

           in consideration of the above-mentioned circumstances, we forecast consolidated net sales of 1,380 billion yen and consolidated operating
           income of 41 billion yen for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2013. in addition, we forecast consolidated ordinary income of 31 billion yen and
           consolidated net income of 15 billion yen for the fiscal year ending march 31, 2013. furthermore, we also forecast we will have orders totaling
           1,360 billion yen.

note 1: the estimation method of the fair value
		 [assets]
		 ・cash and time deposits and receivables: trade notes and trade accounts
            the fair values of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value, because of the short term settlements; although, the
            fair value of receivables: trade notes and trade accounts due over one year are based on the present value of discounted cash flows using
            the interest rate determined by the factors of the estimated collection terms and credit risks, with respect to each receivable categorized by
            collection terms.
		 ・investment securities
            the fair values of the marketable securities are based on the quoted market value, and bonds are based on the market value, the price indicated
            by a third party such as broker, or the present value of discounted cash flows, respectively.
            see the notes on“5 securities“ for notes pertaining to securities according to the purpose for which they are held.
		 [liabilities]
		 ・trade payables: notes and accounts, short-term borrowings and long term debt due within one year, commercial papers and deposits received
            the fair values of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value, because of the short term settlements; although, the fair
            value of long-term debt due within one year are based on the same method as that for long-term debt.
		 ・long-term debt
            long-term debt is the sum of long term borrowings due after one year, straight bonds due after one year and convertible bonds due after one
            year. the fair values of long-term borrowings are based on the present value of discounted cash flows using the interest rate which may be
            applicable when the same kind borrowings are made. the fair values of the marketable bonds are based on the quoted market value, otherwise
            the fair values of the bonds are the present value of discounted cash flows using the interest rate determined by the factors of the estimated
            redemption terms and issuer’s credit risk.
		 ・derivative financial instruments
            see the notes on “15 derivative transactions”.
note 2: financial instruments for which it is deemed extremely difficult to measure the fair value
		 nonmarketable securities (book value amount to ¥ 75,786 million and ¥ 67,977 million ($ 827,071 thousand) at march 31, 2011 and 2012,
         respectively) are not included in the above [assets] investment securities–available-for-sale securities, as it is deemed extremely difficult to
         measure the fair values thereof because neither market quoted value is available nor future cash flows can be estimated.

         31, 2011 and 2012 were as follows
