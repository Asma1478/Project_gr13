                                                                                                                                                       2

    to our stakeholders




             since its establishment in 1936, ricoh has constantly pursued the creation of new value through
             optical equipment and imaging equipment based on innovative technologies. today, the ricoh
             group offers products, solutions and services, underpinned by a diverse line of office imaging
             equipment, in approximately 200 countries and regions around the world.
                from our earliest days right through to the present, our business environment has been con-
             stantly changing. we have resolutely embraced change to foster new innovations all the time
             while charting corporate growth.


                in recent years, the pace of change has accelerated, fueled by greater informatization and
             networks around the world, as well as evolving customer value perceptions and diversifying life-
             styles. in addition, society has a mountain of issues to address on a global scale, from environmental
             concerns to poverty, human rights, and natural resource and energy consumption.
                the ricoh group has a mission to provide excellence in its efforts to improve the quality of life
             for all and to drive sustainability, and going forward, the overriding objective will be to anticipate
             customers’ changing needs and create new value linked to approaches that mitigate issues that
             impact society. this is how we will achieve further growth.


                the three years of the current mid-term management plan have been set as a time to ensure
             long-term growth of the group. the plan is founded on two basic strategies—to reinforce
             and develop earnings power for core businesses and to achieve growth by creating new profit
             generators—and the ricoh group is actively implementing measures for these strategies. in fiscal
             2015, the first year under this mid-term management plan, we were able to secure a larger global
             share of the multifunction printer (mfp) market and reinforce the revenue base in our core office
             business domain. meanwhile, in the production printing business, we were able to acquire a
             firmer footing for full-scale development of business in the commercial printing domain. in
             addition, in the industrial business domain, as a business pillar for the future, we established a
             structure to underpin swift decision making and promote effective management infrastructure
             matched to business pursuits and began to accelerate the expansion of associated activities. also,
             in areas where the ricoh group has not yet made business inroads, efforts yielded the buds of
             new businesses.


                in 2016, ricoh will celebrate its 80th year in business. we are leveraging the collective talents
             of our people in keeping with our corporate tagline of “imagine. change.” we will look into the
             future, to the tomorrows of our customers, the human race and the environment, and we will
             strive to improve corporate value by constantly creating new value that serves a real purpose in
             the world and by meeting the expectations of all stakeholders, including—but certainly not limited
             to—shareholders and customers.

    keen to create value in priority sectors
    within the ricoh group, we are reinforcing efforts to provide products and solutions specifically for
    certain business sectors, such as healthcare, education, finance and manufacturing. a prime example
    in the healthcare sector is support for a smooth workstyle at medical facilities to improve patient satis-
    faction while also reducing the administrative workload on staff and preventing medical errors. our
    responses include automating the separation of specialized documents, such as prescriptions; indexing
    photographic images of an injury or condition in the patient’s electronic medical records; preventing
    medical errors in drug-dispensing procedures with a printer capable of sorted output; and providing
    support for community healthcare coordination using videoconferencing. ➤ web 5

    the kitasato university hospital case study

    looking ahead to 2025 and a super-aged society,
    where one in four people in japan will be over the
    age of 75, the total support center at kitasato
    university hospital took the lead in establishing
    the sagamihara machida area nursing and
    medical care zone infrastructure building
    consortium. this consortium involves 107 office
    sites, including hospitals, pharmacies, regional
    comprehensive support centers and at-home care
    providers, with activities undertaken at 23 loca-
    tions. at these regional medical facilities, it is
    essential that front-line professionals in different
                                                                           kitasato university hospital
    fields, not only doctors and nurses but also phar-
    macists, social welfare counselors, care managers
    and nursing care providers, share patient-specific
    information to ensure proper care. each work
    environment can be hectic, so the consortium
    opted for videoconferencing, which is more effec-
    tive in promoting communication than trying to
    gather individuals together for a meeting in a
    single location. the ricoh group is contributing
    to enhanced communication practices by creating
    the required network. we set up the compact,
    easy-to-install-and-operate ricoh ucs to enable
    participants to initiate remote meetings and train-
                                                                           remote conferencing with ricoh ucs
    ing sessions anytime, anywhere. ricoh ucs
    closes the distance between places that typically
    prevent face-to-face contact and lets the people
    involved in the discussion “see” each other. even
    medical services and nursing care providers on
    round-the-clock schedules can dash over to a
    nearby venue during working hours or after work
    for face-to-face communication.

     solid management with a diverse perspective vital to building new core businesses
                                               prevailing global conditions are quite a bit different than in the latter half of the 20th century when ricoh made
                                               big strides toward becoming today’s ricoh group. the “ideal that the ricoh group aspires to” is imbued with

                                               an executive team needs to approach business from different angles: from a bird’s-eye view, a fish-eye perspec-
                                               tive and an insect’s eye. that is, management must look at business from a global view, overall, and be sensitive
                                               to changes in political, economic and technology currents. it must also look at issues on the periphery and deal

                                               gained insight into various business sectors and realized that nearly all companies are caught up in finding
                                               solutions to existing issues. this leaves no room to look at operations from a bird’s-eye or fish-eye perspective.
                                               i believe an outside director has to round out the efforts of corporate management by providing an external
