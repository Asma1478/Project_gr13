this section introduces some of the major activities
from fy2011 centered on 5 keywords.
the keywords of “environment” “safety, peace-of-mind, comfort” and “global”
were chosen based on the image of the company jtekt aims to
become as stated in the jtekt vision 2015.
of the activities carried out in fy2011, we particularly wish to emphasize efforts
made to spread csr companywide and recover from natural disasters.

     sure condensers with highly concentrated pcb levels harmless
     through pcb treatment at jesco (japan environmental safety

     units in fy2012 and complete this on all 146 units we currently
     have in storage by 2014.
