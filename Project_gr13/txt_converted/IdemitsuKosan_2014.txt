are looking into acquiring interests in promising north american gas fields. we are also working to construct a value chain
encompassing upstream and downstream businesses while building a stable gas business over the long-term.
    moreover, idemitsu and altagas have jointly acquired twothirds of all outstanding shares of                 petrogas energy
corp., a major energy company engaged mainly in the marketing, logistics, storage and transportation of natural gas
liquids (ngl), lpg and crude oil, primarily in western canada and the united states. petrogas energy itself acquired
an lpg export base in washington state in may 2014. as a result of these acquisitions we now have altagas's lpg
production facilities, petrogas energy's collection, storage and logistics facilities, including freight railcars, and the idemitsu
group's sales network united under one banner. this enabled us to initiate lpg exports to japan from north america in
august 2014, a full two years ahead of schedule. it serves as an example of how idemitsu works to maximize synergies
between new and existing businesses and will eventually lead to the export of crude oil and other petroleum products not
only to japan but elsewhere in asia.



     securing interests in oil fields in the north sea and offshore vietnam

in 1971, idemitsu established idemitsu japan sea oil development co., ltd. and began oil field development in the sea
offshore aga, niigata prefecture. we then began producing crude oil domestically at our aga-oki-kita and iwafune-oki oil
fields, but those fields have since been closed.
    in 1989, we established idemitsu oil and gas co., ltd., which is now responsible for upstream oil and gas business

     providing solutions is at the heart of our company

in 1911, idemitsu began business as a petroleum dealer in the town of moji. in the beginning, its operations were restricted
to japan but the company was eager to open sales channel overseas. the company's first venture outside japan was
in mainland china, selling to the stateowned south manchuria railway, which was headquartered in dalian, during the
time of japanese annexation. at the time, mainland china's petroleum product market was dominated by european and
u.s. companies that kept prices high. by providing such products at more reasonable prices, we were able to successfully
become a supplier of machine oil to the south manchuria railway in 1914.
    the grease used to lubricate the rail car axles would often freeze in the frigid climate of manchuria, causing the
axles to overheat while taking a considerable bite out of railway profit. idemitsu founder sazo idemitsu addressed this
problem by discarding the conventional oil specifications imposed by foreign oil companies as he worked to develop the
company's no. 2 axle lubricant for winter weather, a product that doesn't freeze even in the harsh cold of manchuria. no.                                                                                                                         lubricants
2 axle lubricant not only put an immediate end to the overheating of rail car axles, it was the success that set the stage
for the creation of further high-performance lubricant products and provision of solutions to customers. we have since
expanded our sales channels for lubricants and fuel oils to the rest of east asia and southeast asia.

     environmental protection and safety assurance are important when handling                                                    additionally, we hold annual comprehensive disaster drills based on various bcps at the corporate head office and review
     hazardous materials throughout the value chain
                                                                                                                                  bcps based on the results of the drills as part of our efforts to strengthen our practical response capabilities.

the idemitsu group handles hazardous materials throughout its entire value chain from the extraction and procurement
of crude oil through sales. the biggest material risk for the group is the major impact on business revenue of accidents,
including fires, explosions, oil spills and the cross contamination of different grades of oil. safety assurance, environmental
protection and quality control are therefore of the utmost importance.
    in the event of an accident at a refinery, petrochemical plant, oil stockpiling yard or oil depot, there is the risk that
production will need to be stopped. not only would this directly impact revenue due to the loss of business opportunities
and the cost of restarting equipment, it could also cause long-term damage by diminishing the trust placed in us by the
local community and degrading the general public’s perception of the company.
    this is especially true since we moved to a framework of three refineries in fiscal 2014. while our capacity
utilization has increased, the potential magnitude of impact on our operations of an accident has never been greater. we
must therefore be extra diligent in implementing safety measures. when jx nippon oil & energy corporation suspended
crude oil processing at their refinery in muroran, our hokkaido refinery became the sole refinery within the prefecture,
significantly increasing the social responsibility we had to bear. based on this lesson, we will promote extraordinary
structural reforms to increase the competitiveness of the refinery while ensuring safe operations and stable supply.
    at the same time, if contamination occurs during unloading at a service station or customer site, there is a risk it
could lead to an accident affecting the vehicles that receive the fuel. remedying such contamination in order to avoid an
accident takes considerable time and money. the company must recover the fuel, switch out products and clean sales

from the perspective of strengthening corporate governance, the idemitsu group established the safety & environmental
protection headquarters to undertake initiatives for assuring safety and security and protecting the environment across
the entire idemitsu group.
    an executive vice president of idemitsu serves as head of the safety & environmental protection headquarters
and members consist of the managers of each relevant department in charge while the safety, environment & quality
assurance department functions as its secretariat. also, each relevant department in charge appoints deputy safety
managers and thereby controls and promotes its initiatives in tandem with business sites under its supervision.
    the safety & environmental protection headquarters is in charge of formulating policies and promoting other
                                                                                                      *1
important issues as well as maintaining, reviewing and improving security management systems.              every fiscal year,
the headquarters outlines basic policies and important items related to safety and the environment for the group. each
relevant department in charge implements pdca cycles in accordance with these policies. the safety & environmental
protection council is convened annually in principle and reviews the group’s progress.
    moreover, to improve the activities of each relevant department in charge, the head of the safety & environmental
protection headquarters tours worksites to provide safety and environmental instructions and its secretariat implements
safety and environment-related audits. idemitsu’s refineries and petrochemical plants receive such instructions and audits
once a year. other business sites implement safety and environment-related audits once every three years in principle.

     reinforcing the seismic durability of existing facilities

idemitsu tirelessly works to strengthen its response measures in preparation of natural disasters. as for earthquakes, we
constantly assess and improve the seismic durability of our equipment for earthquake magnitudes set by the company,
which go beyond the standards required by law. as a result of our efforts, the great east japan earthquake on march 11,
2011, caused no damage to and had no major impact on any of our refineries or petrochemical plants.
    on the other hand, in light of the fact that the earthquake did cause damage to and explosions of high-pressure
gas equipment at other companies, we toughened our seismic durability standards for newly installed high-pressure gas
equipment. and, to further improve the seismic durability of our existing high-pressure gas equipment, by may 2015,
we will complete detailed examinations of all spherical storage tanks at our refineries, petrochemical plants, including
the anesaki works of prime polymer co., ltd., and other business sites in japan. in addition, we will confirm that all
equipment that may have a significant impact on surrounding areas in the event of an accident is compliant with the newly
toughened seismic durability standards. we will also establish corrective measures to improve seismic durability for any
equipment that needs it.

idemitsu’s refineries and petrochemical plants have established safety & environmental management sections at each
business site. in collaboration with departments at all these refineries and petrochemical plants, these sections promote
safety and security assurance and environmental conservation. moreover, idemitsu’s refineries and petrochemical plants,
in collaboration with partners, conduct thorough daily safety inspections and take all possible measures to prevent
accidents, while forming self-protecting disaster prevention teams in the event of an accident and carrying out periodic
disaster prevention training. also, in addition to receiving safety and environment-related audits undertaken by the safety
& environmental protection headquarters, we promote audits within refineries and petrochemical plants as well as mutual
audits among these facilities to raise the level of monitoring.

     acquisition of iso 9001 certification


in fiscal 2007, our main domestic and overseas business departments completed the acquisition of iso 9001 certification.
when new business sites are opened we consider the need for certification and immediately acquire such accreditation if
necessary. in fiscal 2013, our lubricant sales base in india and resin and chemicals sales base in shanghai, china, newly
acquired iso 9001 certification.


     initiatives to ensure product safety


based on the product safety action guidelines formulated in fiscal 2007, we conduct checks on product safety in each of
the product life stages from research and development to sales. there are significant changes in the regulations of various
countries concerning chemical substances and we are promoting management that can respond swiftly to these changes.
in fiscal 2013, in order to identify and address weaknesses, we examined the systems in place for managing change.

     fair compensation


     basic approach to evaluation and compensation

the basic approach to evaluation at idemitsu involves the use of step-specific growth objectives, which constitute a
common, company-wide evaluative yardstick, to identify an employee's comprehensive competence. at the same time,
a growth support system called management by objectives is used to check whether an employee is demonstrating
work quality and capabilities appropriate to each growth step. growth objectives, capability enhancement, set targets
and the degree of achievement are confirmed in an interview with the employee's superior using an action plan table.
the evaluation results are used to determine the next objectives for growth and reflected in compensation (pay and
allowances) as well as personnel assignments and transfers.
    as a basic policy, we seek to uphold fair compensation based on the idea of guaranteeing a basic level of living for

since fiscal 2004, we have been keeping track of the number of employees on leave for mental health reasons
(employees on leave for more than one month due to mental illness). in accordance with our in-house rules, we have
been managing cases in which employees are allegedly suffering mental health problems, with worksite leaders and the
human resources department swiftly responding to and collaboratively handling problems as they arise. in fiscal 2013,
moreover, we introduced an online-system that enables employees to carry out self-assessments of their mental stress
as a part of comprehensive preemptive preventive countermeasures. this system uses a questionnaire with 85 items,
which takes approximately 15 minutes to fill in via a website. the system enables users to identify possible mental-health
related issues and suggests preventive healthcare measures that they can implement on their own. open to employees
to use without limit, the system allows each user to retain and confirm their own assessment record and provides valuable
assistance to employees with their voluntary mental health management. in fiscal 2013, we conducted two company-
wide campaigns encouraging employees to try out this system and both enjoyed a more than 95% response rate, with
employees going online to obtain evaluations. based on these evaluations, we offer face-to-face counseling with industrial
physicians to those who find themselves in need of the advice of healthcare professionals.


*11 employees on leave for mental health reasons: we keep track of the number of employees who are absent from work or on leave for
     mental health reasons at the end of every fiscal year. with a view to protecting the privacy of employees, however, we do not disclose
     these figures.

the major points of contact between the idemitsu group and individual customers are its service stations, website and
advertising and publicity media.
    the customer relations center established within the public relations & csr affairs office handles customer
comments and inquiries, which come via telephone, regular mail, the customer opinion postcards provided at service
stations and our web-based customer service inquiry form. the customer relations center promptly responds to customer
inquiries and claims in close collaboration with other departments within the group.

     efforts to improve customer satisfaction

the petroleum & coal marketing department has been developing monitoring activities to improve customer satisfaction
at service stations. under this program, investigators recruited from the general public visit service stations, draw up
reports based on their evaluations of said stations, and notify the service stations being investigated of the results. based
on these results, service stations work to improve their operations. in addition, the service stations solicit comments and
requests directly from customers every day through customer opinion postcards. by combining these two programs, we
aim to realize greater customer satisfaction at service stations.

     customer relations center's response to customer inquiries

the customer relations center uses product and service response manuals and other tools to promptly respond to
customer inquiries.
    for inquiries of a technical nature or those about customer service at service stations, the quality of gasoline, the
driving manners of tanker truck drivers and other matters that require verification, the center works in cooperation with
responsible departments, and, depending on the circumstances, the persons in charge may directly answer customers'
inquiries.
    with the aim of sharing the center's accumulated know-how across the entire group, we launched a skills training
program for departments and business sites in fiscal 2010 that focuses on handling calls. with the operators of the center
serving as lecturers, the training program was conducted at nine departments with 250 participants in fiscal 2013.

people of all regions.                                                                                                              neighborhood associations, to explain our safety- and environment-related efforts and seek opinions from community members.



     initiatives jointly undertaken with the idemitsu-kai

idemitsu sales offices in each region undertake activities for community and regional vitalization in collaboration with
the idemitsu-kai, an organization comprising owners of idemitsu service station retail outlets throughout japan. together,
they promote a wide range of activities that have become part of the fabric of local communities. these activities include
arts programs in addition to personal safety, traffic safety and environment-related initiatives, local cleanup activities and
fundraising events.
    one such activity is the idemitsu children's art contest for elementary school students held every year by the
hokkaido idemitsu-kai. the number of entrants continues to grow each year.

sazo idemitsu valued the creativity of the japanese people. he loved simple, apolitical art that did not play up its material
value, and drew spiritual sustenance from it. the ability of artists to take a long, hard look at the world from a unique and
uncompromising perspective rang true with his own dreams for society.

     overseas biofuel business

biofuels refers to fuels created from renewable organic resources through fermentation, pressing, pyrolysis or other
processes. there are high expectations for these fuels as alternative energy sources and, because they are carbon
neutral, they are garnering attention as a way to combat global warming. idemitsu is also working to establish a solid
foundation for biofuel commercialization in southeast asia. this is predicated on the use of plant-based raw materials with
minimal effect to the food supply and with due consideration of maintaining a healthy balance between energy stability,
the environment and the economy. as part of these efforts, we signed a memorandum with the cambodian government
in december 2012 related to the development of biofuels. cambodia has expansive, fertile lands perfect for cultivating
cassava and other crops used as biofuel raw materials. we are still examining the feasibility of building a vertically
integrated ethanol business spanning production and sales with the cooperation of the cambodian government.

     response to biodiversity



     initiatives undertaken by our refineries and petrochemical plants


     actively promoting the greening of factories since the construction of our first refinery

idemitsu’s initiatives to promote the greening of factories can be traced back to the construction of its first refinery, the
tokuyama refinery in shunan city, yamaguchi prefecture, completed in 1957. these earliest efforts predated the factory
construction law by 17 years; it was not until 1973 that the law requiring the creation of green spaces was passed in
the face of significant environmental pollution generated during japan’s post-war period of accelerated industrial growth.        the importance of factory green spaces in terms of biodiversity

award is given by the organization for landscape and urban
green infrastructure in recognition of companies’ excellent
management of green spaces and greening activities along
with outstanding achievements in environmental activities,
such as regional contributions or biodiversity conservation.
the chiba refinery and petrochemical plant was constructed
on land reclaimed from the sea. it has worked to foster a
natural environment where the ocean once was, promoting the management of green spaces over the 50 or so years
since it began operation. currently, the green spaces within the grounds have become a roosting area for local birds.
the refinery and plant were praised for converting their landfills into “parkland factories” as well as their emphasis on
biodiversity conservation in its management of green spaces, which provide a green belt that acts as a buffer zone. they
were also lauded for their implementation of environmental education programs and contributions to raising awareness
about protecting nature.

     waste reduction at refineries and petrochemical plants

as part of efforts led by nippon keidanren to create a recycling-oriented society, the petroleum industry and the petrochemical
industry are each setting voluntary targets*1 for reducing the landfill waste volume of industrial waste. because idemitsu has
already attained these targets, we have set an even higher target and have been working to maintain the industrial waste                                                                 scope of tabulation: the hokkaido, chiba, aichi and tokuyama refineries
ultimately deposited in landfills at or below 0.5% of the volume of waste generated at all refineries and petrochemical plants. in
fiscal 2013, almost all refineries and petrochemical plants were able to achieve this target.
                                                                                                                                                                        petrochemical plants

   japan): reduce the final disposal (landfill) of industrial waste by more than 94% in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 1990 level. along with this,
   realize zero emissions of industrial waste as an independent industry target. zero emissions is defined as an industrial waste landfill

     recycling of catalysts*2

our refineries use approximately 2,000 tons of catalysts annually in the process that removes sulfur from heavy oil.
    used catalysts with reduced desulfurization activity are regenerated by an outside contractor and used again at our
refineries. utilizing regenerated catalysts allows us to reduce the use of new catalysts by about 20%.
    moreover, these used catalysts contain rare metals like molybdenum and vanadium. when used catalysts cannot
be regenerated, we sell these as valuable resources.

*2 catalyst: a substance that accelerates a specific chemical reaction without being modified (consumed) in the process. catalysts play an
     important role in the production process of petroleum products and petrochemical products.




     recycling of petrochemical products

departments handling plastic processed products are promoting the development of easily recycled products made from
single-plastic resins and from recycled materials. we have also established a recycling system for used plastic containers.
these containers are used as ink containers and for other purposes.

                                                                                                     idemitsu unitech recycle products


     reducing waste at service stations

we distribute our service station industrial waste management manual to idemitsu service stations to ensure compliance
with relevant laws and regulations. among the waste generated at service stations, empty plastic lubricant pails are
collected by an outside specialist company for partial recycling into resources. used tires are collected for recycling by tire
sales companies and industrial waste hauling companies, while used batteries are collected for recycling by the lead acid
storage battery recycle association.

     managing cfcs

the idemitsu group has some large-scale processing equipment containing cfcs and hcfcs, which damage the ozone
layer, at its oil refineries and petrochemical plants. this equipment accounted for a large percentage of the cfcs and
hcfcs used by the group. in addition, we plan to continue servicing this equipment as it can be upgraded only during the

     atmospheric pollution measures

air pollutants discharged from group facilities include sulfur oxides (sox), nitrogen oxides (nox) and soot and dust
emitted from boilers and furnaces as well as volatile organic compounds (vocs) from crude oil or petroleum product
storage tanks and tanker truck loading facilities. refineries and petrochemical plants carry out operational management
to ensure compliance with emission standards under laws and regulations and with emission limits prescribed by regional
                                      *1
pollution prevention agreements.

to reduce sox emissions, sulfur is removed from byproduct gases generated by various types of equipment and then
used as fuel, while sox is removed from smoke using exhaust gas desulfurizers. nox emissions are reduced through                                   measures to reduce voc emissions

     ground and groundwater pollution prevention

since fiscal 2002, the idemitsu group has been implementing autonomous surveys of ground and groundwater pollution
and undertaking purification measures. by fiscal 2009, the group completed on-schedule surveys at about 1,300 sites,
including refineries, petrochemical plants, oil depots, idemitsu-owned service stations and idle land. at those locations
where we discover any contamination, we place priority on preventing the impact of this contamination from spreading
beyond the business site and make ongoing efforts for the remediation of contaminated soil or groundwater.
