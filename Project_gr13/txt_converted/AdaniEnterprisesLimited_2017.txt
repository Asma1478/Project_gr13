     the indian economy is
     set into climb to a higher
     growth orbit on account
     of the government’s far-
     reaching policy actions
     including demonetization,
     which delegalized almost
     85% of the currency in the
     system in november 2016,
     and the implementation

2    summary of significant accounting policies

a)   statement of compliance
     the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with indian accounting standards (ind as)
     notified under the companies (indian accounting standards) rules, 2015. the company has adopted ind as with effect
     from 1st april, 2016 in accordance with the notification issued by the ministry of corporate affairs.
     for all periods up to and including the year ended 31st march, 2016, the company had prepared its financial statements
     in accordance with accounting standards notified under the section 133 of the companies act, 2013, read together with
     rule 7 of the companies (accounts) rules, 2014 (‘previous gaap’).
     these financial statements are the first financial statements of the company under ind as. the date of transition to ind
     as is april 1, 2015. previous year numbers in the financial statements have been restated as per ind as. refer to note 3 for
     information on how the transition from previous gaap to ind as has affected the previously reported financial position,
     financial performance and cash flows.

b)   basis of preparation of financial statements
     the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments that
     are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies. fair value is the
     price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between the market
     participants at the measurement date.

c)   use of estimates and judgements
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ind as requires management to make certain judgements,
     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including
     contingent liabilities) and the accompanying disclosures. future results could differ due to these estimates and differences
     between the actual results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.

     estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:
  i)     useful life of property, plant and equipments and intangible assets:
		       determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and the assessment
         as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. useful life of these assets is based on the life prescribed in
         schedule ii to the companies act, 2013 or based on technical estimates, taking into account the nature of the asset,
         estimated usage, expected residual values and operating conditions of the asset.

  ii)    impairment:
		       determining whether property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of
         the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. the value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash
         flow model over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or cash generating units. further, the cash flow
         projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to expected revenues, operational performance of the
         assets, market prices of related products or services, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by
         the management.

  iii) taxes:
		     the company’s tax jurisdiction is india. significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the
       purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/
       recovered for uncertain tax positions. significant management judgement is also required to determine the amount
       of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits
       together with future tax planning strategies, including estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of
       available benefits from the income tax act, 1961.


                                                                                                                             111

  iv) fair value measurement of financial instruments:
		    when the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured
      based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques, including the
      discounted cash flow model, which involve various judgements and assumptions.

  v)        defined benefit plans:
		          the cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined
            using actuarial valuations. an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual
            developments in the future. these include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality
            rates. due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly
            sensitive to changes in these assumptions. all assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.

d)    current & non-current classification
      any asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions:
      i)    the asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled in the company’s normal operating cycle;
      ii)   the asset is intended for sale or consumption;
      iii) the asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
      iv) the asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled within twelve months after the reporting period;
      v)    the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
            twelve months after the reporting date;
      vi) in the case of a liability, the company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
          least twelve months after the reporting date.
      all other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.
      for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities, the company has ascertained its normal
      operating cycle as twelve months. this is based on the nature of services and the time between the acquisition of assets
      or inventories for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents.

e)    foreign currency translation
  i)        functional and presentation currency
		          the financial statements are presented in indian rupee (h), which is entity’s functional and presentation currency.

  ii)       transactions and balances

            rates at the dates of the transactions.
      all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the reporting
      date. exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in statement of profit
      and loss with the exception of exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency monetary items recognised
      in the financial statements as at 31st march, 2016 and related to acquisition of a fixed assets and such differences are
      capitalised and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. non-monetary items that are measured in
      terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

f)    cash & cash equivalents
      cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit with banks. cash equivalents are short-term balances (with an original
      maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into
      known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

g)    property, plant and equipment
      i) property, plant and equipments, including capital work in progress, are stated at cost of acquisition or construction
          less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax credits,
          wherever applicable), import duty and other non-refundable taxes or levies and any directly attributable cost of
          bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. borrowing cost relating to acquisition / construction

           of property, plant and equipment which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also
           included to the extent they relate to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use. the present value of the
           expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the
           recognition criteria for a provision are met.
     ii)   subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment are included in its carrying amount or
           recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
           with the item will flow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other expenses on existing
           property, plant and equipments, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts,
           are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred.
     iii) the company adjusts exchange differences arising on translation/settlement of long-term foreign currency monetary
          items existing as at march 31, 2016 and pertaining to the acquisition of a depreciable asset to the cost of the asset
          and depreciates the same over the remaining useful life of the asset. the depreciation on such foreign exchange
          difference is recognised from the first day of the financial year.
     iv) depreciation is provided using straight-line method as specified in schedule ii to the companies act, 2013. estimated
         useful life of assets are determined based on technical parameters / assessments. depreciation on assets acquired /
         disposed off during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal. leasehold
         land and leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the lease.

           expected to arise from continued use of the asset. any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of property,
           plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the
           assets and is recognised in statement of profit and loss.

h)   investment properties
     i) property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property.
         investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition,
         investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any.
     ii)   investment properties currently comprises of plot of lands only and hence the same are not depreciated.
     iii) investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently
          withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. the difference between the net
          disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in
          which the property is derecognised.

i)   intangible assets
     i) intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated
         amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. internally generated intangibles are not capitalised.
     ii)   the intangible assets of the company are assessed to be of finite lives and are amortised over the useful economic life
           and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the company
           reviews amortisation period on an annual basis.
		         intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
            intangible assets                                            estimated useful life (years)
            software applications                                        3-5 years based on management estimate
            mine development assets                                      over a period of underlying contract
     iii) gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
          disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when
          the asset is derecognised.

j)   impairment of non-financial assets
     i) the carrying amount of the non-financial assets of the company is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
        whether there is any indication of impairment. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is
        estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.



                                                                                                                                 113

notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
      ii)   the impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generation unit exceeds its
            recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in
            use which is determined based on the estimated future cash flow discounted to their present value. all impairment
            losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
      iii) an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
           and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. the reversal is limited so that the increased carrying amount
           does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in
           prior years.

k)    investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
      investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are measured at cost less impairment in accordance with ind as
      27 “separate financial statements”.

l)    financial instruments
      a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
      instrument of another entity.
      financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. transaction costs that are directly attributable
      to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at
      fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as
      appropriate, on initial recognition. transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial
      liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss.
      an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of
      its liabilities. equity instruments issued by a company entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue
      costs.

  a) financial assets
		   all financial assets, except investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are recognised initially at fair
     value.
		          the measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as described below:

		 1)           at amortised cost
			             a financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met :
			             (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash
                    flows, and
			             (b) contractual terms of the asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                    and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
			             this category is the most relevant to the company. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently
                measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method. amortised cost is calculated by taking
                into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir
                amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. the losses arising from impairment
                are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. this category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

		 2)           at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvtoci)
			             a financial asset is classified as at the fvtoci if both of the following criteria are met:
			             a)   the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the
                     financial assets, and
			             (b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                    and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
			             debt instruments included within the fvtoci category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at
                fair value. fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (oci) and on derecognition,




114

                                                                 adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
             cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in oci is reclassified to statement of profit and loss. for equity
             instruments, the company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value
             in oci. if the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci, then all fair value changes on the
             instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the oci. there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to
             statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment.

		 3)        at fair value through profit & loss (fvtpl)
			          fvtpl is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments. financial assets
             included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of
             profit and loss.
			          in addition, the company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost
             or fvtoci criteria, as at fvtpl. however, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a
             measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).

         derecognition
		       on derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the
         consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
         income and accumulated in equity is recognised in statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have
         otherwise been recognised in statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.

		       impairment of financial assets
		       the company applies expected credit loss (ecl) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the
         financial assets and credit risk exposure. the company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses
         associated with its receivables based on historical trends and past experience.
		       the company follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade receivables or
         contractual receivables. under the simplified approach the company does not track changes in credit risk, but it
         recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
         if credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss. however, if credit risk
         has increased significantly, lifetime ecl is used.
		       ecl is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the company in accordance with the contract
         and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive, discounted at the original eir. ecl impairment loss
         allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as income / (expense) in the statement of profit
         and loss.

  b) financial liabilities
		   financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss. the
     measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

		       at amortised cost
		       this is the category most relevant to the company. after initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently
         measured at amortised cost using the eir method. gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss
         when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process. amortised cost is calculated by
         taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the
         eir amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

		at fair value through profit & loss (fvtpl)
		 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
   designated upon initial recognition as such. subsequently, any changes in fair value are recognised in the statement
   of profit and loss.

		       derecognition of financial liability
		       a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. the
         difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.




                                                                                                                                  115

notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
      c) derivative financial instruments
		          initial recognition and subsequent measurement
		          the company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward and options currency contracts to hedge its
            foreign currency risks. such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at
            fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl). derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and
            as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.
		          any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised in the
            statement of profit and loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss) not within results from operating
            activities. changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments
            relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance expense.

m) income taxes
   income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the
   year. current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that
   are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also
   recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

  i)        current income tax
		          provision for current tax is measured at the amount of tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year
            as determined in accordance with the provisions of the income tax act, 1961. current income tax assets and liabilities
            are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
		          current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the company has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends
            either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

  ii)       deferred tax
		          deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
            recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and
            their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
            a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time
            of the transaction.
		          deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
            the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
            utilised. the carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to assess
            their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying values of deferred tax assets in the financial
            statements.
		          deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
            is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
            at the reporting date.
		          deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets and
            liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
		          deferred tax includes mat tax credit. the company recognises tax credits in the nature of mat credit as an asset only
            to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the company will pay normal income tax during the specified
            period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward. the company reviews the such tax credit
            asset at each reporting date to assess its recoverability.

n)    inventories
      i) inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value.
      ii)   cost of inventories have been computed to include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion and other costs incurred
            in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
      iii) the basis of determining cost for various categories of inventories are as follows:




116

                                                                 adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
		       raw material                weighted average cost
		       traded goods                weighted average cost
		       stores and spares           weighted average cost
     iv) net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost of completion
         and estimated cost necessary to make the sale. necessary adjustment for shortage / excess stock is given based on
         the available evidence and past experience of the company.

o)   provision, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
     provisions are recognised for when the company has at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result of past events,
     only if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic outgo or loss will be required and if the amount
     involved can be measured reliably. if the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using
     a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. when discounting is used, the
     increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
     contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a result of past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by
     the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more future events not wholly in control of the company are not recognised
     in the accounts. the nature of such liabilities and an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial
     statements.
     contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. the nature of such assets and an estimate of its financial
     effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements.

p)   revenue recognition
     revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the
     revenue can be reliably measured. revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking
     into account contractually defined terms of payment. amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances,
     rebates and taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
     the specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.

     sale of goods
     revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the goods have been
     passed to the customer.

     rendering of services
     revenue from services rendered is recognised when the work is performed and as per the terms of agreement.

     dividends
     revenue is recognised when the company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when
     shareholders approve the dividend.

     interest income
     interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate
     applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the
     financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.

q)   employee benefits
     employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated absences, contribution to provident fund, employees’ state insurance
     and superannuation fund.

     short term employee benefits
     employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short term employee
     benefits and recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

     post employment benefits
  i)     defined contribution plans
		       retirement benefits in the form of provident fund and superannuation fund are defined contribution schemes. the



                                                                                                                                117

notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
          company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. the company recognises
          contribution payable to the these funds as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.

  ii)     defined benefit plans
		        the company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan. the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan
          is determined based on actuarial valuation, carried out by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit
          method. the liability for gratuity is funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained with the life insurance corporation
          of india and sbi life insurance company limited.
		        re-measurements gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
          recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other
          comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in
          subsequent periods. net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of defined benefit
          liability or asset.
		        the company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement
          of profit and loss in the line item “employee benefits expense”:
		        -   service cost including current service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine
              settlements; and
		        -   net interest expense or income

  iii) other long term employee benefits
		     other long term employee benefits comprise of compensated absences/leaves. the actuarial valuation is done as
       per projected unit credit method. remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
       assumptions are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
      iv) for the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans and other long term benefits, the allocation between current
          and non-current provisions has been made as determined by an actuary.

r)    borrowing costs
      borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily
      takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the
      asset. borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of
      funds. borrowing costs also includes exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are
      regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. all other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period
      in which they are incurred.

s)    leases
      a lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. leases are classified as finance leases
      whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. all other leases
      are classified as operating leases. the company has identified all its leases as operating leases.

  i)      assets taken on operating lease :
		        operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis
          over the lease term.

  ii)     assets given on operating lease :
		        assets subject to operating leases are included in fixed assets. rental income from operating leases is recognised
          in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. costs including depreciation are
          recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

t)    segment accounting
      operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to management. for management
      purposes, the company is organised into business units based on its products and services.
      operating results of the business units are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource
      allocation and performance assessment. segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured
      consistently with profit or loss in the financial statements.

                                                                adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
u)   related party transactions
     disclosure of transactions with related parties, as required by ind as 24 “related party disclosures” has been set out
     in a separate note. related parties as defined under clause 9 of the ind as 24 have been identified on the basis of
     representations made by the management and information available with the company.

v)   earning per share
     basic eps is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity shareholders of the company by the
     weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. diluted eps is computed by adjusting the profit
     or loss attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity shares, for the effects
     of all dilutive potential equity shares.

w) proposed dividend
   the company recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the distribution
   is no longer at the discretion of the company. as per the companies act 2013, a distribution is authorised when it is
   approved by the shareholders. a corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

x)   service work in progress
     service work in progress is valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined based on weighted average
     cost method.
     service work in progress represents closing inventory of washed and reject coal, which is not owned by the company
     as per the terms of mdo contract. hence, this represents work performed under contractual liability in bringing this
     inventory to its present condition and location.
     net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion
     and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

y)   overburden cost adjustment
     overburden removal expenses incurred during production stage are charged to revenue based on waste-to-ore ratio,
     (commonly known as stripping ratio in the industry). this ratio is taken based on the current operational phase of overall
     mining area. to the extent the current period ratio exceeds the expected stripping ratio of a phase, excess overburden
     costs incurred in a period are deferred and shown under “other non-current assets”.

z)   expenditure
     expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where applicable.

3    first-time adoption of ind-as
     the company has adopted ind as from 1st april, 2016 and the date of transition to ind as is 1st april, 2015. these being the
     first financial statements in compliance with ind as, the impact of transition has been accounted for in opening reserves
     and comparable periods have been restated in accordance with ind as 101 –“first-time adoption of indian accounting
     standards”. the company has presented a reconciliation of its equity under previous gaap to its equity under ind as as
     at 1st april, 2015 and 31st march, 2016 and of the total comprehensive income for the year ended 31st march, 2016 as
     required by ind as 101.
     following are the applicable ind as 101 optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions applied in the transition from
     previous gaap to ind as.

a)   deemed cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
     the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its property, plant and equipments and intangible
     assets recognised as of 1st april, 2015 measured as per the previous gaap and use that carrying value as its deemed cost
     on transition date.

b)   deemed cost of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
     the company has elected to continue with the carrying value of its investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
     recognised as of 1st april, 2015 measured as per the previous gaap and use that carrying value as its deemed cost of
     transition date.




                                                                                                                             119

notes forming part of the financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017
c)    exchange differences on long term foreign currency borrowings
      the company has elected to continue the policy adopted for accounting for exchange differences arising from translation
      of long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding and recognised in the financial statements for the period
      ending immediately before the beginning of the first ind as financial reporting period as at 31st march, 2016 as per the
      previous gaap.

d)    business combinations
      the company has elected to apply ind as 103 “business combination” prospectively to business combinations occurring
      after its transition date. hence, the company has not restated past business combinations that have an acquisition date
      prior to the transition date.

e)    embedded leases
      the company has opted not to apply the requirements of appendix c to ind as 17 retrospectively. based on this exemption,
      assessment of whether an arrangement contains a lease or not has been made on the basis of facts and circumstances
      existing as at the transition date, instead of at the inception of contract or arrangement.

f)    derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
      the company has applied the derecognition requirements of financial assets and financial liabilities prospectively for
      transactions occurring on or after transition date.

g)    classification and measurement of financial assets
      the company has assessed classification and measurement of financial assets on the basis of facts and circumstances
      that exist as on transition date.

h)    impairment of financial assets
      the company has applied impairment requirements of ind as 109 retrospectively; however, as permitted by ind as 101, it
      has used reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to determine the credit risk
      at the date that financial instruments were initially recognised in order to compare it with the credit risk at the transition
      date.

i)    assessment of embedded derivatives
      the company has assessed whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and
      accounted for as a derivative on the basis of the conditions that existed at the later of the date it first became a party to
      the contract and the date when there has been a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash
      flows that otherwise would be required under the contract.

notes to above reconciliations :
a)   mtm on derivative financial instruments :
     derivative financial instruments have been fair valued through profit and loss under ind as. under previous gaap, the
     net mark to market losses on derivative financial instruments, other than those designated as cash flow hedges, were
     recognised in statement of profit and loss, and the net gains, if any, were ignored.

b)   impact on accounting of financial instruments at amortised cost :
     the company has valued financial assets (other than investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries and associates which are
     accounted at cost) and financial liabilities, at fair value at the inception of the contract. impact of fair value changes as
     on date of transition, is recognised in opening reserves. these financial instruments have been subsequently accounted
     under the amortised cost model, with resultant changes thereafter being recognised in statement of profit and loss.

c)   actuarial valuation :
     actuarial gains / losses on account of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.

d)   accounting for asset retirement obligations :
     cost of decommissioning any item of property, plant and equipment is included in the initial cost thereof and a liability
     equivalent to present value of such costs is recognised. depreciation on asset and imputed interest on the provision is
     subsequently recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

e)   deferred tax :
     the impact of transition adjustments together with ind as mandate of using balance sheet approach (against profit and
     loss approach in the previous gaap) for computation of deferred taxes has resulted in charge to reserves on the date of
     transition, with consequential impact in the statement of profit and loss for the subsequent periods.

f)   reversal of proposed dividend (including tax) :
     under previous gaap, dividends proposed by the board of directors after the reporting date but before the approval
     of financial statements were considered to be adjusting event and accordingly recognised (along with related dividend
     distribution tax) as liability at the reporting date. under ind as, dividends are recognised when the same is approved by
     the shareholders in the general meeting. accordingly, provision for so proposed dividend and dividend distribution tax
     recognised under previous gaap has been reversed.

39 financial instruments and risk review (contd.)

      level-1 : inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
      level-2 : inputs are other than quoted prices included within level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
      directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
      level-3 : inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). fair values are determined in whole or
      in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current
      market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
      the following tables summarises carrying amounts of financial instruments by their categories and their levels in fair value
      hierarchy for each year end presented.

(ii) credit risk
     credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty or customer will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a
     loss to the company. financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist of loans, trade and other
     receivables, cash & cash equivalents, investments and other financial assets. the carrying amounts of financial assets
     represent the maximum credit risk exposure.
      credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as
      concentration of risks. credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of counter parties on
      continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits. credit risk from balances with banks,
      financial institutions and investments is managed by the company’s treasury team in accordance with the company’s risk
      management policy. cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good
      past track record and high quality credit rating.
      since the company has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk is foreseen. a
      significant portion of the company’s receivables are due from public sector units (which are government undertakings)
      and hence may not entail any credit risk.

(iii) liquidity risk
      liquidity risk refers the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its
      financial liabilities. the company’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its obligations when they are due
      in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the company’s
      reputation. the company monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. these models consider the maturity
      of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
    the tables below provide details regarding contractual maturities of significant liabilities as at the end of each year end
    presented.

    succeed with enforcement of their assessments, the company may be required to pay some or all of the asserted claims
    and consequential interest and penalties, which would reduce net income in the respective reported period.

		        the sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit
          obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
          assumptions may be correlated. there is no change in method of valuation for the prior period.

                                                                                           31st march, 2017 31st march, 2016
          within 1 year                                                                                 3.98              3.63
          1 to 5 years                                                                                  5.46               4.10
          5 to 10 years                                                                                 5.30              5.96

      (c) the estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial valuation, take account of inflation, seniority, promotion

          ind as with effect from april 1, 2016 in accordance with the notification issued by the ministry of corporate affairs.
		        for all periods up to and including the year ended 31st march, 2016, the group had prepared its financial statements
          in accordance with accounting standards notified under the section 133 of the companies act, 2013, read together
          with rule 7 of the companies (accounts) rules, 2014 (‘previous gaap’).
		        these consolidated financial statements are the first consolidated financial statements of the group under ind as.
          the date of transition to ind as is april 1, 2015. previous year numbers in the consolidated financial statements have
          been restated as per ind as. refer note 3 for information on how the transition from previous gaap to ind as has
          affected the previously reported consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated
          cash flows.

  ii)     basis of measurement
		        the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial
          instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting
          policies. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
          transaction between the market participants at the measurement date.

  iii) principles of consolidation
		     the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the company, its subsidiaries and equity
       accounting of its investment in associates and joint ventures.
		        consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other
          events in similar circumstances. if a member of the group uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the
          consolidated financial statements, appropriate adjustments are made to that group member’s financial statements in
          preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure conformity with the group’s accounting policies.
		        the financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as
          that of the parent company. when the end of the reporting period of the parent is different from that of a subsidiary,
          joint venture or associate, the respective entity prepares, for consolidation purposes, additional financial information
          as of the same date as the financial statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial
          information of the said entity, unless it is impracticable to do so.
		        the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis.

          subsidiaries
		        subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has control. the group controls an entity when the group is exposed,
          or has rights, to variable returns from its power and involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those
          returns through its power over the investee.
		        subsidiaries are considered for consolidation when the group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
          group loses control of the subsidiary. subsidiaries have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis by adding together
          the book values of the like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. intercompany transactions,
          balances and unrealised gains resulting on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. unrealised losses resulting

        from intra-group transactions are eliminated in arriving at the carrying amount of assets unless transaction provides
        an evidence of impairment of transferred asset.
		      non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the group and are presented
        separately in the statement of profit and loss and consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders’
        equity, profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (oci) are attributed to the equity holders of
        the parent of the group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having
        a deficit balance.

		associates and joint ventures - equity accounting
		 an associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence. significant influence is the power to
   participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those
   policies.
		      a joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to
        the net assets of the joint arrangement. joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement,
        which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing
        control.
		      the results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial
        statements using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint
        venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the group’s share of post acquisition profits
        or losses and that of other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. distributions received from an
        associate or a joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment. unrealised gains and losses resulting from
        transactions between the group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture.
		      after application of the equity method, at each reporting date, the group determines whether there is objective
        evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. if there exists such evidence, the group
        determines extent of impairment and then recognises the loss in the statement of profit and loss.
		      upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the group measures and
        recognises any retained investment at its fair value. any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or
        the joint venture and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit and
        loss.
		      the list of companies / firms included in consolidation, relationship with the company and shareholding therein is as
        under. the reporting date for all the entities is 31st march, 2017 except otherwise specified.

		       * reporting date is 31st december, 2016

b)   use of estimates and judgements
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ind as requires management to make certain judgements,
     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including
     contingent liabilities) and the accompanying disclosures. future results could differ due to these estimates and differences
     between the actual results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialised.

     estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:
  i)     useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets:
		       determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and the assessment
         as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. useful life of these assets is based on the life prescribed in
         schedule ii to the companies act, 2013 or based on technical estimate, taking into account the nature of the asset,
         estimated usage, expected residual values and operating conditions of the asset.

  ii)    impairment:
		       determining whether property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of
         the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. the value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash
         flow model over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or cash generating units. further, the cash flow
         projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to expected revenues, operational performance of the
         assets, market prices of related products or services, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by
         the management.

  iii) taxes:
		     significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance tax, determining
       the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. significant
       management judgement is also required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised,
       based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies,
       including estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits from the tax laws applicable
       to respective entities.

  iv) fair value measurement of financial instruments:
		    when the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured
      based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques, including the
      discounted cash flow model, which involve various judgements and assumptions.

  v)     defined benefit plans:
		       the cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined
         using actuarial valuations. an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual
         developments in the future. these include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality
         rates. due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly
         sensitive to changes in these assumptions. all assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.




                                                                                                                             189

c)    current & non-current classification
      any asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions :
      i)    the asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled in the group’s normal operating cycle;
      ii)   the asset is intended for sale or consumption;
      iii) the asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
      iv) the asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled within twelve months after the reporting period;
      v)    the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least
            twelve months after the reporting date;
      vi) in the case of a liability, the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
          twelve months after the reporting date.
		          all other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.
		          for the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities, the group has ascertained its normal
            operating cycle as twelve months. this is based on the nature of services and the time between the acquisition of
            assets or inventories for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents.

d)    foreign currency transactions
  i)        functional and presentation currency
		          the financial statements are presented in indian rupee (inr), which is the functional and presentation currency for
            the group.

  ii)       transactions and balances
		          foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, for initial recognition, using the exchange
            rates at the dates of the transactions.
		          all foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the reporting
            date. exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in the statement
            of profit and loss with the exception of exchange differences arising on long-term foreign currency monetary items
            recognised in the financial statements as at march 31, 2016 and related to acquisition of a fixed assets and such
            differences are capitalised and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. non-monetary items
            that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
		          exchange differences arising on other outstanding long term foreign currency monetary items as at march 31, 2017
            are accumulated in the “foreign currency monetary item translation difference account” and amortised over the
            remaining life of the concerned monetary item.

  iii) group companies
		     on consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at
       the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss are translated using average rate of exchange prevailing
       during the year, which approximates to the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. all resulting exchange
       differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in oci. on disposal of a foreign operation, the
       component of oci relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

e)    cash & cash equivalents
      cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit with banks. cash equivalents are short-term balances (with an original
      maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into
      known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

f)    property, plant and equipment
      i) property, plant and equipment, including capital work in progress, are stated at cost of acquisition or construction
          less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax credits,
          wherever applicable), import duty and other non-refundable taxes or levies and any directly attributable cost of
          bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. borrowing cost relating to acquisition / construction
          of property, plant and equipment which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also

                                                                  adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

          included to the extent they relate to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use. the present value of the
          expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the
          recognition criteria for a provision are met.
    ii)   subsequent expenditure related to an item of property, plant and equipment are included in its carrying amount or
          recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
          with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other expenses on existing
          property, plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts,
          are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred.
    iii) the group adjusts exchange differences arising on translation/settlement of long-term foreign currency monetary
         items existing as at march 31, 2016 and pertaining to the acquisition of a depreciable asset to the cost of the asset
         and depreciates the same over the remaining useful life of the asset. the depreciation on such foreign exchange
         difference is recognised from the first day of the financial year.
    iv) depreciation is provided using straight-line method as specified in schedule ii to the companies act, 2013. estimated
        useful life of assets are determined based on technical parameters / assessments. depreciation on assets acquired /
        disposed off during the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal. leasehold
        land and leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the lease.
    v)    an item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
          expected to arise from continued use of the asset. any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of property,
          plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the
          assets and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
  vi) oil & gas assets:
		    expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil and gas are expensed off
      in the year of incurrence to the extent of the efforts not successful. expenditure incurred on the acquisition of the
      license are initially capitalised on a license by license basis. costs including indirect cost incurred for the block are
      held, undepleted within “capital work in progress” until the exploration phase relating to the license area is complete
      or commercial oil & gas reserves have been discovered. indirect costs are expensed off in the year of incurrence.
		        exploratory/appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised within “capital work in progress” on a block by block basis
          until the success or otherwise of the block is established. the success or failure of each exploration/appraisal effort
          is judged on a block basis.
		        where results of seismic studies or exploration drilling indicate the presence of oil & gas reserves which are ultimately
          not considered commercially recoverable and no additional exploratory activity is firmly planned, all related costs are
          written off to the statement of profit and loss in the year of cessation of the exploration activity.
  vii) exploration and evaluation assets:
		     exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises cost that are directly attributable to :
		        -   cost of acquiring mining and exploration tenements;
		        -   research and analysing historical exploration data;
		        -   conducting topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
		        -   conducting exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
		        -   examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or
		        -   compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies.
		        exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for mineral deposits with economic potential. evaluation
          expenditure arises from detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been identified as having
          economic potential.
		        exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to statement of profit and loss as incurred unless the directors are
          confident of the project’s technical and commercial feasibility and it is probable that economic benefits will flow to
          the group, in which case expenditure may be capitalised.
		        capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is treated as a tangible asset and is recorded at cost less any



                                                                                                                                191

notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

            accumulated impairment charges. no amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase as the
            assets is not available for use.

g)    investment property
      i) property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property.
          investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition,
          investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any.
      ii)   the group depreciates investment properties over their estimated useful lives, which are determined based on
            technical evaluation and management estimates.
      iii) investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently
           withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. the difference between the net
           disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in
           which the property is derecognised.

h)    intangible assets
      i) intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated
          amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. internally generated intangibles are not capitalised.
      ii)   the intangible assets of the group are assessed to be of finite lives and are amortised over the useful economic life
            and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. the group
            reviews amortisation period on an annual basis.
		          intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:
             intangible assets                                            estimated useful life (years)
             software applications                                        3-5 years based on management estimate
             mine development assets                                      over a period of underlying contract
      iii) gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
           disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when
           the asset is derecognised.

i)    impairment of non-financial assets
      i) the carrying amount of the non-financial assets of the group is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
         whether there is any indication of impairment. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is
         estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment.
      ii)   the impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generation unit exceeds its
            recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less cost of disposal and value in
            use which is determined based on the estimated future cash flow discounted to their present value. all impairment
            losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
      iii) an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
           and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. the reversal is limited so that the increased carrying amount
           does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in
           prior years.
      iv) goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as at year end or when
          circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. impairment for these assets is determined by
          assessing the recoverable amount of each cgu to which they relate. when the recoverable amount of the cgu is less
          than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in
          future periods.

j)    service concession arrangements
      service concession arrangements (sca) refers to an arrangement between the grantor (a public sector entity) and the
      operator (a private sector entity) to provide services that give the public access to major economic and social facilities
      utilising private sector funds and expertise.

                                                                   adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

     with respect to sca, revenue and costs are allocated between those relating to construction services and those relating to
     operation and maintenance services, and accounted for separately. the infrastructure used in a concession are classified
     as an intangible asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature of the payment entitlements under the sca. when
     the company has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor,
     such right is recognised as a financial asset and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. when the demand risk is
     with the group and it has right to charge the user for use of facility, the right is recognised as an intangible asset and is
     subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. the intangible assets are amortised
     over a period of service concession arrangements.

k)   government grants & subsidies
     government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
     and all attached conditions will be complied with.
     when the grant relates to an expense item, it is deferred and recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss on
     a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match the related costs, which they are intended to compensate.
     when the grant relates to an asset or a non-monetary item, it is recognised as deferred income under liabilities and is
     recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the
     related asset or a non-monetary item.

l)   financial instruments
     a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
     instrument of another entity.
     financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. transaction costs that are directly attributable
     to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at
     fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as
     appropriate, on initial recognition. transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial
     liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss.
     an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
     liabilities. equity instruments issued by a group entity are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

  a) financial assets
		   all financial assets, except investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are recognised initially at fair
     value.
		       the measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as described below:

		 1)         at amortised cost
			           a financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met :
			           (a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash
                  flows, and
			           (b) contractual terms of the asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                  and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
			           this category is the most relevant to the group. after initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently
              measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (eir) method. amortised cost is calculated by taking
              into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir
              amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. the losses arising from impairment
              are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. this category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

		 2)         at fair value through other comprehensive income (fvtoci)
			           a financial asset is classified as at the fvtoci if both of the following criteria are met:
			           a)   the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the
                   financial assets, and




                                                                                                                                    193

notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

			          (b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                 and interest (sppi) on the principal amount outstanding.
			          debt instruments included within the fvtoci category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at
             fair value. fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (oci) and on derecognition,
             cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in oci is reclassified to statement of profit and loss. for equity
             instruments, the group may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value in oci.
             if the group decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci, then all fair value changes on the instrument,
             excluding dividends, are recognised in the oci. there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to the statement of
             profit and loss, even on sale of investment.

   3)        at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl)
			          fvtpl is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments. financial assets
             included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of
             profit and loss.
			          in addition, the group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or fvtoci
             criteria, as at fvtpl. however, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or
             recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).

		derecognition
		 on derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the
   consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
   income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been
   recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset.

		      impairment of financial assets
		      the group applies expected credit loss (ecl) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the
        financial assets and credit risk exposure. the group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses
        associated with its receivables based on historical trends and past experience.
		      the group follows ‘simplified approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade receivables
        or contractual receivables. under the simplified approach, the group does not track changes in credit risk, but it
        recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.
        if credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss. however, if credit risk
        has increased significantly, lifetime ecl is used.
		      ecl is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the group in accordance with the contract
        and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive, discounted at the original eir. ecl impairment loss allowance
        (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as expense / (income) in the statement of profit and loss.

  b) financial liabilities
		   financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss. the
     measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

		      at amortised cost
		      this is the category most relevant to the group. after initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured
        at amortised cost using the eir method. gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the
        liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process. amortised cost is calculated by taking
        into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir. the eir
        amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

        at fair value through profit or loss (fvtpl)
		      financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
        designated upon initial recognition as such. subsequently, any changes in fair value are recognised in the statement
        of profit and loss.

                                                                adani enterprises limited 25th annual report 2016-17




notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

        derecognition of financial liability
		      a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. the
        difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

    c) derivative financial instruments
		      initial recognition and subsequent measurement
		      the group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward and options currency contracts to hedge its foreign
        currency risks. such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value
        through profit or loss (fvtpl). derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
        liabilities when the fair value is negative.
		      any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised in the
        statement of profit and loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss) not within results from operating
        activities. changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments
        relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance expense.

m) income taxes
   income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the
   year. current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that
   are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also
   recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

  i)    current income tax
		      provision for current tax is measured at the amount of tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year
        as determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax laws of the concerned jurisdictions. current income tax
        assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.
		      current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either
        to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

  ii)   deferred tax
		      deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
        recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and
        their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
        a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time
        of the transaction.
		      deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
        the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
        utilised. the carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to assess
        their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying values of deferred tax assets in the financial
        statements.
		      deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
        is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted
        at the reporting date.
		      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets and
        liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
		      deferred tax includes mat tax credit. the group recognises tax credits in the nature of mat credit as an asset only to
        the extent that there is convincing evidence that the group will pay normal income tax during the specified period,
        i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward. the group reviews the such tax credit asset at
        each reporting date to assess its recoverability.




                                                                                                                               195

n)    inventories
      i) inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value.
      ii)   cost of inventories have been computed to include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion and other costs incurred
            in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
      iii) the basis of determining cost for various categories of inventories are as follows:
		          raw material		             : weighted average cost
		          traded goods		             : weighted average cost
		          stores and spares		        : weighted average cost
      iv) net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost of completion
          and estimated cost necessary to make the sale. necessary adjustment for shortage / excess stock is given based on
          the available evidence and past experience of the group.

o)    provision, contingent liabilities and contingent assets
      provisions are recognised for when the group has at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result of past events, only
      if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic outgo or loss will be required and if the amount involved
      can be measured reliably. if the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current
      pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. when discounting is used, the increase in the
      provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
      contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a result of past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only
      by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more future events not wholly in control of the group are not recognised
      in the accounts. the nature of such liabilities and an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial
      statements.
      contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. the nature of such assets and an estimate of its financial
      effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements.

p)    revenue recognition
      revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the
      revenue can be reliably measured. revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking
      into account contractually defined terms of payment. amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances,
      rebates and taxes or duties collected on behalf of the government.
      the specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.

      sale of goods
      revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risk and rewards of ownership of the goods have been
      passed to the customer.

      rendering of services
      revenue from services rendered is recognised when the work is performed and as per the terms of agreement.

      service concession arrangements
      revenue related to construction services provided under service concession arrangement is recognised based on the
      stage of completion of the work performed. operation and maintenance services revenue with respect to intangible assets
      is recognised in the period in which the services are provided by the group. finance income is recognised using effective
      interest rate method for financial assets..

      dividends
      revenue is recognised when the group’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders
      approve the dividend.

      interest income
      interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate
      applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the
      financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition.

q)   employee benefits
     employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated absences, contribution to provident fund, employees’ state insurance
     and superannuation fund.

     short term employee benefits
     employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short term employee
     benefits and recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service.

     post employment benefits
  i)     defined contribution plans
		       retirement benefits in the form of provident fund and superannuation fund are defined contribution schemes. the
         group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund. the group recognises contribution
         payable to the these funds as an expense, when an employee renders the related service.

  ii)    defined benefit plans
		       the group operates a defined benefit gratuity plan. the cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan
         is determined based on actuarial valuation, carried out by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit
         method. the liability for gratuity is funded annually to gratuity funds maintained with the life insurance corporation
         of india and sbi life insurance company limited.
		       re-measurements gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
         recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other
         comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. re-measurements are not reclassified to statement of profit
         and loss in subsequent periods. net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of defined
         benefit liability or asset.
		       the group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in the statement of
         profit and loss in the line item “employee benefits expense”:
		       -   service cost including current service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine
             settlements; and
		       -   net interest expense or income

  iii) other long term employee benefits
		     other long term employee benefits comprise of compensated absences/leaves. the actuarial valuation is done as
       per projected unit credit method. remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial
       assumptions are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

     iv) for the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans and other long term benefits, the allocation between current
         and non-current provisions has been made as determined by an actuary.

r)   borrowing costs
     borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset that necessarily
     takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the
     asset. borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of
     funds. borrowing costs also includes exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they
     are regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. all other borrowing costs are recognised in statement of profit and
     loss in the period in which they are incurred.

s)   leases
     a lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease. leases are classified as finance leases
     whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. all other leases
     are classified as operating leases.

  i)     where the group is a lessee :
		       finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased
         property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. lease payments are apportioned between



                                                                                                                              197

notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

          finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining
          balance of the liability. finance charges are recognised as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
		        a leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. however, if there is no reasonable certainty that the
          group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated
          useful life of the asset and the lease term.
		        operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis
          over the lease term.

  ii)     where the group is a lessor :
		        under finance leases, amounts due from lessees are recorded as receivables at the group’s net investment in the
          leases. finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on
          the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
		        assets subject to operating leases are included in fixed assets. rental income from operating leases is recognised
          in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. costs including depreciation are
          recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss.

t)    segment accounting
      operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to management. for management
      purposes, the group is organised into business units based on its products and services.
      operating results of the business units are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource
      allocation and performance assessment. segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss and is measured
      consistently with statement of profit and loss in the financial statements.

u)    related party transactions
      disclosure of transactions with related parties, as required by ind as 24 “related party disclosures” has been set out
      in a separate note. related parties as defined under clause 9 of the ind as 24 have been identified on the basis of
      representations made by the management and information available with the group.

v)    earning per share
      basic eps is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity shareholders of the group by the weighted
      average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. diluted eps is computed by adjusting the profit or loss
      attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders and the weighted average number of equity shares, for the effects of all
      dilutive potential equity shares.

w) proposed dividend
   the group recognises a liability to pay dividend to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the distribution
   is no longer at the discretion of the group. as per the companies act 2013, a distribution is authorised when it is approved
   by the shareholders. a corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity.

x)    service work in progress
      service work in progress is valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined based on weighted average
      cost method.
      service work in progress represents closing inventory of washed and reject coal, which is not owned by the group as per
      the terms of mdo contract. hence, this represents work performed under contractual liability in bringing this inventory to
      its present condition and location.
      net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion
      and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

y)    overburden cost adjustment
      overburden removal expenses incurred during production stage are charged to revenue based on waste-to-ore ratio,
      (commonly known as stripping ratio in the industry). this ratio is taken based on the current operational phase of overall
      mining area. to the extent the current period ratio exceeds the expected stripping ratio of a phase, excess overburden
      costs incurred in a period are deferred and shown under “other non-current assets”.

z) expenditure
expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where applicable.

3     first-time adoption of ind-as
      the group has adopted ind as from 1st april, 2016 and the date of transition to ind as is 1st april, 2015. these being the
      first financial statements in compliance with ind as, the impact of transition has been accounted for in opening reserves
      and comparable periods have been restated in accordance with ind as 101 “first-time adoption of indian accounting
      standards”. the company has presented a reconciliation of its equity under previous gaap to its equity under ind as as
      at 1st april, 2015 and 31st march, 2016 and of the total comprehensive income for the year ended 31st march, 2016 as
      required by ind as 101.
3.1 following are the applicable ind as 101 optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions applied in the transition from
    previous gaap to ind as.

(a) deemed cost of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
    the group has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its property, plant and equipments and intangible assets
    recognised as of 1st april, 2015 measured as per the previous gaap and use that carrying value as its deemed cost on
    transition date.

(b) investment in joint ventures
    when changing from proportionate consolidation method to equity method, the group has elected to measure its initial
    investment in joint ventures at the date of transition as the aggregate of carrying amount of assets and liabilities that the
    group had previously proportionately consolidated, including any goodwill arising from acquisition.

(c) exchange differences on long term foreign currency borrowings
    the group has elected to continue the policy adopted for accounting for exchange differences arising from translation of
    long-term foreign currency monetary items outstanding and recognised in the financial statements for the period ending
    immediately before the beginning of the first ind as financial reporting period as at 31st march, 2016 as per the previous
    gaap.

(d) business combinations
    the group has elected to apply ind as 103 “business combination” prospectively to business combinations occurring after
    its transition date. hence, the group has not restated past business combinations that have an acquisition date prior to
    the transition date.

(e) embedded leases
    the group has opted not to apply the requirements of appendix c to ind as 17 retrospectively. based on this exemption,
    assessment of whether an arrangement contains a lease or not has been made on the basis of facts and circumstances
    existing as at the transition date, instead of at the inception of contract or arrangement.

(f) derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
    the group has applied the derecognition requirements of financial assets and financial liabilities prospectively for
    transactions occurring on or after transition date.

(g) classification and measurement of financial assets
    the group has assessed classification and measurement of financial assets on the basis of facts and circumstances that
    exist as on transition date.

(h) impairment of financial assets
    the group has applied impairment requirements of ind as 109 retrospectively; however, as permitted by ind as 101, it has
    used reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort to determine the credit risk
    at the date that financial instruments were initially recognised in order to compare it with the credit risk at the transition
    date.

(i)   assessment of embedded derivatives
      the group has assessed whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted




                                                                                                                             199

     for as a derivative on the basis of the conditions that existed at the later of the date it first became a party to the contract
     and the date when there has been a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that
     otherwise would be required under the contract.

3.2 reconciliations between previous gaap and ind as
ind as 101 requires an entity to reconcile equity, total comprehensive income and cash flows for prior period. the following
tables represent the reconciliations from previous gaap to ind as:

(c) notes to above reconciliations :
a)   mtm on derivative financial instruments :
     derivative financial instruments have been fair valued through profit and loss under ind as. under previous gaap, the
     net mark to market losses on derivative financial instruments, other than those designated as cash flow hedges, were
     recognised in statement of profit and loss, and the net gains, if any, were ignored.

notes forming part of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31st march, 2017

b)   impact on accounting of financial instruments at amortised cost :
     the company has valued financial assets (other than investment in joint ventures and associates) and financial liabilities,
     at fair value at the inception of the contract. impact of fair value changes as on date of transition, is recognised in opening
     reserves. these financial instruments have been subsequently accounted under the amortised cost model, with resultant
     changes thereafter being recognised in statement of profit and loss.

c)   actuarial valuation :
     actuarial gains / losses on account of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.

d)   service concession accounting :
     as per ind as, property, plant & equipment (ppe) related to service concession arrangements for providing agri- storage
     facilities has been derecognised and classified into financial asset and intangible asset.

e)   other ind as impacts include :
     - asset retirement obligation and its amortisation
     - reversal of amortised goodwill
     - amortisation of government grants as deferred income

f)   deferred tax :
     the impact of transition adjustments together with ind as mandate of using balance sheet approach (against profit and
     loss approach in the previous gaap) for computation of deferred taxes has resulted in charge to reserves on the date of
     transition, with consequential impact in the statement of profit and loss for the subsequent periods.

g)   reversal of proposed dividend (including tax) :
     under previous gaap, dividends proposed by the board of directors after the reporting date but before the approval
     of financial statements were considered to be adjusting event and accordingly recognised (along with related dividend
     distribution tax) as liability at the reporting date. under ind as, dividends are recognised when the same is approved by the
     shareholders in the general meeting. accordingly, provision for proposed dividend and dividend distribution tax recognised
     under previous gaap has been reversed.

h)   investment in joint ventures accounted using equity method :
     investments in joint ventures are accounted for using equity method under ind as. accordingly all assets and liabilities
     pertaining to joint ventures which were proportionately consolidated line by line under previous gaap were excluded and
     principles of equity accounting are applied to these investments. further, effect of ind as adjustments in joint ventures
     accounts have also been included in consolidated financial statements as at transition date.

38 financial instruments and risk review (contd.)

   level-1 : inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
   level-2 : inputs are other than quoted prices included within level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
   directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

      notes :
      (a) investments exclude investment in joint ventures and associates.
      (b) carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities as at the end of the each year presented approximate
          the fair value because of their short term nature. difference between carrying amounts and fair values of other non-
          current financial assets and liabilities subsequently measured at amortised cost is not significant in each of the year
          presented.

(b) financial risk management objective and policies :
    the group’s risk management activities are subject to the management direction and control under the framework of
    risk management policy as approved by the board of directors. the management ensures appropriate risk governance
    framework for the group through appropriate policies and procedures and that risks are identified, measured and managed
    in accordance with the group’s policies and risk objectives.
      the group is primarily exposed to risks resulting from fluctuation in market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, which may
      adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments.

(i)   market risk
      market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, that may result
      from adverse changes in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates.

  a.      foreign currency exchange risk :
		        since the group operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more than one
          currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where assets or liabilities are
          denominated in currency other than functional currency.
		        the group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows established risk
          management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge
          exposure to foreign currency risks.
		        for open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency exposure,
          refer note 39.

         dollar, would have affected the group’s profit for the year as follows:

  b.     interest risk :
		       the group is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management activities. the
         risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates. the group manages its
         interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
		       the group’s risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of central treasury team
         of the adani group under the framework of risk management policy for interest rate risk. the group’s central treasury
         team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework through appropriate policies and procedures and that
         financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the group’s policies and risk objectives.
		       for group’s total borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end
         of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. a 50 basis point increase or decrease is used, which
         represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rate.
                                                                                                                       (h in crores)

		       in case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points and all other variables were held constant, the group’s profit
         for the year would increase or decrease as follows:
                                                                                                                     (h in crores)

(ii) credit risk
     credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty or customer will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to
     the group. financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist of loans, trade and other receivables,
     cash & cash equivalents, investments and other financial assets. the carrying amounts of financial assets represent the
     maximum credit risk exposure.
    credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as
    concentration of risks. credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of counter parties on
    continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits. credit risk from balances with banks,
    financial institutions and investments is managed by the group’s treasury team in accordance with the company’s risk
    management policy. cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good
    past track record and high quality credit rating and also reviews their creditworthiness on an on-going basis. .
    since the group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk is foreseen. a
    significant portion of the group’s receivables are due from public sector units (which are government undertakings) and
    hence may not entail any credit risk.




                                                                                                                                 227

(iii) liquidity risk
      liquidity risk refers the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial
      liabilities. the group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its obligations when they are due in a timely,
      cost effective and reliable manner without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the group’s reputation.
      the group monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. these models consider the maturity of its financial
      investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.
      the tables below provide details regarding contractual maturities of significant liabilities as at the end of each year end
      presented.

(iv) capital management
     for the purpose of the group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital and all other equity reserves attributable
     to the equity shareholders of the group. the primary objective of the group when managing capital is to safeguard its
     ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholder value.
      the group monitors capital using gearing ratio, which is net debt (borrowings as detailed in note 21,25 and 27 less cash
      and bank balances) divided by total capital plus debt.

43 the group has determined the recoverable amounts of its cash generating units (cgu) under indian accounting standard
   (ind as) 36, impairment of assets on the basis of their value in use by estimating the future cash inflows over the estimated
   useful life of the respective cgu. further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to
   contracted market rates, operational performance of the cgu, market prices of inputs, exchange variations, inflation,
   terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the management.

    amounts of the cgu are higher than their carrying amounts as at 31st march, 2017 in most of the cases. however, if this
    estimates and assumption change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the cgu.
    the group has provided for impairment loss in case where recoverable amounts are less than the carrying values.

           was further agreed to sign “delivery notices” before the dispatch of the cargoes. as the receiving terminal was not
           available to the subsidiary company, the delivery notice was not signed which rendered the contract inconclusive
           and ineffective.

           (“lcia”) against the subsidiary company claiming losses for an approximate amount of h648.50 crores (usd 100.00
           million). lcia gave an interim award requiring the subsidiary company to pay h223.08 crores (usd 34.4 million) to

           of the arbitration and conciliation act, 1996, before city civil court, ahmedabad. asean lng filed an application
           in 2009 under order 7 rule 11 read with section 151 of cpc before city civil court, ahmedabad for rejection of
           subsidiary company’s appeal. the city civil court vide order dated 03.03.2012 dismissed the application filed by
