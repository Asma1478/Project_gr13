  dear all stakeholders

  i am very grateful to all people for the
  interest and support.

   it has been 8 years ever since the first publication of the sustainability report of korea east-west power co., ltd.
   (ewp) in 2007. ewp has aimed for sustainable growth and has endeavored to create not only economic sector
   but also social and environmental sectors for entering the global enterprise. so we want to share these
   performances and meanings with all of you.

   through a series of enterprise-wide discussion and communication, ewp has come up with a new corporate
   vision“2030 most valuable power company”in 2013. this vision statement 2030 shows the willingness and
   aspiration of all ewp members to make the company the world class energy company which can create values
   in all aspects with its four core values - creation, passion and challenge, cooperation and integrity, and respect.

   in addition, ewp started the gas turbine(486mw) in ulsan combined cycle power plant to contribute to stabilizing
   the nation’ s electricity supply, while timely completing the construction of the donghae biomass plant to meet the
   environmental policy. ewp also endeavored to improve performances of existing power plants and prevent
   sudden stops through strengthening preventive inspections.

   as a member of society to live together, ewp also made constant efforts to play a leading role in establishing a
   basis for coexistence and cooperation with smbs by discovering their needs and requirements, sharing technical
   information, promoting collaborative development projects, and cultivating new market opportunities. also, ewp
   has tried to spread the culture of sharing through various social contribution projects and programs such as
   multi-culture family aid, job for low income households and support for energy-vulnerable households.

   2013 was also a meaningful year for ewp as the company’    s collective efforts to promote transparent corporate
   management culture have gained a public recognition. ewp was ranked first in the assessment of public
   organization’ s integrity, which is an annual assessment performed by korea’     s anti-corruption & civil rights
   commission(acrc) aiming to root out corruption by assessing the levels of integrity and anti-corruption
   performances of all public sector organizations. ewp had the privilege of winning two prime minister
   commendations in the corruption prevention section(organization) and civil rights & interests(individual) in the at
   the 2014 citizens’shinmungo award.

   the sustainable growth of ewp is not possible without the cooperation and trust of stakeholders. through this
   report, looking back on our performances in last year, we tried to reflect our lacks and share more good points
   for becoming a company that is loved by people and society.

   we will continue making efforts to create values as a leading company in the electric power industry, and putting
   more strengths on the ethical management. all employees of ewp sincerely ask for your interest and advice for
   ensuing activities of ewp. thank you.

ewp challenges first and thinks deeper to become
a global leader.

assigned a goal of reduction to register a new kcer project. also, the uncertainties in the global carbon market is increasing                                   lhv (kcal/kg)          2,500~3,500              3,500~4,500                  4,000                 3,000~3,500          3,500~4,500

registration of new cdms in the eu emission trading scheme from 2013 is only applied to the poorest nations. however, apart
from such uncertainties, ewp continues to find out the projects to reduce ghg and making efforts to fulfill its green goal
successfully. especially, the old ulsan heavy oil thermal power plant is being replaced with a new combined heat and power
plant to reduce about 1,060 kilo tons of ghg emissions.
