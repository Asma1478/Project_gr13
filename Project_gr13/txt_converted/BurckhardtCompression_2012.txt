to our shareholders



                                   dear shareholders
                                   the growing optimism observed during the course of the fiscal year 2010 was tempered in the
                                   year under review by the sovereign debt crisis in europe and the nuclear catastrophe in japan.
                                   the weakness of the euro and us dollar, our two most important reference currencies, against
                                   the swiss franc had a material impact on our business. the markets relevant to burckhardt
                                   compression showed divergent developments during the past year.

                                   significantly higher order intake despite these strong headwinds, order inflow from the markets
                                   of relevance to burckhardt compression was positive. full-year order intake amounted to
                                   chf 404.9 mn, which represents an increase of 11.7% over the previous year. the strong appre-
                                   ciation in the value of the swiss franc versus most other currencies had a negative impact on
                                   reported order intake and its gross profit margin.

                                   improved profitability on slightly lower sales sales of chf 328.9 mn were chf 26.7 mn or 7.5%
                                   lower than in the previous year but gross profit increased by chf 6.7 mn to chf 122.3 mn, result-
                                   ing in a gross profit margin of 37.2%. operating profit rose by chf 3.3 mn or 5.4% from the prior-
                                   year level, which lifted the operating profit margin to 19.7% (17.3% in the previous year). net
                                   income was up by 12.0% and amounted to chf 50.5 mn (chf 45.1 mn in the previous year) or 15.4%
                                   of sales, a respectable achievement considering how challenging the market was last year.

                                   difficult exchange rate situation thanks to the company’s high rate of innovation, productivity
                                   gains and increased sourcing from foreign countries (natural hedging), we have maintained our
                                   sharp competitive edge even though much of the added value we offer our customers is created
                                   in switzerland and despite the unrelenting headwinds on the forex front. the minimum exchange
                                   rate to the euro imposed by the swiss national bank lowered exchange rate volatility and enhanced
                                   planning certainty.

                                   strong balance sheet burckhardt compression strengthened its capital base during the year
                                   under review. equity increased to chf 282.8 mn or a solid 53.3% of the balance sheet total as of
                                   march 31, 2012. holdings of cash and cash equivalents grew as well and amounted to chf 185.0 mn
                                   at the end of the reporting year (chf 149.1 mn in the previous year).

                                   mid range plan reviewed and redefined the executive board and the board of directors thor-
                                   oughly evaluated the company’s medium-term development during the year under review. this
                                   ultimately resulted in a new mid range plan that affirms the company’s independence and inter-
                                   nal growth ambitions. expanding the service and components business, entering new application
                                   areas and broadening the company’s geographic footprint are the operational priorities. our
                                   overall objective is to grow faster than the market and maintain our status as the compressor
                                   industry benchmark.
                                       our business activities revolve around two different sales processes: selling new machines
                                   (building new plants and upgrading existing plants) and providing services, compressor
                                   components and technical support. the latter activities target the same compressor operators.
                                   consequently, we are regrouping our activities into two business areas instead of the former

change in the board of directors heinz bachmann, a director on the board of burckhardt com-
pression holding since 2002, will not be available for re-election at the upcoming annual general
meeting, because he reached the statutory age limit. the board of directors is proposing the elec-
tion of dr. monika krüsi as successor. with this nomination for election the board of directors is
enhancing its competencies in the areas of strategic development and implementation, innova-
tion, growth, and process management. mr. heinz bachmann has accompanied the company since
the management buy-out in 2002 and contributed to its successful development in many ways.

outlook for fiscal year 2012 business in the current year will be shaped in part by the impon-
derables relating to europe’s debt problem, the threat of a slowdown in the global economy, and
exchange rate movements. nevertheless, from today’s perspective, we expect another increase
in order inflow at both business areas in the current fiscal year. thanks to the current high order
backlog, sales will be substantially higher than in the year under review. we expect a somewhat
lower operating profit margin compared to the previous year. this is because of the lower average
margin on orders for compressor systems that will be delivered during the current year. as a              valentin vogt
result of the price concessions that were granted when these orders were placed – because of
the strength of the swiss franc at that time – margins will be lower.

increase of dividend as part of the review and revision of the mid range plan, an increase of
the dividend payout ratio is foreseen. burckhardt compression now intends to pay out 40% to
60% of its net profit to its shareholders. the board of directors is therefore proposing a dividend of
chf 7.00 (chf 5.00 in the previous year) per share at the annual general meeting, which corre-
sponds to a payout ratio of 46% (37% in the previous year) of basic earnings.

a word of thanks on behalf of the board of directors and the executive board, we thank our
shareholders for the loyalty and the trust they have placed in our company. the stability of our
shareholder structure is encouraging and inspiring as we execute our sustainable, long-term-
oriented strategy. we also thank our 983 employees for their untiring efforts and extraordinary
commitment. the trust and confidence our customers have shown in our products and services
are, of course, also highly appreciated.

yours sincerely,
                                                                                                          marcel pawlicek

    burckhardt compression’s product development activities
have been guided by a stage-gate process for a number of years.
this process is first applied in the idea generation and screen-
ing phase and continues during the initial evaluation of product
viability and market attractiveness followed by the elaboration
of product performance specifications, market analysis and
then the actual development and subsequent launch of the
product. after a product has been successfully developed and
placed into operation, a concluding review of the development
project is conducted. all milestones in the stage-gate process
must be presented to and accepted by the “innovation review
team”, which is headed by members of the executive board.

    customers had been hesitant to order spare parts in the
wake of the financial crisis but the currently good capacity uti-
lization rates have alleviated their worries. when capacity is
fully utilized maintaining production output becomes more
important and customers even start thinking about expanding
capacity, which has positive implications for the replacement
and components business as well as for service operations in
general. in the previous year large orders for spare parts were
being placed again and major conversion and renovation proj-
ects were initiated. burckhardt compression has set up a spe-
cial service team for these often highly complex projects that
provides customers with technical support and consulting ser-
vices or can even carry out the entire project. this team quickly
and competently executes engineering, repair, overhaul and
performance enhancement projects for compressors made by
burckhardt compression and other manufacturers. burckhardt

research and development
extended process gas compressor product line a
market success
as expected, the extension of the successful line of process
gas compressors api 618 at the upper end of the performance
range was met with considerable interest in the marketplace.
powered by up to 31 mw, this most recent addition to burckhardt
compression’s line of process gas compressors enables it to
meet all current and foreseeable specifications for large-scale
plants. the order of the first system during the past year marks
an important reference in expanding our position in refinery and
petrochemical applications.

further milestones reached in the development
of a stepless flow control system for reciprocating
compressors
the project for developing and launching a stepless flow control
system for reciprocating compressors passed further mile-
stones in the reporting year. this system offers various process
control advantages and significant energy savings compared to
conventional control systems. initial field tests confirmed the
clearly superior levels of the two key variables of controllability
and energy consumption. the successful conclusion of further
field tests as well as long-term tests across a range of differ-
ent applications will lay the basis for a broad market launch.



brand management
burckhardt compression’s corporate design was updated and
aligned with the company’s long-term branding strategy during
the year under review. new basic visual elements and commu-
nication tools provide a modern platform for projecting com-
pany values and will also support our efforts to strengthen the
brand and raise its international profile.

such measures, most of our waste can be recycled. the rest is
sent to the neighboring waste incineration plant, where district
heating is generated for warm water and room heating. special-

priate and environmentally friendliest manner.

innovation
advanced planning system “way”

burckhardt compression was one of the first in switzerland to introduce the advanced planning system “way” for better
process control. work-in-progress and the key dates for every order can now be easily referenced at any time by planning and
production staff. this provides full transparency throughout the entire value chain and ensures optimal sequence planning.


reliability
condition monitoring and diagnostic systems

prognost systems gmbh, a member of burckhardt compression group, has more than 15 years of specialist experience in
building systems that record and evaluate high-resolution reciprocating compressor data. downtimes and the ensuing costs are
avoided with its state-of-the-art monitoring technology.


safety
laby® compressor on board a lpg tanker

most of the compressors that have been installed on lpg tankers during the past 50 years were made by burckhardt
compression. high demands are placed on the reliability and operating safety of the equipment used on gas carriers.
a lifespan of more than 20 years of operation attests to the unique technology built into laby® compressors.




reliability and endurance
refinery plant, russia

process gas compressors made by burckhardt compression are used at refineries to compress hydrogen, among other
applications. optimal compressor reliability and longevity are achieved by focusing on serviceability as well as the technology
and quality of all key components already during the design and development stages.

3. financial risk management
– basic principles the goal of the group-wide risk manage-
  ment policy is to minimize the negative impact of changes in
  the financing structure and financial markets, particularly
  with regard to currency fluctuations. derivative financial
  instruments such as foreign exchange contracts may be used
  to address the respective risks. burckhardt compression pur-
  sues a conservative, risk averse financial policy. financial risk
  management is based on the principles and regulations estab-
  lished by the board of directors. these govern burckhardt
  compression’s financial policy and outline the conduct and
  powers of the group’s treasury department, which is respon-
  sible for the group-wide management of financial risks. the
  financial principles and regulations govern areas such as
  financing policy, the management of foreign currency risk, the
  use of derivative financial instruments and the investment
  policy applicable to financial resources not required for oper-
  ational purposes.

– liquidity risks each burckhardt compression group company
  is responsible for managing its liquidity so that day-to-day
  business can be handled smoothly, while the group treasury
  is responsible for maintaining the group’s overall liquidity.
  the group subsidiaries in india, brazil and the united arab
  emirates as well as prognost systems gmbh, germany, may
  secure loans from local creditors within the limits approved
  by group management. no other group subsidiaries may do so.
  the group treasury provides the local group companies with
  the necessary funds or invests their excess liquidity. the
  group treasury maintains sufficient liquidity reserves and
  open credit and guarantee lines to fulfill the financial obliga-
  tions at all times.
      burckhardt compression follows the principle of security
  before return in the investment of financial resources. the
  liquidity is invested mainly in the money market (time depos-
  its with first class financial institutions).
      the actual and future cash flows and cash reserves are
  compiled monthly in a rolling liquidity forecast. the executive
  board and the board of directors are informed about the
  liquidity situation and outlook with the regular financial
  reporting.

– interest rate risks burckhardt compression had mortgage
  loans of chf 40.2 mn as per march 31, 2012. the mortgage
  loans have fixed terms of 1 to 7 years and fixed interest rates.
  the funds borrowed from local banks by the indian subsidiary
  amounted to chf 8.9 mn as of march 31, 2012. these bank
  loans have variable interest rates and averaged 13.4% during
  the period under review (previous year 11.5%). burckhardt
  compression does not have any other major borrowings. liquid
  assets not required for operational purposes are deposited in
  current accounts or short-term money market instruments
  and therefore are only exposed to the fluctuations of short-
  term interest rates. for this reason burckhardt compression
  has not performed a sensitivity analysis.

– capital risks the capital managed by burckhardt compres-
  sion is its consolidated equity. with regard to its capital man-
  agement policies, burckhardt compression seeks to secure
  the continuation of its business activities, to achieve an
  acceptable return for the shareholders and to finance the
  growth of the business to a certain extent from own cash flow.
  in order to achieve these objectives burckhardt compression
  can adjust the dividend payments, repay share capital, issue
  new shares or divest parts of the assets.

  balance sheet date using an actuarial-based procedure. for
  these projections assumptions must be made regarding inter-

  lead to significant deviations because of the long-term nature
  of these calculations.

the expected return on plan assets is determined by consider-
ing the attainable returns available on the assets underlying
the current investment policy. the expected long-term return
for investment categories is as follows: 2.0% for bonds, 5.8% for
equities, 3.6% for properties and 3.0% for other investment cat-
egories.
     as stated in the accounting principles, burckhardt compres-
sion will adopt the amendments to ias 19 in 2012 or 2013. due
to the amendments to ias 19, the consolidated equity disclosed
by burckhardt compression will show greater fluctuations in
future periods. the disclosable assets in accordance with ias
19 as per april 1, 2012 would amount to tchf 179 (tchf 115 as
per april 1, 2011) and the disclosable liabilities as per april 1, 2012
would amount to tchf –13’900 (tchf –3’883 as per april 1,
2011). adoption of the amended ias 19 would decrease consoli-
dated shareholders’ equity as per march 31, 2012 by tchf 13’980

08 financial result
financial expenses financial expenses mainly arose from the
local bank funding secured by the indian subsidiary and the
mortgage loan for the commercial real estate in winterthur.
the slight increase in financial expenses in fiscal year 2011 is
attributable to the increase in the interest rates charged to the
indian subsidiary on its local borrowing.

the positive contribution from the fair value measurement of
financial assets.

impairment tests for goodwill goodwill is allocated to the
identifiable cash-generating units of the burckhardt compres-
sion group (crosshead piston compressors and standard high-
pressure compressors). the recoverable amount of a cash-gen-
erating unit is determined by calculating its value in use. these
calculations are based on cash flows projections, which, in turn,
are based on the mid-term plans approved by management. for
this purpose five planning years are taken into consideration,
applying the parameters listed below as well as a terminal
value with no growth at all. management estimated the planned
gross profit margin based on past developments and the expec-
tations regarding future market developments. historical data
were used to make cautious assumptions. the assumptions
listed below were used in the analysis of each cash-generating
unit. no impairment losses were recognized for fiscal years 2011
and 2010.

the test is based on the following assumptions:
– growth rate for sales                                                  6.6%                                       4.8%
– gross margin as % of sales                                            32.7%                                      19.7%
– pre-tax discount rate                                                  8.0%                                       8.0%


the discount rate for discounting projected cash flows equals
the rate which is used for similar purposes in the day-to-day
business. the discount rate applied in the previous fiscal year
for discounting projected cash flows was 8.5%.

    the board of directors will propose to the annual general meeting a dividend of chf 7.00 per share, to be paid in july 2012.

the average number of outstanding shares is calculated based                        sury shares. there are no conversion or option rights outstand-
on the issued shares minus the weighted average number of trea-                     ing; therefore there is no potential dilution of earnings per share.

28 risk management
burckhardt compression has an integrated risk management
policy. in a process consisting of two steps, the board of direc-
tors identifies key risks in an early stage and assigns them into
categories of strategic, financial and operational risks. the
risks are then assessed and processed and consistently moni-
tored, avoided or reduced through adequate risk management
measures. the first step consists of a continuous risk manage-
ment process where risks are systematically identified and
assessed in a periodic leadership cycle at the larger locations
of the burckhardt compression group in order to define and
monitor the necessary measures with responsible people and
deadlines for the according implementation. the second step
consists of a periodic management review which takes place as
part of the semi-annual meeting of the audit committee of the
board of directors. for this purpose the ceo prepares an over-
view of the key risks the burckhardt compression group is
exposed to and presents an assessment of the probability of
such risks to happen and the impact they could have on the
group. the presentation is given to the audit committee of the
board of directors together with adequate measures and
responsible people and deadlines to implement these measures.
the audit committee of the board of directors then informs
the full board about the findings of the risk management
review.

29 events after the balance sheet date
