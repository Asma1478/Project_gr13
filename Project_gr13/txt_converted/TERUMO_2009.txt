1. message from the chairman and the president

  aiming to provide people-friendly healthcare

  a corporate philosophy that reflects our dedication to healthcare

terumo was founded in 1921 by several medical scientists, led by dr. shibasaburo kitasato,
with the intention of domestically manufacturing the most reliable clinical thermometer
possible. the driving force of the new company was the enthusiasm of this group of medical
professionals, who wanted to promote the development of quality public healthcare and
contribute to the health of every individual.                                                                                    takashi wachi
                                                                                                                                 representative director & chairman
      this drive lives on in our corporate philosophy, “contributing to society through
healthcare,” which has held up as our highest value since our inception.

  contributing to the evolution of healthcare by understanding the needs of the times

“terumo’s unique technology makes medical treatment kinder and gentler.” this statement,
which represents our corporate vision, has led us to develop products that reduce the pain,
discomfort and psychological and physical harm patients sometimes suffer during tests and
operations. these products include various disposable medical devices and equipment to
prevent infection.                                                                                                               akira takahashi
                                                                                                                                 representative director & president
      public interest in health and healthcare is growing; issues surrounding the industry (rising
costs, a shortage of doctors etc.) have been taking on a greater urgency as changes in the social environment, including an aging
population and a slowing economy, take place.
      under these circumstances, we are committed to pursuing new value for healthcare as a company that possesses unique
expertise in both medical devices and pharmaceuticals.
      the evolution of medical devices and equipment is closely related to the evolution of medical treatment and has the power to
bring about dramatic and disruptive changes in healthcare. improving the effectiveness of treatments without placing additional burdens
on patients has the potential to bring about many benefits, ranging from shorter treatment and recovery times and reduced costs to
improved operational efficiencies and the consequential significant reduction in the risk of medical accidents. we also recognize support
for practical technical training in medical techniques for healthcare professionals as the crucial elements in the provision of better healthcare.

  as a member of society

all companies, as members of a society, have a responsibility to take action to ensure the sustainability of that society. efforts to reduce
global environmental impacts, are one of key elements of this responsibility. at terumo, we have made such efforts, including promoting
energy conservation and the reduction of waste at our factories. we are introducing new environment-friendly development guidelines
for 2009 with respect to our product development and will continue to work hard to overcome new challenges, always striving to live up
to our goal of being a people- and environment-friendly company.
      in short, we have identified our responsibilities as developing and providing a stable supply of superior products and proactively
tackling the various social issues surrounding healthcare, consistent with our corporate philosophy.
      a company that does not contribute to society has no reason to exist. our purpose, which all terumo associates are embrace to
fulfill, is to improve the lives of people around the world through better healthcare.


                                            terumo has set five statements as the basis of its corporate activities.

  driven by strong desire to relieve pain


  a sense of mission gives terumo its drive
many people, suffering from diabetes have to inject themselves with insulin every day. painful injections
are difficult not only for the patients to endure but also for their loved ones.
       terumo, driven by our strong desire and the sense of mission as a syringe needle manufacturer,
started development of “low-pain needles” to address the situation. after a lot of trial and error,
we succeeded in creating the world’ s thinnest needle for insulin. this needle was a result of the
combination of a number of technologies with the creativity of our associates, who were driven more              needle for insulin injection
than anything by the thoughts of seeing the smiles on the faces of the patients who would use it.

 simulation training is crucial in medical education
                                             training held at terumo medical pranex is focused on “team-based medicine,” meaning care is
                                             provided by a team comprised of physicians and other healthcare professionals. these days, the
                                             need to improve healthcare is such that we are required to examine every line of movement of each
                                             team member to see if they can move more efficiently without any wasted movements. observing
                                             the movements and role of each team member is impossible at a real hospital due to constraints of
                                             space and other factors. terumo medical pranex is therefore the only place where we can conduct
                                             simulations in an environment very similar to real life.

organizations, and sending mrs* to medical institutions to provide face-to-face explanations.
       furthermore, we make the best use of the accumulated information in our product development and support for medical safety

terumo is making every effort to achieve “open management” through communication with shareholders and investors.
we implement fair information disclosure to maintain a high level of management transparency, and make various other efforts
to ensure terumo’s business and products, as well as general healthcare topics, can be comprehensively understood.
as a good corporate citizen, we consistently aim for high-quality communication that is easy to understand.

at terumo, we refer to our employees as “associates,” and expect each of them to continually develop and refine their
abilities, think and act independently and make valuable contributions to the development of the company.
our term for any given group of associates (including a team, section, or department), is “pride,” referencing both the term
used to describe a group of lions as well as an appropriate sense of self-worth.
terumo is therefore a group of proud individuals who cooperate with each other to achieve greater results.
our associates work hard to improve themselves, and the company rewards them by providing them with valuable
opportunities to demonstrate their abilities to the utmost extent.
we believe our value as a company is equal to the sum of the value of our associates.




  supporting associates who through work experiences
based on our belief that associates grow through work experiences, terumo values opportunities to take on work-related challenges.

  an environment for self-learning
people learn most effectively when they are self-motivated. based on
this understanding, terumo provides only a few general training
programs, including training for newly hired associates. other training
programs are provided on a voluntary and selective basis in which
associates who have demonstrated noteworthy results may
participate at their own request or by the recommendation of their
supervisor.
       for example, we hold a selective training program for                                  presenting a proposal to top               heated group discussion

of about 100 applications, we choose around 30 mid-career associates in their late 20s to late 30s based on their performance,
contributions and an interview. for the roughly four months of the program, the selected participants balance their job with their training
assignments. as part of their training, they engage in serious discussions on management issues facing terumo and present their
recommendations directly to management at the end of the course. some of these recommendations have been launched as a new
company project.
       we also make it a rule to implement job rotation for all participants following the seminar to enable them to broaden their
experience. more than 200 graduates of the seminar have already distinguished themselves in divisions across the company.
* “leo” stands for leader executive organization. it also refers to the purpose of the program, which is to identify and develop those associates with the potential to grow into
  “lions” (top management).

“high-performing” or “glamorous” divisions. associates who work steadily behind the scenes every
day also make a huge contribution. to reward and recognize the achievements of these
professionals who take pride (“hokori” in japanese) in their work and support the front (“genba”)
with their consistent efforts and results, we created the genba-no hokori award. past winners of
the award include associates in charge of maintenance of production facilities and others who
ensure smooth distribution. each year, the award is presented at a ceremony held in september
on the anniversary of the foundation of terumo to five or six recipients selected from candidates                                    winners of the pride award “genba-no
nominated by their peers.                                                                                                            hokori” in 2008

terumo seeks to assure product safety through good design and to develop products with minimum environmental impact.
we are striving to create products that are helpful to both medical professionals and their patients as well as friendly to the
global environment.
we will continue to make every effort to respond effectively to the needs of society.



  introducing human x eco development guidelines
based on our environmental vision, we have developed “human x eco development
guidelines” based on two axes: “human,” representing friendliness to people, and
“eco,” representing friendliness to the environment. we are launching the guidelines in
the latter half of fiscal 2009.
       the axis of “human” represents the principles of “more friendly” (providing
safety and reliability) and “more advanced” (enhancing healthcare value). it refers to
innovation to improve quality and usability, including efforts to prevent medical errors
and infections, relieving patients’ pain and improving user satisfaction. the “eco”
axis is based on the principles of “cleaner” (reducing environmental impact) and “less” (improving resource efficiency) and refers to
our efforts to use resources effectively through initiatives aimed at resource-saving, energy-saving, space-saving and productivity
improvement, without making waste nor generating hazardous substances.
       these two axes may seem unrelated, but a medical error or infection that causes pain to a patient also necessitates additional
treatment, which involves the use of medical devices and equipment and pharmaceuticals. the idea of “people-friendly” (human) is
therefore linked to the resource-saving concept of “environment-friendly” (eco).

  reducing waste emissions by the in-house liquefying of waste plastic for recycling

we have established an experimental facility at our kofu factory to pyrolyze and liquefy
waste plastic generated in syringe or other production processes, and have started
research into how to use pyrolysis oil as an energy source. by not outsourcing the
treatment of waste plastic and instead recycling it within the factory, we intend to achieve
the following:


      (1) effective use of resources
                                                                                                                         liquefaction equipment and collected oil
      (2) reduction of risks involved in outsourcing industrial waste treatment
      (3) reduction of co2 emissions in waste transportation


we are conducting further research to control the state of pyrolysis oil in order to be able
to use it more effectively.

  introduction of stricter chemicals management

  initiatives to reduce ethylene oxide emissions                                                 target for reduction of chemical emissions:

ethylene oxide is widely used to sterilize medical devices and
equipment. we set voluntary concentration controls* to track                         trends in dichloromethane emissions

  aiming at appropriate pcb* management

in accordance with the law concerning special measures for promotion of proper treatment of pcb wastes and the waste management
and public cleansing law, we have removed all transformers, fluorescent light ballasts and other equipment containing pcbs. to ensure
the prompt and appropriate disposal of these materials, we completed early registration with the toyota office of the japan environmental
safety corporation (jesco).
      an investigation conducted by the japan electrical manufacturers’ association identified pieces of equipment that may
potentially contain trace amounts of pcbs on the basis of the time of manufacture or other factors. following this, we conducted our
own investigation, categorizing and performing a complete analysis of every piece of equipment (including examining manufacturer
warranties), with the exception of those that could not be analyzed due to their sealed nature. these will be examined when they reach
the end of their life.

  green procurement

  toward the establishment of a green conformity assurance system

european environmental regulations (rohs/weee), as well as chinese and japanese laws, restrict the use of hazardous substances in
electrical and electronic equipment (or require that such equipment be labeled). meanwhile, creating a conformity assurance system to
bring medical devices, which are not yet targeted by the eu’ s rohs directive, into conformity with these regulations is a vital task in the
achievement of eco-friendly operation.
       our basic policy on conformity assurance is to prevent harmful substances from entering the factory and also prevent them from
exiting. this concept is not vastly different from the traditional concept of quality assurance for medical devices. it was necessary, however,
to add new rules to the management procedures due to the need to handle management elements not conventionally present. we thus
added the following management steps, the main elements of which had already been stipulated.

           1
                 procedure for determining which items are subject to the assurance system
           2     procedure for determining conformity of parts and materials purchased and products shipped
                 (created determination flow and determination standards for purchased parts/materials. partially implemented)
           3
                 procedure for tracking information about substances contained in purchased parts/materials
                 (created instructions for investigating substance composition and began periodic investigations in fy 2007)
           4     procedure for eco-friendly product design
                 (provide results of substance composition investigation via database and provide conformity training)
           5     procedure for risk management
                 (risk analysis/improvement instructions/determination of whether self-declarations are allowed)

     in the future, we will integrate each of these procedures in turn into our quality management system to construct an overall
conformity assurance system.

17. business activities and material flows
terumo determines the environmental impact associated with production processes that use inputs of energy and raw materials
and create outputs like carbon dioxide, wastewater and waste, and uses these values as indicators. we are striving to reduce
our environmental impact in this manner.

                                   we start sales of a balloon catheter made of thermoplastic elastomer, which does not generate sulfur oxides when
    1994
                                   incinerated.

                                   we completely abolish the use of ozone-depleting specified chlorofluorocarbon (cfc) chemicals in the production

    1996
                                   we start production of a hypodermic administration set with a new-type plastic needle: the non-metal needle makes
                                   post-disposal separation at hospitals as well as incineration easier.

                                   we establish the environmental management department at head office.
