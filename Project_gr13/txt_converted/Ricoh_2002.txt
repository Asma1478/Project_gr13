           aims at pursuing sustainable
           management and continues its
           environmental conservation practices.

           the rich resources of our planet earth have given birth to many forms of life and have sup-
           ported the wide-ranging and ambitious activities of mankind. nevertheless, recent activities
           have exceeded this life-sustaining ability of the earth. this poses a threat not only to our
           coexistence with other forms of life on this planet but also to the future of the human race
           itself. the environment is the most crucial issue that the whole mankind must tackle. in
           order to bequeath a rich, fertile earth to future generations, each of us must reduce the
           environmental impact caused by our activities. for that to happen globally, governments,
           companies, citizen groups, and even individuals in all countries and regions must be aware
           of the environmental impact that is affecting the entire planet and actively seek to reduce it.
           mutual consultation and cooperation are also critical to further advance this cause.
              for the ricoh group, as a global citizen, safeguarding this precious planet is one of our
           corporate missions. looking at all aspects of management from an environment-conscious
           point of view, we always endeavor to minimize the environmental impact produced by the
           group’s business activities by being closer to the limit that the natural environment permits
           us. environmental conservation activities should be neither temporary, regulated by law,
           nor conducted for personal gain. with a firm resolution to incorporate environmental con-
           servation into its corporate mission, the ricoh group is focusing on consistency in its
           activities. to continue corporate activities, it is necessary to profit from environmental
           conservation activities and not merely engage in them. the ricoh group’s fundamental
           idea of sustainable management is to continuously engage in environmental conservation
           activities that are at the same time profitable.
              to survive in the new century as a respected corporation in the global community, a
           company needs to excel in environment-conscious management and social responsibility
           and obtain the support of society. recognizing the fact that companies should contribute to
           society as members of that society, the ricoh group promotes sustainable management
           from a global point of view, making efforts to revitalize the economy of local communities
           and nurturing its personnel. the ricoh group further promotes activities that restrict the
           environmental impact of its business activities so that the environment can recover. more-
           over, the group earnestly engages in social contribution activities, such as forest ecosystem
           conservation, to improve the self-recovery capability of the natural environment.

   the ricoh group will disclose information about its activities globally to discuss envi-
ronmental issues, which are now cross-border issues, with as many people from as many
countries as possible. our 2002 report details results of our global environmental conserva-
tion activities in fiscal 2001. we hope that this report will help as many of you readers as
possible to discover the extent of the ricoh group’s concepts for environmental conserva-
tion and environmental measures. we welcome your honest opinion to further improve our
activities in terms of both quality and effectiveness.

    kiyoshi ichimura, ricoh’s founder, explained the
    company’s corporate philosophy as follows:                    to be a good global corporate citizen with
       my motto in life is “love your neighbor, love your                   reliability and appeal
       country, and love your work.” i believe that a
       person’s worth depends on the depth and breadth
       of the love that he/she feels. we have an innate
       love of ourselves, as all animals do, in the name of
                                                                                   our principles
       selfpreservation. everyone at least loves
       himself/herself. as time passes, however, this                      to think as an entrepreneur
       feeling of love grows and expands to include              to put ourselves in the other person’s place
       parents, siblings, spouses, and children and, later,
       goes on to encompass neighbors, one’s country                   to ﬁnd personal value in our work
       and ethnic group, and, ﬁnally, all the people of the
       world. at this point, such people return the same
       amount of love or more to all people, plants, and
       animals. therefore, i am convinced that our true
       worth depends on how much love we give and how
       far that love extends.

based on our management principles, we recognize environmental conservation as one of
the most important missions given to mankind, and we regard environmental conservation
as an integral part of all our business activities. we therefore assume the responsibility of
environmental conservation and approach this on a companywide basis.



                                   action guideline
1. not only do we comply with all domestic and overseas environmental regulations,
   but we also set our own targets to reduce the negative environmental impact of our
   business in consideration of social expectations. we also endeavor to attain our
   targets.

2. we strive to promote technological innovations that help reduce negative environment
   impact while maintaining and improving our environmental conservation systems.

3. in the development, design, and operation of factory facilities, we always consider
   their impact on the environment, and we strive to prevent pollution, to utilize energy
   and resources effectively, and to reduce and dispose of waste in a responsible manner.

4. at every stage, from planning, development, design, procurement and production to
   sales, logistics, use, recycling, and disposal, we offer products and services that have
   minimum environmental impact and give maximum consideration to safety.

5. through environmental education, we strive to raise the awareness of all our
   employees in order to develop a social viewpoint that enables them to conduct
   environmental activities on their own.

6. in every country and region where we conduct business, we maintain close ties with
   the local community and contribute to society by publicizing our activities and
   assisting in environmental conservation activities.

vision and strategy (the comet circle™)




       using the comet circle concept to
       help the ricoh group build a society
       that recirculates resources.

       activities and partnerships that the ricoh group must
       deal with.
           the ricoh group not only promotes its sustainable
       management, but also enthusiastically encourages sup-
       pliers, customers, and recycling companies to set up
       their own sustainable management. moreover, the
       group strives to make the resource recirculation of the
       comet circle smaller at all stages (entities represented
       by spheres) by improving economic efficiency and
       reducing environmental impact. this would reduce the
       total amount of environmental impact produced by eco-
       nomic and social activities.
           the comet circle is a graphic representation of
       environmental conservation. in today’s world, both the
       product and the manufacturing process of that product
       determine corporate value and what people purchase.
       our philosophy goes beyond environmental conserva-
       tion concepts and ensures the credibility of our prod-
       ucts, none of which are produced under poor conditions
       or with child labor or by any other reprehensible means.
       such profiteering is both unfair and incompatible with
       the philosophy of ricoh group.
           there are comet circle members other than the
       ricoh group, suppliers, customers, and recycling com-
       panies. when individuals who direct their efforts toward
       building a society that recirculates resources more effi-
       ciently shop for things that have less environmental
       impact, separate their garbage for recycling, or take
       environment conservation and social responsibilities
       into consideration when making investments, they
       become a part of the comet circle, too. everybody
       should be aware of the resources that went into the
       clothes that they buy and how those things were deliv-
       ered. they should also think about how those clothes

layer covering the whole earth. before that,
living things could not go on dry land be-

cause the uv rays from the sun were. it is
said that it takes 100 years for the earth’s

surface to gain one centimeter of soil. soil

covers mountains, stores rainwater, and

releases the stored water gradually. moun-

tains need forests to keep the soil in place,
especially after it rains, for instance. the

earth, the only planet where living things

exist, is constantly developing and main-

taining its natural ecosystem. mankind has
long pretended that it had forgotten it was

a part of nature. to preserve a better natu-

ral environment for future generations, we

must develop and recover the natural envi-

ronment, change our lifestyles and social

mechanisms, and restrict environmental im-

pact to a point where the natural environ-
ment can recover by itself.

       ricoh reduced co2 emissions by 24.1%, surpassing the goal in fiscal 2001. seven manufacturing subsidiaries in japan reduced co2 emissions by 20.9%–57.4%,
       surpassing the goal in fiscal 2001. among five manufacturing subsidiaries outside japan, four achieved a 23.1%–32.2% reduction in co2 emissions, reaching the
       goal. one had an 8.5% increase and, therefore, did not achieve the goal. (the average total reduction in co2 emissions by all manufacturing subsidiaries outside
       japan was 31.6%.)

fukui ricoh co., ltd., achieved zero-
waste-to-landfill in fiscal 2000, and
iwate ricoh co., ltd., followed suit in
march 2002. under the slogan “waste
when mixed but resource when sorted,”
iwate ricoh conducted a campaign that
focused on detailed waste sorting as well
as office computerization with a less-
paper system. the company thus achieved
level 2 zero-waste-to-landfill*.
