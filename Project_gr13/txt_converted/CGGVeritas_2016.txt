dear mr. secretary general,


our industry is experiencing a profound, extended and in many ways unprecedented crisis. as we navigate through these
difficult times we have not compromised on our social and environmental responsibilities and ambitions. all our employees
and subcontractors have been mobilized to maintain good health & safety practices and to continue to operate in a
responsible manner towards the environment and the communities hosting our sites and operations. our results in this regard
are compelling.


in order to continue to weather an enduring industry crisis, in 2015 we accelerated a far-reaching strategic transformation plan
whose aim is to rebalance our portfolio of activities and make the company less sensitive to the cyclical nature of our industry.
we have had to make some tough decisions, including a significant reduction in the number of employees.


our company values and our adherence to the united nations global compact become even more important in such times. i
am proud to re-affirm our belief that sustainable development can only be achieved if collectively we deliver long-term value in
financial, social, environmental and ethical terms.


we know that what cgg and its partners do today will have an impact far into the future. we act to meet the energy needs of
society today, while respecting the needs of future generations, leaving only a proud memory wherever we work.


most respectfully yours,




jean-georges malcor
chief executive officer

amendments to our credit agreements
in order to soften some of our financial covenants, we amended in september 2014 certain terms in several of our credit facilities, namely our
french and us revolving facility agreement, our us$200 million facility and our us$45 million facility. pursuant to such amendments, the
maximum leverage ratio (defined as total net financial debt to ebitdas) was increased from a constant ratio of 3.00x to a ratio of 3.75x for each
rolling 12-month period ending on or before september 2015, 3.50x for each such period ending on or before september 2016, 3.25x for each
such period ending on or before september 2017 and 3.00x for each such period thereafter.
on december 16, 2014, we completed the amendment and extension of the us$200 million nordic credit facility. the credit amount was
increased to us$250 million and the maturity extended from may 2018 to december 2019.
in june 2015, in order to increase our financial flexibility, and following unanimous consent from the 16 different financial institutions involved,
we have revised certain terms in several of our credit facilities, pursuant to such amendments,
-    the maximum leverage ratio (defined as total net financial debt to ebitdas) was increased to a ratio of 4.00x for each rolling 4-quarter
     period ending on or before june 2016, 3.75x for each such period ending on or before june 2017, 3.50x for each such period ending on
     or before june 2018, 3.25x for each such period ending on or before june 2019, and 3.00x for each such period thereafter; and
-    the minimum interest cover ratio (defined as ebitdas to total interest costs) was reduced from 4.00:1 to 3.00:1.
-    in exchange of extending the security package under the existing us and french revolving facilities, the group has obtained the ability to
     raise secured indebtedness ranking pari passu and sharing the same security package. the group used this ability by issuing on december
     22, 2015, the term loans due 2019.
on november 4, 2015, cgg obtained consent to waive the maximum leverage ratio covenant (defined as total net financial debt to ebitdas)
at year-end 2015 under all the credit facilities which include such financial covenant.
in december 2015, we revised our financial covenants, effective on february 4, 2016 (see note 30 to our 2015 consolidated statements).


there was no other post-closing event to be reported.

4. information on terms of payment

as of december 31, 2015, the outstanding debt of the company towards its suppliers amounted to €3.1 million. the breakdown of this
outstanding debt per maturity date was as follows:
     -     due date not exceeding 30 days : €2.6 million;
     -     due date not exceeding 60 days: €0.5 million;
     -     due date exceeding 60 days: € 0 million.


as of december 31, 2014, the outstanding debt of the company towards its suppliers amounted to €4.2 million. the breakdown of this
outstanding debt per maturity date was as follows:
     -     due date not exceeding 30 days : €1.6 million;
     -     due date not exceeding 60 days: €2.5 million;
     -     due date exceeding 60 days: €0.1 million.



5. information on the utilization of financial instruments

more than 74% in 2015 and 2014 of our turnover is denominated in us dollars and to a more limited extent in brazilian real, canadian dollar,
renminbi-yuan and in the other western european currencies such as euro, british pounds and norwegian kroner.
most of our expenses in 2015 are paid in us dollars, euro, british pounds, norwegian krone and renminbi-yuan. we attempt to match foreign
currency revenues and expenses in order to balance our net position of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies.
nevertheless, during the past five years, such dollar-denominated expenses have not equaled dollar-denominated revenues principally due to
personnel costs payable in euros in france and europe.
in order to improve the balance of our net position of receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, we maintain our financing
primarily in us dollars. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, our total outstanding debt denominated in us dollars was us$1,874 million and
us$1,571 million and, respectively, representing 66% and 57% of our total financial debt outstanding at such dates.
in addition, our policy generally is to hedge major currency cash exposures through foreign exchange forward contracts or other foreign exchange
currency hedging instruments. these contracts are entered into with major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had us$5 million and us$26 million, respectively, of notional amounts outstanding under u.s. dollars
against euro forward exchange contracts.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had us$14 million and us$24 million, respectively, of notional amounts outstanding under us dollars
against british pounds forward exchange contracts.
as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had us$26 million and us$17 million, respectively, of notional amounts outstanding under us dollars
against norwegian kroner forward exchange contracts.
we do not enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for trading purposes.

7. prospects

7.1.         market environment

the growth of the oil services sector, and therefore of the seismic sector, slowed down significantly from the middle of the year 2013 because
of the major international oil companies cutting back on exploration projects, and more broadly on exploration & production investment expenses,
in order to generate greater cash flow in the short term and maintain the expected level of dividends for their shareholders. this trend was
confirmed during the year 2014, with overall exploration & production expenses finally stabilising and seismic expenses falling by 10%. during
the second part of 2014, the price of a barrel of oil fell sharply and swiftly following the decision of saudi arabia to maintain its world market
share and let supply and demand fix the fair market price. thus, in the space of seven months, oil prices fell by 59%, going from us$115 per
barrel (middle of june 2014) to us$47 per barrel (middle of january 2015), which led to oil companies drastically reducing their exploration &
production spending forecasts for 2015.
in 2015, the average brent oil price settled at nearly us$53, down by 45% from 2014. at this pricing level, the international oil companies (ioc)
do not generate positive cash flow after payment of the dividend and exploration & production investment expenses, even after having reduced
such expenses significantly (by about 20% between 2014 and 2015). as far as the national oil companies (noc) are concerned, the priority is
the management of the oil income and the rate of decline of their fields. in this respect, exploration & production investments in 2015 went down
by about 25% compared to 2014, with the middle east, where such investments continued to increase by about 5%, being the notable exception.
finally, for shale oil producers, these investments went down significantly, by about 35% compared to 2014, since some of the wells are no
longer profitable at the current average price of a barrel of oil. in terms of production, the supply of oil is still on the rise because the main
producers in the middle east are continuing to hold their position in terms of maintaining market shares, and because, in the united states, the
production of shale oil has been a lot more resilient than expected, only starting to reduce in the second half of 2015. in terms of demand for oil,
this has turned out to be stronger than anticipated, particularly in the united states, europe or india, encouraged by low prices. the oil market
is however still unbalanced, with supply outstripping demand by 1.5 to 2 mb/d.
for 2016, the fall in crude oil prices in the second half of 2015 has led to the oil companies predicting a further drop of 25% in exploration &
production investments. this would be the first time since 1986-87 that these investments would experience two years of consecutive reduction,
and the oil companies think that the price per barrel would need to return to between us$60 and 70 per barrel to see such investments increase
again. the exploration investment expenses (which bolster the majority of the cgg group's activity), are even more in decline with a ratio of
exploration expenses to exploration & production expenses at the lowest for 15 years – proof of the reluctance of the majority of oil companies
to invest in long-term projects. as for the offshore activity segment, many exploration or development projects have been frozen or stopped,
since the cost price per (future) barrel extracted from an area of deep or ultra-deep water is still often well above the current average price per
barrel, which leads a lot of oil companies to give priority to other projects. in fact, this segment should see its investments still fall heavily in
2016.
but this situation of under-investment in oil exploration, and particularly in offshore exploration, is not sustainable over the long-term. currently,
the growth in production from conventional onshore deposits (iran, iraq, etc.) and the productivity gains from non-conventional deposits (shale
oil in the united states) allow both the growth in worldwide demand and the natural depletion of deposits being operated to be addressed. in
the medium-term, this continuous and rapid depletion of conventional onshore deposits will result in a renewal of producers' seismic imaging
needs, particularly in the middle east, china or russia. over the long term, it will not be possible to satisfy the growth in worldwide demand
without the development of new offshore deposits, which will only become profitable again after a significant reduction in the costs of oil services,
resulting in particular from better collaboration between the service companies and the oil companies across all stages of a deposit's operating
chain and the development of an integrated vision for the reservoir. consequently, these changes allow us to glimpse favourable long-term
growth prospects for geophysics and geosciences.


7.2.         a commercial strategy based on technology differentiation

the group will continue to focus its strategy on high-end seismic equipment and services, and on integrated solutions in the geology, geophysics
and reservoir characterisation disciplines. the aim is to develop solutions based on a cross-disciplinary approach, integrating the most innovative
technologies of each area of the group's expertise whilst improving or adapting these technologies to its clients' needs. this is particularly the
case with the stagseis multi-client programme in the gulf of mexico or the “bedias creek” survey in respect of shale oil hydrocarbons in the
united states, which combined the group's equipment, acquisition, subsurface imaging and geological expertise activities. in addition to the
high quality of its services and technology, for cgg, attention to the sound management of health, safety and environmental matters (hse) is
crucial to establish lasting relationships with its clients.
cgg believes that its long-term differentiation will result from developing acquisition technologies using high-end seismic equipment and
combined with sophisticated subsurface imaging. this combination will significantly improve image quality and maintain reasonable product lead
times, in line with its clients' exploration and drilling decision-making process. this technological differentiation will be enhanced upstream by
the group's geological consulting expertise and downstream by its reservoir characterisation software and services to provide its clients with
reliable static and dynamic reservoir modelling solutions to enable better assessment of known or future reserves and higher recovery rates in
producing fields.
in general, the group's clients are still focused, very early on in the production cycle, on the future positioning of the drilling wells and their
configuration. this translates into a steady interest, on the part of the oil and gas companies, in the technological content of seismic data in
order to extract highly specific reservoir properties from it in advance of their investment decision-making process. the group's clients want, in
particular, to predict stress fields and fractures to ensure the safety and accuracy of the well drilling and the extraction operations while optimising
their return on investment. these requirements could strongly influence seismic processing and reservoir characterisation activities and thus
significantly increase the geoscience component of the seismic market.

sercel's innovative solutions
in terms of equipment, sercel maintains a high level of research and development which is justified by the high technological content of seismic
equipment which includes numerous cutting-edge technologies, such as wireless transmission, high- and low-frequency transmission or
miniaturised electronic technologies, and also optical or acoustic technologies.
sercel launched several new products in 2014 and 2015, including:

          the nomad 65 neo and nomad 90 neo vibrators that allow the generation of a wider range of seismic wave frequencies and are
           therefore the ideal source for broadband seismic land surveys;

          geowave® ii, the first digital multi-level downhole array tool specifically designed to withstand high temperatures (up to 400°f/205°c)
           and high pressures (up to 25,000 psi/1,725 bars), and which allows for up to 120 levels to be deployed on a standard wireline;

          quietseatm, a passive acoustic monitoring system for detecting the presence of marine mammals during marine seismic surveys;

          geotag, the acoustic positioning solution of choice for seabed seismic acquisition, allowing the accurate positioning of all types of
           cable (obc) or autonomous systems, on seabeds or in transition zones, for seismic surveys in depths up to 500 metres.


developing and improving land and marine acquisition technologies
the group believes that the growth in demand for geophysical services will continue to be linked to new technologies. the group predicts that
high-end surveys, such as high-definition 3d (broadseis), broadband 3d, 3d full azimuth, and also 4d (with time as the additional dimension)
and multi-component (3c or 4c) surveys, will play a key role in the future in exploration & production, especially in the sea deposits sector. with
respect to the land sector, increased demand for ultra-high density surveys of sensors should result in teams deploying more than one hundred
thousand channels appearing in the field in the next five years. this trend should transform the entire land acquisition chain, with developments
focusing on low-cost sensors, more mechanised deployments and more automated data quality controls.

improving imaging and developing integrated solutions for reservoir simulation
to anticipate the exponentially increasing in data acquired (big data), considerable research and development efforts will be necessary for
seismic data processing, data storage and management, and also investigating new parallel computer architectures which should enable such
data to be processed in a reasonable time frame whilst making energy savings. the group believes that, by continually improving its seismic
data processing software, it will remain among the leading suppliers of high-end land and marine seismic services. its research and development
work will therefore continue to focus on improving imaging in complex zones to help exploration and production as a technology for characterising
and monitoring reservoirs. the group will also continue to develop lithological prediction (identification of rocky layers surrounding the
accumulation of hydrocarbons) and reservoir characterisation and content applications, in particular 3d prestack depth imaging, subsalt depth
imaging, broadband depth imaging, multi-component acquisition imaging and differential imaging unique to 4d surveys.

7.3.          outlook for group activities in 2016

commercial outlook
the group's seismic activity (equipment, acquisition and imaging) is strongly correlated to the exploration activity and should therefore decline
over the year 2016. more generally, the geosciences activity should also be on the decline since the oil companies should continue to lower
their expenses and reduce their investments, which will result in an even more difficult market than the one currently faced for the entire oil-
related sector. it is in this environment that cgg recently launched a new stage in its transformation plan.

industrial outlook
in 2016, the group will focus on the management of its transformation plan, in particular the implementation of the changes announced in
november 2015. in general terms, cgg will continue to develop and promote high-end solutions: upstream with its equipment offering; then in
the acquisition field, which is essential for maintaining a strong and global relationship with the main ordering parties; and finally downstream
with the services linked to the use of geological and geophysical data. it is because of the high level of expertise developed in each of its activities
and their integration within the same company that the group can forge both r&d collaborations and partnerships with its clients who value its
technological expertise in all geoscience areas.


equipment: maintaining the group's market share through technology and a strong client base

the group feels that the seismic equipment market will remain at a low level overall, particularly affected by a significant weakness in demand
for marine seismic equipment (which should represent only approximately 35% of the equipment market 2016) because of the very sharp
reduction in industrial investments of the group's main clients and the withdrawal from service of numerous seismic vessels (including those of
the group). with respect to the land seismic equipment market, the group thinks that it will continue to decrease in 2016 due to the cost cutting
programs launched by clients. however, the subsidiary sercel could be supported by growing sales of the 508xt, its next-generation land
acquisition system, whose quality and functionality were demonstrated in the field throughout 2015. in the medium-term, the land equipment
market should be spurred by the need for better imaging of conventional onshore reservoirs that are currently being operated particularly
intensively (with the increase in volumes produced aiming to offset the drop in prices as best as possible) in order to control their depletion
better.
overall, the geophysics market is characterised by ever increasing demand for new technologies, both in land and marine, to achieve high-
resolution imaging. the group predicts that this trend will continue in the coming years. because of its strong reputation and past success,
sercel should be able to maintain its leading position in the seismic equipment market, capitalising on its installed base, the implementation of
new technologies in its full product range and also its diversified geographical presence.

contractual data acquisition: retaining expertise and limiting exposure

in 2014, the marine seismic industry had to demonstrate discipline in view of the deteriorating conditions in the marine contract activity, with
prices having dropped by more than 10% on average. cgg announced its decision to reduce the size of its fleet from 18 to 13 3d high-capacity
vessels and this step was followed by the other principal players in that market. by the end of 2014, the market contracted even more sharply
as a result of the drastic reduction in offshore exploration & production budgets by oil companies. the utilisation rate for the fleets of all market
players also decreased significantly in the first half of 2015. against this background, cgg ceased operating 2 3d vessels at the start of 2015,
keeping no more than 11 in operation. despite this adjustment and those of other players, prices dropped to levels which had never been seen
in the past, as, since the second quarter of 2015, the revenue generated by a vessel is close to the cash cost for operating it.
in such an environment cgg announced, at the start of november 2015, an additional step in its transformation plan for the marine seismic
acquisition activity, with its decision to withdraw 6 additional vessels from its fleet, in order to operate no more than 5 3d high-capacity vessels.
in fact, the group noted that the contractual marine seismic acquisition activity should be depressed for a long time with very low price conditions
generating heavy losses. this poor pricing is due to lower demand following the sharp reduction of exploration programs, less appetite for frontier
exploration and a structural oversupply linked to a large number of good cold-stacked vessels which can quickly come back, at a low cost.
furthermore, in the event of an improvement in demand, cgg’s competitors would be able to increase again their capacity quickly by bringing
back to the market cold stacked vessels, thereby limiting the chances of a price recovery. the group has therefore decided to drastically reduce
its exposure on the marine contract market and to reposition the size of its fleet towards its needs in the area of the production of multi-client
studies that are sufficiently pre-funded (at above 70%), which means operating 5 3d vessels for the next 2 years. the marine seismic acquisition
activity will therefore be mainly a technological tool for the acquisition of multi-client data.
thus, the worldwide 3d high-capacity seismic fleet, which stood around 33 active vessels at the end of 2015 compared to 63 vessels at the end
of 2013, will continue to decrease in 2016 in the light of the announcements made by the different contractors.
in land acquisition, cgg continues with its development strategy in niche and technological markets, focusing on differentiation and operational
excellence, avoiding as much as possible the commoditised part of this market. its strategy, by mean of the ultraseis broadband solution, is to
meet the increasing demand for high-resolution land seismic acquisition or using a high-end technology, as is already the case in the middle
east and north africa. cgg will continue to put long-term partnerships in place in key regions or markets, as has been done in the middle east
with taqa and with seabed geosolutions bv joint venture, owned 40% by cgg and 60% by fugro.
in multi-physics acquisition, the priority in 2016 will be to take advantage of the 2015 restructuring plan which reduced the cost base, and also
to continue with the aircraft fleet rationalisation programme with the aim of reducing the number of different aircraft models to optimise their
management. the group has also planned to further pursue the synergies of electromagnetic and gravimetric measurements with the seismic
data.
finally, with a reduced seismic fleet, the revenue generated by the contractual data acquisition segment (including both land and marine
acquisition) should now represent in the future less than 15% of the cgg group’s turnover.


geology, geophysics & reservoir: developing an integrated geoscience activity

investments in the multi-client activity went down by more than half in 2015 compared to those in 2014 (us$713 million), since the ibalt
programme launched in 2012 in the gulf of mexico, and based on the stagseis technology, was completed in mid-october 2014. it continues
to attract increased interest from major oil companies active in that region, notably in advance of the many lease block auctions scheduled for
the 2015-2017 period, and it should generate significant after-sales in upcoming years. for 2016, investments are expected between us$300
million and us$350 million with a pre-funding rate of over 70%, spurred by the undiminished appetite of oil companies for good quality multi-
client seismic data in zones that they know well (brazil, the north sea, etc.) which can capitalize on their existing infrastructures and reduce the
marginal investment cost. moreover, cgg should benefit from interest in new prospecting zones, such as the mexican part of the gulf of mexico,
where the group's expertise is acknowledged.
the group will now dedicate most of its seismic fleet utilisation to it, i.e. 3 vessels out of 5 on average for the marine multi-client activity, with
contractual seismic acquisition taking up the remainder. thus, the multi-client activity may continue to be an integrating factor for all of the
group’s technologies (equipment, acquisition, imaging and geoscience), by creating products that will use the different areas of expertise
developed in each of its product lines and which will allow its clients to prepare for their exploration programs and developments in the related
basins as best as possible.
the subsurface imaging activity was more resilient in 2015 than the equipment and contractual data acquisition activities, driven by the
increasing complexity of the geologies to be imaged, which requires sophisticated and high-end algorithms, an area in which the group has an
unequalled position. in addition, the oil companies, wanting to obtain the best possible images to maximise their exploration efforts, are asking
for more reprocessing of previous data in order to benefit, at a lower cost, from developments of new imaging algorithms. despite that, the
subsurface imaging market is following the global trend of reducing exploration & production spending by its clients, as the drop in the number
of marine or land seismic acquisition projects directly results in a significant fall in the volumes of new data to be processed. as for the software
sales and consulting activity, this was also resilient in 2015, with a smaller decrease in turnover than that in the exploration & production
spending by its clients. in fact, the cost of these products and services for clients is well below the value that they bring, particularly with regard
to the amounts of the exploration or production budgets. overall, the subsurface imaging and reservoir activity saw its turnover erode in 2015
(a decrease of 20% compared to 2014), a trend that should continue in 2016.
looking forward, the group in this new format will get around 60% of its revenue generated by the geology, geophysics & reservoir (ggr)
activity.

financial outlook
in 2016, the group does not expect an improvement in the seismic and geoscience market compared to 2015. against this background, the
group's priorities will be strict cash management, cost reduction, operational and commercial efficiency and dynamic debt management.
industrial investments (excluding capitalized development costs) should be between us$100 million and us$125 million in 2016. multi-client
cash investments should be between us$325 and us$375 million in 2016 with a pre-funding rate greater than 70%. finally, the group could
also sell non-strategic assets in 2016, the income from which would be used for the general funding of its activities.

                                                   & development policy
2.
cgg's capacity to remain competitive on a depressed market while building toward the future is largely dependent on its capacity for permanent
technological innovation. the group believes that the future of the seismic industry relies on seismic equipment and services with high
technological content. with the market for products and services being subject to such downward pressure on prices, the development of new
solutions - from initial design through to market launch - must make cost reduction the number one objective. capitalizing on its integrated
approach, cgg has the capacity to reduce the cost of new solutions at each step in the value chain.
cgg is convinced that the seismic industry will put in place new solutions that will have an impact on exploration and production. the major
areas of oil exploration - arctic, offshore pre-salt layer structures at sea, and mountain ranges or jungles on land - are hard to survey and
constitute sensitive and complex environments ("frontiers"). in production, increasingly precise monitoring of reservoirs, in terms of both recovery
(maximizing oil recovery) and the risks associated with production ("geohazards"), requires our industry to conduct more repeated seismic
surveys (4d) and improve the accuracy of the data acquired in the shortest possible time. lastly, as the common denominator in all this, reducing
the costs of new solutions is vital to the short-term survival of all players in the industry.
with its experience, expertise and involvement in every aspect of the seismic industry, cgg is ideally placed to design and implement new
solutions.
to implement this vision, cgg focuses its efforts on the entire exploration-production chain, including reservoir characterization, development
of multi-component seismic data processing techniques, structural imaging, and improved operational performance. these efforts are focused
on improving geophysical target illumination during data acquisition, while increasing efficiency and safety. with more than 700 employees, the
r&d teams are spread around the world and cover a broad range of areas of expertise.
cgg also has access to new technologies through strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers, oil and gas companies, universities, and
by acquiring technologies under license.

                                                                    5.

group expenditure on r&d (including capitalized development costs) amounted to usd 143.1 million in 2014, or 6.8% of revenue.
in the difficult environment experienced by the seismic industry in 2015, and which will persist into 2016, cgg has only slightly reduced its r&d
investments compared to 2014, thereby demonstrating its resiliency in technological innovation as well as its continuing desire to differentiate
itself from the competition with the high technological content of its different solutions.
the broadseis / broadsource solution continues to be the seismic "broad frequency content" benchmark. this combination provides an
acquisition system capable of obtaining up to six frequency content octave bands (2.5 - 200 hz) which are key to creating subsurface images of
unparalleled resolution. the most remarkable part of this acquisition system combined with specific processing algorithms is the restitution of
very low frequencies (under 5 hz). these very low frequencies provide essential information for both profiling deeper targets and characterizing
hydrocarbon reservoirs using seismic data. the innovation and the expertise of cgg's ggr segment once again received strong client praise
in 2015.
this technological achievement has placed cgg in a class apart on the "broad frequency content" seismic market segment, widening the gap
with its direct competitors, and putting this market out of the reach of businesses with inferior r&d capabilities.
the stagseis multi-client acquisition campaigns make it possible to obtain very long distance (up to 20 km) seismic data with 360° azimuthal
distribution and very dense sampling. stagseis data sold well in 2015, demonstrating that stagseis is a solution that is perfectly suited to
addressing imaging difficulties, particularly in the gulf of mexico.
stagseis' success confirms cgg's ability to develop unique and highly-innovative acquisition designs to help meet the imaging challenges of
our customers, with solutions tailored to their needs. these innovations are possible thanks to cooperation between our acquisition experts, our
imaging experts and equipment provided by sercel. this type of approach makes it possible both to develop high-value-added customized
solutions and to propose innovations optimizing the use of imaging resources combined with substantial reductions in the final cost of the
solution.
other land or marine seismic acquisition systems using drones are currently being assessed by cgg and could be developed over the next few
years.

building on emphaseis vibrator operation technology using a wide frequency band and on cgg's experience with land acquisition systems
involving a large number of channels (up to 600 million traces per km 2), the ultraseis program is now able to offer efficiently and economically
broadband technology (6 octaves) for acquisition projects using a very large number of channels. the capacity of these systems will continue
to grow: today up to 200,000 channels, with the objective of reaching one million channels in five years’ time. this development is greatly
supported by sercel's new 508xt acquisition system. given the huge volumes of data required for the seismic imaging of reservoirs in the middle
east, these acquisitions with a very large number of channels are intended to provide solutions to near-surface and noise problems by increasing
the density of the source / receiver pairs. ultraseis is also based on an optimized operational model designed to provide major productivity
gains, and its integrated character ensures that the image provided is optimal for the quantitative characterization of the reservoir.
in depth imaging, cgg has pursued its development efforts to provide more accurate seismic images acquired in zones of complex geology.
the research and development programs relate to the second-generation migration algorithms (reverse time migration) and full waveform
inversion, taking into account absorption phenomena in anisotropic environments. these technologies operate high resolution seismic velocity
models, critical for the production of high-precision images. cgg is now a technology leader in this field. also to be noted in 2015 is the significant
effort that has gone into optimizing the calculation time for key algorithms.
cgg is also working on the combined processing of multiphysics and seismic data in order to exploit synergistically these two types of
measurement that are not sensitive to the same geological property variations. as in 2014, cgg continued in 2015 to provide results of
exceptional quality and recognized by the industry, and produced by a combination of seismic, resistivity, and gravity data to better characterize
the near subsurface.
concerning equipment, sercel's need to maintain a high level of research and development is justified by the high technological content of its
seismic equipment for land and marine acquisition. this intense r&d activity has put sercel at the cutting edge of technology for wireless data
transmission, the design and manufacture of sensors with low noise levels, and the design of miniaturized electronics that withstand extreme
environmental conditions. sercel's research also applies to underwater acoustics. the nautilus (lateral and vertical streamer positioning
controller) and seapronav (integrated navigation system) systems have reached industrial maturity and are now the industry standard used to
equip cgg's fleet.
in marine, sercel deployed its first quietsea aquatic activity monitoring systems, enabling passive detection of sea mammals during exploration
campaigns.
in 2015, sercel continued to market its sentinel streamers, including its latest product, the multi-sensor (ms) sentinel which provides an acoustic
vector sensor composed of a group of accelerometers arranged around a hydrophone.
sercel deployed its 508xl land acquisition system, combined with new, highly sensitive quietseis sensors, on crews in the middle east deploying
a large number of traces with extremely high productivity.
the 508xt is the epitome of what is done best in seismic data acquisition, with a simultaneous recording capacity of one million channels. this
system also includes new features facilitating increasingly complex land seismic exploration operations.
the market launch of the geowave 2 system was initiated. through its currently unrivalled temperature and pressure performance, geowave 2
enables seismic acquisition in deep, high-temperature boreholes.


8.3.          prospects for technological innovation and r&d         7.

8.
on the production side, improvements in monitoring techniques both in acquisition equipment and seismic data processing serve to optimize
shallow reservoir production. these also improve recovery rates, and extend the life of fields through appropriate management. in major oil-
producing regions such as the north sea and the middle east, these issues are of crucial importance for operators. however, they remain an
important avenue of study for developing seismic surveys as a core discipline in deep reservoir production where resolution and reliability need
to be improved.
in the field of exploration, r&d seismic achievements help identify prospective fields that are increasingly difficult to detect and reduce the
associated drilling risks. accordingly, the success rate of exploration wells tends to increase even though the easy targets were drilled first. the
contribution of new technologies justifies the regular reprocessing of previously acquired data and, increasingly, the acquisition of new seismic
data on surfaces that have already been surveyed in the past. in this way, technical progress directly affects the activity, in particular multi-client
activity or the reprocessing of old data with new algorithms.
finally, as in most fields related to the seismic industry, the concepts of "cloud" and "big data" will be increasingly integrated in the processing
of seismic data, while the use of marine and land drones should change current and medium-term operational models.
anticipating the difficult market conditions in 2016, cgg will be redirecting parts of its r&d efforts to the development and optimization of the
costs of its solutions so as to provide a sustainable response to the low price of the barrel. in this context, two major lines of development stand
out: cost reduction, to address the short-term context; and high value-added technological differentiation, in order to maintain technological
leadership.
reducing and optimizing the costs of the solutions:
           reducing and optimizing the cost of its solutions by capitalizing on its capacities as a mainstream player in geoscience. as part of an
            integrated approach, cgg will be looking to define the optimum quality/price ratio across the entire geophysical value chain, and
            thereby reduce costs while guaranteeing the necessary information for decision-making.
           the mechanization and automation of land and marine acquisition is a second avenue of cost reduction on which cgg is acting. this
            approach necessarily requires the redefinition of the existing operational models.

technological leadership:
           improving data quality, including expanding the range of recorded frequencies (high frequencies for better resolution and therefore
            better geological characterization of reservoirs, low frequencies ensuring better penetration to detect increasingly deeper targets)
           increasing the amount of data through greater density of acquisition and increased azimuthal coverage to explore the geological
            target from all possible angles
           associating increasingly diverse data types (secondary waves, well data, electromagnetic and gravity data in particular) to obtain
            the most accurate picture of the subsurface possible, as well as its porosity and permeability, and fluid content (water and
            hydrocarbons)
this quest for improved data will ultimately result in positioning seismic instruments ever closer to the reservoir.
despite the unfavorable context in 2016, cgg will continue to invest in research and development in order to support the group's capacity for
innovation, with regard to both geophysical services and equipment.

9. environment, sustainable development and human resources


cgg's major contribution to sustainable development is based on our capacity to deliver, over the long term, geoscience products and services
which provide a clearer understanding of reservoirs, which help our clients reduce risk and which lead to a more efficient and effective production
of energy resources. our business model is implemented with a respect for the environment and with care for our employees and the
communities in which we work.
cgg has been a member of the un global compact since 2007 and each year, our chief executive officer reaffirms our commitment to
respecting the environment and human rights, to promoting international labour standards and to combating all forms of corruption.
cgg is the only geoscience company whose performance has been recognised in the dow jones sustainability index (world and europe) in
2015.


9.1.         sustainable development strategy and governance

9.1.1.      ranking the issues relating to sustainable development: a regular exercise carried out with cgg stakeholders
dialogue with stakeholders is at the heart of cgg's sustainable development approach. acknowledging the interest and contribution of its
stakeholders in cgg's sustainable development, cgg listens to its stakeholders when validating its priority sustainable development issues.
every three years, cgg organizes an extensive consultation involving the management, a panel of employees, clients, investors, ngos and its
trade association in order to highlight the most critical sustainable development topics for the group. these priority issues are set out in the plot
area of the following graph. using a 0–3 scale of importance, the x-axis plots the priorities perceived within cgg, and the y-axis plots the
importance given to the issues by the external stakeholders, and hence their expectations. the graph below shows the results for the 2012-
2015 consultation. another consultation was carried out in late 2015 to guide the objectives and the actions to be undertaken during the period
2016 – 2018.

9.1.2.     sustainable development governance
9.1.2.1.   promoting an ethical culture and conduct
cgg’s values and rigorous ethical standards are the foundations of development for the cgg group. they require us to comply with laws and
regulations and the principles of our business code of conduct with regard to our clients, shareholders, employees, and partners. the business
code of conduct, available in nine languages, sets out the rules and expected behaviour to enable the group to conduct its business with
integrity.
the cgg ethics committee publishes and communicates the business code of conduct, ensuring that our standards are widely distributed.
the ethics committee promotes ethics training throughout the group, which is described in greater detail in section 9.3. (“employees”) of this
chapter.
the ethics committee is notified of any difficulty in interpreting or applying the business code of conduct. in addition to direct channels to
access the ethics committee, a whistleblowing procedure with hotline has been implemented in 2009. employees are regularly reminded of
ways to access the ethics committee. the ethics committee meets several times a year. it reports to the chief executive officer and to the
audit committee of the board of directors.
the number of referrals to the ethics committee in 2015 was comparable to that in 2014. the committee was mainly contacted:
           on issues of conflicts of interest that led managers or employees to raise questions ahead of a decision that might cause a conflict
            or regarding a relationship between cgg and one of its stakeholders;
           on issues concerning relationships between the employees and the company, which were handled in conjunction with the human
            resources department;
            by operational or functional departments, to answer questions from cgg clients about the group's approach to ethics, including our
            efforts to prevent corruption in activities.
the level of referrals to the committee, in particular requests for advice, show that the efforts undertaken in terms of communication and training
are producing results.


9.1.2.2.   anti-corruption program
cgg's sustainable development materiality study underlined the significant risk of corruption inherent to our sector of activity. a strong
compliance program within the group is a major focus for the cgg management team and a demonstration of its commitment to sustain the
group’s momentum in this area.
cgg continues its corruption prevention actions, for example through training activities (described in greater detail in item 2.3.3.3) and by
bolstering its rules and procedures, especially in the contractual terms and management of its various partners and service providers.
in 2015, the group appointed a compliance officer, who is mainly in charge of implementing the corruption prevention program within the group.
the compliance officer reports to the evp general secretary & group general counsel and is also a member and the secretary of the ethics
committee.
a communications campaign was launched within the group in december 2015, linked to the un international anti-corruption day, aimed at
raising the awareness of employees to this issue in particular and, more generally, to the importance of ethics within the cgg group.
cgg’s robust anti-corruption program has been recognized since 2014 every year by anti-corruption certifications issued by mazars-adit.
these certifications are based on a framework validated by the french central service of corruption prevention (a ministry of justice institution)
and by a panel of international experts.


9.1.2.3.   governance of sustainable development issues
responsibility for health, safety and the environment (hse) and human capital development lies with management. for this, it draws on hse
and human resources professionals in each business line and in the support functions.
the group executive management plays a vital role in defining the terms and conditions under which cgg can develop its business while
protecting its employees, local communities, and the environment. cgg's leadership in sustainable development is established at the highest
level through specific expectations on hse performance, regular communication, monitoring performance throughout the year, and implementing
necessary changes following periodic formal reviews.
the sustainable development committee assists management by defining the guidelines for the sustainable development program. three
times a year, this committee reports on the progress achieved to the corporate committee (c-com) and to the hse and sustainable
development committee of the board of directors. regular reviews are also carried out by business lines, the corporate committee and the
sustainable development committee to check that the system is operating correctly. these make it possible to identify areas for improvement
and corrective measures to be applied, and ensure that suitable resources are made available to achieve the expected results.




                                                                                                                                        page | 15

                                                       cgg – 2015 additional information



9.2.         health, safety, security and the environment

9.2.1.      material issues for health, safety, security and the environment (hse)
cgg's primary sustainable development priority consists of preventing workplace accidents and occupational diseases among employees and
subcontractors. historically, the group's main risk activities are road transport, helicopter operations, tree-felling, crossing lakes and rivers. cgg
is also committed to providing a healthy work environment with no addictive substance in the workplace.
the security of its employees is another absolute priority for cgg. the group is exposed to threats of burglary, assault, piracy and terrorism,
which it counters through a system based on prevention and dissuasion.
cgg seismic acquisition operations cover wide land and marine areas. sometimes our activities take us to areas almost devoid of human
intervention. the acquisition can also occur within ecosystems that are already fragile. consequently, cgg strives to develop geophysical
methods and equipment that enable its clients to prevent or reduce their environmental footprint. in particular, cgg seeks to contribute to better
knowledge of the potential impact of its sound emissions on the marine environment so as to adapt the necessary protection measures.


9.2.2.      policies applied to health, safety, security and the environment (hse) issues
9.2.2.1.    policies and objectives
cgg’s hse program is based on the conviction that all accidents can be prevented.
hse expectations are established by the chief executive officer and are included in hse, health and well-being, safety, and environment
policies. every employee can access these policies, either via the internet or displays at the group's sites. these policies are supported by
three-year objectives set by the chief executive officer and incorporated in the "care+protect" program.
group objectives defined by the management applying to the domains of health, safety, security and the environment target more specifically
the management commitment and visibility on hse topics, risk management, subcontractor management, competence and training. each
business line adopts these objectives and specifies them in annual programs so as to best respond to the issues characterising their activity.
in this way, every level of the organisation is clearly informed of the expected results and called on to help achieve them. group objectives also
serve as a base for personal objectives for the management team.


9.2.2.2.    the operational management system for health, safety and the environment (hse-oms)
cgg's structured approach to health, safety, and the environment is based on an operating management system for health, safety and the
environment (hse-oms). this has recently been extensively reviewed to comply with the latest international oil and gas producers (iogp)
guidelines for the development and application of health, safety and environment ("hse") management systems, which have become a de
facto standard in the industry. the hse-oms applies to all of the group's activities in the domains of health, safety, security, social responsibility
and the protection of the environment in all our sites and projects. its scope extends to our permanent staff, seasonal employees, and
subcontractors operating within our prevailing influence. the social responsibility domain will be described more specifically in item 4 of this
chapter.
risk management is central to the operational management system for health, safety and the environment (hse-oms). the group maintains
a structured approach aimed at identifying, assessing and controlling risks, based on a common group-wide methodology and model for risk
management. risks are assessed for each project or permanent installation. they incorporate incident history drawn from the group's database
and the database shared with the international association of geophysical contractors (iagc), which covers several decades of incidents.
through systematic risk assessments, and in particular the targeted identification of high-risk activities, we determine the necessary controls to
manage safety risks. these controls include procedures, work instructions, specific risk management training, site meetings and daily on-the-
ground hse inspections, supplemented by cross-department inspections. the cross-department inspections are carried out by a person external
to the inspected entity. drills carried out periodically at the installation and project level mean that the effectiveness of the emergency response
plans can also be checked. at the site and project level, line management carries out its own inspections and observations. a robust audit
program ensures that the group's hse policies and key processes are implemented and complied with in all our activities. the environment of
controls and monitoring is coupled with a culture of individual responsibility.
individual risk awareness and personal responsibility are essential elements of our operating management system for health, safety and the
environment (hse-oms). the group's behavioural safety program, entitled "rules to live by" and "things we all must know", is well rooted
across the organization since 2011. this program, focused on the group's key safety risks, is deployed across all activities and in several
languages, and these rules are supported by visible posters at the workplace and clear instructions.
the proper management of risks related to health, safety, security, and the environment requires transparent reporting and rapid, effective
communication. comprehensive notification of all incidents, near-misses and hazards is crucial to obtaining good results. our prism system
has been developed in-house for this purpose. prism is a software system that allows hse, quality and social responsibility files to be shared
by all cgg sites and operational units. it also allows to produce reports, check performance, assess and manage risk and action points. all
cgg employees can access prism. incidents are assessed according to their actual and potential severity, and a subscription system allows
the appropriate management level to be notified immediately, including the highest level management for high-potential incidents.
the final element in our management system consists in management reviews conducted within business lines, executive committee and
board hse and sustainable development committee. these reviews ensure the system's proper operation, identification of improvement areas
and corrective measures, and make sure that suitable resources are in place.

                                                       cgg – 2015 additional information


 health
 cgg implements occupational health programs aimed at maintaining quality of life at work through fitness for work programs and the
 prevention of occupational diseases. the management of health risks and impacts is systematically adapted to the local environment. it
 therefore takes into account the issues specific to very isolated areas and adapts the means of protection, rescue and assistance for the
 staff exposed, especially in the case of land geophysical projects. thus, in 2015 means for preventing malaria were bolstered in angola,
 through an update of a procedure to improve in particular the information (posters, e-learning). in algeria, the medical evacuation and
 repatriation plans were adjusted because of the site's extreme isolation, targeting the reinforcement of aircraft means.
  safety
 our risk analyses and prevention programs are directed first and foremost at high-risk activities (for example, road transport and offshore
 crew helicopter transfers). this year we bolstered these risk management and prevention programs through the development of e-learning
 training modules accessible to everyone and by producing a large number of posters and stickers covering all risk situations. we have also
 introduced u-safe, a new educational tool to grasp more practically the risks at the workplace.
 security
 cgg has implemented a security intelligence and monitoring system to identify and assess threats in areas prone to maritime piracy and
 potentially unstable areas onshore. projects in areas at risk are reviewed at the highest level, supported by assessments from security
 experts. local security plans, linked to projects, are produced and implemented before operations start. all staff also receive security
 information concerning their travel destinations.
 environment
 cgg strives to avoid or minimize the environmental footprint of its operations. historically, cgg's largest footprint concerned land acquisition
 activities, in particular from tree-felling linked to seismic line opening. changes in seismic acquisition technology and equipment developed
 by our equipment business line, in both sources and receivers, have significantly reduced this footprint. cgg implements environmental
 plans in all its business lines. these plans are aimed at eliminating or reducing the impact on the soil, water, fauna, flora and the atmosphere.
 assessing the actual impact of activities remains challenging in one area because of incomplete scientific knowledge: the effect of sound
 emissions from seismic acoustic sources on marine life. this is why cgg promotes research in this domain and has for over fifteen years
 implemented risk prevention and mitigation measures on vessels. marine mammal observer teams ensure compliance with applicable
 regulations stipulated by the country in which we are operating. where no regulations have been issued, cgg applies the risk mitigation
 measures recommended by the iagc.


9.2.2.3.    promoting hse excellence
for many years, acquisition projects implemented internal recognition measures rewarding proactivity with regard to hse. the quality and
quantity of notifications of dangers and near-misses reported at the project level are therefore generally linked to a system of material rewards
and formal recognition by the local management.
at group level, since 2014 cgg has also organised an annual competition: above & beyond/care+protect. the prizes reward cgg teams that
have achieved hse or sustainable development excellence through technological development, innovative behavioural practices, or the results
of an original initiative. in 2015, the jury rewarded three excellence projects. the first recognized health and fitness voluntary actions implemented
in rio, houston and singapore, promoting original and effective initiatives to improve the health and physical fitness of employees. the second,
awarded to hse training developers, recognised the significant increase in quality acquired by the in-house hse training courses thanks to the
adoption of new learning formats described in the results in terms of skills and training below. the third rewarded quietsea™, the new passive
acoustic monitoring system integrated with the seismic streamers, described in the environmental results below. a special prize was also
awarded to the most deserving subcontractor and joint-venture partner.
cgg also continued to play an active role on the hse committee of the international association of geophysical contractors (iagc); cgg
participated actively in a number of workgroups organised by international oil and gas producers (iogp). these committees facilitate the
sharing of lessons learned from the management of major near-misses or accidents, the dissemination of best practices, and reviews and
improvements to hse standards in the exploration & production industry.

the group has also again noted a decrease in the frequency of total recordable cases and again a decrease in the lost time injury frequency.
the frequency of hse incidents with high potential severity (potentially fatal incidents including near-misses), which is tracked worldwide, has
decreased.
in 2015, as in 2014, cgg noted improved compliance with "rules to live by" and "things we all must know", shown by a decrease in the
frequency of breaches of these principles. this improvement was more visible in the marine business line than in the land business line where
crews are renewed when they change locations.
cgg has maintained a high focus on its vehicle program by focusing on driving skills and assessments. cgg uses in vehicle monitoring
systems (ivms), speed limiting devices (sld), roll-over protection, and there are always trainers in defensive driving on our crews. our motor
vehicle crash (mvc) rate still improved in 2015.

9.2.3.3.   security
our security monitoring established a decrease in the threat level linked to maritime piracy in the indian ocean, but an increase in the jihadist
threat in north africa and the middle east. in august 2015, one of our subcontracted employees working on an argas land acquisition project
was taken by terrorists claiming to be from daesh (sinai branch, egypt), who claim to have killed him. government authorities have not yet
confirmed his death.


9.2.3.4.   environment
environmental footprint
land and marine seismic acquisition covered more than 150,000 square kilometers in 2015, a surface equivalent to florida. airborne acquisition
flew over an area equivalent to france. cgg suffered one significant environmental incident, namely a diesel oil spill caused by a fuel truck
supplying a land seismic camp in saudi arabia. in order to decontaminate the track impacted by the spill, a team collected all the contaminated
soil and sent it to an approved waste treatment facility.


sound emissions and the marine environment
efficient monitoring is key to mitigating the risk of sound emissions impacting marine life in either physiology or behaviour. the graph below
shows that passive acoustic monitoring, a technology detecting and localizing marine mammals through their vocalizations, has over the last
years been widely adopted as a monitoring tool.




cgg achieved significant progress in the efficiency of this monitoring technology thanks to quietsea, the integrated passive acoustic monitoring
system launched by sercel in early 2015. quietsea has been deployed on five marine seismic surveys in the north sea, indian ocean and the
atlantic. the system's robustness and its ability to locate marine mammals more accurately than conventional systems have been demonstrated.
the improved marine mammal localizations around seismic sources allow for more efficient risk reduction procedures such as the soft-start or
shutdown of seismic sources.
the end of 2015 also marked the completion of a two-year research project financed by cgg, whose aim was to better understand the impact
of different types of sound emissions on fish development. for the first time, independent researchers exposed seabass to different types of
sound emissions such as boat noise, pile driving and seismic operations over a long period and observed the resulting physiological effects on
the fish. they showed that fish acquire a tolerance to prolonged sound emissions. the research results have been submitted to peer-reviewed
scientific journals to ensure maximum transparency and value to the wider industry and research community (radford et al, submitted). this
project qualified a scientific methodological approach that can support r&d on marine seismic sources with the goal of minimizing their impact
on the marine environment.
cgg also continues to support, through iagc, the exploration & production industry's joint program "sound and marine life" which, since
2006, has provided us$55 million to support research. the results obtained by the various research projects are published on the site
www.soundandmarinelife.org and have been recognised by several environmental authorities as a significant contribution to better risk
management.


9.2.3.5.   skills and training
cgg hse training programs are provided on all company sites, at cgg university, and in the field. substantial efforts were made in 2015 to
develop e-learning courses supporting our hse operating management system. 27 modules were developed. topics previously available only
in the form of procedures – such as preventing malaria, managing fatigue, safe business travel, environmental management, corporate social
responsibility – are now covered in a more effective outreach program. the variety of formats available (educational films, e-learning courses,
powerpoint presentations) means that the way in which the training is delivered can be varied so as to optimise its assimilation. quizzes test
the acquisition of knowledge. in 2015, cgg delivered over 109,000 hours of hse training on site to its employees and subcontractors.




                                                                                                                                      page | 19

9.3.          employees

9.3.1.      employees’ material matters

9.3.1.1.    economic environment and related hr issues
despite difficult market conditions, respect for human rights and protection of employees remain priorities for cgg. the materiality analysis
(conducted in 2012 for a period of three years) on internal (management, employees) and external (customers, investors, ngos, iagc) actors
highlighted two hr themes confirming the company's position on its human resources: training and professional equality. these themes are still
relevant in 2015.


9.3.1.2.    training / hr development
in a globalized economy marked by the continuous creation of new trades, continuing training and professional development are emerging as
true strategic challenges. this competitive lever is an essential driver of innovation and growth.
it must constantly adapt to the new needs of employees; this requires more and more personalization, immediacy and mobility.


9.3.1.3.    professional equality
professional equality is also a strategic and economic issue and a performance asset for cgg. in france, legal obligations have steadily
increased in recent years especially with the french law of may 9, 2001 which introduced an obligation of negotiation in companies or branches,
the french law of march 23, 2006 on equal pay for men and women, decree no 2008-838 of 22 august 2008 on indicators in the annual report
on the comparative situation of general employment conditions and training of women and men in the company, and more recently law no.
2014- 873 of august 4, 2014 for equality between men and women to combat inequalities in private, professional and public areas.


9.3.2.      human resources policies

9.3.2.1.    environment
cgg is committed to maintaining working conditions that are compliant with health, safety, and ergonomics standards to contribute to employee
well-being and performance.


9.3.2.2.    employee assistance
the employee assistance program was renewed with the american company, compsych, in 2012 for five years until 2017. this program,
provided by a third party, guarantees confidentiality for the employee and aims to provide personal and individual medical, social, professional,
or legal assistance when needed.
in france, this program co-exists with other more conventional forms of social assistance implemented under french labor regulations: social
assistance, chsct (health, safety, and working conditions committee) and recourse to elected representatives. in countries where legislation
is less stringent, the program brings missing social assistance.


institutional labor relations
in order to promote cooperation and information exchange, the cgg sa - cgg services sa ues (social and economic grouping) and sercel
sa have representative bodies with which they organize a number of official meetings (works committee, staff representative meetings,
chsct, and various commissions) as well as trade union organizations with which agreements have been signed in france. within the cgg
sa - cgg services sa ues, employee rights are guaranteed by a company labor agreement. four ordinary and eight extraordinary chsct
meetings were held in 2015. twelve ordinary and seven extraordinary works council meetings were held in 2015. twelve employee
representative meetings were held in 2015.
similarly, employee representatives are elected for prospectors and cgg international's expatriate employees under the swiss code of
obligations. marine commission elections were held in 2012 and led to the formation of a new commission in 2013. the land commission was
renewed for another three years in 2013.
in singapore, 51 employees are represented under the collective bargaining agreement of december 31, 2012. these employees are
represented by the siseu (singapore industrial and services employees union) which is affiliated to the national trades union congress.
in norway, offshore crews on norwegian contracts (77 employees) are all part of a collective agreement, 31 office employees are covered by
two different collective agreements.
in switzerland, according to the law (code of obligations), employees’ representatives are elected for a period of three years.


compliance with international labor conventions
the group adheres to the principles and rules of the core conventions of the international labor organization (ilo). see details in section
9.4.2.1 (“social responsibilities/human rights”) of this chapter.

remuneration policy
cgg guarantees the homogeneity of the remuneration system while ensuring compliance with local legal and contractual frameworks and
practices. rewarding the performance of each employee is at the heart of the implementation of mechanisms to share value created by the
company.
this policy includes the following:
       -    remuneration intended to boost cgg's performance, aligned with the group's strategic objectives and likely to improve business
            performance.
       -    a remuneration policy in line with cgg's culture and values: simple and fair systems, and the wish to actively encourage personal
            involvement, teamwork, innovation, and commitment to health, safety, environment, and sustainable development issues.
       -    a competitive remuneration policy intended to attract, motivate, recruit, and retain skills needed by the group.
       -    a remuneration policy consistent with market practices regarding base salary, variable share (short and long-term), and benefits.
these general principles apply in each country where cgg is represented by employees.
in 2015, a performance-related bonus was paid to all employees for 2014. this variable portion of remuneration is implemented uniformly across
the group. it comes in two forms. one, for support and management entities (gpip or global performance incentive plan), is equally based on
collective financial performance and individual performance. the other, for production units, is based on their achievements compared to their
own production targets.
in france (cgg sa - cgg services sa ues, and sercel sa), the remuneration policy also includes the following specific elements:
   -       mandatory annual negotiations: wage negotiations with social partners in 2015 did not lead to any signed agreements. the 2015 pay
           increase was 0.5% of the ues’s total payroll and 0.3% of sercel sa’s total payroll (internal mobility and promotion support).
   -       profit sharing: the agreement originally signed on june 30, 2007 and renewed on june 20, 2012 between the ues and social partners
           was not renewed in 2015. sercel sa's profit-sharing agreement was renewed on june 18, 2015 resulting in a payment for 2014.
   -       participation: the ues's results did not permit to release any payment. regarding sercel sa, existing agreements in force in 2015
           continued to generate payments (for 2014).
   -       the supplementary savings and retirement plans (pee and perco) remain in force. as of the end of december 2015, 367 employees
           joined the pee and 549 joined the perco in cgg sa and cgg services sa and 698 employees joined the pee and 695 employees
           joined the perco in sercel sa.


9.3.2.3.    training and career development training
the training policy, as a lever of individual development and vocational training of employees, is a priority of the group which founded its own
corporate university several years ago: cgg university.
the university provides training courses intended to foster the development of our employees and accelerate the integration of new employees
in the group's various activities. it offers internal programs covering our core technical activities: seismic data acquisition, data processing and
management, interpretation, geology and reservoirs, and seismic equipment. these programs are provided by cgg university or in conjunction
with operational centers. it also provides technical training for our customers.
it is strategic for the company that our employees are prepared to handle business, managerial and social aspects of a technology company.
this is one of the main drivers that allowed programs on commercial and interpersonal skills to be developed.
the learning for development concept continues to be part of the programs deployed. it reflects the need for the organization and each
employee to continuously acquire the knowledge and skills they need to adapt to changing technologies and working methods. it also reflects
the need to adapt to organizational change and changing internal processes. cgg university is organized to ensure that there is a close
relationship between the internal training offer and operations.


9.3.2.4.    professional equality policy
measures to promote the employment and integration of disabled employees
the group, as specified in its human resources policy, rejects all forms of discrimination in employment or during the career of its employees.
in particular, this concerns discrimination against people with disabilities. the group complies with national legislation and does not publish
statistics on the subject due to the nature of its activities and the constraints related to the collection and analysis of information that might exist
in some countries which prevents the group from recording this information in its databases (discrimination).
in france, the group is subject to the law of february 11, 2005 on equal rights and opportunities as well as the participation and citizenship of
people with disabilities


agreement on gender equality
cgg is making a special effort to promote greater gender balance in managerial functions through promotions and targeted recruitment.
in france, the agreement on gender equality signed on december 21, 2011 as part of the cgg sa - cgg services sa ues expired on
december 20, 2014. new negotiations were initiated in 2014 but failed in 2015.
this agreement also provided for the monitoring of recruitment for the future and gender equality awareness programs for employees and more
particularly management staff.
an agreement on gender equality was also negotiated for sercel sa and signed on october 23, 2012. this agreement provides for specific
actions on job desegregation, access to training, career paths, and pay equity.




                                                                                                                                            page | 21

                                                     cgg – 2015 additional information



this type of agreement only exists in the french regulatory framework. to overcome this deficiency worldwide, the hr function has implemented
monitoring analysis on the gender distribution in the group's various activities and main countries of operation.
note that the text of the group human resources policy, published in 2010 and amended in 2012, explicitly provides for non-discrimination in
recruitment and equality of opportunities and treatment.


9.3.3.      main results relating to employees

9.3.3.1.    situation and developments in 2015
in 2014, the group engaged in an ambitious transformation plan to adapt to very adverse market conditions and preserve the soul of the company
while aiming to shift from a seismic acquisition company to an integrated geosciences group. the plan continued in 2015 with the following key
events:
           implementation of a more centralized, more effective, and more fluid governance and organizational structure
           reduction of the marine acquisition fleet to address supply and demand issues in the sector
           announcement of an employment protection plan in france
the figures provided below are for the cgg group (world) (see methodology section). on december 31, 2015, the group employed 7,277
permanent employees against 8,540 on december 31, 2014). the following are the main indicators of the group's human resources:
           7,277 employees
           over 90 nationalities
           over 70 locations worldwide

                                                      cgg – 2015 additional information




            reverse trend for expatriates category is explained by the significant drop (38%) of number of employees in this category.


 in 2015, 240 entries and 1,471 exits were recorded for the group's
 permanent employees.
 entries include 212 employments and 28 re-employments.
 exits include both voluntary departures (retirement, resignations,
 etc.) and involuntary departures (redundancies). departures break
 down as follows:




over the whole of 2015 a balance of 32 people has been deducted for contract suspension or effective transfer to a joint venture.
the decrease in our activity resulted in us recruiting considerably fewer employees in 2015. internal mobility was focused on via a global online
tool, always in a consistent and unified framework on all business lines and geographic areas. cgg continues to be at the forefront of innovation
and develop the experience and expertise of its teams.
the group maintains close relations with schools and universities and continues to participate in forums and educational programs to inform
schools and universities on geosciences. these programs are notably implemented by trade associations such as the seg (society of
exploration geophysicists) and eage (european association of geoscientists & engineers).
this promotion initiative is combined with work placement opportunities and first experiences abroad in a number of forms: school work
placements, apprenticeships and vocational training contracts, industrial research training agreements (cifre), contracts, ivp, etc.


9.3.3.2.     working environment
employees are subject to compliance with the working times stipulated in the social regimes of their countries of assignment.
"prospector" contracts are contracts that provide for rotational work arrangements, such as five weeks of work for five weeks of rest in marine
acquisition. land acquisition rotations are more flexible according to the nature and duration of projects.
in france, group working conditions are governed by a specific company labor agreement whose terms have been adopted in consultation with
social partners. this agreement is common to the parent company, cgg sa, and cgg services sa as part of the implemented ues (economic
and social unit). it does not include sercel sa which is subject to the collective bargaining agreements for the metallurgy industry.


four types of working schedules are provided for in this collective bargaining agreement:
   -       two regimes are for people working in offices or workshops (time-sheets and time-by-day)
   -       one is for annualized prospectors (set number of days of work per year) who work in rotation
   -       one is for non-annualized prospectors who acquire rest days based on the number of days worked in the field.
employee working rhythm is governed by an agreement on the reduction of working hours signed on august 27, 1999 and implemented, following
the principle of annualization, by the implementing agreement of february 17, 2000.
a working time account was implemented in parallel with the implementation of the 35 hour working week. similar schemes regarding work time
planning have been implemented on sercel sa's french sites.




                                                                                                                                      page | 23

  absenteeism
  the group's absence management tool generates statistics for key countries within the limits of local laws and data reliability which is constantly
  improving. it is important to note that these figures are difficult to compare as the notions of work and absence are diverse and long-term
  absences are not taken into account in the same way by the various local laws.
  in 2015, homogenized absenteeism rates (excluding equipment and parental leave) are listed below and compared with available national
  statistics (year availability dependent on country, similar scope i.e. absences for illnesses and accidents only). cgg is well positioned with rates
  that are lower than the national averages available.

  9.3.3.3.    professional training and hr development
  cgg continues to implement a strategy which aims to help develop the skills of its employees and its organization. the knowledge and skills
  and competencies required for each job are regularly identified and assessed. employee development through training, mentoring, and coaching
  and the broadening of assignments and experiences foster employee mobility and challenges. the development and a range of training courses
  tailored to our present and future needs, make cgg university a privileged partner.


  training
  in 2015, cgg university continued to enrich its catalogue of courses in reservoir and geoscience. moreover, for the effective dissemination of
  knowledge, 42 conferences on topics relating to geosciences and management with a total of 1,211 participants were organized worldwide.
  cgg university also offers management training programs. in 2015, these programs continued to develop by building skills in line with cgg's
  leadership model. the offerings of personal development programs in negotiations, marketing, project management, and qhse (quality, health,
  safety, and environment) policies were updated or expanded.
  cgg university provided 10,968 days of training in 2015 of which 1,090 were for external customers and 9,878 for cgg group employees. the
  1,090 days of training provided to external customers concerned data acquisition and processing techniques. the 9,878 days of training provided
  to our employees break down as follows:
  1,159 introductory days on the basics of our businesses and geosciences, 2,156 in depth technical training days, 384 training days focused on
  health, safety, and the environment, 5,076 days devoted to management, leadership, and personal development programs and 1,103 training
  days for technical conferences.
  finally, training activities relating to the promotion of ethics, the understanding of the business code of conduct, and the fight against
  discrimination and harassment continued to be deployed (e-learning). the attendance rate for this training was 92% of the company's total
  population on december 31, 2015.

in addition to the group's corporate university, training programs are also offered by third parties (external training organizations). external
training provided by specialized professional bodies or equipment suppliers concern the acquisition of specific technical skills or generic business
skills and can lead to a qualification. health, safety, and environment (hse) training, such as offshore safety induction, first aid, and fire-fighting,
is mandatory for our prospectors and staff visiting our seismic acquisition vessels. finally, a third type of training is provided in situ by operations
staff themselves which include, among others, the continuous training of geophysicists or hse and professional training for employees assigned
to offshore and onshore surveying missions.
to better direct training and improve the return on investment, cgg developed and has deployed the course tracker (ct) tool since 2013.
initiated by subsurface imaging division, this tool is currently being adapted and deployed group-wide. this tool aims to group the training offer
(internal and external) and serve as a single portal to record 100% of training received by employees. in 2015, use of ct by the university was
100% (group) and business lines (subsurface imaging, geoconsulting) continued to deploy the tool. course tracker has been improved to
allow external training followed by the employee to be registered (‘self-service’ mode). this new feature is currently deployed in the usa. course
tracker recorded 22,549 days of training in 2014 and 18,423 in 2015 (including the 10,968 days of training provided by the university).
cgg plans to continue deployment in the coming years to cover all training. deployment in the usa is expected to be completed and deployment
in france to begin in 2016. 2016 will also be the year where the cgg university course tracker data's reliability will be improved to only retain
course tracker as a reporting tool.
training data for 2015 is as follows:

hr development
the group continued to use its human resources development tools in 2015 to encourage discussion on personal and career development for
employees. the main aspects and tools are: annual performance interview, personal development plan, annual review, and succession plan.
the annual review process for employees helps maintain a succession plan for key positions in the group and identify promising talent. following
this identification, personal development plans are formalized for this category of employees to help them acquire or develop skills.
international mobility is an integral part of the group's business. in 2015, in parallel with the group's restructuring effort, we continued to
implement the expatriation policy (revised in 2014) and encouraged mobility, in particular, through the inclusion and development of local talent.


9.3.3.4.   professional equality
the percentage of women in the group is stable at 26.9%.
in france, the wage gap between men and women decreased from 1.30% (2014) to 0.89% (excluding equipment and prospectors).
in 2015, cgg moved up to 15th (21st in 2013 and 17th in 2014) in the ranking of the 'feminization' of the sbf 120's governing bodies published
by the ministry of women's rights.
out of the group's 7,277 permanent employees the gender distribution is as follows:

9.4.        social responsibility

9.4.1.      main social responsibility focus areas
in the area of social responsibility, cgg focuses its efforts on the fight against corruption (described in section 9.1.2.2. of this chapter), respect
for human rights, its relationships with local communities, as well as their development.


9.4.2.      policies applied to social responsibility
in the hse-oms introduced early 2015, social responsibility is a distinct domain covering all group activities that could have an impact on the
social environment of our operations.

9.4.2.1.    human rights

the group's sustainable development policy stipulates that cgg, as a member of the un global compact, acknowledges and promotes the
ten principles derived from the universal declaration of human rights, the ilo's declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work,
the rio declaration on environment and development, the united nations convention against corruption and the united nations declaration
on the rights of indigenous people.
in addition, cgg human resources policy prohibiting child labour clearly states that the minimum age to work for cgg or for one of its service
providers is 16. young workers aged 16–18 are extremely rare at cgg and are subject to additional supervision and precautionary measures
aimed at protecting their health, safety and integrity.
training courses in the hse-oms system for the hse community and managers all include a component related to these issues. this also
applies to hse-oms audits, verifying that the principles adhered to by the group are put into practice.
as a last resort, the whistleblowing procedure is available to any employee who wants to report a human or labour rights issue to the ethics
committee. this mechanism is described in section 9.1.2.1 "promoting an ethical culture and conduct" of this chapter.

9.4.2.2.   managing relations with local communities
developing and maintaining harmonious relations with local communities is paramount to the success of the group operations, especially for
obtaining access to land in order to image their subsurface. cgg undertakes to respect and discuss with the local communities living close to
its seismic acquisition projects.
on seismic acquisition projects relations with local communities are generally managed by the clients, who are likely to operate in the survey
area for much longer than cgg. as a responsible partner, cgg nevertheless cooperates with the procedures implemented by its clients.
on all its multi-client seismic acquisition projects, cgg assumes sole responsibility for relations with local communities. projects where there
are frequent interactions with local communities are thus closely managed, and cgg applies its expertise acquired over many years through its
permitting teams.
to safely complete acquisition projects, line management and the dedicated permitting teams identify the associated stakeholders and initiate
a dialogue as early as possible in the project. they define the most responsible way of accessing their operating grounds to coexist with their
activities, whether on land or at sea. the evaluation of the risks and opportunities related to our community relations is part of each project risk
assessment (pra).
cgg continues to promote documentation developed to support seismic acquisition activities in managing community relations and highlight
the best practices field-proven by the permitting teams. the "community relations management plan" (crmp) and its four associated guides
(management of fishing activities, management of permitting and access to land, managing local temporary staff during onshore surveys, and
implementation of a sustainable development project) enable closer management in areas where cgg's seismic acquisition surveys could
significantly impact life and activities of a community. this is, for example, the case for marine surveys in heavy fishing grounds or land surveys
in urban or cultivated areas.


9.4.2.3.   local content
cgg's presence in 43 countries opens up tremendous opportunities for it to make a positive contribution in a number of areas to the social and
economic environment of the communities hosting its operations.

employment
seismic acquisition, whether on land or at sea, is nomadic and temporary by nature. consequently, cgg's ability to recruit and obtain supplies
locally is a crucial factor for success. our land survey projects therefore try as far as possible to continuously employ local staff during several
successive surveys. the guide 'managing local temporary staff during onshore surveys', associated with the crmp described above, provides
assistance for operations management on this critical issue.

local procurement for land surveys
during land acquisition surveys, cgg is particularly committed to contributing to the development of the acquisition region by sourcing locally
(see the "responsible procurement" section below).

partnerships with universities and donations of software for educational purposes
in order to be able to recruit a qualified workforce from close to our centres, efforts have been implemented for several years through training
programs and partnerships with local universities. consequently, cgg has signed a number of cooperation agreements worldwide providing for
the donation of hampson-russell reservoir characterisation software or geovation seismic data processing software licences.

9.4.2.4.   responsible procurement
procurement of goods and services is significant at cgg, representing 64% of the turnover in value. cgg is committed to managing suppliers
and subcontractors to ensure their respect of hse, human rights and anti-corruption policies, norms and standards. the purchasing department
has therefore developed methods and tools, among which the supplier code of conduct, which describes the minimum social and environmental
standards expected from our suppliers, in particular with regard to compliance with international conventions on labour rights and human rights.
acquisition projects make regular use of service subcontracting. the framework agreements that have been developed for these service
provisions precise cgg expectations regarding respect for human rights. respect of these rights is subsequently verified during audits of cgg's
operational management system for health, safety and the environment (hse-oms).
the procurement procedure specifies the responsibilities and code of conduct that each employee interacting with a service provider is required
to comply with. other procedures specify the suppliers' management of hse aspects and the way in which they are assessed.


9.4.3.     main results achieved for corporate social responsibility

9.4.3.1.   human rights
since 2013 cgg has been a "gc advanced" member of the global compact, underlining its advanced level of implementation and higher
degree of engagement concerning the issues of human rights and labour rights.
the 40 audits carried out in 2015 all verified the application of the fundamental rights at work, such as eliminating forced labour and child labour,
non-discrimination and respect for freedom of association. audit observations concerning respect for human rights are reported to management
and are included in the project assessments.

                                                      cgg – 2015 additional information



9.4.3.2.    managing relations with local communities

in 2015, cgg was responsible for managing relations with local communities on marine surveys in australia, brazil, colombia, gabon, india,
malaysia, norway, u.k. and vietnam as well as in algeria, egypt, saudi arabia and thailand land seismic acquisition projects. no significant
detrimental consequences to the communities have been noted or reported. good practices aimed at developing the community health or
capacities have been identified. in algeria, ten medical beds, two air conditioners, one resuscitation pack, twenty glucometers, twenty blood
pressure monitors and other basic equipment have been offered to the nearest hospital to the land seismic camp. on the coast of the state of
barreirinhas, brazil, 78 artisanal fishing vessels were equipped with deflectors. local small-scale fishermen were offered training, during which
they were taught about their use, which allow their boats to be detected by vessels operating in their fishing zone. with regard to the contribution
to the community health, the most widespread best practice on the permanent sites consists in organizing blood donation drives. the calgary,
houston, massy, mumbai, perth and rio de janeiro sites have organized drives for several years.
cgg has also continued the community relations program initiated in 2012 in brazil (pernambuco) aimed at developing the abilities of several
fishing communities. operations already made possible by this plan include training the fishermen in the techniques of sustainable fishing and
first aid, renovating the premises of several fishermen's organisations, re-establishing a fish market, and building a fish processing centre.

9.4.3.3.    local content
employment
maintaining long-term relationships with national partners is key to cgg's strategy. the argas joint venture established with taqa in saudi
arabia has been in operation for 49 years. the ptsc joint venture in vietnam was formed more recently, 4 years ago.
our permanent sites principally employ national employees. thus, among all cgg staff (prospectors excepted), 78% of employees are working
in a country from which they are nationals. additionally, among cgg services centres exceeding 50 employees, 70% of managers are nationals
of the country where they work.
regarding short-term employment for land acquisition, locally hired staff and continuation of employment over several successive surveys is
favoured whenever possible. in 2015, cgg carried out land acquisition operations, either directly or through its participation in the argas joint
venture, in seven non-oecd countries (algeria, angola, egypt, oman, saudi arabia, thailand and united arab emirates), for a total of 1.44
million work days by employees who are nationals from those same countries.

partnerships with universities and donations of software for educational purposes
with donations or licence renewals by cgg geosoftware in 2015 of us$450 million (estimated market value), the cgg geosoftware partnership
university program encourages innovative educational approaches in geosciences. it therefore means that students can train on state of the art
industry leading software systems and develop new techniques for characterising reservoirs, and allows them to practice on actual data
examples. this program is international in scope: in 2015, cgg geosoftware was a partner with 116 universities throughout the world, including
32% located in countries considered to be emerging or developing (non-oecd countries). in most of these countries, software donations are
very often accompanied by logistical assistance, donations of computer equipment and also, when this is possible, tutoring by cgg employees.
cgg subsurface imaging also maintains a partnership program with universities and scientific research institutes. to date, geovation licences
have been granted to a total of 11 universities and research laboratories (including 4 located in non-oecd countries). the total market value of
these licences is estimated at us$5 million. for its most recent donation cgg has teamed up with the university of the witwatersrand in south
africa, granting the geoscience department a multi-user geovation licence free of charge. this donation, accompanied by a donation of computer
equipment and a 2-week on-site training course for 3 persons, including the head of the research department, has already produced results. it
has allowed the first seismic research centre to be opened at the university, attracting a number of phd students in seismic reflection. these
students processed and interpreted existing seismic data, thereby contributing to improving knowledge and to the development of several south
african energy basins.

local procurement for land surveys
to properly conduct land operations in 2015, over us$13 million benefited the local economy in non oecd countries. the main expenditure
categories were personnel, overhead (camp, catering, telecom, travel, etc.) and equipment, respectively representing 33%, 23% and 15% of
the expenditure.


9.4.3.4.    responsible procurement
although the volume of purchases by the group is very large, exposure to environmental and social responsibility risks in its procurement chain
is very limited. the group purchased in 2015 78% of its products and services from suppliers in countries considered to have a low risk of
corruption by transparency international (corruption perception index higher than or equal to 60). most of these countries are oecd countries
which have issued environmental regulation and signed international labour organisation ("ilo") fundamental labour conventions.
a performance assessment program is implemented to monitor suppliers considered as critical to marine operations. the first set of criteria
being monitored pertains to health, safety and environmental matters. in 2015, 63 supplier performance assessments were realized.

        despite the reduction of marine seismic acquisition activities, the fuel consumed by the seismic fleet still accounts for 89% of the group
        energy consumption. vessels’ energy efficiency is a key element in the relation between cgg and its ship managers. ship managers
        formalize their commitments in their ship energy efficiency management plans. cgg has been developing the ecomax program in order
        to maximize opportunities to gain in efficiency. in 2015, ecomax registered 1456 m3 of saved marine diesel oil, representing 3,9 ktonnes
        co2 eq. not emitted in the atmosphere. financially, this represents a saving of about a million dollars. operationally, this fuel allows a
        seismic vessel to transit 2.5 times from europe to the americas.

        subsurface imaging needs a high computing capacity. the energy efficiency of our data centers continues to improve, thanks among others to
        the expansion of the oil immersion cooling system in the houston center. cgg’s oil immersion cooled data center is the largest installation of
        this type in the world.

9.6.          reporting scope and method

9.6.1.      selection and pertinence of indicators

published data is intended to inform stakeholders of cgg's sustainable development results for the current year. it is in line with iogp and
global reporting initiative (gri) recommendations on information transparency regarding social responsibility and the environment. the
information retained followed a materiality analysis process involving the consultation of internal and external stakeholders.
indicators were selected to monitor:
-       cgg's hse and sustainable development commitments and policies integrated in management systems,
-       performance relating to cgg's main risks and impacts,
-       regulatory obligations (the french commercial code which was updated in 2012 by a decree implementing article 225 of the grenelle ii
        law).

the 42 themes mentioned in the decree are handled as transparently as possible. some are not reported on in great detail for the following
reasons:

      measures for consumer health and safety

       cgg mainly provides services to its industry clients and is not in contact with consumers. the equipment division, which sells industrial
       seismic products, trains its clients to use its products and provides all information about the components used. to date, the group has not
       been informed of any adverse effects.

      consumption of raw materials and measures to improve efficiency in their use

       the consumption of raw materials within cgg is limited to the equipment business line. the ecodesign approach to equipment
       manufacturing aims to minimize the use of raw materials. the reduced product weight is generally indicated on the product factsheet to
       inform the customer. in addition, a due diligence has been conducted to determine whether the minerals used in our manufacturing stem
       from the democratic republic of congo and its neighboring countries.

      water use and supply according to local constraints

       cgg does not use much water (volume estimated at 347,000 m3 in 2015). land acquisition projects in desert or water-stressed areas are
       also consuming a very limited amount of water (average of 160 liters per employee per day on our 2015 algerian operations).
       environmental risk assessment and management plans established prior the start of land acquisition projects integrate the protection of
       local water resources.

      prevention, recycling and waste disposal measures

       the prism and sercel databases provide detailed information on the categories and quantities of generated waste. waste, including
       hazardous waste, is however not material enough at group level to require detailed reporting. about 12,000 tons of waste were generated
       in 2015; 75% of this waste was non-hazardous. permanent sites, vessels and land acquisition projects have developed waste
       management systems that all include the same principles: avoid, reduce, reuse, and treat/recycle.

      adaptation to climate change

       climate change should not have a significant impact on the group's activities in the short-term. the group also strives to continuously
       reduce its environmental footprint and improve the use of resources such as energy.

                                                     cgg – 2015 additional information


    measures to enhance biodiversity

     the group is particularly committed to minimizing the environmental footprint of its activities so as to not impact habitats and their related
     biodiversity.

    soil use

     most of cgg permanent sites are located in highly urban areas and have not caused any cropland loss. land seismic acquisition projects
     that require to access crops or cultivable land are tightly managed by a permitting team in order to prevent or reduce potential damage.
     compensation systems are agreed upon whenever necessary.

    amount of provisions and guarantees for environmental risks

     cgg has not established any provision for environmental risk. the amount of guarantees is considered confidential.

    use of renewable energy sources

     most of the energy used by cgg is for the marine or land transport of marine and land acquisition activities. these activities lend
     themselves poorly to the use of renewable energies, especially as seismic vessels or vibrators are refueled during surveys to minimize
     trips to port or seismic camp. cgg permanent office locations do consider the use of renewable energy where available on a case by case
     basis. for example, all british cgg sites are supplied with electricity produced from a mix of wind, wave, solar, biomass, and hydro power.


9.6.2.     methodology

cgg hse reporting procedures are based on the group's event reporting, recording and classification guidelines.
social reporting consolidation rules and adjustments are defined by a protocol to ensure comparability and traceability of the information
provided.

9.6.3.     reporting scope

health, safety, environmental and social reporting concerns all employees and contractors working in cgg's prevailing influence, namely all of
our sites and acquisition activities that are at least 50% cgg owned and which are consolidated in the group’s financial statements.
as an exception to this rule, hse reporting also covers the operations of:

-     argas in the middle east,
-     amadeus and binh minh, the ships operated by cgg through the ptsc cggv geophysical survey company limited joint venture in
      vietnam,
unless otherwise specified, all statistics provided in this report include this scope which accounted for 52 million hours worked in 2015.
data associated with acquisitions is recorded as soon as possible and no later than january 1 of the following year; sales activities are recorded
in the month following their actual output.


9.6.4.     consolidation and internal controls

hse data is reviewed on a weekly basis by hse support functions. the data is then consolidated every month at business line and group
level. data pertaining to certain specific indicators are calculated directly by the businesses. these processes undergo regular internal audits.

social data is stored in the human resources information system by local human resources administrative entities, or through a special
structure set up for this purpose (employee service center for north america). this data is checked at three levels:

-   a level of sox compliance, via annual audits and setting up of control points for individual data such as; gender, birth dates, seniority,
    wages, promotions, tax situations, type of contract, etc.;
-   a level of compliance via the pay slip or monthly time sheet, when the base is coupled to an hrms payroll engine,
-   a level of compliance regarding organizational reporting lines, belonging to a given business family, a division, a function, a business line
    etc. is done by checking made by operational and functional hr managers at the time of the monthly or quarterly reporting.

commerce) with the limitations specified in the methodological note (section 2.6) in chapter 2 of the reference document.

based on this work, we confirm the presence in the management report of the required csr information.

     2.    limited assurance on csr information

nature and scope of the work

we undertook approximately fifteen interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the csr information in the different departments
of sustainable development, human resources and hse, in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable, the people responsible for
internal control processes and risk management, in order to:

-   assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability,
    taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;
-   verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
    csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information.

we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information, in relation to the
characteristics of the company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best
practices.

for the csr information which we considered the most important11:

-   at the level of the consolidated entity, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information
    (organisation, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the
    calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented
    in the management report;

-   at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected12, based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators,
    their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests
    on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. the sample selected
    therefore represented for example 19% of total headcount, 7% of lost time accidents, 6% of energy consumption.

for the other consolidated csr information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company.

finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information.

we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express
a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. due to the necessary use
of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection
of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated.

conclusion

based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information, taken together, has
not been fairly presented, in compliance with the criteria.

12. report of the chairman on board of directors’ composition, preparation and
organization of the board of directors' work, on internal control and risk management
in accordance with article l.225-37 of the french commercial code, the purpose of this document is to report on the composition, the conditions
of preparation and organization of the meeting of the board of directors, on the limitations of the authority of the management as well as the
internal control and risk management procedures put in place within cgg (hereinafter referred to as "the company") and its consolidated
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "group"). the board of directors approved this report in its session of march 2, 2016.
this report informs shareholders of the oversight assured by general management and the board of directors of the activities of the company.
such oversight involves assuring:
-       on the one hand, that acts of management and transactions and the behavior of personnel adhere to guidelines established by corporate
        governance bodies, applicable laws and regulations, standards, and internal rules and procedures of the company;
-       on the other hand, that the accounting, finance and management information, provided to corporate governance bodies offers a reliable
        and sincere presentation of the activity and situation of the company and the consolidated group.
one of the objectives is to anticipate and manage risks resulting from the activity of the company and risks of errors or fraud, particularly in
accounting and finance.
however, as with all control systems, there is no absolute guarantee that such risks can be entirely eliminated.
in accordance with article l. 225-37 of the french commercial code, this report is divided into three sections:
-       board of directors’ composition and preparation and organization of the board of directors' work (i),
-       limitations imposed on management authority (ii),
-       procedures of internal control and risk management implemented by the company (iii).

                                    yes = compliance with the afep-medef code in relation to independence criteria
                                  no = non-compliance with the afep-medef code in relation to independence criteria


    these criteria are the following:


    criterion no 1: not to be an employee or an executive director of the corporation, or an employee or director of its parent or a company that it
    consolidates, and not having been in such a position for the previous five years;
    criterion no 2: not to be an executive director of a company in which the corporation holds a directorship, directly or indirectly, on in which an
    employee appointed as such or an executive director of the corporation (currently in office or having held such office going back five years) is a
    director;
    criterion no 3: not to be a customer, supplier, investment banker or commercial banker:
                that is material for the corporation or its group;
                or for a significant part of whose business the corporation or its group accounts ;
    criterion no 4: not to be related by close family ties to an executive director;
    criterion no 5: not to have been an auditor of the corporation within the past five years;
    criterion no 6: not to have been a director of the corporation for more than twelve years;
    criterion no 7: not to represent a significant shareholder of the company holding more than 10% of the voting rights).


    with regard to the criterion relating to the business relationship, there is no business relationship between on the one hand, directors and/or
    companies in which they hold an office and, secondly, the company or its group. therefore, in the absence of such relationship, in 2015, the
    board of directors did not have to assess the significant nature of any business relationship with regard to criteria determined in relation with
    the characteristics of the company and the business relationship in question.
    finally, the board of directors also confirmed that mr. remi dorval, who qualified as independent before his appointment as chairman of the
    board, continued to meet all of the criteria set out by the afep-medef code.
    in its meeting held on march 2, 2016, the board therefore confirmed that seven out of the twelve directors who were sitting on the board at that
    time qualified as independent (i.e. more than half of the board members, which is compliant with the recommendation of the afep-medef
    code13): mrs. agnès lemarchand, mrs. gilberte lombard, mrs. hilde myrberg and mrs. kathleen sendall and messrs. loren carroll, remi
    dorval and michael daly.


    update on the company's application of the principle of a balanced representation of men and women on the board of directors:
    pursuant to a law dated january 27, 2011 and the afep-medef code, the board of directors has taken the initiative to better balance the
    women and men representation in the board. as of the date of the present report, with five women on the board out of twelve directors, the
    number of women in the board is exceeding 40%.

    13 the afep-medef code recommends that independent directors should account for half the members of the board of directors in widely-

    held corporations without controlling shareholders.

i.3.        activity of the board of directors:
       1.     role of the board of directors:
pursuant to article l.225-35 of the french commercial code, the board lays down the guidelines governing the company's activity and sees to
their application. subject to the powers explicitly assigned to the shareholders' meetings and within the limits of the business purpose, it
considers any question affecting the proper operation of the company and it settles the matters concerning it.


       2.     preparation of meetings:
the operating procedure of the board is governed by internal rules and regulations (hereafter the "internal rules and regulations of the board of
directors") which are available on the company’s website (www.cgg.com). their main provisions are summarized below.


information to be provided to directors:
in preparation of every board meeting, the board's secretary sends documentation to the directors containing all useful information on each of
the points appearing on the meeting agenda. this documentation is generally uploaded on the secured website of the board of directors and
its committees to enable the directors to review it before the meeting.
furthermore, directors are kept informed and consulted by the chief executive officer between board meetings about all events or operations
of importance to the company.
a draft version of press releases related to quarterly, semiannual and annual financial statements and all events or operations of importance
for the company are sent to directors sufficiently in advance of their publication so they can transmit their comments to the general
management. other press releases are systematically sent to them at the same time they are published by the company.
in general, the chairman of the board ensures that directors are able to fulfill their duties. for this purpose, he assures that each of them
receives the documents and information necessary to perform their duties. in addition, board members usually meet for a two-day annual
strategic seminar generally held close to one of our operational sites. the agenda of this seminar is determined by the chief executive officer,
in close cooperation with the chairman of the board and the chairman of each board committee.


       3.     board meetings:
at every meeting, the board is informed of the evolution of the operating and financial performance of the main segments of the group since
the last meeting.
this information per segment is supplemented by a particular review of the consolidated financial situation of the group in terms of debt, cash
flow and financial resources available available on a short-term basis and in the light of forecasts.
all transactions with a material impact on the strategy of the group such as acquisitions, partnerships, disposals or strategic investments are
subject to the prior authorization of the board after the technology/strategic committee has issued its recommendation. the board is regularly
informed on the progress of the transaction in question.
the board of directors meets at least four times per year in the presence of the statutory auditors and whenever circumstances so require.
pursuant to the internal rules and regulations of the board of directors, directors may participate in board proceedings through
videoconferences or telephone conferencing provided such telecommunication means permit the identification of participants and allow them to
effectively participate to the meeting in the conditions set forth in article l.225-37 of the french commercial code. they are in such cases counted
as present for the calculation of the quorum and majority in accordance with the rules of the board of directors. however, pursuant to law the
said procedure may not be used in connection with the following decisions:
   -    establishment of the annual financial statements and of the management report;
   -     establishment of the consolidated financial statements and of the report on the management of the group, if that is not included in the
        annual management report.
in addition, pursuant to the internal rules and regulations of the board of directors, this restriction also applies to decisions relating to the
establishment of the half-year financial statements and related board report.


       4.     rules applicable to directors:
duty of expression:
each director has a duty to clearly express his or her opinions and shall endeavour to convince the board of the relevance of his or her position.


diligence:
each director must devote the necessary time, care, attention to his or her duties. before accepting any new position or office, he or she must
consider whether he or she will still be able to fulfil this obligation. unless he or she is genuinely unable to do so, he or she must attend all
meetings of the board of directors and of any committees of which he or she is a member, and all general meetings of shareholders.


conflicts of interest:
each director must inform the board about any conflict of interest situation, even potential, that may involve him/her because of the duties
he/she may hold in other companies.
in such a case, the director shall abstain from taking part in voting on the related resolution.

share ownership:
since march 26, 2014, the board’s internal regulations provide that each director is required to own at least 5,000 of our shares. current directors
have been given two years to comply with this new requirement.


rules applicable to transactions carried on company’s shares by directors:
the directors may be led to hold information relative to the company that has come to their attention because of their position as director and
which, if made public, might have an appreciable effect on the company's share price. the significant character of a piece of information is
normally related to the influence it may have on the financial results of the listed company. a significant piece of information can relate to
operating revenues, financial or budgetary estimates, investments, acquisitions or divestments, main discoveries, stops of important
manufacturing units, launching or withdrawal of products, significant changes in shareholding or management, transactions affecting the capital,
the dividend, the appearance or the settlement of a dispute, etc.
in such a case, the internal regulations provide that the directors must refrain:
-      from exploiting such information in their own behalf or in behalf of others, directly or through an intermediary, by purchasing or selling the
       company's securities or financial products connected with the said issue;
-      from communicating the said information for purposes other than and for an activity other than the one in connection with which it is held.
in addition to the above, directors must abstain from carrying-out any transaction on the company's shares, of whatever nature, during the 30-
calendar days preceding the publication of quarterly, semiannual or annual results and until the day after the publication date. such publications
occur the last week of february, mid-may, the last week of july and mid-november.
in case of doubt, the directors are invited to contact the group chief financial officer.
pursuant to the provisions of the general regulation of the autorité des marchés financiers, the directors must notify directly to the autorité des
marchés financiers any transactions that they may carry out on the company’s shares, within 5 trading days as from the date on which they
carried out such transactions. the obligation to notify such transactions is the direct responsibility of each director.

composition of board and its committees, (xi) the appointment of new directors, (xii) the appointment of a new corporate officer.


principles and rules to determine the remuneration of the executive officers:
pursuant to article l.225-37 of the commercial code, the compensation of the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer and the
corporate officers (directeurs généraux délégués) is defined by the board of directors upon proposal from the appointment-remuneration
committee.
the positioning of the compensation of the chief executive officer and the corporate officers of the company is regularly reviewed against the
company’s sector and comparable compensation markets on the basis of studies carried out by specialized external firms.
chairman of the board of directors
the compensation of the chairman of the board of directors comprised a fixed element (from which is deducted the amount of his benefit in
kind (company car) and a fixed amount of directors’ fees. he does not benefit from any other kind of compensation.
chief executive officer and corporate officers
the board of directors and the appointment-remuneration committee pay particular attention to ensure that the compensation policy applied
is linked to the performance of the company and focuses on creating long-term value (quantitative criteria) and the achievement of individual
objectives (qualitative criteria). consequently, significant weight is given in the structure of their compensation to the variable part of the
compensation package, both short term and long term, whereas a lower weight is assigned to the fixed part compared to market practice.
such aggregate compensation includes a fixed element, a variable bonus and benefits in kind (company car). the bonus for a given fiscal year
is determined and paid during the first semester of the following fiscal year. the target amount of the short term variable incentive (the target
being paid when 100 % of the quantitative and qualitative objectives are achieved) applied to the chief executive officer and the corporate
officers is expressed as a percentage of the fixed part of the compensation. it is equal to 100% of the fixed salary for the chief executive officer
and to 75% of the fixed salary for the three corporate officers.
finally, in case of financial overachievement, the allocation of short term variable incentive compensation may involve:
         •        the quantitative criteria (financial objectives) for a maximum of 133.3 % of the fixed salary for the chief executive officer and of
                  100 % of the fixed salary for the corporate officers, and
         •        the qualitative criteria (individual objectives) for a maximum of 66.6 % of the fixed salary for the chief executive officer and of
                  50 % of the fixed salary for the corporate officers.
a detailed description of the compensations paid in 2015 to the senior executive officers are set forth in the management report (item 6 –
compensation – of our annual report on form 20-f). information relating to deferred severance indemnity and supplementary retirement plan
are also included.

the audit committee usually meets before each session of the board of directors. for practical reasons that are linked to the presence of two
directors residing abroad, meetings of the audit committee are held in general on the eve of the board of directors. in order that this constraint
does not prevent the proper functioning of the committee, the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer ensure that the members
of the committee receive the necessary documents and information sufficiently in advance in order to have sufficient time to be able to review
the accounts.
minutes of each meeting are taken. furthermore, the chairman of the committee reports on its work at every board of directors’ meeting. this
report is recorded in the minutes of the board of directors' meeting.

(*) independent director




gilberte lombard was appointed as financial expert by the board of directors in 2013 pursuant to section 407 of sarbanes oxley act.

france (1987), she was the investor relations officer, in charge of the relation with financial analysts and institutional investors, and coordinated
the information policy vis a vis the shareholders of the bank: major shareholders as well as individual shareholders. after credit commercial de
france had been taken over by hsbc (2000), she was appointed as head of the financial transactions (directeur des opérations financières)
in charge of structuring and implementing sales, acquisitions, mergers for hsbc and managing hsbc industrial and financial portfolio. as part
of her assignments, she was appointed as member of the board and the audit committee of several companies of the hsbc group in france.

gas, petrochemical, and other industrial markets. within smith international, he was in charge of investor relations, supervision of financial
activities of public corporation (nyse) and merger, acquisitions and strategic development.

iii.         internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the company


the company’s internal control and risk management, effected by the board of directors, the management and by other personnel is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following areas:
              completion and optimization of operations, including the safeguarding of resources,
              the reliability and sincerity of financial information, and
              compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
the principal objective of our internal control and risk management systems and processes is to identify and control risks related to the activities
of the company, as well as the risks related to errors in accounting and financial reporting.
the company is listed both in france and in the us and is therefore subject to both the sarbanes-oxley act and the french "loi de sécurité
financière". in the scope of implementation of the recommendations and provisions of the sarbanes-oxley act relating to internal control, the
company decided to apply the 2013 coso internal control integrated framework, established by the committee of sponsoring organizations
of the treadway commission (“coso 2013”). the autorité des marchés financiers (amf) has subsequently integrated the principle elements
of coso in its frame of reference.
pursuant to the sarbanes-oxley act, the company must include in its annual report on form 20-f (the "20-f report") filed with the securities
exchange commission, a management report on internal control over financial reporting. this report along with the opinion of the auditors on
the company's internal control will be included in item 15 of the 20-f report for fiscal year 2015. a translation of this item 15 into french will be
included in the "document de référence" for fiscal year 2015.


iii.1.       control environment:
the control environment is the foundation of all the components of internal control and risk management of the group, providing discipline and
structure. the discussion below describes the group’s charts and codes setting its expectations in integrity and ethics, it describes how the
group is organized and structured to assure internal control and risk management, and it describes how authority and responsibilities are
delegated in the group.


iii.1.1. integrity and ethics:
integrity and ethics are essential values for the group internal control.
the company’s standards and expectations in integrity and ethics are codified in its chart of ethics, in its statement of values and in its code
of business conduct that apply to all employees of our group. these documents are widely distributed globally in the group and they are also
available to all staff on the group’s employee internet portal, insite.
in addition, pursuant to section 406 of the sarbanes oxley act, the board of directors implemented a code of ethics which is applicable to the
chairman, the chief executive officer, the members of the e-com and the disclosure committee. this code defines rules of conduct and
integrity which the persons must follow in the performance of their function and obligations relating to disclosure.


values and chart of ethics
the group has developed and communicated widely to all its employees a statement of its values – our values. this statement of values
centers around the group and its employees’ commitment: operate safely and with integrity, have a passion for innovation, be socially
responsible.
the group’s chart of ethics represents a commitment by the group to its clients, its shareholders, its employees and its partners to comply with
local laws and regulations and to respect the principles of its code of business conduct.


ethics and business conduct
the group’s code of business conduct is a guide to appropriate conduct. in conjunction with the group’s statement of mission, vision and
values it provides a framework for all employees to perform their jobs with integrity. the business code of conduct addresses compliance with
laws and regulations, prevention of conflicts of interest, respect for persons and the environment, protection of the group’s assets, financial
security and transparency, internal verification and the role of internal audit. the code is translated into eight languages. in addition, certain
recommendations have been issued to the employees of the group in order to draw their attention to unlawful behaviors and actions relating to
payments, facilitations, gifts and invitations, contribution to political parties and donations to non-profit organizations. besides, in june 2013, a
business integrity booklet was released in order to help the employees to understand the concept of corruption and the associated rules, risks
and red flags and to apply the code of business conduct and determine the appropriate ethical behavior to adopt in every circumstance. finally,
the selection of the group commercial consultants and the management of their network is strictly monitored through a procedure defining
precise and identical rules applicable within all entities of the group in order to ensure, in particular, that the commercial consultants comply with
our chart of ethics and business code of conduct and the applicable international conventions and national regulations against corruption (such
as but not limited to the conventions of the united nations, the oecd, the us foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) or the uk bribery act).
this procedure is available on the group’s employee internet portal, insite.
to support the business code of conduct, the group has established an ethics committee which can be contacted anonymously by employees
concerning issues related to conduct. the group has also established a global ethics alert phone line, ethics alert, which is operational 24
hours, 7 days a week. this reporting line is in compliance with sox and with cnil (commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés)
recommendations. finally, the training program on ethics has been reinforced by the implementation of an e-learning for all the employees of
the group. we have also put in place a training program on the prevention of corruption. this training session has been delivered in our main
sites worldwide.

finally, in may 2014 and in january 2016, we received a moderate assurance report on cgg anti-corruption program issued by mazars, one
of our statutory auditor and adit, an independent third party. the mazars-adit anti-corruption framework® is based on national and
international laws and regulations (french law, fcpa, uk bribery act 2010, oecd convention, and un global compact 10th principle) and
industry best practice. it covers five areas (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, monitoring, information and communication)
which are broken down into more than 200 control points. the framework has been validated by an international advisory board and by the
french central corruption prevention department (“service central de prévention de la corruption“), an inter-ministerial department attached
to the french ministry of justice. the purpose of this audit is to review the adequacy of our program based on the mazars-adit anti-corruption
framework®, and the implementation of such program. this audit has been carried out in two phases over 2014 and 2015, the second phase
including the entities acquired from fugro in 2013.

    the group has an accounting manual which sets forth its accounting practices, instructions and reporting rules. the accounting manual
     applies to all group entities and is designed to ensure that the accounting rules are applied across the group in a reliable and homogeneous
     way. it details procedures for closing the books, preparation of the income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement as well as the
     consolidation process. additionally, it outlines the principles for producing the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
    to limit risks of fraud, processes of segregation of duties are in place from approval of the orders to payment of the vendors and suppliers.
    all group entities process consolidated accounts in the format chosen by the group using a standardized package. all reclassifications from
     the corporate accounts to the consolidated accounts are documented using a specific standard format.
    intercompany transactions are carried out in various areas (different services, geophysical equipment sales, software licenses). the
     corresponding fees vary according to the nature of the transaction and in compliance with market conditions and transfer pricing policy.
    management software packages implemented within the company in finance, logistics and procurement are critical organizational
     components of the internal control system as they define in detail the processes to be applied in each of these areas.


information technology infrastructure and information systems security
    access to the internal networks of the group’s companies and information systems are regulated.
    the networks are protected by firewalls and antivirus systems. external access is possible through secure and encrypted connections.
    users are duly authenticated before being granted access to the system.
    data backup, archiving and recovery systems have been put into place. procedures are created, modified and updated by competent
     personnel and approved by the appropriate management. once a year, an internal audit is carried out to test the effectiveness of such
     procedures, including some intrusion tests with assistance of external it experts.


control of the disclosure of information externally
    the group has a procedure which outlines rules for preparing, validating and approving press releases.
    the group follows a pre-determined process for the preparation and distribution of its regulatory documents.


disclosure committee
within the framework of the implementation of the sarbanes-oxley act, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the group
created a disclosure committee in february 2003 to assure they will be able to properly issue the certificate provided for by section 302 of the
sarbanes-oxley act which must accompany annual financial statements filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission.
the principle functions of this committee are to:
    analyze the importance of information and determine the appropriateness of a disclosure, and if so according to what schedule, and to this
     purpose:
     -   review all information to be published and their draft wording,
     -   oversee disclosure procedures and coordinate disclosures to external parties (shareholders, market authorities, investors, the press
         etc.).
    provide guidelines for internal control procedures to ensure the reporting of material information to be disclosed within the framework of
     quarterly, semiannual or annual communications to market authorities or destined for financial markets,

    inform the chief executive officer and the group chief financial officer of any changes, deficiencies or material weaknesses pointed out
     by the committee in the process of the reporting of information.


in 2015 the committee was chaired by the senior vice president, group chief accounting officer and composed as follows:
 -       chief operating officer, equipment & acquisition business lines
 -       chief operating officer, ggr business lines
 -       financial controller, equipment business line
 -       financial controller, marine & acquisition business lines
 -       financial controller, ggr business lines
 -       senior vice president, group internal audit
 -       senior vice president, investor relations
 -       senior vice president, group tax director
 -       senior vice president, group treasurer
 -       senior vice president, general secretary and group general counsel
 -       senior vice president, group communication
the committee meets quarterly before periodic disclosures of the company are published. a self-evaluation is performed each year and is
adjusted for ongoing improvement of the committee functioning.


delegation of powers and areas of responsibility
delegations of power are authorized by the chief executive officer and the senior executive vice presidents and cascaded to successive levels
of management through a formal, documented process that clarifies the responsibilities related to the delegation. the approval of offers and
contracts as well as capital expenses and operating expenses are controlled through these delegations. approval levels for investments, leases,
sale-and-lease back transactions and other expenses are also defined.
delegations of authority are carried out according to directives established by the e-com in the general instruction on delegation of authority
and delegation of powers.
the process for preparing offers, and controlling and approving contracts signed between the group’s legal entities on the one hand, and its
customers, partners and subcontractors on the other hand, is managed through the bid and tender review process. the process includes
authorization rules to be applied with respect to contractual commitments and in particular the limits where a prior review and authorization by
the c-com is required. this review process cuts across all functions that contribute to the control of risks in bid and contract review including
the legal department, the tax department, treasury, and the hse department.


iii.4.     control activities
processes implemented by the group to identify necessary control procedures are based on risk assessments and on the necessary processes
required to fulfill the group's objectives.


internal control procedures
control procedures of the group are implemented according to the hierarchical levels of personnel involved and the principles of materiality and
the separation of functions. control procedures are implemented in light of the identification of risks.


system of evaluation of internal control
internal control in the group is evaluated through self-assessment tools and through internal audits.
financial security annual objectives are set requiring self-assessments of all active company entities using the internal control assessment
form (icaf). this questionnaire includes approximately 40 prerequisites defined for operating business lines and support functions. on an
annual basis, the results of these reviews are consolidated, assessed and distributed to relevant managers; through these assessments, internal
control improvement areas are identified.
internal control is continuously evaluated through a program of internal audits. in 2015, almost 30 audits were conducted by the group internal
audit department in addition to sox testing, 6 were operational audits and 21 general audits (financial and operational and performance). audit
findings and recommendations are in each case reviewed with relevant managers and are presented to the executive management of the
business line if necessary, and action plans are agreed to assure continuous improvement of internal control and risks management. audit
reports are submitted to the c-com and action plans to the e-com whose members receive on a monthly basis, the internal audit dashboard to
monitor progress on improvement actions.
areas of improvement from icaf assessments and from internal audits form the base of annual strategic plans (organizational changes) and
annual financial security objectives.
furthermore, hub-level controllers were put in place to assure better control of far reaching geographies.

financial and accounting controls
internal control procedures in force in the group are designed principally to ensure that accounting, financial and management information
communicated to corporate bodies of the group provide a fair presentation of the activity and situation of the group.
    the financial statements of all the group's subsidiaries are reviewed by the finance function. physical inventories are carried out on a
     regular basis at each site, comparing the balance sheet values of inventories with those of the physical inventories. variances noted are
     then corrected.
    access to the accounting information systems is formally restricted in accordance with the function and responsibilities of each user.
    current management information systems make it possible to record transactions in a complete and exact manner, to trace them and
     regularly back them up.
    all intercompany transactions are documented and reconciled on given dates according to the transactions.
    the company monitors its off-balance sheet commitments.
    comparisons and reconciliations are performed at various levels, particularly between reporting and consolidation. the consolidated
     financial statements are reviewed by the chief financial officer at corporate level and the chief financial officers of the business lines.
in accordance with requirements of the sarbanes-oxley act, the group has a system to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting.
the e-com fully supports this project as a contribution to a proper business control, which is also in line with the implementation of values and
the application of the financial security program with our personnel.


iii.5.    information and disclosure
the group's ability to meet its objectives depends on effective dissemination of information at all levels of the group.
quality standards, security requirements or legal and professional obligations demand that the procedures be documented and accessible. the
group encourages the sharing of knowledge and best practices. an intranet site provides all personnel with access to charters, group policies,
annual objectives, general instructions, procedures, standards and other documents on which the group’s management system is based.
generally, the internet site of the group allows the achievement of a better communication and cooperation between the group entities and the
operating and support functions.
the group organizes, generally on an annual basis, seminars for the c-com, e-com and for certain senior management and key managers
around the globe.
the group has implemented a weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting system according to the hierarchical levels and relevance, to obtain and
exchange information necessary to carry out, manage and control operations. the data distributed concerns operations, finance, or legal and
regulatory compliance issues. it includes not only data produced by the group but also data related to the external environment.
senior management evaluates the performance of the group on the basis of both internal and external information.


iii.6.   monitoring and management review
the group's business environment is by nature continuously changing and evolving. as a result, the internal control system is continuously
adapted taking into account the environmental conditions and past experience.
operations are managed and evaluated against performance criteria on a day to day basis and monitored by successive levels of management
in the organization, finally being reviewed by the executive committee. management carries out periodic evaluations, taking into account the
nature and importance of any changes which may have occurred.
the senior vice president internal audit, the chief accounting officer, the compliance officer and the senior vice president risk management,
hse and sustainable development meet every month for information and mutual coordination within the risk monitoring and coordination
committee.
the monitoring of risks is built into our business review processes at the project level, at the business line level and at the e-com level. key
indicators have been identified to signal risk environment changes and adverse trends. these are reviewed in management meetings at each
level. transverse functions and group departments assist the business lines in monitoring these indicators and when necessary focus
attention on specific group risks.
the group has implemented a global incident monitoring system for round the clock alerts; actual incidents and high potential incidents (hpis)
anywhere in our operations must be reported within 24 hours to the relevant management level through our internet based system prism.
the e-com regularly reviews the group’s key risks and the measures put in place to control these risks. the e-com reviews the group’s risk
map annually as well as the insurance policies put in place to transfer the group’s risks. the e-com establishes a schedule of key risks which
it reviews in more depth during the year.
the board, through its committees regularly reviews key risks faced by the group. the board receives annually a mapping of the key risks
facing the group and is informed on the organization of the group’s risk management program as well as on the key risk controls put in place.
through the audit committee, the hse and sustainable development committee, the technology committee, the appointment and
remuneration committee and the strategic committee, specific risks in the domain of each committee are reviewed.

iii.7.   reasonable assurance
every system of internal control, however well-designed and effective, has inherent limitations. notably, there is an inherent risk that controls
may be circumvented or bypassed. this means that the internal control system can offer only a reasonable assurance as to the reliability and
sincerity of financial statements. furthermore, the effectiveness of internal control procedures may vary over time, in response to new
circumstances.
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control procedures on a regular and formal basis and beyond the related actions undertaken by
the internal audit management, the group has put in place a tool for internal control self-evaluation for all units of the group. at the corporate
level a compliance officer has been appointed thus showing the group commitment to good corporate governance rules.

15. items likely to have an influence in the event of a take-over bid

pursuant to article l.225-100-3 of the french commercial code, you will find below the elements which are likely to have an influence in case of
a take-over bid.
capital structure of the company:
notice of crossing of a statutory threshold:
pursuant to article 7.2 of the by-laws of the company, any shareholder holding directly or indirectly a portion amounting to 1% of the stock capital
or of the voting rights or a multiple of this percentage, within the meaning of article l. 233-7 of the french commercial code, shall give notice to
the company of the number of shares or voting rights he holds, within five trading days from the date on which one of these thresholds was
exceeded.
in the event of failure to comply with this notification requirement, and upon request of one or several shareholders holding at least 1 percent of
the capital, such request being recorded in the minutes of the general meeting, those shares in excess of the fraction that should have been
declared shall be deprived of their voting rights from the date of said general meeting and for any other subsequent general meeting to be held
until the expiry of a two-year period following the date on which the required notification of the passing of the threshold will have been regularized.
similarly, any shareholder whose shareholding is reduced below one of these thresholds shall give notice thereof to the company within the
same five-day period.
double voting right:
as from may 22 1997, a double voting right has been allocated to all registered and fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same
holder for at least two years.
statutory restrictions concerning the exercise of voting rights and share transfers or clauses of agreements which the
company is aware of, in compliance with article l.233-11 of the french commercial code:
there is no statutory restriction to the exercise of voting right and share transfers. the company is not aware of any agreement in compliance
with article l.233-11 of the french commercial code.

the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and certain of our credit facilities provide for an early redemption of the loans, at the
option of the lenders, in the event of a change of control, pursuant to the terms specified in each agreement.
agreements providing for severance payments to employees who resign or who are dismissed without cause or employees
whose employment is terminated in the event of a take-over bid:
in addition to the agreements referred to in “item 6: directors, senior management and employees – contractual indemnity in case of
termination” of our report on form 20-f, with respect to the company’s executive officers, we inform you that certain executives of the group
benefit from a protection letter providing for the payment of a severance payment in the event of dismissal or change of control. the amount of
such severance payment depends upon the positions and classifications of each concerned persons.
