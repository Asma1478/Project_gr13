            3. ambitious long term financial
               targets for attractive shareholder
               returns
schneider electric’s opportunities, strategy and business positioning have led its management to define ambitious long-term targets for the
company. over the long term, the key priorities remain focused on profitable growth, cash conversion and capital efficiency.
2 sets of targets have been defined: business performance targets and capital efficiency targets.



    across the economic cycle(1) performance targets:
    ● average organic revenue growth: 3 to 6% across the cycle;
    ● adjusted ebita: margin between 13% and 17% of revenues;
    ● cash conversion: c.100% of net profit converted into free cash flow.




    across the business cycle capital efficiency targets:
    ● roce(2): between 11% and 15%;
    ● dividend: c.50% payout of net income;
    ● capital structure: retain a strong investment grade credit rating.



at its investor day in february 2015, the company also highlighted            l margin     improvement targeted: the group confirms its
its growth initiatives and near term business focus. the focus will              13-17% long-term adjusted ebita margin range and targets a
be on organic growth, improving the returns on the recent                        margin improvement over the next 3 years driven by operating
investments and optimizing the portfolio and capital structure.                  leverage and eur1.4-eur1.5 billion efficiency initiatives(3)

hence the following objectives were defined:




(1) schneider electric defines a business cycle as a period including a slowdown and an expansion, or a period in between. this concept allows
    investors to estimate the group’s long-term growth potential across a business cycle. the length of a business cycle can vary and can not be
    forecasted.
(2) roce is defined as: adjusted ebita after tax/average capital employed. capital employed is defined as: shareholders’ equity + net financial debt
    + adjustment for associates and financial assets. in the context of the invensys acquisition, the tax rate will be adjusted for any benefits of the
    invensys-related tax shield that would not be captured in the p&l.
(3) includes industrial productivity and gross sfc savings.



                                                                                          2014 registration document schneider electric                   23

to the shareholders,
in our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the cofrac(1), under the number no. 3-1050, and as a member of the network of
one of the statutory auditors of the company schneider electric, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and
societal information established for the year ended on december 31, 2014, presented in chapter 2 of the management repor, and on the
planet & society barometer indicators, hereafter referred to as the « csr information », pursuant to the provisions of the article l.
225-102-1 of the french commercial code (code de commerce).

responsibility of the company
it is the responsibility of the board of directors to establish a management report including csr information referred to in the
                                                                                                                                                       2

safety and environment reporting procedures in their version dated november 1, 2014 (hereafter referred to as the « criteria »), and of
which a summary is included at the end of chapter 2 of the management report (the « methodological note ») and available on request at
the company’s headquarters.

independence and quality control
our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the code of ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in article l. 822-11
of the french commercial code (code de commerce). in addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented
policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations.

responsibility of the independent verifier
it is our role, based on our work:
l to attest whether the required csr information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate
  explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of r. 225-105 of the french commercial code (code de
  commerce) (attestation of presence of csr information);
l to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the csr information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in accordance
  with the criteria (limited assurance on csr information);
l to express, at the request of the company, a reasonable assurance conclusion on the indicators « 1 day training for each employee every
  year » and « 75% of our product revenues achieved with green premium », has been established, in all material aspects, in accordance
  with the criteria.
our verification work was undertaken by a team of five people between september 2014 and march 2015 for an estimated duration of
eighteen weeks.
we conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france and the order of may 13,
2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of
fairness and the reasonable assurance report, in accordance with the international standard isae 3000(2)

1. attestation of presence of csr information
we obtained an understanding of the company’s csr issues, based on interviews with the management of relevant departments, a
presentation of the company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the
activities of the company and its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programs.
we have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the article r. 225-105-1 of the
french commercial code (code de commerce).
in the absence of certain consolidated information, we have verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions
in article r. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the french commercial code (code de commerce).
we verified that the information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the
article l. 233-1 and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the article l. 233-3 of the french commercial code (code
de commerce) with the limitations specified in the methodological note in chapter 2 of the management report (« 2.6 methodology and
audit of indicators »).
based on this work, we confirm the presence in the management report of the required csr information.

2. limited assurance on csr information
nature and scope of the work
we undertook approximately twenty interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the csr information in the different

 2      sustainable development
        methodology and audit of indicators




      l assess the suitability of the criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability,
        taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;
      l verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the
        csr information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the csr information.
      we determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the csr information, in relation
      to the characteristics of the company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry
      best practices.
      for the csr information which we considered the most important(1):
      l at the level of the consolidated entity, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative
        information (organization, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a
        test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other
        information presented in the management report;
      l at the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected(2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated
        indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook
        detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. the
        sample selected therefore represented on average 5% of the fixed-term contract and permanent contract personnel and between 8%
        and 14% of the quantitative environmental information.
      for the other consolidated csr information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the company.
      finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information.
      we consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to
      express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. due to the
      necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the
      risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the csr information cannot be entirely eliminated.

      conclusion
      based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the csr information, taken together,
      has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the criteria.
      observations
      without qualifying our conclusion above, we draw your attention to the fact that methodological changes, presented in section « 2.6
      methodology and audit of indicators » of the management report, were made on the planet & society barometer indicators « 1 day of
      training for each employee every year », « 30% women in our talent pool », and « 63% result in our employee engagement index », relating
      respectively to the reporting scope, the method of calculation and the target to reach.

      3. reasonable assurance on a selection of csr information
      nature and scope of work
      regarding the two indicators « 1 day training for each employee every year » and « 75% of our product revenues achieved with green
      premium », we undertook work of the same nature as those described in paragraph 2 above for the csr information considered the most
      important, but in a more in-depth manner, in particular in relation to the number of tests.
      we consider that this work allows us to express a reasonable assurance opinion on these two indicators of the barometer published in
      chapter 2 of the management report.

      conclusion
      in our opinion, the two indicators « 1 day training for each employee every year » and « 75% of our product revenues achieved with green
      premium » have been established, in all material aspects, in compliance with the criteria.

          this report includes the chairman’s report on the composition of the board of directors, the application of the
          principle of balanced representation of women and men on the board of directors, and the conditions applicable
          for the preparation and organization of the work carried out by the board of directors, and the internal control and
          risk management procedures implemented by the company.
          the sections on governance structure, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 (group senior management compensation policy, pension
          benefits and compensation of members of the board of directors), 9 and 10, in this section 3, as well as
          sections 2 (annual shareholders’ meetings and voting rights) and 7 of section 7 constitute the chairman of the
          board of directors’ report provided for in article l.225-37 of the french commercial code. they are indicated with
          a special mention.

          governance structure
          this section is part of the chairman of the board of directors’ report.
          the company is a european company with a board of directors. the functions of the chairman and the chief
          executive officer are carried out by jean-pascal tricoire, who was appointed chairman and chief executive
          officer on april 25, 2013.
          on may 6, 2014, the board of directors confirmed this decision, in accordance with article 1 of its internal
          regulations, which provides that once it has decided to unify the functions of chairman and ceo, the board must
          deliberate on this decision every year.
          the exercice by mr. tricoire of the functions of chairman and chief executive officer seems particularly
          appropriate to the board of directors taking into account:
          l the composition of the board, which includes 71% independent directors within the meaning of the
            afep/medef code;
          l the economic environment, which requires responsiveness by the leadership and clarity in naming the person in
            charge of directing the group. this clarification given by the use of the title of chairman ("président") is
            particularly necessary vis-à-vis employees, customers and partners, in france and abroad;
          l provisions to ensure accurate information and effective functioning by the board of directors, in particular the
            appointment of an vice-chairman independent lead director, the principle of holding an executive session at
            each meeting of the board presided by the vice-chairman independent lead director, and the creation of four
            board committees;
          l the requirement for the board to deliberate each year on the unification of the functions of chairman and chief
            executive officer.
          the company applies the afep/medef corporate governance guidelines, except for the few exceptions, which
          are described below (see section 10).
          the guidelines are available online at www.medef.fr.

      schneider electric voluntarily refers to the afep/medef corporate governance guidelines. however, as some of these guidelines may not
      correspond to schneider electric’s specific situation, the company has chosen not to implement the following recommendations:


      recommendation                                                             schneider electric practice

      the non-compete agreement must include a provision authorizing             a mutual agreement is necessary to repeal the non-compete
      the board to waive its implementation upon the departure of the            requirement only in the case of voluntary resignation and subject to
      member of senior management. the board decides on the                      the condition that the performance conditions are met and that the
      application of the agreement at the time of departure of the senior        senior manager does not or will not have rights to or is not or will

      after having asserted his rights on retirement.                            the payment of a pension.
                                                                                 this exception to the afep/medef recommendation is justified by
                                                                                 the fact that it is in the interest of the company to put forward the

                                                                                 attempts by competitors or to prevent a person who wants to

      the valuation of options and performance shares allocated must             electric stock and to prevent a windfall effect, the board continues
      not depart from previous business practices.                               to apply the old afep/medef recommendations in its decisions; in
                                                                                 other words, its reasoning is based on the number of shares and
