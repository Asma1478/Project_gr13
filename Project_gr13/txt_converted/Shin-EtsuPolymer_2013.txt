          though the automobile industry has recovered somewhat, the market conditions facing the shin-etsu polymer group
          have continued to remain adverse, due to the slowdown in the digital home appliance market and suppressed capital
          investments in the semiconductor industry. under such conditions, our group focused on new product proposals and new
          customer development and in terms of production, made efforts to reduce fixed costs and improve production efficiency,
          but business was generally sluggish.

development of eco-products
based on the basic environmental principles (please refer to page 18), the shin-etsu polymer group tackles product
development to reduce environmental burdens, positions existing products as eco-products and started internal
certification.




  concept of our eco-products
based on the corporate action policy, we set up the concept of eco-products in our group.


  concept
  eco-products in our group are new or existing products that solve customers’ challenges, and upon confirmation
  that they are required by society and the environment (social needs), are evaluated and certified for seven items
  (please refer to the top half of the following page).




  position of eco-pro promotion activities
these activities are part of green activities and are positioned as described below. in these activities, we also establish the
concept, evaluation standards, and evaluation methods of our exclusive eco-products and certification of products.


  we position green activities as “an effort to improve productivity from
  the viewpoint of the environment,” and eco-pro promotion activities as
  “an activity to promote the development of (eco-friendly) products demanded and
  expected by the market from the viewpoint of the environment.”



  concept of activities
we add the ideas of ecology to qcd and tackle the challenge of environmental burden reduction of products from raw
material procurement to manufacture, use, and disposal.


   the concept is to convert conventional qcd to qcd + e [environmental friendliness]
   (q stands for quality, c for cost, d for delivery and e for ecology (reduction of environmental burden))


                                                                 ❶resource saving          ❺environmental pollutants

                                                                                          (please refer to the top half of the following page).




                  by developing eco-friendly products, we target becoming a company that
                   contributes to the realization of a recycling-oriented society and that is
                  appreciated in society where environmental management is emphasized.

  evaluation standards of eco-products
shown below are the evaluation standards of eco-products.

                                 yields. we have also used recycled materials or resources.
                                 we reduced energy consumption, the amounts of various basic units and the generation of ghg at

 ❼bio-diversity protection
                                 protect bio-diversity. products have also contributed to the protection of bio-diversity

for the above seven categories, we have a total of 97 evaluation standards.
since april 2013, we have started to internally certify “eco-products”, judging them against these evaluation items.

    challenge to improve transmittance
    from 70% to 80%
with an expanding range of applications and other
competitors’ technological innovations, we needed to
develop a product with even higher transmittance to
                                                                                               conventional product                improved product
maintain our superiority. of course, the development of
                                                                                             conventional product with 70% transmittance (left) and
such a product was also a customer requirement, and
                                                                                             improved one with 80% transmittance
we thus faced the challenge of developing a touch switch
with 80% transmittance.
    the first thing we set about was the improvement
                                                                                                section of the automotive
of the method to form the conductive coating. instead
                                                                                                center console
of coating formation by conventional print technology,
we took a method to paint conductive paint fully on the                                                                                           console
film and additionally process electrodes for detection in
a required form and arrangement (patent no. 4818216).
by introducing this technology, we could make the paint
film of conductive paint thinner. one of the key points                                                                                           backlight
for success was in launching a new coating process,
we worked together with the technology development
he adqua r te r s to improve the conductive paint a nd
successfully developed a conductive paint that shows                                                                                              touch switch
c ondu cti v it y e qui va l e nt to that of th e c o nve ntiona l
product even when it is made thinner.
    in this way, we were able to realize 80% transmittance                                   making the transmittance of the touch switch higher contributes to save
                                                                                             energy needed for backlighting
for our touch switch, and make it possible to promote the
energy saving of backlighting better than before, which is
also greatly advantageous for our customers.

             shin-etsu polymer group conflict material policy
             the shin-etsu polymer group expresses the following in relation to conflict minerals:
               the shin-etsu polymer group agrees with and supports the objectives of the wall street reform and consumer
               protection act on conflict minerals.
               the shin-etsu polymer group has no intention to participate in human right violations or environmental destruction by
               procuring raw materials, parts, components, or products using such conflict minerals.
               the shin-etsu polymer group will continue to work with customers, business partners, and industry organizations to
               proceed with efforts to avoid such participation.
               if any conflict minerals are found in raw materials, parts, components, or products the shin-etsu polymer group
               procures, the group will promptly take the necessary measures.

                     in “engagement with the environment” (pages 18 to 20), we explained the compliance status of each law and regulation in
                     addition to targets and results associated with green activities. from this page we will explain other environmental data,
                     reduction activities, etc.




                       business activities and the environment
                     we believe the essence of environmental conservation activities is to precisely grasp environmental loads associated with
                     our business activities. to effectively and continuously promote environmental conservation activities, we check the related
                     numerical values and are engaged in activities based on the improvement themes to reduce environmental loads.
