forward-looking statement
in this annual report, we have disclosed forward-looking
information to enable investors to appraise our prospects
and take investment decisions. this report and other
statements – written and oral – that we periodically make
contain forward-looking statements that set out anticipated
results based on the management’s plans and assumptions.
we have tried, wherever possible, to identify such
statements by using words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’,
‘expects’, ‘projects’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘believes’, and words
of similar substance in connection with any discussion of
future performance. although we have been prudent in
our assumptions, we cannot guarantee that these forward-
looking statements will be realised. the achievement
of results is subject to risks, uncertainties and even
inaccurate assumptions. should known or unknown risks or
uncertainties materialise, or should underlying assumptions
prove inaccurate, actual results could materially vary from
those anticipated, estimated or projected. readers should
bear this in mind. we undertake no obligation to publicly
update any forward-looking statement whether as a result
of new information, future events or otherwise.

a momentous year for mid-income affordable housing

towards its mission of ‘housing for all by 2022’, the government, in
coordinated actions with sectoral regulators, unveiled a slew of measures
to line-up incentives and direct efficient funding to affordable housing.

mid-income affordable housing got a boost with the inclusion of
households with incomes up to ` 18 lakhs per year under the credit
linked subsidy scheme (clss) of the pradhan mantri awaas yojana
(pmay).

factoring the upfront subsidy under the pmay scheme and tax savings
from deduction available against home loan repayments, the effective
home loan interest rate for mid-income affordable housing is at near-zero
levels!! these near-zero effective home loan rates are in stark contrast to
the prevalent rental yields of 3%+ in urban india, making home purchase
extremely compelling.

demand in mid-income affordable housing remains strong propped up
by a young working population, two thirds of which is below 35 years of
age, and rising urbanisation. moderating residential prices, robust wage
inflation and fiscal incentives to home buyers and builders, has lead to
tremendous improvement in affordability.

the average age of the first-time home buyer is falling. a change in the
home loan distribution model towards a more digital, internet driven
mobile platform is imminent. indiabulls e-home loans is an industry
pioneering, global first, end-to-end online home loan fulfilment platform
providing access to indiabulls’ home loans at customers’ fingertips.

we have our ears to the ground and recognise the potential of emerging
technology to vastly improve customer experience and enhance our
operational efficiencies. we have digitalised our offerings to capitalise on
the emerging potential of tier ii and tier iii towns and cities with leaner
tech-efficient home loan branches in these cities.

we are india’s second largest housing finance company and are now a
part of the nifty 50 index. we enjoy the highest long-term rating of ‘aaa’
and are focused on creating value for all our stakeholders. with over 9.20
lakh satisfied customers, our endeavour is to reach out to and help every
aspiring indian who dreams of owning a home.

		fair value methodology:
            as all the other plans were issued based on the fair value of the options on the date of the grant, there is no impact

(1)   note on as - 15 disclosure:
      employee benefits – provident fund, esic, gratuity and compensated absences disclosures as per accounting standard
      (as) 15 (revised) – employee benefits:
      contributions are made to government provident fund and family pension fund, esic and other statutory funds which
      cover all eligible employees under applicable acts. both the employees and the company make predetermined contributions
      to the provident fund and esic. the contributions are normally based on a certain proportion of the employee’s salary. the
      company has recognised an amount of ` 60,452,561 (previous year ` 37,904,134) in the consolidated statement of profit and
      loss towards employers contribution for the above mentioned funds.
      provision for unfunded gratuity and compensated absences for all employees is based upon actuarial valuations carried
      out at the end of every financial year. major drivers in actuarial assumptions, typically, are years of service and employee
      compensation. pursuant to the issuance of the accounting standard (as) 15 (revised) on ‘employee benefits’, commitments
      are actuarially determined using the ‘projected unit credit’ method. gains and losses on changes in actuarial assumptions
      are accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.

(35) earnings per equity share (eps):
      earnings per equity share (eps) as per accounting standard (as)-20 “earnings per share”.
      the basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year by the
      weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings per share are computed using the
      weighted average number of equity shares and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been
      issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. the dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the
      proceeds receivable, had the shares been actually issued at fair value.
      dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless they have been issued at a later date.
      the number of equity shares and potential diluted equity shares are adjusted for potential dilutive effect of employee stock option
      plan as appropriate. potential dilutive equity shares on account of share warrants are not adjusted being anti dilutive in nature.

      (1) employee benefits – provident fund, esic, gratuity and compensated absences disclosures as per accounting
          standard (as) 15 (revised) – employee benefits:
		        contributions are made to government provident fund and family pension fund, esic and other statutory funds
          which cover all eligible employees under applicable acts. both the employees and the company make predetermined
          contributions to the provident fund and esic. the contributions are normally based on a certain proportion of the
          employee’s salary. the company has recognised an amount of ` 55,124,863 (previous year ` 35,035,247) in the statement
          of profit and loss towards employers contribution for the above mentioned funds.
		        provision for unfunded gratuity and compensated absences for all employees is based upon actuarial valuations
          carried out at the end of every financial year. major drivers in actuarial assumptions, typically, are years of service
          and employee compensation. pursuant to the issuance of the accounting standard (as) 15 (revised) on ‘employee
          benefits’, commitments are actuarially determined using the ‘projected unit credit’ method. gains and losses on
          changes in actuarial assumptions are accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.

		        3.4.3 (a) qualitative disclosure:-
          the company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. the
          company uses derivate contracts such as foreign exchange forward, cross currency contracts, interest rate swaps,
          foreign currency futures, options and swaps to hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange and interest rates.
          the use of these derivative contracts reduce the risk or cost to the company and the company does not use those for
          trading or speculation purposes.
          the company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the company which are approved by the
          board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk
          management strategy of the company. the board constituted risk management committee (rmc) of the company
          manages risk on the company’s derivative portfolio. the officials authorized by the board to enter into derivative
          transactions for the company are kept separate from the authorized signatories to confirm the derivative transactions.
          all derivative transactions that are entered into by the company are reported to the board, and the mark-to-market on
          its portfolio is monitored regularly by the senior management. the company uses bloomberg to monitor and value its
          derivative portfolio to ascertain its hedge effectiveness vis-à-vis the underlying.
          to hedge its risks on the principal and/ or interest amount for foreign currency borrowings on its balance sheet, the
          company has currently used cross currency derivatives, forwards and principal only swaps. additionally, the company
          has entered into interest rate swaps (irs) to hedge its basis risk on fixed rate borrowings and libor risk on its foreign
          currency borrowings.
          derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured
          to fair value at each reporting date. derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive (positive marked to
          market value) or as liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked to market value). derivative assets and
          liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. fair value of derivatives is ascertained from the mark to market
          and accrual values received from the counterparty banks. these values are cross checked against the valuations done
          internally on bloomberg. changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedges are recognized in
          the statement of profit and loss.
          hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, no longer
          qualifies for hedge accounting or the company chooses to end the hedging relationship.

(33) earnings per equity share
      earnings per equity share (eps) as per accounting standard (as)-20 “earnings per share”,:
      the basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to equity shareholders for the year by the
      weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings per share are computed using the
      weighted average number of equity shares and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been
      issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. the dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the
      proceeds receivable, had the shares been actually issued at fair value.
      dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless they have been issued at a later
      date. the number of equity shares and potential diluted equity shares are adjusted for potential dilutive effect of employee
      stock option plan as appropriate. potential dilutive equity shares on account of share warrants are not adjusted being anti
      dilutive in nature.
