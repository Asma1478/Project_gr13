                    at edmonton international airport (eia), we strive to do business
                    sustainably, by considering the triple-bottom-line (financial, environmental
                    and social aspects) of our operations. this means we manage airport
                    assets responsibly, support environmental stewardship, drive regional
                    economic prosperity and contribute to the social well-being of everyone
                    at the airport and in the communities we serve. over the years, through
                    our annual reports, our website and a wide range of other forums, we
                    have reported on our activities as they relate to this holistic approach
                    to sustainability.

in 2014 we released our first dedicated report on
the subject: non-stop sustainability. by doing
so, we became one of two airports in canada to
report using the internationally recognized global
reporting initiative (gri) framework. published
again concurrently with our annual report, our
2015 sustainability report offers an update on our
plans and initiatives and highlights some exciting
and ambitious new developments, such as our
carbon management strategy. with these reports
completed, we have established and validated
our reporting process and built a strong and solid
foundation for future information sharing. looking
ahead, our long-term goals include a full integration
of our sustainability and annual reports to provide
the best and most holistic understanding of our
story, our commitments and our achievements.

we seek to advance sustainability with a two-
pronged approach:




transparency & awareness
investing in research and sharing knowledge

engagement & action
taking action that uses shared knowledge
to lead to positive change




by reviewing our organization’s core values and
considering our successes in building transparency
and awareness, and also engaging others and taking
action, we can see how sustainability is increasingly
reflected in all our values and integrated into our         self-declaration
business. the chart below is aligned to the results

recognition by corporate knights as one of the top 40 medium-
sized organizations in canada when it comes to sustainability
performance. in 2015, edmonton international airport became
the first airport terminal in canada to receive leed® gold
certification. our new central tower also received leed® gold
certification, boma best level 2 (silver) certification and the
toby award (the outstanding building of the year) from the
building owners and managers association (boma). we’re
honoured by these prestigious accolades, and i congratulate
the many professionals whose dedication and expertise have
created a beautiful, iconic and sustainable airport.

it’s fitting that the very building where edmonton airports
operates is a physical embodiment of sustainability. the
building represents a major milestone of achievement in a
decades-long journey that began with simple changes like
switching to recycled paper, to today’s much more advanced
initiatives, such as using wetlands to treat deicing run-off,
engaging the community through social media platforms
and adjusting the timing of projects to capitalize on pricing
efficiencies. today, as we strive not only to navigate, but to
innovate our way through challenging economic conditions,
we must think and plan sustainably for the long-term benefit
of our community.

president and
ceo’s message


at edmonton airports, we’ve spent many years working towards
greater social, environmental and financial sustainability in our
operations, laying the cornerstones of a strong organization
that is able to meet today’s needs without compromising
tomorrow’s opportunities.

over the past year, as we faced shifting economic conditions,
that solid foundation played an important role in giving us
the strength and flexibility to adapt. eia is a major economic
driver for our region, supporting over 12,000 jobs and
contributing $1.2 billion in gdp, with a total economic impact
of $2.2 billion in 2014. now, more than ever, our community
needed us to continue delivering our mandate of driving
economic prosperity.

our tradition of sustainable management helped us to meet
that challenge as we drew upon our financial sustainability
experience to adjust to the downward shift in our revenues.
as a result, we strategically managed expenses, continued
to pay down debt and, through it all, increased our already
positive organizational credit rating.

we capitalized on the trust and support we have earned
