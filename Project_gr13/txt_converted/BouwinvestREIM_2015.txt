message from the chairman
﻿
in 2014, we saw the first real signs of a significant recovery in the real estate sector, as transactions in the dutch
market more than doubled compared to 2013, which was already quite a good year. it was also a year in which we
very much reaped what we have sowed over the past few years. we had a record year, as our dutch investments
business unit invested over € 600 million and international investments invested more than € 500 million in listed
and unlisted funds. and because all of our over € 400 million dutch residential investments were in new-build
properties, we have secured our pipeline for the coming years.


we also took our first steps in a segment with excellent growth potential, acquiring the first properties for our
healthcare fund. the ageing population, increasing demand for various levels of assisted facilities and the
increasing quality demands in the healthcare sector makes this an essential feather in the cap of any real estate
investor looking for a balanced portfolio. we expect to make more acquisitions in this sector in 2015 and beyond.


we are really seeing the benefits of our strategy of downsizing our development activities and opening up the
funds to third-party investors. and of all the additional checks and balances we have introduced to comply with
the alternative investment fund managers directive. consequently, we welcomed a second new investor to the
residential fund, following the rabobank pension fund’s investment at the start of 2014. by 2 january 2015, three
more investors had committed to the residential fund. we are seeing serious interest from investors in our
commercial property funds.


very importantly, of course, our funds continue to book solid returns in what are still challenging markets. our
dutch investments booked a return of 3.3% and outperformed the ipd benchmark (except for the office fund). our
international investments business did remarkably well last year, booking a return of 19.5% on its listed and
unlisted funds, with a little help from a strong us dollar.


of course, this is largely thanks to our strategy of continuing to invest during the crisis. that consistency also
showed that we are a reliable partner in the market and that we are serious about growth and our ambitious
targets. it put us in an excellent position now the markets are picking up and investors moving back in.


the market has also changed and is now a real seller’s market. volumes in the netherlands doubled to € 10 billion
last year as investors are looking for higher returns. bonds are at record highs and the stock market is trading at
fair value, so real estate has become a real alternative. investors’ biggest challenge is to find the right investment
manager and that is where we come in. we have a clear market vision, roots in pensions and real estate,
high-quality governance, a strong commitment towards sustainability and a great track record. investors know
they can trust us with their capital.


on top of this, we keep a close eye on our fees. a recent benchmark study showed that our fees are below the
industry benchmark for dutch investments and at benchmark level for our international portfolio. and the
outcome of a client satisfaction survey we conducted with bpfbouw and our first two new investors was very
positive, as we emerged with an average score of 7.7. it also provided us with a lot of insight into what investors
want or need from their investment manager. these results capped what was already an excellent year for us.


i would like to thank all our employees for their commitment, dedication and focus over the past year in a time of
market uncertainty and changes within bouwinvest itself. and i would like to welcome our new managing director
finance, arno van geet, who joined us in 2014.

we bid farewell to jacques van ek, who has been chairman of our supervisory board for the past eight years. we
are very grateful to him for his commitment, his inspiration and his contribution to bouwinvest’s success. we wish
him well.

report of the supervisory board
financial statements and profit appropriation
the board of directors prepared the bouwinvest financial statements and discussed these with the supervisory
board. deloitte accountants b.v. have audited the financial statements and provided them with an unqualified
independent auditors’ report. the financial statements will be submitted for adoption as part of the 2014 annual
report at the 2015 annual general meeting of shareholders (agm). the supervisory board proposes that the agm
adopts the financial statements and discharges the board of directors for its management of the company and its
funds and discharges the supervisory board for its supervision of same.


key developments
investments in the global real estate market were almost back at pre-crisis levels in 2014. bouwinvest has in-depth
knowledge of the dutch and international real estate market markets, through its in-house regional experts, its
own research department and via cooperation with local partners. the company was able to take full advantage of
this in 2014, investing more than € 1 billion in its dutch and international portfolios, the largest annual amount
invested in the company’s history. the residential fund invested no less than € 400 million last year, most of which
was in new-build properties, which means the fund has a secured pipeline for the coming years. both the office
fund and the retail fund invested in very promising assets, fully in line with the strategy of both funds, while the
newly-formed healthcare fund made its first investment in what promises to be a very high-growth market.


supervisory board meetings
the supervisory board met ten times in the course of 2014. all members of the supervisory board were frequently
present. the main subjects discussed at these meetings were bouwinvest’s strategy, the strategy of the funds it
manages and its investments in international listed and unlisted real estate funds, together with real estate
market developments. the supervisory board also discussed the investment plan real estate 2015 – 2017 for
bpfbouw, the various (quarterly) reports and bouwinvest’s compliance and risk management.

the supervisory board discussed the medium-term strategy and offered advice on bouwinvest’s long-term strategy
and the management of the bouwinvest funds. in april 2014, the board approved bouwinvest’s medium-term and
long-term strategy.

new investors
in 2014, bouwinvest welcomed two new investors to its residential fund, stichting rabobank pensioenfonds
(rabobank pension fund) and stichting bedrijftakpensioenfonds voor de zoetwarenindustrie (pension fund for the
dutch confectionary industry). as well as discussing the addition of these new shareholders and the changes to
the corporate governance of the residential fund, the supervisory board met in late 2014 to discuss the potential
addition of three new investors, all of which decided to join the residential fund as per 2 january 2015. these are
the stichting pensioenfonds voor fysiotherapeuten (the dutch pension fund for the physiotherapy sector),
stichting bedrijfstakpensioenfonds pno media (media pension fund) and stichting coop pensioenfonds (coop
supermarket pension fund).


the supervisory board was extremely pleased to welcome these new investors to the residential fund, and to note
heightened interest in bouwinvest’s office and retail funds.


financial performance
in four meetings, the supervisory board discussed the company’s quarterly reports, as well as the quarterly reports
related to compliance, risk management and business incidents. the board discussed the financial statements for
2014 in march 2015. the supervisory board also assessed the annual general meeting.


the supervisory board dealt with separate reports on bouwinvest’s management of bpfbouw’s international
portfolio and its heritage portfolio.


aifmd license
the supervisory board also discussed the progress of the application to the financial markets authority (afm) for a
license in the context of the european alternative investment fund managers directive (aifmd), as incorporated in
the dutch financial markets supervision act on 25 june 2013. bouwinvest received its license on 17 february 2014
and is now subject to the supervision of the dutch financial markets authority (afm) and the dutch central bank
(dnb).


management fees
a study was commissioned of bouwinvest's asset management fees. the supervisory board discussed the outcome
of this study, which showed that bouwinvest's fees are below the industry level benchmark for dutch investments
and at benchmark level for the company's international portfolio.


corporate social responsibility (csr)
as it does each year, the supervisory board devoted extra attention to bouwinvest’s corporate csr strategy. we are
pleased to report that bouwinvest's three dutch sector funds were awarded gresb ‘green star’ status due to the
transparency of the funds' reporting on corporate social responsibility and sustainability-related matters and the
funds' efforts to increase the sustainability of their business operations and their real estate portfolios.


other subjects
the board also discussed and approved the regulations of the selection & remuneration committee. other
subjects discussed included the recruitment of new members of the supervisory board, to fill the vacancies
created by the departure of gerard groener in 2013 and the retirement of chairman jacques van ek in late 2014.
kees beuving and roel wijmenga were appointed as a member of the supervisory board in august and october
2014 respectively. in december 2014, kees beuving replaced jacques van ek as chairman of the supervisory board.


in 2014, the supervisory board met four times in the absence of the board of directors. these meetings were
convened to discuss and evaluate the supervisory board, its committees and its individual members. the
self-evaluation was based on an extensive questionnaire. the main conclusion was that the board is performing
well and effectively. the supervisory board also discussed the performance of the board of directors and its
individual members.

bpfbouw, as shareholder in bouwinvest, met several times in the course of 2014. members of the supervisory
board also attended several meetings of the bouwinvest works council.

the internal audit function. the committee also devoted particular attention to the isae 3402 type ii certifcation,
the implementation of sepa and the implementation of the aifmd license. the audit committee advised the
supervisory board on the performance of the external auditor, which was judged adequate.

market developments and trends
occupier market
the dutch residential market has recovered in 2014 and the dutch residential rental market as a whole offers
stable rental income. after years of devaluations, market dynamics are increasing, with cities in the randstad
outperforming the market as a whole. the office market has been suffering from over-supply and downward
pressure on lease prices for an extended period. the premium segment of the office market is in a much stronger
position, however, with generally stable lease prices and occupancy rates.


dutch retail assets have generated good returns over the past few years, but are facing a challenging period on the
occupier market. there are signs of over-supply, partly due to trends such as online shopping, the ageing of the
population and (overly) ambitious construction plans from the past, and these trends are likely to result in further
polarisation among both users and investors. in the retail sector, a1 shopping streets in the major cities and local
or neighbourhood shopping centres appear to be the best-equipped to resist these trends and are the most
attractive investment category in this sector. the major cities are also the most attractive locations for hotels, led
by amsterdam, thanks to its position as the leading tourist and business destination in the country.


on a global scale, the highest growth is in the asia-pacific region, with the north american region coming in a close
second. the growth outlook is lower in europe, but the region does offer much greater stability. and even within
these regions, we are seeing major differences between countries, cities, sectors and segments. the focus of our
core investment strategy is on stable, transparent, large-scale, dynamic and liquid markets.


investment market
the investment dynamic in the global real estate market fell sharply in 2008. in the intervening period that
dynamic has gradually climbed back to pre-2008 levels. investment volumes have now almost reached pre-crisis
levels after a record-breaking last quarter in 2014. over the past few years, a great deal of capital has fled to core
markets and assets. these high-quality assets have largely regained a good deal of their value, with some markets
approaching all time low yields. lower quality or secondary assets, however, are still suffering from the downturn.
the resulting polarisation we are seeing among both users and investors has resulted in a sharp drop in liquidity
and negative pricing. however, what we did see last year was an increase in risk appetite, among both new and
existing investors, with the risk appetite certainly higher than in 2013. this is because risk premiums have risen,
especially in secondary markets. investors are still cautious with leverage and are relatively risk-averse compared
with pre-crisis sentiment.


global real estate transaction volumes came in at around € 700 billion in 2014, with the emea and us regions
booking the strongest growth. both regions experienced huge transaction volumes in the last quarter. us cities
formed half of the world’s top 20 investment destinations with secondary markets interest growing remarkably.
growth in the asia-pacific region was concentrated in australia, china, japan, with a marked upswing in interest in
south korea and new zealand. in europe, london was a very lively investment market and saw transaction
volumes of around € 45 billion in 2014.


the dutch real estate market peaked with growing activity from dutch and foreign investors. last year saw some €
10 billion in registered transactions in the netherlands. the long-term average transaction volume in direct dutch
real estate is around € 6 billion. over the past few years, however, transaction volumes have dipped to roughly € 4
billion a year. the office segment is traditionally the largest segment, but recent years have seen a sharp increase
in investment activity in the residential market.

the most important principles we can have.

we provide this security by offering reliable real estate solutions. bouwinvest does this by building a bridge
between the real estate investment assignment and the various kinds of real estate open to investment. we offer

investment plan bpfbouw
key achievements included the controlled growth of assets under management, improving the quality and
consistency of returns, the diversification and internationalisation of assets, controlling costs, refining the csr
strategy and establishing more stringent checks and balances within the investment management organisation. in
addition to the aifmd license, we took a number of significant steps in improving governance, notably in achieving
isae 3402 type ii certification, cobit 4 level 3 compliance and establishing a business continuity plan. last year, we
realised our first investments in the healthcare segment, which we believe has huge growth potential. and finally,
we and bpfbouw went on a study visit to london, which was organised with apg.


increased interest in our family of funds
the rabobank pension fund’s participation in the residential fund at the start of 2014 was a first step in realising
our multi-client strategy. this strategy was validated further by subsequent participations in the fund by four
third party investors later last year and in early 2015. we are seeing an increased interest in our family of funds,
partly thanks to our efforts on the investor relations front, our investor seminar and our dutch property tours.
commitments of well over € 120 million during the past 12 months, on top of the existing commitment of
bpfbouw, have put us in an even stronger position to take advantage of opportunities in the years ahead while
adhering to the consistent and sustainable growth strategy of our funds.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                    22



real estate sectors
residential fund (open for third-party investors)
pipeline secured by record investments of over € 400 million
the residential fund generated a total return of 5.1% (2013: 0.0%), with a direct return of 3.9% (2013: 3.6%), and an
indirect return of 1.2% (2013: -3.6%). the fund had a high and stable average occupancy rate of 96.5%. like-for-like
rental growth for 2014 amounted to 3.2% (2013: 3.1%), while rent arrears were low at 1.2% (2013: 1.5%). the dividend
return for 2014 is 3.9% (2013: 3.6%).


the residential fund reaped the benefits of our regular growth strategy following the completion and delivery of
seven excellent new-build projects, six of which were fully let before completion. we have a secured pipeline of 18
new residential projects following record investments totaling € 407 million in 2014 that will add 1,447 apartments
and 207 family homes. we anticipate they will benefit from the growing scarcity of high-quality residential units in
the liberalised rental sector, giving us visibility for the fund’s future and matching the fund’s regular long-term
growth objectives.


the recovery in the residential market and growing interest from domestic and foreign investors have led to a
steady rise in values, giving us a positive indirect return in 2014, and we expect this to continue in the next few
years. the renewed interest in the residential sector created an opportunity for the fund to optimise its portfolio
last year by selling 21 non-core assets for a total of € 116 million, which is close to its three-year target for
divestments.


the recovery in the residential sector and the very high quality of the residential portfolio enabled the fund to
attract five new investors alongside anchor investor bpfbouw in the 12 months to the end of january 2015.
rabobank pension fund invested in january 2014, followed by a € 30 million investment by the pension fund for the
dutch confectionary industry in july of 2014. three more pension funds followed suit, investing a total of € 72.5
million by january 2015, while the pension fund for the dutch confectionary industry added another € 20 million to
its initial investment in the fund.
at year-end 2014, the fund’s portfolio consisted of 210 properties with a total value of € 2.6 billion.


retail fund (open for third-party investors)
two-pillar strategy is starting to pay off
the retail fund booked a return of 1.8% in 2014 (2013: 8.1%), the result of a direct return of 4.5% (2013: 5.1%) and a
negative indirect return of -2.7% (2013: 3.0%). the average occupancy rate increased to 94.4% in 2014 from 92.9% the
previous year. the dividend return for 2014 is 4.5% (2013: 5.0%).


the retail fund benefitted from a substantial increase in values of its retail assets in amsterdam and improved its
portfolio by investments and upgrades of existing assets. this reflects the fund’s commitment to investing in
assets with solid growth prospects throughout the crisis years. while retail real estate will be a challenging sector
in the years ahead, we believe that portfolio with a good balance of 'experience' and 'convenience'-oriented retail
real estate assets will continue to generate solid returns in the long term.


in 2014, we acquired some excellent assets that matched our strategic focus on shopper 'experience' and
'convenience'-oriented retail properties. towards the end of the year, we acquired almost 30 retail units in the
multifunctional building beurs-wtc rotterdam in the heart of the city. this excellent addition to the portfolio’s
experience category of retail property assets has enormous potential. in the convenience category of retail assets,
we added the new parkweide shopping centre in ede to our portfolio. the retail fund made € 57 million in
acquisitions in 2014 and intends to upgrade and future-proof several existing assets, reflecting our continued
commitment to this segment of the real estate market.


on a very positive note, in 2014, the retail fund agreed new leases and renewed existing contracts for a total of
32,590 m2 of space, representing a rental value of some € 9.3 million.


at the end of 2014, the fund’s portfolio consisted of 41 properties with a total value of € 0.6 billion.


office fund (open for third-party investors)
three prime assets acquired at the bottom of the market
the office fund booked a return of 0.1% in 2014 (2013: -0.3%), the result of a direct return of 5.7% (2013: 5.6%) and a
negative indirect return of 5.6% (2013: -5.9%). the average occupancy rate fell slightly to 89.9% in 2014 from 90.4% in
2013. the dividend return was 5.7% (2013: 5.5%).

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                    23



last year was a turnaround year for the office fund as it made its first investments since 2008. the fund invested €
138 million in three prime properties in amsterdam and rotterdam. the dutch office market will continue to be an
extremely challenging sector, but these high-quality acquisitions in prime locations highlight the fact that there
are still excellent opportunities available. our long-term commitment to this real estate sector means that we will
continue to look for opportunities in the prime segment of the office market.

the fund acquired two prime properties in amsterdam, the valina building in the centre and the former citroën
buildings in the popular southern part of the city. the assets are in prime amsterdam office locations and
represent significant additions to the fund’s overall portfolio. towards the end of 2014, the fund also acquired the
beurs-wtc office complex in the heart of rotterdam’s business district. the citroën building and beurs-wtc are
both multi-functional, multi-tenant complexes, which are a primary focus for the office fund.


one of the highlights of 2014 was the fund’s success in winning its second successive ipd european property
investment award for the highest outperformance over the preceding three years (2011-2013).


active asset management and continued investment in upgrading and updating its office assets ensured that the
fund renewed or signed new leases for a total of 22,507 m2, representing an annual rental income of € 4.1 million in
2014.


at the end of 2014, the fund’s portfolio consisted of 30 properties with a total value of € 0.6 billion.


hotel fund (on behalf of bpfbouw)
best performing fund in dutch portfolio
the hotel fund lifted profits to € 9.8 million (2013: € 5.6 million) in the year under review. the fund‘s total return
slipped to 6.5% from 7.1% in 2013. highlights of the year include its € 1.7 million investment in expanding the
restaurant at casa400, as well as the installation of thermal energy storage facilities for casa400 and nh the
hague. the hotel fund’s portfolio comprises three fully-let hotels with a total value of € 140 million. the hotel fund
was our best performing dutch fund in 2014.


healthcare fund (on behalf of bpfbouw)
first acquisitions in very promising market
in its first year, the new healthcare fund reported a profit of € 0.4 million, while its total return amounted to 3.1%.
in 2014, the fund invested 3.0 million. acquisitions included the assisted accommodation complex hildebrand in
haarlem and the intramural care complex ingenhouszhof in amsterdam.


as healthcare moves from the state sector into the consumer market, we expect the demand for better quality
services to increase substantially as people seek more value for money. we are on the threshold of a new era
where ‘one size fits all’ is no longer the norm, and consumers will require different levels of healthcare and
accommodation according to their lifestyles and needs.


the ultimate potential for the entry of market forces into healthcare real estate in the netherlands is immense, as
the floor space in the sector is projected to grow to 30 million m2 by 2030 in or roughly midway between the size of
the retail and office markets. real estate brokers dtz and cbre estimate that annual investment transaction
volumes in the sector could hit between € 650 million and € 800 million over the next five years. the bpfbouw
mandate to invest in healthcare is € 300 million for the coming years.


international investments
shift to listed investments improved returns
the total return on bouwinvest’s international investments came in at 12.5% in 2014, excluding currency
variations. the exceptional performance of unlisted real estate funds in north america (17.3% in 2014) and listed
real estate investments (23% in 2014) stood out as all regions performed well. the total return of 9.8% from
european investments was a considerable improvement on the previous year’s return and a sign of the gradual
recovery that we are seeing in this region. the asia-pacific region performed well, with a 9.0% return in 2014. at
year-end 2014, the average leverage in the portfolio had fallen to 33.6% from an average of 36% in 2013. however,
new investments with a higher leverage level are planned for 2015-2017. the maximum average portfolio leverage
is 45%, with a maximum leverage of 60% per investment. the total value of the international investments portfolio
stood at € 2.4 billion at year-end 2014, compared with € 1.9 billion a year earlier. total investments came in at € 438
million in 2014, while disposals came in at € 307 million, in line with the growth strategy outlined in the mandate
for international investments. exchange rates contributed € 137 million while valuation movements also added €
197 million to the growth of the portfolio in 2014.

bouwinvest development (on behalf of bpfbouw)
landholdings represent opportunities
bouwinvest development booked a negative return of 16.7% in 2014, widening from the -13.8% return reported in
2013. the direct result came in at -2.5% (2013: 0.4%) and the indirect result amounted to -14.2% (2013: -14.2%), mainly
the result of a significant depreciation of a landholding in nieuw vennep.

the existing landholdings in the portfolio are becoming more and more important again. the landholdings
represent a potential of 5.000 dwellings.



financial analysis 2014
income and costs
fee income came in at € 27.9 million in 2014, 1.9% higher than in 2013. combined with the reduced overall
management costs of € 24.6 million, compared with € 25.3 million in 2013, we recorded a higher than expected
margin of € 3.3 million in 2014, up € 1.3 million compared to 2013. the reduced operating costs, which came in € 0.7
million lower than in 2013, were key factors in the reduction of overall management costs.


fiscal result
the revaluation of the fiscally compensable losses for corporate tax purposes had a positive impact of € 1.0 million
on bouwinvest results. this item includes the effects of losses booked in previous years which, on the basis of the
ruling from the tax authorities, may be offset against the current and future profits of bouwinvest.


total result
the total profit for 2014 came in at € 3.2 million, almost equal to the average total profit of € 3.3 million recorded in
the last five years.


financial position
as a result of the profit booked in 2014, shareholders’ equity increased to € 27.2 million in 2014, from € 24.0 million
in the previous year. the solvency ratio had risen to 88% (excluding dividend) at year-end 2014, from 83% a year
earlier.


cash position
at year-end 2014, bouwinvest had a total of € 12.5 million available in its current account with our bank abn amro.
this was more than sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and was also in line with the formal requirements
of the alternative investment fund manager directive (aifmd).


profit allocation and dividend policy
the management proposes to pay out a dividend of € 2.1 million in 2015.


phui energy
the thermal energy storage installations were sold at market value to the bouwinvest funds, resulting in a
negative result of € 0.6 million. in the last quarter of 2014, phui energy was liquidated.



outlook
we expect most real estate markets to continue to recover in 2015 and beyond, and we are generally positive on
the outlook for the growth of returns from our assets under management. in 2014, we saw the benefits of our
continued investment in the past few years and we will reap the benefits of our investments in high-quality real
estate assets in 2015. we have a very solid secured pipeline of new properties of around € 700 million, which will
lead to more participants in the funds and growth of the portfolios.


of course, there is a flip side to this. more and more investors are discovering that real estate is an attractive asset
class, with solid potential for long-term investments. this is likely to make the market far more competitive and
more expensive, certainly for top-notch assets in the prime segment of our core regions. on the other hand, many
investors are looking for an investment manager with expertise and a solid track record in the real estate industry.

this is why we are seeing a lot of interest from investors in our open funds. we expect to see this interest increase
in the future and to see more investors participating in these funds, which puts us in a very strong market position.
we have the funds, the commitment and the market know-how to continue to expand our secured pipeline in 2015
and beyond to meet this growing demand from investors.

corporate social responsibility
introduction
bouwinvest believes it has a responsibility to make sure its investments meet sustainability criteria and that we
operate in a responsible and ethical manner. we have always taken a long-term view and environmental, social and
governance (esg) criteria play a significant role in our investment strategy. this is because we are convinced that
sustainable and socially responsible investments and business operations play a key role in helping us to book
stable returns from our real estate investments.


csr highlights 2014
• several success stories in building long term value through sustainable partnerships
• gresb green star status for our three dutch sector funds two years ahead of schedule
• number of best performing 'green star' fund managers more than doubled over the past three years in our
  international portfolio
• co2 emissions for the management organisation further reduced by 4.0% in 2014 (7.2% since 2012)
• first steps taken in the composition of a materiality matrix
• active endorsement of our social responsibility in our hiring policy and through a partnership with homeplan


stakeholder engagement and communications
bouwinvest believes that the best way to engage with its stakeholders is through open and transparent dialogue.
it helps us to identify the material issues relevant to the bouwinvest organisation and its funds and to find out
what our stakeholders want and what they think is relevant. identifying those issues in turn helps us to reduce
costs, future-proof the organisation and ultimately create value for all our stakeholders.



csr pillars
our csr pillars
bouwinvest has divided its csr mission and activities into three pillars:


1. we aim to be a reliable business partner and meet the expectations of our investors through full transparency
   on our csr track record and goals.
2. we endeavour to continuously improve the sustainability of our investment portfolio in cooperation with all
   our stakeholders.
3. our goal is to be a flexible, ethical and fair employer to help our people to achieve bouwinvest’s csr ambitions.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                  27



sustainability strategy and material issues




1. sustainable and reliable business partner
bouwinvest sees sustainability as an integral part of its business and we believe that transparency on where and
how we impact society is a key element in improving our sustainability performance. this transparency gives us
invaluable insight into the issues relevant to us and to our stakeholders, and enables us to define clear priorities
and set concrete and measurable targets.


value creation
in today’s challenging market, it is essential to be a reliable business partner both in economic terms and on the
sustainability front. of course investors are looking for added economic value, but now they also expect their
partners to add social and environmental value. and they want complete transparency with regards to
sustainability goals and performance and the related issues they find relevant.


see the corporate governance section in this report for more details.


2. sustainable real estate
bouwinvest is constantly improving the transparency and sustainability performance of its three main sector
funds, both at a bricks and mortar level and at fund level. we use globally accepted performance indicators (inrev,
gri) and sustainability labels (gresb, breeam) to benchmark our performance and our progress. however, it is
impossible to achieve real sustainability by yourself.


joint effort
this is why one of bouwinvest’s top priorities is to work with all its stakeholders to improve the sustainability its
assets and its business as a whole. we work with our tenants, business partners and other stakeholders, such as
local city councils, to create sustainable properties and local environments. places where people will want to live,
work or shop long into the future.


dutch real estate funds win ‘green star’ status
bouwinvest uses the global real estate sustainability benchmark (gresb) to measure and compare the
sustainability performance of our three main dutch sector funds. in 2014, bouwinvest's three main dutch sector
funds once again actively participated in this initiative, which is aimed at boosting transparency and sustainability
in the real estate sector. the result of the strategy and actions that bouwinvest has taken to improve its
environmental and social performance is that in 2014, well ahead of schedule, bouwinvest's residential, office and
retail funds all moved up from ‘green talker’ to ‘green star’, the highest possible category in the gresb rankings.


benchmark international real estate investments
last year, bouwinvest also continued its active cooperation with other institutional investors aimed at increasing
sustainability and transparency in the real estate sector. we extended our membership of gresb and encouraged
fund managers of our (international) indirect investments to participate in the gresb benchmark.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                    28



the results of the gresb benchmark were better in 2014 than in both 2013 and 2012. the response rate in the gresb
assessment in bouwinvest’s international portfolio was also higher in 2014



   highlights gresb and international portfolio:
   • the number of participating investors in the gresb benchmark increased again to 68% from 61%
      measured by nav.
   • the number of green stars increased to 15 from 11 for (unlisted investments) and doubled to 18 from 9
      for listed investments. this means that the number of green stars overall has more than doubled since
      benchmarking started.
   • the international portfolio outperformed the benchmark with a average total score of 52 against 47
      (global average), with a larger difference than in 2013.
   • throughout the portfolio the score showed a substantial increase. for the unlisted investments, 43%
      improved its score compared to last year (in 2013: 48%). for the listed investments the increase was
      even more impressive: 54%, following an increase of 31% in 2013.



sustainability performance is now part of our key criteria in investment decisions and risk assessment, and we
give a clear preference to investments with higher sustainability scores. the inclusion of the corruption index per
country and the robecosam country sustainability index in our internal bouwinvest global market monitor also
enables us to assess and manage esg risks even more effectively when selecting our international investments.


for more details, please see the csr sections in our fund reports and the csr performance indicators in this annual
report.


3. a sustainable, ethical and fair employer
bouwinvest sees its employees as its most important source of value creation. our hr policy is aimed at providing
the organisation with the knowledge, expertise and skills it needs and to develop the talents of our employees in a
pleasant and stimulating working environment. the results of last years' employee engagement surveys show that
this approach is working. for the past three years, bouwinvest has booked a steady improvement in what we see
as a one of the main spearheads of our hr policy. the most recent survey (2013) again showed an improvement of
our employment engagement score, this time to 7.8, from 7.4 in 2011.


for more details, please see the hrm section in this report.



progress made in 2014
in 2014, bouwinvest took a number of significant steps to further integrate corporate social responsibility into its
day-to-day business and refined the pillars of its csr strategy. this is now based on three pillars: our aim to be a
reliable business partner, to increase the sustainability of our real estate investments in cooperation with our
stakeholders and our goal to be an ethical and fair employer. this shift to a more refined set of csr pillars signals a
step forward in our journey of linking financial and sustainability ambitions and strategy to create long-term
stakeholder value.


sustainability hotspots
not content to rest on its laurels, bouwinvest is currently working on a so-called materiality matrix to help the
company identify the main sustainability issues and devise a strategy to deal with them on an ongoing basis. this
is important because sustainability is about a lot more than the environment and reducing emissions. real
sustainability also embraces ethical, legal, social, compliance, risk and human resources issues.


in today’s ever more demanding environment, a serious csr strategy has to address all these issues to create
sustainable value for an organisation’s stakeholders. the materiality matrix will help us to further boost
awareness of how important it is for us to embed esg criteria in our day-to-day business, and help us to refine our
priorities and targets. it is a starting point to further engage with several relevant stakeholder groups in 2015.


co footprint bouwinvest organisation
    2

in 2012, bouwinvest started to improve the transparency of the management organisation's co2 emissions. last
year, we expressed our ambition to make our operations to be carbon neutral by 2020. we have already made
significant progress in recent years in reducing our emissions and we took further steps to reduce emissions in
2014. progress made this year include:

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                   29



• co2 emissions from energy consumption fell by 17%, following the introduction of flex work 2.0 and the
  resultant shutdown of two floors at the bouwinvest office building.
• renovations related to the introduction of flex work 2.0 resulted in a once-only increase of 28% in co2
  emissions on our waste disposal. on a like-for-like basis, our waste emissions remained stable.
• the use of more fuel-efficient lease cars (including hybrid and electric lease cars) resulted in a reduction in co2
  emissions of more than 11%, while the number of kilometres driven increased by 9%.
• a side-effect of an increase in our international real estate allocation was a 36% increase in co2 emissions from
   air travel.


these and other measures led to a total reduction in our total co2 emissions of 4.0% compared to the previous year.
carbon emissions intensity, calculated as tonnes of co2 /fte dropped by 8.1%. in addition, bouwinvest purchases
renewable energy (electricity) for its entire real estate portfolio. this is part of bouwinvest’s policy to reduce any
negative impact on the environment and stimulate the use of sustainable sources.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                30




human resources management
﻿
following the organisational changes at bouwinvest in 2013, human resources management (hrm) focused on
refining and enhancing the organisation in 2014, with a clear focus on increasing efficiency and encouraging more
cooperation and knowledge exchange across the company. bouwinvest wants to be the best in its market, the best
at what we do and, very importantly, provide investors and other stakeholders with the highest possible levels of
service. the only way to do that is by having the best people in the right place in an organisation that is both
effective and efficient, and that can add value at an individual and organisational level.


hrm highlights in 2014:
• instigating real change by putting our people in charge
• increasing the commercial focus and efficiency of back-office processes, including digitising accounts payable
  and a new administrative system for international investments
• increasing the awareness of aifmd-related processes and demands
• promoting collaboration and knowledge-sharing through an open-space office, business and social networking,
  plus intensified internal communications
• actively endorsing our social responsibility in our hiring policy and through a partnership with homeplan


organisational development
one of bouwinvest’s strategic goals is to increase its assets under management to € 7.7 billion in 2017. but we are
not interested in growth for growth’s sake. we want to book controlled growth, combining entrepreneurial spirit
with accountability and control processes. we are now under much more scrutiny than in the past, as we now fall
under the supervision of the dutch financial markets authority and the dutch central bank. additionally, we now
have to meet the conditions of our aifmd license. so we need to meet very strict control and reporting standards,
and increase our focus on the commercial side of the business.


creating a clear identity
in 2014, hrm took further steps towards creating this new bouwinvest corporate identity, a culture based on
accountability, focus and collaboration. of course, you cannot create a new corporate culture overnight.
organisational change has to be accompanied by a change in the mindset of the people it affects the most.


this is why bouwinvest’s approach to change is to put its people at the forefront, to make them stakeholders in
that change. it may not be the quickest road to change, but we have found that the most effective way to realise
real change is to put together small but diverse project groups, who help to define the changes necessary. then we
get as many people as possible involved in actually making the changes and embedding them in the organisation.
people are much more willing to accept change that they have helped to shape. this not only increases buy-in and
the chances of success, it helps bouwinvest to make changes that actually work and add value for clients, the
organisation, and our employees.


focus on core competencies, efficiency and control
to achieve this added value, our focus has to be more competency-driven, putting highly-skilled specialists where
they are the most effective. for instance, we have a lot of specialists in fields such as compliance, risk
management, internal audit, tax and reporting. we have continuous process management, document
management and change management in place. in other words, we are in control. in fact, this is virtually a
business within the business, which is vital in the much more demanding compliance environment in which we
now operate.


last year, we took a number of practical measures to improve these processes and the efficiency of the
‘back-office’. these included the introduction of the sepa (single european payments area) system, digitalising
accounts payable and reducing administration. we improved our quarterly reporting both quantitatively and
qualitatively, raising overall reporting to aifmd standards. last year saw several measures aimed at enhancing the
aifmd compliance process and increasing awareness of aifmd standards. and bouwinvest decided to decentralise
its it systems and migrate from one supplier to a number specialised it companies. this gave us an opportunity to
increase control of our company-wide it system. in line with the sharp increase in investments at our international
portfolio, we decided to invest in a new and far more efficient administration system.

collaboration is key
the real estate investment sector is a people business; it depends completely on know-how and expertise. and
achieving commercial focus requires very high levels of collaboration and knowledge exchange, right across the
organisation. this will be one of the major drivers of change at bouwinvest in the years ahead. collaboration is
already implicit in almost everything we do, but in the future it will be a very explicit and integral part of how we
do business.


to promote collaboration, we introduced an open-plan office, literally breaking down barriers and bringing people
from different parts of the organisation closer together. this effort was boosted by the flex working practices we
introduced, such as the absence of fixed work stations for a large number of our employees.


communicating change
communication is a key factor in the promotion of collaboration and bouwinvest has stepped up its internal
communications in several ways. we now make maximum use of internal media such as our group intranet and
various in-house magazines, increasing the number of internal news items and project write-ups. people are now
much more aware of what is happening in other parts of the organisation.


putting people first
our people and their know-how, their commitment and their engagement are essential to our continued success.
this is why bouwinvest places so much focus on its people’s professional and personal development. we want our
people to be committed and accept accountability for their results. but commitment and accountability are
two-way streets. we cannot expect people to be engaged unless we as an organisation show similar levels of
engagement. we provide our people with the tools they need and create a culture in which they can focus on what
they need to do.


respect people, have fun and make money
we invest both time and money in the development of professional and personal skills, to create project
challenges and also to promote an active vitality programme with a range of individual sports activities and
collective events. in addition to our commercial success, we feel that this engagement has also helped us to
achieve one of the lowest absenteeism rates in the real estate industry and indeed in the dutch corporate world.


we also organise regular social and networking events for the entire organisation. these have increased the
opportunities for internal networking and helped create a much more cohesive organisation, with fewer barriers
to communications across the company. besides this, the social events give people a chance to get to know each
other in an even more relaxed atmosphere.


investing in the future
we want to continue to improve as an organisation with the people we have on board and we want them to grow
with us. we already have strategic personal planning and succession planning in place and in 2013 we introduced
the management development programme, covering a wide range of management skills. last year’s launch of the
development programme for team leaders and high potentials was the next logical step in the process. we will
continue to roll this out in 2015, paving the way for the next generation of leaders. we will also be conducting our
bi-annual employee engagement survey, which will show us when our employees think we are on the right track
and identify other improvements to makes us even more effective.


accepting social responsibility
bouwinvest does not exist in a vacuum and we aim to play an active and positive role in the world around us. we
actively promote the regeneration of neighbourhoods in inner city areas across the netherlands, both at head
office level and through our investment funds, and encourage our people to get involved in social initiatives.


on a real bricks and mortar level, bouwinvest extended its partnership with the homeplan charity foundation,
which builds houses for some of the world’s poorest people. for an initial period of three years, bouwinvest will
make a fixed donation to the charity’s housing projects, but we have also committed to getting our own people
involved in initiatives around the globe. in november of last year, three bouwinvest employees spent time in
mexico with a homeplan team building homes in the slums of san andrés azumiatla in the country’s puebla
province. ten families had new homes in time for christmas.


on the home front, young people are currently finding it very difficult to enter the job market. bouwinvest has
therefore increased the number of interns we take on each year, giving young people a chance to work in a highly
professional environment and gain valuable work experience.

influencing respectful personnel management with business partners has now been incorporated in selection
criteria when tendering for facility management services, such as catering and cleaning. in addition to pricing,
social responsibility is now a key issue in the selection of new partners and is part of our service level agreements.

members of the supervisory board are appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. in carrying out its
duties, the supervisory board is guided by the interests of the company and the business connected with it.

in the regulations of the audit committee of the supervisory board. the selection & remuneration committee’s
tasks and responsibilities are set out in the regulations of the selection & remuneration committee of the
supervisory board. more information on the composition of the committees can be found in the report of the

company secretary
the supervisory board is supported by the company secretary. the company secretary ensures that the correct
procedures are followed and that the supervisory board acts in accordance with its legal and statutory obligations
and powers and the applicable corporate governance rules.



shareholders' meeting

year and the annual report, to adopt the ﬁnancial statements, decide on the dividend proposal, discharge the
board of directors for its management and discharge the members of the supervisory board for their supervision.
the meeting also appoints the members of the supervisory board and statutory directors. shareholder approval is
required for resolutions that have a substantial impact on bouwinvest and its risk proﬁle.

board of directors endorses the best practices of the code as far as applicable to bouwinvest.

directors. you will find more details on the compliance function in the risk management section of this annual
report.


conflict of interests policy
bouwinvest has a conflicts of interests policy. the purpose of this policy is to protect the interests of bouwinvest
and the interests of the fund when bouwinvest is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that
might benefit the private interests of a bouwinvest employee or might result in a possible excess benefit
transaction. the policy also describes how bouwinvest should act with respect to the allocation of different
investment opportunities over the respective funds and clients. the policy is intended to supplement but not
replace any applicable dutch laws governing conflicts of interests.


in 2014, there were no conflicts of interests as referred to in the bouwinvest conflicts of interests policy, either
between the members of the board of directors, the management company, or the funds managed by the
management company.



internal control framework
bouwinvest has an effective internal control framework based on the coso framework. the internal control
framework provides reasonable assurance that the management company and the funds it manages will achieve
their financial and operational objectives, the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the business, the reliability of its
ﬁnancial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015, bouwinvest
was awarded isae 3402 type ii certiﬁcation for the year 2014.


four lines of defence
bouwinvest has a monitoring and control framework based on the four lines of defence principle. the compliance,
risk management, control and internal audit functions at bouwinvest are aligned in accordance with that
principle. this is an integrated approach to compliance and risk management, with policies designed to meet the
demands of both regulatory supervision and public opinion, while enabling the oversight functions to operate in a
focused, efﬁcient and cost-effective manner.


the four lines of defence are as follows:


1. board of directors - responsible for embedding the risk and control environment in the organisation’s
   day-to-day operations.
2. the compliance, risk management and control functions – responsible for risk-related, compliance and
   control policies, efﬁcient and cost-effective implementation of the policies and continuous improvements.
3. bouwinvest’s internal auditor – operates independently and responsible for the execution of required control
   measures.
4. supervisory board and external auditor - the supervisory board supervises the board of directors and provides
   advice. also supervises internal risk management and control systems, ﬁnancial reporting and assesses the
   internal and external auditors.

bouwinvest's four lines of defense




regulation
bouwinvest has obtained a licence within the meaning of article 2:65 of the dutch financial supervision act (wet
op het financieel toezicht). bouwinvest is therefore subject to supervision of the dutch financial markets
authority (afm) and the dutch central bank (dnb).



funds managed by bouwinvest
the management company manages five funds:


•   bouwinvest dutch institutional residential fund n.v.
•   bouwinvest dutch institutional retail fund n.v.
•   bouwinvest dutch institutional office fund n.v.
•   bouwinvest dutch institutional hotel fund n.v.
•   bouwinvest dutch institutional healthcare fund n.v.


bouwinvest has a separate mandate from bpfbouw for the management of international real estate investments.
bouwinvest also manages bouwinvest development, a project development company.



external auditor
bouwinvest's external auditor is deloitte accountants b.v. deloitte audits the financial statements of bouwinvest
reim. deloitte also audits the financial statements of the funds managed by bouwinvest.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                  36




dutch management and supervision act
the dutch management and supervision act (wet bestuur en toezicht) came into force on 1 january 2013.
bouwinvest has amended its articles of association and internal regulations in line with this legislation, insofar as
applicable and necessary. the management and supervision act includes a guideline for a balanced gender ratio
within the board of directors and supervisory board. at least 30% of these positions should be filled by women and
at least 30% by men. bouwinvest’s board of directors and supervisory board do not yet have the above-mentioned
gender balance. based on the profiles of the members of the board of directors and of the supervisory board, in
the event of future resignations bouwinvest will carry out an evaluation to determine the desired profile of any
new members. this evaluation will take into account diversity criteria, including a balance of male and female.



in control statement
the board of directors has issued an ‘in control’ statement on the ﬁnancial reporting risks and strategic and
operational risk management at bouwinvest. the board of directors is responsible for proper risk management
and internal control systems and for assessing their effectiveness.


based on its assessment of the risk management and internal control systems, the board of directors believes that
these systems provide a reasonable level of assurance that the ﬁnancial reports contain no material errors.


in general, the risk management and internal control systems functioned properly in 2014 and there is no
indication that these systems will not function properly in 2015. no shortcomings that could have a material
impact were identiﬁed in these systems in 2014, nor up to the date this annual report was signed in 2015.
furthermore, no deﬁciencies in the internal control systems were identified that could have a material impact on
operational and compliance risks, nor on the financial reporting function and the functioning of the internal and
external auditors.

risk management
risk management and compliance
bouwinvest recognises the importance of a solid risk management framework. the aim of the framework is to
identify and mitigate risks, making it possible for the company to achieve its goals more effectively.


introduction
the developments of the past few years in the financial sector and among asset managers have led to calls for
stricter legislation and regulations to prevent a repeat of the various crises. the banking, insurance and pension
sectors all now face increased regulation and monitoring by regulatory authorities. as a consequence,
institutional investors attach ever increasing importance to internal risk management, compliance, transparency
and open accountability to stakeholders.


the various cases of major real estate fraud seen in the past have led to a rethink in the sector. apart from stricter
legislation and stakeholders that have forced the sector to take action, real estate players have realised that this
kind of behaviour simply cannot be tolerated. due in part to new legislation and the sector’s need for internal
reform, real estate asset managers are continuously improving risk management, compliance and internal
auditing practices to prevent future incidents. the real estate world is changing rapidly and players in the sector
are – wherever possible – making use of lessons from the banking and insurance worlds.



risk management framework
bouwinvest has chosen the globally recognised coso framework as the basis for its own risk management. this
model goes beyond internal controls and also covers the entire internal management system and is known as
coso or enterprise risk management framework (ermf). based on this framework, bouwinvest has also drawn up
its own reporting and monitoring framework with its four lines of defence, as described in the corporate
governance section in this annual report.



main risks and mitigating factors
in 2014, bouwinvest recognised the following management risks:


•   continuity
•   quality
•   relative performance
•   transparency
•   management fee


continuity
the continuity risk is the risk relating to the continuity of the management organisation, as a result of which the
company can no longer meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other clients. this risk is mitigated by
closing service level agreements with outsourcing partners, by drawing up and updating/maintaining a business
continuity plan and the application of an information security policy.


quality
the quality risk is the risk that the management organisation is unable to deliver sufficient quality, as a result of
which bouwinvest is unable to meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other investors in an
adequate fashion. this risk is mitigated through the use of an internal (process) management framework in
accordance with isae 3402, which is tested annually by an external auditor. in addition to this, a corporate social
responsibility action list is monitored and a business incidents procedure is in place.

bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. | annual report 2014                                                   38



relative performance
this risk pertains to the extent to which the management organisation fails to achieve the relevant benchmarking
with the entities it manages, as a result of which bpfbouw and other clients may decide to withdraw their
assignments from bouwinvest. this risk is mitigated by monitoring bouwinvest’s own performance vis-à-vis the
relevant benchmarking on the basis of quality (ipd property index, inrev fund index and ncreif fund index) and
annually (anrev index) and by management of (the results of) the managed entities.


transparency
the transparency risk is the risk that the management organisation is unable to account for its activities in
accordance with the timely reporting and quality requirements laid down in the service level agreements closed
with bpfbouw and other clients. this risk is mitigated by actively managing the process with a view to the timely
delivery of high-quality reports.


management fee
this describes the risk that bouwinvest’s fee income is lower than its expenses. this risk is mitigated by identifying
fee income developments in a timely fashion and if necessary responding to same with cost-control measures.



control of investment decisions
the investment committee (ic) is an important advisory body for the board of directors in terms of risk
management. supported by the risk controller, the manager corporate control participates in the ic and tests the
investment process, decision-making and investment proposals. he does so together with the compliance officer
and several other of bouwinvest’s specialists. investment proposals are tested in advance against kpis, the
fundamentals of which are set annually in the investment plan. this includes looking at whether the investments
are in line with the budgeted amounts of the various locations and whether the risk classification is correct and in
line with the intended investment strategy and the goals for portfolio diversification.


after the ic has provided its advice, the proposal is presented to the board of directors. the board will take the ic
advice into consideration and makes the final decision. for investments above a certain threshold, an additional
approval by the supervisory board is required. the exception to this are investments by bouwinvest funds which
have a shareholders' committee.


using leverage is a well-known risk factor in the real estate world. unlike many other real estate investors,
bouwinvest makes no use of leverage for dutch investments. bouwinvest’s international investments do involve
leverage, but this accounts for a limited proportion of total investments and is continuously monitored in financial
and risk reports.


in addition to leverage, extra risk factors in dutch and international investments include business partners and
related due diligence and fiscal matters, and all of these are monitored closely by the risk and compliance
functions. in the case of international investments, bouwinvest devotes extra attention to fee structures and their
relation to a fund’s performance.



alternative investment fund managers directive
(aifmd)
early 2014, bouwinvest was one of the first parties in the netherlands to obtain an afm licence as required by the
aifmd. this licence allows bouwinvest's funds to manage funds that are open for other institutional investors
besides bpfbouw.


the aifmd specifies certain transparency and integrity related requirements for alternative investment funds. for
bouwinvest this has led to an increased workload in reporting. on top of that, alignment activities with our newly
contracted custodian -intertrust group- required additional operational efforts. nevertheless, 2014 has shown that
bouwinvest is geared up for these additional tasks. bouwinvest foresees no aifmd-related challenges for 2015
besides minor optimisation of internal processes.


you will find more detailed information on financial risks in the financial risks section of the explanatory notes to
the financial statements.

monitoring and reporting
at bouwinvest, monitoring risks is a fixed part of day-to-day activities of the managers responsible for same and an
integral part of the planning and control cycle. the bouwinvest board of directors receives quarterly risk reports,
which report on the management of risks on the basis of risk indicators. in 2014, bouwinvest continued to expand
and refine its risk management system through detailed assessment. this will result in an improved risk reporting
framework, which is expected to be in place as per 2015.

general
legal structure and principal activities
bouwinvest real estate investment management b.v. (‘bouwinvest’ or ‘the company’), domiciled in amsterdam, is a
private company with limited liability incorporated on 9 october 2002. bouwinvest’s objective is to provide real
estate investment services to the stichting bedrijfstakpensioenfonds voor de bouwnijverheid (bpfbouw), to third
parties and to bpfbouw group companies as defined in article 2:24b of the dutch civil code. all shares in the
company are held by bpfbouw. the company forms part of a group, headed by bpfbouw in amsterdam, the
netherlands. the financial information of the company has been recorded in the financial statements of bpfbouw.
copies are available at the trade register of the chamber of commerce as well as on the website bpfbouw.


bouwinvest is an investment manager specialised in real estate for institutional investors. bouwinvest manages
five dutch sector funds. bouwinvest also manages a separate mandate for international investments in europe,
north america and the asia pacific region. in the netherlands, the management services cover the entire real
estate chain, from acquisition and (re)development through asset management and disposal. for the international
investments, the management services consist mainly of fund selection and monitoring the performance of the
selected fund managers and funds.


basis of preparation
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with part 9, book 2 of the dutch civil code.


the legal entity is subject to the medium-sized company annual accounts regulations as defined in article 2:397 of
the dutch civil code.


changes in group companies
the associated companies phui energy bv and dri i beheer bv were disposed in the financial year 2014. as a result
of the disposal of these companies, the comparative figures have been restated. the movement in the associated
companies is stated in explanatory note 2 with a balance of nil at year end 2014. the results of the disposed
associated companies are included in the financial statements up to their date of disposal, see explanatory note
15.


accounting policies
valuation of assets and liabilities and determination of the result take place under the historical cost convention.
unless presented otherwise at the relevant principle for the specific balance sheet item, assets and liabilities are
valued according to the cost model.


income and expenses are accounted for on accrual basis. profit is only included when realised on the balance
sheet date. losses originating before the end of the financial year are taken into account if they have become
known before preparation of the financial statements.


the financial statements of the company are presented in thousands of euro (€), unless otherwise stated.


financial instruments
financial instruments include primary financial instruments, such as receivables and payables.


the notes to the specific items of the balance sheet disclose the fair value of the related instrument if this deviates
from the carrying amount. the carrying amounts of all financial instruments approximate the fair value. if the
financial instrument is not recorded in the balance sheet, the information on the fair value is disclosed in the
notes to the ‘contingent rights and obligations’.


for the principles of primary financial instruments, reference is made to the recognition per balance sheet item.

tangible fixed assets
equipment is stated at purchase price less straight-line depreciations, calculated while taking into consideration
the estimated economic life of the assets in question, and, if applicable, less impairments in value. acquisitions in
the year under review are subject to depreciation according to the proportion of the year they have been held.
depreciation of equipment is over a period of three to fifteen years.


costs for periodical major maintenance are charged to the result at the moment they arise. leasehold
improvements are depreciated over a ten-year period. the estimated useful lives of the leasehold improvements
are in line with the remaining term of the corresponding lease.


financial fixed assets
group companies
where significant influence is exercised, associated companies in non-consolidated group companies are valued
under the net asset value method, but not lower than a nil value. this net asset value is based on the same
accounting principles as applied by bouwinvest.


associated companies with a negative net equity value are valued at nil. if the company fully or partly guarantees
the liabilities of the associated company concerned, or has the effective obligation respectively to enable the
associated company to pay its (share of the) liabilities, a provision is formed. upon determining this provision,
provisions for doubtful debts already deducted from receivables from the associated company are taken into
account.


other participations
when significant influence is exercised, associated companies are valued at net asset value. when no significant
influence is exercised, associated companies are valued at cost less impairment, if applicable. with the valuation
of associated companies any impairment in value is taken into account.


current assets
upon initial recognition the receivables are included at fair value and then valued at amortised cost. the fair value
and amortised cost equal the face value. any provision for doubtful accounts deemed necessary is deducted. these
provisions are determined by individual assessment of the receivables.


cash
the cash is valued at face value. if cash equivalents are not freely disposable, then this has been taken into
account upon valuation.


management fee
the management fee is calculated based on the assets under management and project turnover.


taxes
corporate income tax is calculated at the applicable rate on the result for the financial year, taking into account
permanent differences between profit calculated according to the financial statements and profit calculated for
taxation purposes, and with which deferred tax assets (if applicable) are only valued insofar as their realisation is
likely.


the legal entity is part of a fiscal unity for corporate income tax and vat purposes and for that reason it is jointly
and severally liable for the tax liabilities of the fiscal unity as a whole.


notes to the cash flow statement, general principles
the cash flow statement is drawn up according to the indirect method. the funds in the cash flow statement
consist of cash and cash equivalents. cash equivalents can be considered to be highly liquid investments. interest
income and expenses are recognised in the cash flow from ordinary operations.

management takes the position that the management fees charged to the residential fund, office fund and retail
fund are exempt from dutch vat under the exemption for the management of collective investment funds.
bouwinvest did not pay the levied dutch vat over the second and third quarter of 2013. the dutch revenue has
imposed an assessment of € 2.0 million with respect to the unpaid vat. bouwinvest has appealed the decision from
the dutch revenue and management expects to pay nil. the maximum exposure, on result before tax, is € 2.9
million incase the vat have to be paid whereas € 0.9 million is recorded as a receivable, see note 5.

reporting of performance indicators
bouwinvest reports environmental data for those assets where management control is possible (operational
control approach). data is provided for those assets where we have the authority to introduce and implement
operating policies and are responsible for purchasing energy and water and handling waste. our management
control differs greatly by asset type (e.g. residential and office); these differences affect the level of influence we
have over the sustainability performance of our assets.
like-for-like data and changes represents assets which have been fully owned and operational for the full
24-month period in our investment portfolio. it provides insight into the performance of an indicator over time at a
constant portfolio scope. the relatively large reduction in ghg emissions is due to the compensation of carbon
emissions through the purchase of carbon certificates. this is in line with bouwinvest’s commitment to reduce the
impact its operations have on climate change.
energy, emission and water intensities are reported using “shared services” as the numerator and the lettable
floor area (lfa) as the denominator. “shared services” refers to landlord-obtained consumption for common areas
and any services provided to tenant areas that have not been sub-metered.
