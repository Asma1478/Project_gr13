gri reporting

in the 2013 financial year, geberit’s sustainability reporting is fully integrated in the online annual report for the third year running. the company’s
systematic and transparent communication on the subject of sustainability is addressed to a range of target groups, including customers and
partners, investors, the general public and company employees. to this end, information is therefore made available at different levels:

  → ceo statement on sustainability
  current → highlights and → highlights 2012 on the theme of sustainability
  business and financial review, as part of the annual report integrated into the chapters → employees, → customers, → innovation, → logistics
  and procurement, → sustainability, → compliance and → social engagement
  → sustainability strategy with objectives and measures
  → key figures sustainability
  → communication on progress un global compact

the sustainability performance report brings together all the information and indicators in a systematic overview (gri index) in accordance with
the guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri). for more detailed information on individual aspects, reference is made in the report to the
above-mentioned elements. the report is available in german and english. the german version is binding.

geberit’s sustainability reporting has been assessed with the gri application level “a level: gri checked” since the 2007 report. the information
disclosed within the scope of this report fulfills this maximum transparency grade set out in the gri g3 guidelines, as has been verified and
confirmed by gri, see → gri statement.

as part of sustainability reporting for 2012, geberit for the first time initiated and consulted a panel of external stakeholders. its mandate
consisted of providing feedback on the company’s sustainability strategy and reporting, as well as reviewing whether the key topics were included
in the sustainability reporting and whether the needs of the stakeholder groups were taken into consideration. the results also served as a basis
for the further development of the sustainability strategy and reporting for 2013 and are summarized here:

  → introduction to the stakeholder panel
  → members of the stakeholder panel
  → panel statement
  → response from geberit to the panel statement

the next stakeholder panel consultation is due to be carried out in 2014 and is intended to support geberit in identifying key sustainability topics
for its reporting. this forms an essential part of the transition process for implementation of the new gri g4 guidelines published in summer 2013.

1. strategy and analysis

1.1 ceo statement

for the statement of albert m. baehny, chairman and ceo, see → www.geberit.com > sustainability > ceo statement


1.2 key impacts, risks and opportunities with regard to sustainability

a sustainable corporate culture makes it possible to increase the value of the company over the long term and minimize risks for its future
development. geberit aims to be a role model and to set standards for customers, suppliers and other partners. this applies to water-saving,
sustainable products; environmentally friendly and resource-efficient production; procurement and logistics with high environmental and ethical
standards; and good, safe working conditions for the more than 6,200 committed and qualified employees worldwide. the corporate social
responsibility is realized among other things within the scope of global social projects relating to the core competence of water and is intensified
through partnerships such as that with swiss waterkiosk aimed at cleaning polluted drinking water in bangladesh. there is also a long-term
→ partnership with the swiss development organization helvetas.

the → 50th anniversary of the geberit concealed cistern is a perfect example of how long-term business success is compatible with
environmentally friendly action. this highly successful product, which has been sold over 60 million times, was a far-sighted strategic step on the
journey from a sanitary unit to the bathroom of today in its modern form. water saving through reduced flush volumes, reliable quality and comfort
for end users as well as the 25-year guaranteed spare parts availability for plumbers are all convincing aspects of a sustainable product.

sustainability means satisfying the needs of today’s generation in a manner that will ensure a solid basis for the livelihoods of future generations.
with its millennium development goals from the year 2000, the united nations aims to halve the number of people without access to clean drinking
water and sanitary facilities by 2015. this demonstrates the great importance of the topic of water for world health, world nutrition and
peacekeeping. the increase in the world’s population, migration, urbanization, climate change and natural disasters can lead to regions that are
currently well supplied with water becoming problem regions in the future. these global trends will have a significant impact on future sanitary
technology: water-saving, resource-efficient products are becoming even more important. the study published in 2013 by the european
commission on the criteria for an ecolabel aimed at reducing water consumption in european toilets was therefore broadly received and discussed.
the eu is increasingly putting water conservation on its political agenda and is developing ecolabels for efficient toilets, urinals, washbasins and
showers. as an industry leader in the area of sustainability, geberit imposes stricter standards on its products than those prescribed by the
european ecolabels. leading geberit wc flushing systems therefore already meet the requirements for this ecolabel. according to the product
classification system well (water efficiency label) for water-saving and resource-saving products introduced by the industry back in 2011, seven
out of eight certified geberit product groups are represented in the highest classification class a. the analysis of the entire value chain in the form
of a → water footprint shows that nearly 100% of the water consumption is attributable to the product usage phase. the water savings are
impressive: according to one model calculation, the entire dual-flush and flush-stop “fleet of cisterns” produced since 1998 has so far saved
around 15,800 million cubic meters of water in comparison with traditional flushing systems. in 2013 alone, the water saved amounted to
1,980 million cubic meters. this is more than half of the annual consumption of all german households.

however, the continuous reduction of the ecological footprint of geberit products goes beyond water saving. since 2007, geberit has been
implementing the → eco-design approach. this means that concepts are tested in their entirety during a product’s early development phase in
order to examine how water, energy and material consumption in the product and value chain can be optimized. at the same time, production
processes can often also be simplified and cost savings made. thanks to its pioneering work on the topic of eco-design, geberit is well equipped in
terms of possible requirements as envisaged as part of an eu ecodesign directive.

→ green building has long been more than just a trend. european standards in this area are becoming more and more important and new
standards are setting out the basic rules for environmental declarations for individual products and systems in buildings. geberit published the first
environmental product declaration for lavatory taps in 2012 and a pilot project for the systematic and simpler development of environmental
declarations and ecological product information was launched in 2013. at the same time, more and more buildings are being constructed in
accordance with voluntary sustainability standards such as dgnb, minergie, breeam and leed. investors, project developers, owners and tenants
are looking for system providers with holistic expertise regarding green building that can contribute to the respective desired standards being
fulfilled in a targeted manner. this is opening up a future market with major potential in which geberit is present with water-saving, energy-saving,
low-noise and durable products. the group is well positioned as a leading system provider of sanitary solutions in green building and plays an
active role in the relevant associations. the importance of the topic is also reflected in the increasing number of green building reference projects in
which geberit products are installed.

3.5 process for defining report content

the gri g3 guidelines serve as the basis for this report. an expansion of the materiality analysis for defining report content is planned for 2014 as
part of the switch to the gri g4 guidelines.

the “gri guidance for defining report content” and related principles have been implemented as extensively as possible. the basis for
sustainability reporting is a materiality analysis for the identification of those aspects that are of significance for geberit and its stakeholders. the
concerns of the stakeholders are addressed in the interactions and dialogs named under → 4.16.

all topics classed as significant and related measures are presented in compact form primarily within the → sustainability strategy. the aspects of
the 10 principles of the un global compact which geberit has committed itself to uphold and which are presented in the → communication on
progress un global compact are also material. in terms of completeness, all of the company’s economic, environmental or social effects that
appear to be of relevance have been included in the reporting based on the gri g3 guidelines, insofar as corresponding information was available.

as part of sustainability reporting on the 2012 financial year, geberit for the first time initiated and consulted a panel of external stakeholders. the
objective of the work performed by the external stakeholder panel was to review geberit’s sustainability strategy and reporting and support
further development. this involved analyzing whether the most important topics were included in sustainability reporting and whether the concerns
of the stakeholders were taken into consideration. in particular, the panel examined the extent to which the principles of “inclusivity” (participation
of stakeholders), “materiality” (relevance and significance to stakeholders) and “responsiveness” (response to stakeholder issues) were considered
in the reporting. the results of the stakeholder panel are presented in the → panel statement. some recommendations of the panel were already
included in the sustainability reporting for 2012. please also refer to the → response from geberit to the panel statement. they also served as a
basis for the further development of the sustainability strategy and reporting for 2013.


3.6 boundary of the report

the report covers the entire geberit group (see → 2.3, → 2.4, → 2.5 and → 2.6 ). if only part of the company is meant as an example or due to the
availability of data, this is clearly indicated.


3.7 special limitations

there are no special limitations.


3.8 joint ventures, subsidiaries, outsourced operations, etc.

there were no material changes in the group structure during the period under review which significantly influence reporting.

3.9 data measurement techniques and bases for calculations

the guidelines and assessment rules of the gri g3 standard were applied wherever the data situation permitted.

environmental area:

  all relevant environmental and occupational safety data is recorded in a group-wide software program newly implemented in 2012 and analyzed
  within the scope of the corporate eco-balance, energy master plan and geberit safety system (gss).
  the swiss ecological scarcity method (2006 version) is used as the assessment method for analyzing the environmental impact (see → dma-en).
  there are plans in 2014 to switch to the new 2013 version and the most recent data from the ecoinvent database (version 3.0).
  the calculation of the relative environmental impact and relative co2 emissions is based on currency-adjusted sales.
  the calculation of energy (see → en3 and → en4) and greenhouse gas data (see → en16) is based on the internationally recognized ecoinvent
  database (version 2.0) and the continental electricity mix for europe, the us and china. the data covers scope 1 and 2 as well as scope 3 to a
  certain extent as per the ghg protocol (see the greenhouse gas protocol (ghg) initiative – a corporate accounting and reporting standard
  (revised edition, 2004) of the world resources institute (wri) and the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd)). a separate
  life cycle assessment (lca) was drawn up for the production and use of biogas in pfullendorf (de). there are plans in 2014 to switch to the most
  recent version of the ecoinvent database (version 3.0) and the national electricity mix.
  the calculation of other air emissions (see → en19 and → en20) is based on the ecoinvent database (version 2.2), the continental electricity mix
  for europe, the us and china and also takes into account specific emission factors for diesel vehicles with particle filters. “direct emissions”
  comprise emissions from the burning of combustibles and fuels as well as the consumption of solvents. “indirect emissions” comprise emissions
  from the production of electricity. there are plans in 2014 to switch to the most recent version of the ecoinvent database (version 3.0) and the
  national electricity mix.
  since 2010, data on the transport services (intercompany and distribution) of the most important transport service providers has been recorded
  by the new logistics center in pfullendorf (de), and the environmental impact calculated along the same lines as the corporate eco-balance. in
  addition to direct emissions (emissions at the tail pipe), the assessment also includes the provision of fuel, vehicles and infrastructure. the
  ecoinvent database (version 2.1) is used as the basis for the data. the system scope has been retained for the 2013 data (see → en29).
  business flights have been recorded and included in the assessment since 2012. the flight distances are calculated according to the respective
  departure and arrival airports. the co2 emissions comprise direct and indirect emissions and are based on the ecoinvent database (version 2.2).
  the water footprint calculated since 2012 that covers the entire value chain is a simplified balance sheet based on the ecoinvent database
  (version 2.1). all water flows contained in ecoinvent except for turbine water were taken into account. the calculation includes water consumption
  for the provision of raw materials, production at geberit, use of the manufactured products (wc cisterns, urinal flush controls and lavatory taps)
  during their entire service life, and disposal.
  the co2 footprint calculated since 2012 is based on the same assumptions as the water footprint. emissions from logistics were additionally
  taken into consideration. in the usage phase, both water consumption (energy for water supply and the disposal of non-polluted waste water) and
  energy for the provision of hot water (lavatory taps) were taken into account.

employees area:
quantitative data on employees (see → employer responsibility (la)) is collected using a central management information system, with the
indicators calculated in accordance with gri standards. data collection on occupational accidents and monitoring of the long-term objectives
regarding occupational safety is carried out since 2012 using a group-wide software program as part of the geberit safety system.

additional qualitative data on the topics of “attractive employer”, “conduct with integrity”, “fair business partner”, “environmental protection” and
“product liability” are collected in accordance with gri standards by means of an annual binding survey at all geberit group companies.


3.10 effects of any restatements of information provided in earlier reports

the annual sustainability reporting for the 2006 to 2013 financial years is based on the gri g3 guidelines in force since october 2006. in this way,
geberit has developed a consistent reporting system in which individual indicators are further developed each year. if, in individual cases, a new
form of presentation, calculation method or optimized data collection has led to other results for the previous years, then this is noted as a
restatement under the respective indicator.


3.11 changes from previous reporting periods in scope, boundary or measurement methods

there were no significant changes during the reporting period with regard to scope, reporting limits or measuring methods. if, in individual cases, a
new measuring method is used, then this is noted under the respective indicator or under → 3.9.


3.12 gri content index

this extensive sustainability performance report is classified in accordance with the requirements of the gri g3 guidelines and therefore serves
simultaneously as a gri content index.

3.13 external assurance for the report

geberit did not initiate and consult a panel of external stakeholders in order to review the sustainability strategy and reporting as part of
sustainability reporting on the 2013 financial year. annual consultation is not considered necessary. the next stakeholder panel consultation is due
to be carried out in 2014 and is intended to support geberit in identifying key sustainability topics for its reporting. this forms an essential part of
the transition process for implementation of the new gri g4 guidelines. the results of the 2012 stakeholder panel consultation are presented in the
→ panel statement. in the → response from geberit to the panel statement, geberit deals in detail with the external assessment and the
recommendations contained therein.

perspective, thus enabling the company to demonstrate its performance clearly in areas also including environmental protection and sustainability.
the → sustainability strategy is examined and approved by the group executive board and the board of directors. results and the achievement of
objectives are submitted to the group executive board and board of directors for verification at least once annually. this also comprises the
→ communication on progress un global compact and the geberit compliance report, including the audit results with respect to the code of
conduct.

sustainability
sustainability performance report


the way in which the topic of sustainability is approached has been regularly reviewed within the company. for around 20 years, geberit has had an
environment/sustainability department, which has been reporting directly to the ceo for the past nine years. in recent years, this department has
coordinated the further development of the sustainability strategy and related activities, although the responsibility for planning and
implementation lies with the individual areas themselves.


4.10 processes for evaluation of the sustainability performance of the board of directors

there is no formal procedure for assessing the performance of the board of directors from an integrated sustainability perspective.

for information about the remuneration of the management bodies, see → business report > corporate governance > compensations,
shareholdings and loans.


4.11 precautionary approach

the precautionary principle plays an important role for geberit as a production company. this is defined in the → geberit code of conduct and
reflected in the integrated geberit management system (quality, environment, safety). in operations it is implemented by means of preventive
approaches for environmental protection, occupational safety and quality assurance, see → combined group certificate for quality and
environment in accordance with iso 9001 and iso 14001. in line with the “best-in-class” approach, ambitious long-term goals were drawn up at
the end of 2012. for example, by the year 2020 the aim is to reduce absolute co2 emissions by 20% compared with the base year 2000 (based on
organic growth) and to halve accident rates compared with 2010.

an extensive system for the control and management of all risks involved in business activities is in place throughout the group. for further
information, see → business report > corporate governance > board of directors > information and control instruments vis-à-vis the group
executive board.


4.12 external agreements and initiatives

geberit has been a formal member of the un global compact since october 2008 and was a founding member of the local swiss network in 2011.
the company has been a member of the transparency international organization since june 2000 and supports its objectives for combating
corruption. through the voluntary application, introduced in 2007, of the g3 guidelines of the global reporting initiative (gri) in the sustainability
report and gri report, geberit makes an active contribution towards ensuring transparency and comparability in sustainability reporting.
furthermore, the company became a member of the non-profit organization “swiss water partnership” in 2012. the goal of this platform is to bring
together all those involved in the topic of water supply (from the academic, business, public and private spheres) in order to address future
challenges in this area jointly. this partnership also aims to promote international dialog on water.


4.13 membership in associations and organizations

geberit is involved in various associations and organizations that make a contribution toward sustainability. in addition, various geberit companies
are members of national associations on topics such as environmentally friendly production, energy, waste management and employee protection.
for major commitments, see → www.geberit.com > company > sustainability > un global compact and memberships.


4.14 relevant stakeholder groups

significant stakeholder groups for geberit are customers, shareholders and analysts, banks, the media, employees, trade unions, neighbors and
municipalities, suppliers, transport companies, competitors, associations, non-government organizations and the general public, governments and
regulators, and research institutes. details on stakeholder engagement can be found under → 4.16.


4.15 basis for selection of stakeholders

systematic dialog with stakeholders helps geberit to identify possible conflict issues and opportunities for further development and to respond to
these in good time. at the national and international levels, the geberit group and the group companies maintain relations with organizations and
institutions in the respective countries that direct requests and suggestions to the company. the stakeholders listed under → 4.14 have been
identified as important for systematic stakeholder dialog as they fulfill one of two criteria: either the stakeholder group exerts a strong influence on
the economic, environmental or social performance of geberit and/or the stakeholder group is strongly affected by the economic, environmental or
social performance of geberit.


4.16 approaches to stakeholder engagement

as part of sustainability reporting on the 2012 financial year, geberit for the first time initiated and consulted a panel of external stakeholders. the
objective of the work performed by the external stakeholder panel was to review geberit’s sustainability strategy and sustainability reporting. this
involved analyzing whether the most important topics were included in sustainability reporting and whether the concerns of the stakeholders were
taken into consideration. the results of the stakeholder panel are presented in the → panel statement. in the → response from geberit to the
panel statement, geberit deals in detail with the external statement and the recommendations contained therein. the next stakeholder panel
consultation is due to be carried out in 2014 and is intended to support geberit in identifying key sustainability topics for its reporting in
accordance with gri g4.

a stakeholder analysis is performed at all production plants as part of environmental management in accordance with iso 14001. requirements
are recorded situationally in stakeholder dialogs. based on this information, geberit identifies potential for conflict or opportunities and essentially
pursues a cooperative approach in order to discuss and further develop possible measures with the stakeholders concerned.

5. economy (ec)

dma-ec management approach economy

as a key objective of the company, the economic performance of the geberit group is under the strategic control of the board of directors and the
operational management of the group executive board (aspects economic performance, market presence, indirect economic effects).

a clear business strategy and its consistent implementation are crucial for sustainable success. the focused, tried-and-tested strategy rests on
four strategic pillars:

1.   focus on sanitary technology
2.   commitment to innovation
3.   selective geographic expansion
4.   continuous optimization of business processes

for detailed explanations of the four strategic pillars, see → www.geberit.com > company > vision and strategy.

for a discussion of the economic position of the geberit group, see → business report > business and financial review.


ec1 economic performance

significant indicators for the generation and distribution of value in accordance with the gri requirements can be found in the financial report:

direct economic value added
sales and operating profit, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > income statements.


economic values passed on
  operating expenses excl. personnel expenses, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > income
  statements.
  personnel expenses, see → key figures sustainability > employees and society.
  payments to providers of capital, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > statements of cashflows.
  social commitment, see → ec8.

  investments in and divestments of property, plant and equipment, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group >
  statements of cashflows.
  share buyback, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > notes > note 22.



ec2 financial implications of climate change

climate change is influencing the availability of water resources throughout the world. in 2010, the world bank forecast that the adjustment to an
increase in temperature of the global climate of two degrees celsius between 2020 and 2050 would cost between usd 70 and 100 billion per year.
20 percent of this is attributable to water supply and flood protection measures. the fourth un world water development report published in
2012 underlines the necessity to integrate the topic of water more prominently into global governance in view of the global trends. sustainable
water use is essential for ensuring viable social and economic development around the world. water is of central importance for nutrition, health,
the environment, the economy and energy production. sensible water management therefore calls for cross-sector solutions.

these trends will determine the sanitary technologies of the future. water-saving, resource-efficient products will become increasingly important.
geberit is taking advantage of the opportunity to meet the growing worldwide demand for water-saving products and to contribute towards the
diligent handling of water, thus making a name for itself as a leader in sustainability. products classified as special water-saving products already
make a substantial contribution to group sales → business report > business and financial review > sustainability

compared to this relatively big opportunity, geberit is exposed to an average risk of natural disasters triggered by climate change which can
fundamentally affect production areas or transport areas. none of the production sites is particularly at risk in this respect. as geberit does not
operate in the classically energy-intensive industries, there are currently no special co2 regulations such as statutory emission limitations, etc. on
the other hand, geberit is indirectly affected by higher energy or raw materials prices and by generally increasing requirements in terms of energy
management. with its internal energy master plan and the measures related to its co2 strategy (see → en18), geberit is reacting proactively and is
working continuously on saving energy, improving its energy efficiency and reducing its co2 emissions. in this way, the company is saving on
energy costs and reducing the risks associated with co2 emissions.

as far as corporate risks are concerned, the audit committee of the board of directors introduced a comprehensive system for the monitoring and
management of the risks associated with the company's business activities, including the risk category co2 emissions, see → financial report >
consolidated financial statements geberit group > notes > note 4.

there is no systematic, data-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change for geberit.

ec3 scope of the organization’s defined benefit plan obligations

the geberit group sponsors defined benefit plans for its employees in switzerland, germany, austria and the us.

for more information, see
→ financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > notes > note 3 > retirement benefit plans.
→ financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > notes > note 17.


ec4 significant financial assistance received from government

significant assistance received from the public sector includes:

  for information on income taxes, see → financial report > consolidated financial statements geberit group > notes > note 26.
  because of new investments to promote the respective business location and secure jobs, geberit received government investment subsidies
  totaling approximately chf 2.15 million in the reporting year (switzerland: chf 0.65 million, germany: chf 1.5 million).
  contributions received to support training and part-time employment prior to retirement amounted to chf 0.34 million (germany:
  chf 0.07 million, austria: chf 0.2 million, us: chf 0.07 million).

the public sector is not represented on the board of directors of the geberit group.


ec5 ratio of standard entry-level wage compared to local minimum wage

geberit pays market-rate wages, taking into account local circumstances and laws. when selecting employees and determining their assignment in
the company, geberit attaches great importance to qualifications appropriate to the task description. applicable local minimum wages are well
met.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


ec6 selection of locally based suppliers

geberit pursues a procurement policy that focuses on low costs, safety and independence. before a collaboration agreement can be concluded, a
multiple-stage risk analysis and assessment including environmental and social risks is carried out for every new supplier (see also → hr2). taking
account of all aspects relevant to purchasing (guidelines in the geberit group's purchasing manual), there are no directives concerning preferential
treatment of local suppliers, especially from certain countries. however, geberit supports regional organizations for disabled persons and the
long-term unemployed (see → ec8).


ec7 procedures for local hiring

geberit has no personnel policy or employment practices providing for the preferential treatment of persons from local vicinities in connection with
the hiring of members of management boards for the respective country organizations.


ec8 investments in infrastructure and services primarily for public benefit

donations and financial contributions, including product donations, totaling chf 3.1 million (previous year chf 2.7 million) were made during the
reporting year. in addition, geberit employees contributed 1,340 hours of charitable work as part of social projects (previous year 2,335 hours).
geberit also supports facilities for disabled persons and long-term unemployed, where simple assembly and packaging work in the amount of
around chf 4.4 million was carried out in 2013 (previous year chf 4.8 million). see also → key figures sustainability > employees and society.

geberit aims to achieve sustained improvement in the quality of people’s lives through innovative solutions in sanitary technology. to this end,
various social projects are supported on site with products, know-how and financial contributions. care is taken to ensure that the topic of water
plays a central role and that the projects exhibit a substantial relationship to geberit’s core competencies and corporate culture. the focus was on
the following projects and partnerships in 2013:

  execution of a → social project in bucharest in romania: installation of sanitary facilities in a hospice for seriously ill adults and children, plus the
  voluntary care of patients (social work).
  continuation of → the partnership with helvetas (renewal of contract for three years) on the topic of clean drinking water and sanitary facilities.
  continuation of the partnership with the swiss waterkiosk foundation to clean polluted drinking water using a solar pasteurization process.
  support with products and know-how in rebuilding a sports facility for the rugby team in villa sant’angelo (it) destroyed by the earthquake in
  2009.

for more information, see → business report > business and financial review > social engagement.


ec9 indirect economic impacts

there is no systematic, data-supported analysis concerning indirect economic impacts. geberit nevertheless pursues a long-term approach in
dealings with its customers and stakeholders, thereby making a significant contribution to their economic development.




geberit annual report 2013                                                                                                                                12

sustainability
sustainability performance report

geberit sets important trends for the sanitary industry: with innovation and new products that are sold and implemented worldwide by
wholesalers, plumbers and planners and make a contribution to economic development. this is supplemented by providing training, advice and
intensive support to plumbers and planners, see → business report > business and financial review > customers. for example, this includes the
training of over 3,000 planners and plumbers in 2013 on the implementation of new drinking water directives in switzerland. furthermore, the
education of students and research on sanitary technology and sustainable construction are supported by cooperation with institutions such as
the swiss federal institute of technology (eth) in zurich (ch), the university of applied sciences rapperswil (ch) and tongji university (cn).

geberit uses its know-how to set industry-wide standards for water conservation and the relief of water and waste water systems. for example,
geberit actively worked on adapting the applicable standard for the dimensioning of waste water piping to smaller diameters. this is important so
that the full functionality of the piping system is ensured even with lower quantities of waste water. geberit also supported the launch of well
(water efficiency label), a product classification system for water-saving and resource-efficient sanitary products that was introduced in 2011.

also to be emphasized are the economic impacts on suppliers, transport companies and the local economic regions of the production sites. the
group’s cost of materials in 2013 was chf 597.2 million (previous year chf 590.7 million). geberit has relations with a total of more than 1,200
suppliers. the company does not have its own transport fleet and contracts external transport companies for logistics services. geberit places its
faith in its 17 production plants in europe, china, india and the us as well as in its logistics center in pfullendorf (de), in which it continuously
invests.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.

6. ecology (en)

dma-en management approach ecology

geberit has long stood for a high level of environmental awareness and been committed to environmentally friendly, resource-efficient production
as well as the development of water-saving and sustainable products. environmental criteria are considered in all decision-making processes. in
addition, processes are continuously being optimized so that a proven high standard is achieved which often greatly exceeds legal requirements.
geberit's environmental principles are defined in the → code of conduct.

systematic, group-wide environmental management takes center stage. this is the remit of the central environment and sustainability department
that reports directly to the ceo. guidelines and measures pertaining to all aspects of the gri environmental guidelines are coordinated here. since
1992, a network of environmental managers has been practicing active environmental protection at the production plants, thus ensuring that the
measures are implemented worldwide. for objectives and measures for production, see → www.geberit.com > sustainability > sustainability
strategy.

since the beginning of 2007, geberit has had a → combined group certificate for quality and environment in accordance with iso 9001 and iso
14001, which by now covers all production locations (with the exception of the site in india) and logistics services. this certificate is valid until
2015. the persons in charge at all locations meet at least once every year to exchange experiences and share best practice. the most recent
meeting took place in september 2013.

the preparation of an annual corporate eco-balance has been an integral part of geberit’s environmental strategy since 1991. the corporate eco-
balance covers 16 production plants worldwide, the logistics center in pfullendorf (de) and the eight largest sales companies. the → production
plant in pune (india), which commenced operations in the second half of 2013 and represents geberit’s 17th production site across the globe, will
be included in the assessment as of 2014. the corporate eco-balance enables an overall assessment of the environmental impact and its largest
contributing factors. this makes it possible to calculate the total environmental impact of the geberit group in terms of eco-points and monitor the
implementation of the environmental targets. key figures for environmental impact, energy consumption and the co2 emissions triggered by the
transport of geberit products are reported separately. the co2 emissions generated by air travel have also been recorded since 2012. in 2013, the
roll-out of the integrated management system for quality, environment, energy and safety was continued at all plants. this includes the further
implementation of the software program launched in 2012 for the group-wide monitoring of the corporate eco-balance, the energy master plan and
occupational safety. among other things, this enables energy consumption to be monitored on a monthly basis.

the absolute environmental impact for the group declined by 2.1% in the reporting year (previous year decrease of 5.1%). this is explained by
improved electricity efficiency, an increase in the share of green electricity and the use of biogas to replace natural gas. sales after currency
adjustment grew by 3.6% in the same period. the relative environmental impact with respect to sales (currency-adjusted) improved by 5.5% and
exceeded the target figure of 5%.

detailed key figures on the environmental impact are provided at → key figures sustainability > environment. longer time series are now also
provided for individual key figures.


en1 materials used

the most important materials for production are plastics, metals, semi-finished and finished products. a total of 184,216 metric tons of materials
were used in 2013 (previous year 177,762 metric tons). detailed key figures on the use of materials can be found at → key figures sustainability >
environment.

for packaging materials used, see → en27.


en2 percentage of recycled material

when estimating the share of recycled material in production, a distinction is made between external and internal sources of raw materials for
reasons of expediency.

external sources:
the share of recycled material in purchased metals is relatively high. the data is based on geberit’s product life cycle assessments for supply pipes
for buildings (2009). extrapolated, the raw material metal purchased contains around 54% or 26,000 metric tons of recycled material.

with plastics, virgin material is primarily used. the search for suitable, high-quality regranulate from external plastic waste is an integral part of
geberit’s procurement strategy. in terms of the material abs, a suitable alternative made of 100% recycled material was found. this alternative is
based on high-quality plastic waste from the electronics industry (e.g. used computer cases). according to the supplier, the manufacture of this
regranulate consumes over 80% less energy compared to the manufacture of a metric ton of new petrochemical-based plastic. furthermore,
between one to three metric tons less co2 are released into the atmosphere, depending on the material. in 2013, over 350 metric tons of abs
regranulate were used for the mounting frames for concealed cisterns. the use of plastic regranulate is to be increased further and applied to other
product areas.

internal sources:
in terms of the raw material plastic, recycled material is primarily generated internally and is ground on site or via a decentralized mill and fed back
into the process. the proportion fluctuates depending on the manufacturing process. for blow molding it is around 35%, for injection molding
around 15%, depending on product class, and for pipe extrusion around 3%. this corresponds to a total of around 7,700 metric tons.




geberit annual report 2013                                                                                                                             14

en3 direct energy consumption

geberit generally uses energy purchased externally. the direct energy carriers (scope 1) include heating oil extra light, natural gas and the fuels
diesel and gasoline. consumption of natural gas was increased by 4.8% (previous year reduction of 11.1%) and heating oil consumption was
reduced by 31.0% (previous year reduction of 39.9%). fuel consumption increased slightly by 1.6% (previous year increase of 3.8%).

since 2012, a → block heating station has been in use in pfullendorf (de). this plant was fed by 10.6 gwh of regionally produced biogas in 2013.
the electricity generated by the plant (3.9 gwh) is fed into the transmission grid and the resulting heat (4.9 gwh) can be used in production, thereby
substantially reducing the use of natural gas. the efficiency of the plant is 82%.

for detailed key figures on energy consumption, see → key figures sustainability > environment.


en4 indirect energy consumption

at geberit, only electricity consumption is significant for indirect energy consumption (scope 2), and it simultaneously represents the greatest
environmental impact. in terms of end energy, electricity consumption declined by 1.5% in spite of higher production (previous year decrease of
0.7%). the share of purchased green electricity was increased by 1 gwh to 21 gwh in 2013 and now accounts for 19% of total electricity
consumption.

since 2012, the group has also been generating electricity in a → block heating station powered by regional biogas in pfullendorf (de). this
electricity is fed into the transmission grid, with this figure amounting to 3.9 gwh in 2013. furthermore, the roof area at the plant in givisiez (ch)
was made available to an energy services provider in 2013 for the construction of a 3,050 m2 photovoltaic system with projected annual electricity
production of 0.5 gwh. however, this contribution is not included in the energy balance as the energy produced is managed by the regional energy
supplier.

for detailed key figures on electricity consumption and the electricity mix, see → key figures sustainability > environment.


en5 energy saved

important energy-saving measures in production include:

  the insulation of buildings
  the continuous modernization of the machine fleet
  increasing the efficiency of production installations
  the optimization of cooling systems through the use of natural ambient cold (free cooling)
  the improved use of waste heat (heat recovery)
  the careful use of compressed air

concrete examples show the clear efficiency gains that the reduction in relative energy consumption has been contributing to for years:

  the number of injection molding machines retrofitted or purchased new with energy-efficient drive technology was increased from 74 to 96 in
  2013, with the two chinese plants in shanghai and daishan benefiting particularly from this development. the analysis on site showed that a
  modified machine consumed an average of over 40% less energy. this measure enables the chinese plants to save approximately 2 gwh of
  electricity per year.
  replacing an old blow molding machine in pfullendorf (de) with the latest machine technology contributes to a reduction in energy consumption of
  around 0.6 gwh per year.
  a pilot project for the preheating and drying of plastic granulate was started at the same site. using the waste heat from the block heating
  station as opposed to additional heating energy enables the plant to save around a further 0.6 gwh per year.
  by carefully planning new buildings, the company is also investing in the energy-efficient infrastructure of the future. the completely → new,
  state-of-the-art factory premises currently being built in ruše (sl) are already serving as a role model in all of slovenia in the area of green
  building and production. the site’s sophisticated holistic energy concept includes the use of all waste heat from industrial processes as well as
  the complete absence of fossil fuels. the available ground water is used for cooling, while rainwater is collected and used both as fire fighting
  water and for watering the surrounding area.

although no quantitative summarized breakdown of energy savings according to the measure implemented is available, systematic energy
management has been expanded further. in 2013, work commenced on the development of a systematic energy management system at the three
sites in pfullendorf, lichtenstein and langenfeld (de) and pre-audits have already been conducted by sqs. the certification of these production
plants according to iso 50001 (energy management) is planned for 2014 within the scope of the existing integrated management system
according to iso 9001, iso 14001 and ohsas 18001.

en6 energy-efficient products

the biggest environmental contribution by the geberit products lies in the conservation of water, which indirectly also saves on energy:

  the creation of the infrastructure for drinking water supply and waste water disposal, the conveyance, processing and distribution of water and
  the subsequent purification of the waste water in a wastewater treatment plant also consume resources and energy. according to the ecoinvent
  database (version 2.1), 9.3 mj of energy are required per cubic meter of water and 0.61 kg of co2 emissions are released (reference values for
  europe).
  the → water footprint, which has been prepared since 2012, covers the entire value chain and shows that almost 100% of water consumption
  occurs during the usage of the products. the picture is similar for the co2 emissions: around 67% of the total co2 footprint occurs during usage.
  the total water savings achieved by geberit products in use throughout the world are impressive: according to one model calculation, the entire
  dual-flush and flush-stop “fleet of cisterns” produced since 1998 has saved around 15,800 million cubic meters of water to date in comparison
  with traditional flushing systems. in 2013 alone, the water saved amounted to 1,980 million cubic meters.

direct energy savings when using the products are made possible thanks to systematically improved energy efficiency. current examples include:

  with its simple, modern lines and wealth of innovative technology, the new → geberit aquaclean sela shower toilet launched in april 2013 is a
  compelling product offering a high level of convenience. in adding this model, geberit is supplementing its line of shower toilets with a complete
  solution that has been fundamentally redesigned and fits into nearly any style of bathroom. the spray functionality, which uses aerated water for
  cleaning, is the main feature of the new shower toilet. enrichment with air not only gives a pleasant feeling of cleanliness, but also reduces water
  and energy consumption. with the spray intensity at the maximum setting, just 0.5 liters of hot water are required for the entire shower
  procedure. this results in around 65% less water consumption and 33% less electricity consumption compared to the top geberit aquaclean
  8000plus model. for further information, see → business report > business and financial review > innovation.
  with the → electronic lavatory taps type 185 and 186, the company has for several years been offering environmentally friendly products for
  public facilities that reduce water consumption. the taps, which were awarded the top a category by the well water efficiency label, ensure
  economical water-saving consumption thanks to their control electronics. since spring 2012, a new generator unit has been using the energy of
  the flowing tap water to generate the required electricity, thus making the electronic taps independent of mains current or batteries.
  the → geberit actuator plate sigma70, which will be launched on the market in 2014, distinguishes itself through its refined elegance and a
  patented servo technology that does not require an external energy source due to its use of pipe pressure. thanks to this technology, a gentle
  press suffices to trigger the dual flush.



en7 reduction of indirect energy consumption

  raw materials: the eco-design workshop in product development generally pursues the approach of using as few materials as possible (see
  → en6 and → en26). no quantitative analyses on the resulting energy savings are available.
  logistics: for information on the reduction of energy consumption, see → en29.
  business trips: travel using company vehicles is covered in → en3. as part of the co2 strategy, an ambitious fuel reduction plan for new vehicles
  has been defined. the emissions caused by business trips by air travel have also been captured and calculated since 2012 (for both these figures,
  see → en18).

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


en8 water consumption

the → water footprint, which covers geberit’s entire value chain, shows that nearly 100% of water consumption is attributable to the use of the
products, while the manufacture of the products by geberit accounts for less than 0.01% of water consumption. geberit nevertheless also serves
as a role model with respect to its internal water consumption in production and goes to great lengths to further optimize its processes with
regard to water consumption every year.

geberit mainly uses fresh water from the public water system, together with well water and rainwater. thanks to targeted savings measures, the
consumption of fresh and well water has been reduced by nearly 40% since 2006 and is now leveling out at a low level. consumption decreased by
3.5% in 2013. water consumption per sales (currency-adjusted) has declined by over 50% since 2006, confirming that geberit is on track to meet
its long-term target of reducing consumption by 5% per year.

geberit also advocates the economical use of water beyond processes and products. this can be seen by its collaboration in the development of
the product classification system → well (water efficiency label) introduced in 2011, its collaboration within the standard group for the
development of the new iso 14046 water footprint standard and its active role in the dialog with stakeholders on the european ecolabel for wcs,
urinals and lavatory taps.

en10 water recycling

throughout the group, two processes are responsible for much of the water requirements:

1.   during the production of multilayer pipes in givisiez (ch), the pipes are cross-linked in autoclaves. a total of 30,670 m³ of water was used for
     this purpose in 2013. around 31% or 9,380 m³ of this is fresh water; the remaining 69% was recycled internally.
2.   newly developed products are tested at the geberit sanitary laboratory in jona (ch). the tests require some 130,700 m³ of water annually.
     only about 2% or 2,280 m³ of this is fresh water. the remaining 98% is used in a closed-circuit system. based on these two processes, the
     estimated proportion of recycled water in the geberit group is almost 55%.

en16 direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions

a comprehensive co2 footprint has been calculated since 2012. the co2 footprint covers the entire value chain – from the provision of raw
materials, the manufacturing of products at geberit, logistics and use, right through to disposal. an analysis of the co2 footprint revealed that
product use (67%) and the provision of raw materials (21%) are by far the largest sources of co2 emissions. during product use, the provision of
water, treatment of waste water and generation of hot water play a central role. production by geberit accounts for only 3% of total co2 emissions.
in a relative comparison, the transport (1%) and disposal (8%) of the products also cause fewer emissions.

co2 emissions are calculated as part of the annual preparation of the corporate eco-balance. the six leading substances as per the kyoto protocol
(co2 fossil, ch4, n2o, hfc, pfc and sf6) were used for the greenhouse gas emissions and shown as a sum parameter (co2 equivalents or simply
co2). the calculation includes both direct emissions (scope 1) from the burning of combustibles and fuels (see → en3) and indirect emissions
(scope 2) resulting from electricity consumption (see → en4). the emissions from the preparation of combustibles and fuels in the upstream chain
(scope 3) are included in the cumulative value (see → en17).

key figures on the co2 emissions are available at → key figures sustainability > environment.

in absolute terms, co2 emissions (scopes 1 and 2) decreased by 2.7% to 69,909 metric tons in 2013 (previous year 71,853 metric tons). if one
relates these emissions to sales (currency-adjusted), there is an improvement of 6.1%. at 75%, electricity consumption is by far the largest source
of co2, followed by combustibles and fuels. just the purchase of 21 gwh of green electricity in pfullendorf (de), daishan (cn), givisiez (ch) and
weilheim (de) reduces the co2 emissions by more than 12,200 metric tons.


en17 other relevant greenhouse gas emissions

other relevant greenhouse gas emissions (scope 3) result from:

  the provision of combustibles and fuels (in → en16) which accounted for some 2,000 metric tons of combustibles and around 2,250 metric tons
  of fuels in 2013.
  the raw materials used and the “gray energy” purchased along with them. this is estimated for the corporate eco-balance, and amounted to
  around 10,720 tj in 2013 (previous year 10,500 tj) and caused around 491,000 metric tons of co2 emissions (previous year 478,000 metric
  tons).
  logistics (see → en29), which caused a total of 27,483 metric tons of co2 emissions in 2013 (previous year 26,883 metric tons).
  business travel by air, which caused 829 metric tons of co2 emissions (previous year 769 metric tons).

en18 initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

under the established → co2 strategy the co2 emissions per sales (currency-adjusted) should be reduced by 5% per year on average between
2006 and 2015. with an improvement in this key figure of 6.1%, geberit outstripped this annual target in 2013 and is well on track with its strategy
(see → en16). in line with the “best-in-class” approach, ambitious long-term goals were drawn up at the end of 2012. based on organic growth, co2
emissions should be reduced by 20% by 2020 compared with the base year 2000, in line with the eu target values. in addition, the share of
combustibles from renewable sources should be increased to 25% and the share of electricity from renewable sources to 60% by 2020.

the measures for implementing the co2 strategy are based on the three pillars “energy saving”, “increased energy efficiency” (see → en5) and the
“targeted expansion of the share of renewable energy sources”. an energy master plan is being implemented in the largest plants to manage and
plan energy consumption. this provides a forward-thinking illustration of the development of energy consumption and co2 emissions. in
switzerland, geberit works with the business energy agency and has also obtained corresponding co2 certificates.

in 2013, another 2 gwh of certified green electricity was purchased by the largest production plant in pfullendorf (de), bringing the total for green
electricity to 14 gwh. the plan is to increase this by another 3 gwh in 2014. the daishan (cn) plant purchased around 2 gwh of wind energy in the
reporting year, which accounted for around 60% of the plant’s total energy consumption. in addition, the plant in givisiez (ch) converted to 100%
green electricity and purchased approximately 4.6 gwh of green electricity in 2013. in 2013, the consumption of green electricity amounted to 21
gwh (previous year 20 gwh). renewable energy sources accounted for 31% of total electricity consumption (previous year 30%). furthermore, the
roof area at the plant in givisiez (ch) was made available to an energy services provider in 2013 for a 3,050 m2 → photovoltaic instalation with
projected annual electricity production of nearly 0.5 gwh.

the share of renewable energies when it comes to combustibles is also being increased gradually. an important milestone was reached in 2012
with the commissioning of the → block heating station in pfullendorf (de), which was fed by 10.6 gwh of regionally generated biogas in 2013. this
already brought the share of renewable energies for combustibles to 21% in 2013 (target figure 25%).

the efficiency of the in-house fleet of vehicles is enhanced with a consistent purchasing policy. since early 2008, binding guidelines have applied for
the purchase of new vehicles with the goal of reducing consumption by 10% every three years until 2012. since 2013, this fuel reduction plan for
new vehicles has been increased to 5% per year to reach an emission value of 100 grams of co2/km by 2020 as targeted by the eu. at the same
time, emission-reducing measures are being implemented. currently 99% of all geberit diesel vehicles have particle filters.

geberit promotes awareness among all employees for the promotion of environmentally friendly behavior. new employees receive training on the
subject of sustainability at geberit as part of their job orientation program. in the largest plants, this is also tailored to the target group of
production employees.

all targets and measures for improving the co2 balance are disclosed in detail as part of the company’s participation in the carbon disclosure
project (cdp).


en19 ozone-depleting substances

emissions of ozone-depleting substances, measured in cfc11 equivalents, can be calculated based on the geberit group’s corporate eco-balance.
the calculation includes both direct emissions from the burning of combustibles and fuels and process emissions (solvents), as well as indirect
emissions resulting from electricity consumption.

key figures on ozone-depleting substances can be found at → key figures sustainability > environment. the increase at a very low level is due to
the increase in coolant losses.


en20 nox, sox and other air emissions

emissions of nox , so2, nmvoc (non-methane voc) and dust (pm10) can be calculated on the basis of the geberit group’s corporate eco-balance.
the calculation includes both direct emissions from the burning of combustibles and fuels and process emissions (solvents), as well as indirect
emissions resulting from electricity consumption.

key figures on these emissions are available at → key figures sustainability > environment.


en21 total water discharge

geberit does not engage in the unplanned discharge of water. all resulting domestic waste water and all process waste water is treated. in 2013,
116,719 m3 of waste water was generated (previous year 114,932 m3 of waste water). of this, 75% is domestic waste water that passes into the
communal wastewater treatment plant (previous year 65%), and 2% (previous year 12%) is domestic waste water that is pretreated and fed into
receiving waters. the remaining 23% (previous year 23%) is waste water that is pretreated and fed to a communal wastewater treatment plant.
waste water is not directly reused by third-party companies.

key figures on waste water can also be found at → key figures sustainability > environment.


en22 waste

in 2013, the total waste was 12,118 metric tons (previous year 11,460 metric tons). of this, 84% was channeled to external recycling processes
(previous year 84%). the measures focused above all on the further separation of waste and the reduction of mixed waste and hazardous waste.
the following examples show that considerable progress was made in the past few years: in weilheim (de), the manufacturing waste was reduced
by 80% in five years, mainly through the use of a new foaming facility. this pioneer project was tested and implemented in several stages. central
aspects include the use of rainwater for cleaning, which is then added to the foaming process as process water, and optimized cleaning cycles to
prevent residues in the plant.

this indicator is not relevant to geberit as no bodies of water are affected by significant water discharge from geberit facilities as defined in the gri

en26 mitigation of environmental impact of products

the basis for sustainable products is a systematic innovation process in which the most environmentally friendly materials and functional principles
possible are chosen, risks are minimized and a high level of resource efficiency is targeted for the production process as well as the product itself.
→ eco-design workshops, in which different disciplines cooperate and ensure that every new product exceeds its predecessor in environmental
aspects, are an integral part of the early development phase.

specially created product life cycle assessments are important decision-making tools for development and provide arguments for the use of
resource-efficient products. detailed life cycle assessments have already been prepared for the following products: drainage/supply pipes,
aquaclean 8000plus, electronic lavatory taps type 185/186, concealed cisterns and urinal flush control. an environmental product declaration
(epd) was issued in accordance with the new european standard en 15804 for the first time in 2012. the → epd for lavatory taps provides
relevant, comparable and verified information about the product’s environmental performance. new ways of more efficiently creating product life
cycle assessments and epds for other products are currently being sought. a pilot project for the systematic recording of environmental data at
the product level was therefore started, which should greatly simplify a further processing to epds and ecological product information. this further
supports the visible positioning of the company as a provider of system solutions in the area of green building. examples from the product range
that help to reduce the environmental impact:

  since 2011, a new technological solution has been deployed to simplify the conversion of the large flush volume on nearly all concealed cisterns
  from 6 or 9 liters to 4.5 liters. the gradual conversion of the product range is creating great potential for even more water conservation.
  the new well water efficiency label, which was introduced by the european umbrella organization for valve manufacturers (eunited) in 2011 and
  which determines the water efficiency of products in line with the european energy label, provides more transparency in the area of water
  conservation (see also → pr3). of the eight geberit product groups already certified, seven are represented in the a, one in the b class. these
  product groups account for around 20% of group sales.
  swift implementation of the european drinking water directive 98/93/ec, which is valid as of december 1, 2013 and defines a maximum allowable
  lead concentration in drinking water: in 2013, geberit adapted all components made of copper materials that come into contact with drinking
  water – some 1,800 products – to the new requirements and did so ahead of time, thus ensuring that customers with geberit products are on the
  safe side.
  the geberit sovent fitting, which facilitates an optimal layout of waste water discharge stacks in high-rises, was streamlined and optimized
  thanks to the leading know-how of geberit’s flow specialists. the new flow-optimized fitting causes the water to rotate in the discharge stack,
  which creates a continuous column of air in the center. this ensures optimum pressure compensation and increases the discharge rate by 40%,
  while at the same time taking up less space and using 45% less material. the sovent fitting also permits the use of relatively small-sized
  discharge stacks even in very high buildings.
  since 2010, eco-design has also been included in product modifications and technology projects, thus ensuring that opportunities to reduce the
  ecological footprint are always utilized to their full potential: from the end of 2013, the elements for wcs, urinals and washbasins will receive new
  halogen-free protecting hoses for the threaded rods. by replacing around 6.7 million hoses, 110 metric tons of polyvinyl chloride (pvc) can be
  replaced by 35 metric tons of environmentally friendly polyethylene (pe).

advances in the reduction of the environmental impact were not only made at product level, but also with regard to product information. from
2013, the user manuals for the shower toilet will only be provided to the main markets in five instead of 22 languages. this change, which was
initiated by environmentally conscious customers, is very effective, as it reduces paper consumption by some 19 metric tons per year.


en27 reclaimed packaging material

the following quantities are based on an internal survey at the sites: on the product side, approximately 13.3 metric tons of used products (mainly
electrical equipment) were taken back and disposed of appropriately in 2013 (previous year 7 metric tons). in some markets (de, ch), parts of the
multilayer drinking water pipes (mepla) are also taken back. the exact quantity is not known, but is estimated to be just under around 10 metric
tons group-wide (previous year 7 metric tons). in 2013, approximately 13,360 metric tons (previous year 12,320 metric tons) of packaging material
were used, over 49% (previous year 45%) of which was collected and recycled by geberit itself or by financed contract partners. the rest is
disposed of and recycled on a country-specific basis.

en28 sanctions due to non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations

no significant fines or non-monetary penalties were imposed in the reporting year.


en29 environmental impact of transport

in the area of logistics, in addition to cost effectiveness and punctuality, it is increasingly important to customers that transport services be as
environmentally friendly as possible. geberit does not maintain its own fleet of vehicles. because external logistics equates to around 35% of the
geberit group’s total environmental impact (production plants and sales companies), collaboration with the transport service providers that work
with geberit is central. partners agree to actively support geberit in its efforts to use energy and packaging material efficiently and to reduce
emissions, and undertake to provide the data needed for geberit’s environmental reporting.

the logistics calculator developed in 2010 facilitates the capture of data on the vehicle fleet composition, transportation performance and fuel
consumption of all transport service providers, as well as the preparation of the annual eco-balance. in the reporting year, the twelve largest
transport service providers handled 176.6 million ton-kilometers (previous year 169.7 million ton-kilometers). this generated 27,483 metric tons
of co2 emissions (previous year 26,883 metric tons). the increase in transport services and co2 emissions was mainly caused by the increase in
sales and the related increase in transport volumes. the share of euro 5 vehicles remains high at 87%. euro 6 vehicles (compulsory for new vehicles
from january 1, 2014) were also used for the first time. as a result, euro 5 and euro 6 vehicles account for a total of nearly 90% of the entire truck
fleet.

another important step in reducing the environmental impact is switching from road to rail. for instance, 80% of the goods transported from italy
and 50% of those transported to italy are moved by train. the use of → mega-trailers, which can carry an approximately 15% greater load volume,
also increases energy efficiency: in 2013, about 1,350 such transport runs (previous year 1,280) between rapperswil-jona (ch) and pfullendorf (de)
and around 800 transport runs (previous year 800) between pottenbrunn (at) and pfullendorf (de) were completed in this way. this translates into a
reduction of 134,000 kilometers compared with conventional transport runs. as a result, diesel consumption was reduced by 39,900 liters and
co2 emissions were lowered by 164 metric tons. geberit is also working on innovative solutions aimed at enabling a higher goods per truck ratio –
i.e. increasing capacity utilization of the transport volume.

furthermore, the pilot project with an → environmentally friendly, natural gas truck running between pfullendorf (de) and rapperswil-jona (ch)
commenced at the end of 2013. this pioneering project is being conducted in collaboration with a transport service provider and a truck
manufacturer.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


en30 costs of environmental protection

approximately chf 1.3 million was spent on environmental protection and preventive environmental management in 2013 (previous year
chf 1.2 million). this involved external advisory services and training, external certification and personnel expenditures on environmental
management activities. the costs of disposal of hazardous and other waste, in turn, amounted to approximately chf 0.6 million in 2013 (previous
year chf 0.6 million).

7. employer responsibility (la)

dma-la management approach to employer responsibility

responsibility for all important aspects of the gri guidelines with respect to labor practices at the geberit group lies with the head corporate
human resources who reports directly to the ceo.

geberit's most important ambassadors are its employees. they shape the company's image and represent geberit in their day-to-day contact with
customers and many other stakeholders. this task can only be performed by employees who are aware of what their company stands for and what
its objectives are. geberit's central corporate and brand values are defined in the → geberit compass. geberit aims to act as a role model for
ethically unimpeachable, environmentally friendly and socially responsible operations. the → code of conduct fills this objective with tangible
content and to this end serves as an authoritative source of guidance. the code applies worldwide and is available on the intranet in 14 languages.
revision of the code was started in 2013 and will be completed in 2014.

a fundamental goal is to reinforce the performance culture, increase transparency and promote talent. the standardized global performance
assessment, development and compensation process (pdc) started in 2012 was therefore continued. remuneration policies are based on
standardized job assessments and salary levels for the relevant country. a central element of the process is that several supervisors assess the
performance, development and salary of an employee together. the process is concluded with a feedback interview between the employee and
their direct supervisor. a total of around 1,000 employees or 15% of the entire workforce are involved in this pdc process.

the priority in terms of internal employee communications is for interactive, real-time communication that is accessible to all. the intranet
introduced in 2009 plays a central role here. special solutions have been developed for production employees in the form of newsletters and/or
large screens for joint use. the ceo, albert m. baehny, regularly informs the employees of the current state of the business, the economic
parameters, the future prospects and general topics of interest in videos that are accessible on the intranet as well as via electronic newsletters.
the → “geberit integrity line” that was designed in 2012 and launched on january 1, 2013 enables all employees to anonymously report internal
irregularities in their mother tongue (35 languages), thereby making an important contribution towards the upholding of high compliance standards
within the group. there were no significant incidents in 2013. the few registered complaints were all dealt with and issues were cleared up swiftly.

geberit has formulated the vision of an “accident-free company”. to meet the group’s ambitious standards, the objective is to reduce the accident
frequency rate (afr) and accident severity rate (asr) by 5% per year and thus by 50% between 2010 and 2020. for this purpose, a comprehensive
master plan for occupational safety including a package of measures for the period 2013 to 2015 has been developed and adopted. this will be
implemented and checked as part of the geberit safety system (gss). the basis for the monitoring is the monthly recording of all accidents from
january 1, 2013 onward. important elements of the geberit safety system include: a vision, safety policy and site-specific safety principles as well
as the definition of rules in the event of breaches, the development of a suitable organization structure, awareness-raising and training as well as
the planning of regular internal and external audits. the geberit safety system is to be integrated into the geberit management system by mid-
2014 and all production plants including logistics are to be certified according to ohsas 18001 in combination with iso 9001/14001 by mid-
2016. the two chinese production plants have been certified according to ohsas 18001 since 2009, the sales company in the uk since 2010, the
production plant in givisiez (ch) since 2011 and the plant in pottenbrunn (at) since 2013.

the ability to win and retain the right employees for the company is becoming more and more important for the future. employer branding is a
component of superordinate corporate branding and creates a unique employer identity. geberit continued the roll-out of its employer branding
concept in 2013 and intensified its presence at job fairs in particular. in doing so, geberit sharpened its profile as a company that offers attractive
international development opportunities at the interface between the craft, engineering and sales sectors.

la1 total workforce by employment type, employment contract, and region

the number of employees rose once again in the reporting year. at the end of 2013, the geberit group employed 6,226 people worldwide –
92 persons or 1.5% more than in the previous year. this increase is primarily due to the – to some extent temporary – adjustment of capacities in
the production plants, the start of operation at the new plant in india and the development of various emerging markets. a reduction in capacity in
the chinese plants offsets this growth slightly.

for key figures on the workforce by employment type, employment contract and region, see → key figures sustainability > employees and
society.


la2 employee fluctuation

the average fluctuation rate (in terms of employees with permanent contracts, without natural departures and long-term leaves of absence) was
4.1% (previous year 5.0%). including natural departures, it was 5.5% (previous year 6.5%). for key figures on fluctuation by age group, gender and
region, see → key figures sustainability > employees and society.

la3 benefits

geberit essentially grants the same benefits to full-time and part-time employees. however, employees with temporary contracts are not always
entitled to the same benefits as permanent employees. for example, employees in switzerland with temporary employment contracts of less than
three months are not insured in the pension fund. geberit bases its employee benefits on country-specific standards.


la4 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements

approximately 4,050 employees, and thus around two-thirds of the workforce, are currently covered by collective agreements (e.g. collective labor
agreements, wage agreements). above all in germany, austria and switzerland, over 90% of employees are governed by a collective labor or wage
agreement. there are no collective agreements with employees in the us and china (14% of all employees).


la5 notice periods regarding operational changes

apart from country-specific obligations (arising from statutory requirements or collective agreements), there are no formal rules as to when and
how often employees are to be informed. in cases of major structural changes, geberit makes every effort to involve the employees at an early
stage. the completely revamped intranet introduced in the autumn of 2009 has become a central channel for all electronic employee
communications within the group.


la6 percentage of total workforce represented in health and safety committees

each of the 17 production companies and logistics has a safety manager. wherever possible and sensible, this function is combined with that of the
environmental manager or closely linked from an organizational point of view. 96% of the employees at all production sites and 85% of all
employees worldwide are represented through an occupational health and safety panel or safety committee at their production site, in which
employer and employee representatives can discuss occupational health and safety issues. as a rule, national standards for the country concerned
are implemented.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


la7 accidents, occupational illness and lost time

the group-wide absenteeism rate for the reporting year was 4.10% (previous year 3.53%); illness-related absences accounted for 4.00% of this
rate (previous year 3.37%) and 0.10% was related to occupational accidents (previous year 0.16%). these figures are based on the hours
effectively worked. in 2013, these amounted to 10,661,572 hours (previous year 10,680,389 hours). the statistics show only those occupational
accidents that occur during working hours or business travel and lead to lost working time of more than one day. a total of 109 accidents were
recorded (previous year 125 accidents), equivalent to 1,325 lost working days due to occupational accidents (previous year 2,164 lost working
days). there were no serious or fatal accidents. employees at geberit are not exposed to a particularly significant extent with regard to
occupational illnesses. this category is therefore not covered.

furthermore, the accident frequency rate (afr) and the accident severity rate (asr) are recorded in a standardized manner. these rates are
calculated as the number of accidents or the number of lost working days per one million hours worked. the afr was 10.2 (previous year 11.7); the
asr dropped significantly to 124.3 (previous year 203). geberit is therefore back on track with regard to its long-term objective of reducing the
frequency and severity of accidents by 5% per year or by 50% between 2010 and 2020.

all key figures concerning the absenteeism rate by region can be found under → key figures sustainability > employees and society.

for the goals and measures for the enhancement of occupational safety, see → www.geberit.com > sustainability > sustainability strategy.


la8 assistance regarding serious illnesses

at geberit, there are no operational activities involving a particularly high risk of contracting a serious illness or with a high incidence of illness.

as part of its group-wide efforts to support employees’ health and well-being, geberit offers its employees precautionary healthcare opportunities
through various offers and activities. these include, for example, sports facilities, anti-smoking training, massage services, dietary and health tips,
and presentations on health-related issues. they also include reintegration counseling, which aims to get people back to work as soon as possible
in the event of long-term illness. managers are specifically trained in this respect. examples of individual support include counseling in rapperswil-
jona (ch) to assist with problems ranging from on-the-job pressure, partnership and family problems to debt issues, and the telephone helpline
created in the us to discuss problems at work in complete confidentiality.

for further information, see → business report > business and financial review > employees.


la9 health and safety topics covered in agreements with trade unions

geberit attaches great importance to a high level of health and safety for its employees. to this end, it cooperates with authorities, trade unions
and employers’ liability insurance associations on a country-specific basis. written agreements exist at all production companies and individual
sales companies with parties such as trade unions and employee representatives that normally cover topics such as personal protective
equipment, complaints procedures, regular inspections, education and further training and the right to refuse unsafe work.

la10 employee education and further training

education and further training are a central theme at the company. in the reporting year, employees across the group attended on average around
17 hours of internal and external education and further training events (previous year 17 hours). for training hours as part of the potentials
management process, see → la11.

in 2013, 234 apprentices (previous year 229) were employed. the transfer rate to a permanent employment relationship was 59%. see → business
report > business and financial review > employees.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


la11 programs for skills management and lifelong learning

for the management team, the watchword is continuous training. the goal of the potentials management process is to identify talent within the
company and support selected candidates on their way to middle or upper management, or to their first management, project management or
specialist functions. these measures are intended to ensure that at least half of the open management positions can be filled by internal
candidates. in 2013, it was even possible for 70% of all positions in group management to be filled internally (previous year 54%).

the management training program at the international institute for management development (imd) in lausanne was continued in 2013 for the
some 160 members of group management and the geberit group companies worldwide. the course’s key topics include strategic management,
leadership and finance. as of the end of 2013, 130 members of group management had completed this program. see also → business report >
business and financial review > employees.


la12 performance and career development of employees

in everyday working life, the personal and professional development of each individual employee is encouraged in a variety of ways. this covers all
areas of work, functions and age groups. around 93% of all employees received appraisal interviews in 2013, and around 59% had objective-
agreement meetings at which development opportunities were also identified and discussed.


la13 workforce diversity

the proportion of female employees at the end of 2013 was 31% (previous year 31%), and for senior management this figure was 6.5% (previous
year 6.5%). the board of directors consists of six men.

for key figures on diversity in terms of gender and age structure, see → key figures sustainability > employees and society.

no further data on minority group membership is currently being collected as geberit and its stakeholders do not consider this to be relevant.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.


la14 gender-based differences in salaries

protection of the principles of equality is anchored in the → geberit code of conduct. this includes the prohibition of discrimination against any
employee on the basis of gender. according to the annual binding survey of all geberit group companies, no differences between the basic salaries
of women and men exist anywhere within the group. fair and equal pay for women and men is guaranteed as follows:

  determination of salaries primarily according to function, evaluated in accordance with the proven hay method. a score is calculated based on
  the assessment criteria know-how, problem-solving and accountability. the resulting number of points is the basis for determining the salary.
  this guarantees fair salary structures irrespective of gender.
  binding wage agreements with set pay grades at many geberit sites.
  an in-depth investigation carried out at four production companies in 2011 revealed no differences between the salaries of men and women. the
  investigation covered the pay levels of production employees within an established site in employee-friendly germany, at a production site of
  many years’ standing in slovenia and at the two chinese sites where employee protection and fair wages are largely the responsibility of the
  company itself.

8. human rights (hr)

dma-hr management approach to human rights

in terms of information, the promotion of awareness and controlling, human rights issues related to the business activities of the geberit group are
the responsibility of corporate human resources for internal topics (equal treatment, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining)
and of corporate purchasing with regard to procurement practices.

the → geberit code of conduct is authoritative in the area of human rights, among other things stipulating the exclusion of child and forced labor.
compliance with the code of conduct is monitored as part of a binding annual survey of all geberit group companies.

long-term cooperation, reciprocal commitment, sustainability and social responsibility are important guidelines for geberit. these acquire
particular importance in the procurement of raw materials, semi-finished products, finished products and services. the high standards with respect
to fair business practices, environmental protection and safe working conditions are therefore also expected from suppliers. the → code of
conduct for suppliers applies to all geberit suppliers worldwide. verification is the responsibility of corporate purchasing.

with respect to measures and objectives regarding the code of conduct and procurement, see also → www.geberit.com > sustainability >
sustainability strategy.


hr1 human rights aspects in investment agreements

there are no significant investment agreements which include human rights clauses or which have been audited in terms of human rights aspects.
agreements with suppliers include human rights clauses which must be audited and upheld by geberit suppliers, see → hr2.


hr2 screening of suppliers with regard to human rights aspects

with respect to human rights violations, the greatest risk lies with suppliers, who can only be influenced indirectly. geberit does all it can to
minimize this risk and requires its business partners and suppliers to comply with comprehensive standards, above all with respect to consistent
environmental protection, socially acceptable working conditions and fair business practices.

at the end of 2007, a → code of conduct for suppliers was introduced for the first time which is geared, among other things, to the principles of
the united nations global compact. upon request by geberit, the supplier must prepare corresponding records in order to demonstrate
compliance with the standards of the code and make these available at any time. should the supplier fail to comply with the regulations set out in
this code, then corrective measures are taken wherever possible. failure to comply on the part of the supplier is regarded as a serious obstacle to
the continuation of the business relationship. if the supplier does not correct this non-compliance, geberit can terminate the cooperation. as of the
end of 2013, 701 suppliers had signed the code of conduct (previous year 671). this is equivalent to 95% of the total procurement value (previous
year 95%), thereby meeting the target value of 95% for 2013. among the top 200 suppliers, the share of companies that have signed is 99%
(previous year 99%). the code of conduct is binding for each new supplier.

in the interests of the systematic planning and performance of audits, which are generally conducted every three years, the existing risk
management approach was further developed in 2012 based on the division of suppliers into risk classes – depending on production location
(country) and production processes. in the reporting year, 40 companies were identified in the highest risk category. this is equivalent to less than
5% of the entire procurement value. to ensure neutrality and the expertise required for the audits, geberit also works with an external partner. in
china, the carrying out of audits by independent experts has proven effective. performing such audits makes an important contribution to
enhancing credibility in supplier management. any shortcomings exposed by audits give rise to sanctions. as a rule, a deadline is imposed for
remedying the situation. for example, shortcomings were revealed at three chinese suppliers in 2013, primarily in the areas of occupational safety,
working hours and remuneration. action plans were agreed upon with these three companies, the implementation of which will be checked and
demanded during a re-audit in 2014.

only in a few justified exceptional cases are there plans to impose complete regulations on the second tier and third tier in the supply chain by
getting them to sign a code of conduct, as this would result in a disproportionately high level of additional administration with little added benefit.
geberit pursues a pragmatic yet effective approach. when auditing suppliers in the highest risk category, an analysis of their most important
suppliers is included in the risk analysis and the audit investigations on site. at the end of the day, geberit’s goal is modern supplier management,
where the relationship with the supplier is actively managed and sustainability risks in the supply chain are jointly analyzed.

for further information, see → business report > business and financial review > logistics and procurement.


hr3 human rights training for employees

in 2008, more than 98% of all employees received training on the topics contained in the → geberit code of conduct. the code applies worldwide
and is available on the intranet in 14 languages. since 2009, all new employees have been receiving training in the code as part of their induction,
with media such as training films developed especially for this. all employees worldwide have access to the code of conduct via the intranet. in
addition, since 2012 contributions toward increasing awareness of the geberit code of conduct have been published on the intranet. for further
details, see → so3.

this information partially covers the requirements of the gri indicator.

hr4 cases of discrimination

the code of conduct forbids discrimination as defined in the ilo core labor standards. compliance with the code is verified annually as part of a
binding group-wide survey. in addition, the “geberit integrity line” allows all employees to anonymously report irregularities such as discrimination
in their mother tongue (35 languages). there was one case of workplace bullying in 2013, which led to the dismissal of the person responsible.


hr5 guarantee of freedom of association and collective bargaining

employees are completely free to join trade unions, associations and similar organizations. no rights with respect to exercising freedom of
association or collective bargaining as defined in the ilo core labor standards are subject to restriction at the geberit group.


hr6 risk of and precautionary measures against child labor

geberit’s exposure with respect to child labor is considered low because of its industry and the countries in which business activities are carried
out as well as its high quality requirements. geberit commits itself to the protection of human rights in its code of conduct. child labor is
categorically rejected. according to the annual, binding group-wide survey there were no cases of child labor revealed in 2013. there were likewise
no such cases arising during the audits carried out at suppliers. the basic principles set out in the code of conduct for suppliers explicitly include
compliance with the ilo core labor standards for the exclusion of child labor.


hr7 risk of and precautionary measures against forced labor

geberit’s exposure with respect to forced labor is considered low because of its industry and the countries in which business activities are carried
out as well as its high quality requirements. geberit commits itself to the protection of human rights in its code of conduct. forced labor is
categorically rejected. according to the annual, binding group-wide survey there were no cases of forced labor revealed in 2013. there were
likewise no such cases arising during the audits carried out at suppliers. the basic principles set out in the code of conduct for suppliers explicitly
include compliance with the ilo core labor standards for the exclusion of forced labor.


hr8 human rights training for security personnel

at its production sites in europe, the us and china, geberit is not confronted with the need for special security measures that increase the risk of
human rights violations. to date, this problem has therefore not been relevant to geberit within the scope of its global activities.


hr9 violation of rights of indigenous peoples

to date, this problem has not been relevant to geberit within the scope of its global activities.

9. community (so)

dma-so management approach society

the corporate departments environment and sustainability (community aspect) and legal services (corruption, anti-competitive behavior,
compliance with other basic laws) are responsible for questions of social responsibility related to the business activities of the geberit group.

both internally and externally, geberit places great value on dialog. the suggestions and needs of the local stakeholders are recorded at all
production sites in order to counter potential problems such as noise emissions and exploit opportunities for cooperation. thus, for example, a
→ round table with regional farmers served to reach agreement on guidelines for the generation of biogas for the pfullendorf (de) production site.
the introduction of a → stakeholder panel is another important measure aimed at integrating the perspectives of stakeholders. following on from
the first panel in 2012, the next stakeholder panel consultation is due to be carried out in 2014.

geberit aims to be a model of ethical, environmental and socially responsible operations. the → geberit code of conduct is the definitive guide for
conduct with integrity in the corporate environment. for instance, fair competition throughout the world is an important principle here. cartels of
any kind and other competition-distorting activities are rejected. as a member of transparency international switzerland, geberit is committed to
high standards in combating corruption. there are clear guidelines for the purposes of prevention and employees receive continuous training in this
area. compliance with the guidelines is monitored as part of an annual binding survey at all geberit group companies (see the individual indicators
for the results). internal auditing is supplemented by on-site audits. in the event of misconduct, corrective measures are taken.

key areas are focused on during training on compliance. in 2013, comprehensive training on antitrust legislation via an e-learning program was
carried out as planned at the sites in china, india, south africa, southeast asia, australia and the usa. during this training, the respective members
of management and the field service employees were brought up to the same level of knowledge and prepared for the market challenges. as in
2011, all sites in europe will take part in the updated e-learning program in 2014.

with respect to measures and objectives in the code of conduct, see also → www.geberit.com > sustainability > sustainability strategy.


so1 impact on the community and public interests

the potential for conflict with public interests in the vicinity of geberit sites is generally regarded as low. as part of environmental management in
accordance with iso 14001, a stakeholder analysis is performed at all production sites. based on this analysis, the effects of the business activities
and production on local communities and regions are assessed.

geberit maintains good relations with its neighbors and carries out appropriate measures at its sites: for example, open days, involvement in
associations, etc.

for further information, see → 4.16 and → 4.17.


so2 analysis of business units for risks of corruption

according to the annual binding survey carried out at all geberit group companies, there were no cases of corruption in 2013.

the topic of corruption is also a component of the audit program for the periodic inspections of the production plants and sales companies by the
internal audit department. various audit activities and interviews are carried out as part of these inspections. the annual audit planning of the
internal audit department is oriented to risks. each company is audited at least every four years, or more frequently if it has a heightened risk
profile. in 2013, the internal audit department audited a total of 16 companies. this represent approximately one-third of all geberit companies. in
addition, approximately three to four in-depth audits are carried out each year, whereby the audit focus is on the processes of group-wide
functions (e.g. purchasing, it, etc.). no cases of corruption were discovered in 2013.


so3 training on anti-corruption policies

in 2008, more than 98% of employees were informed of and trained in the code of conduct. with the aid of short films (“animatics”), the training
focuses on gray areas in four topics of relevance: bribery (corruption), sexual harassment, workplace bullying and it misuse. in 2013, as before, new
employees were also trained accordingly as part of the welcome events. in addition, since 2012 contributions toward increasing awareness of the
geberit code of conduct have been published on the intranet.

to raise awareness on the topic of compliance, a “corporate compliance info letter” was sent to all managers on management levels 1 to 3 in
2013 for the first time. this letter contained information on the latest developments in case law, legislation and practice in the areas of antitrust
legislation, product liability and corruption.


so4 actions taken in response to incidents of corruption

no measures were necessary, as no cases of corruption were revealed in 2013.


so5 political positions and exercise of influence

as a rule, geberit does not issue political statements and does not involve itself in political lobbying.

10. product responsibility (pr)

dma-pr management approach to product responsibility

at geberit, product responsibility lies with several corporate departments: customer health and safety with product development and quality
management, product labeling and services, advertising and customer data with marketing, and compliance with statutory requirements with legal
services.

for geberit, high quality standards mean fulfilling customers’ requirements in terms of functionality, reliability and application safety to the greatest
possible extent. the company is guided by the zero-error principle. corporate quality management is responsible for ensuring that suitable
framework conditions promote a quality culture throughout the company, and that all employees act in a quality-conscious and independent
manner.

products undergo a defined optimization process from the first draft. product development is responsible for ensuring that the products
developed are safe and user-friendly, and that they comply with all standards and statutory requirements. as an independent department, quality
management is responsible for defining, arranging and monitoring all necessary inspections to ensure that these requirements are met. a clear
organizational distinction is drawn between development and quality management. in addition, many products are also examined by external
authorization bodies.

following market launch, an efficient handling of complaints with integrated error analysis, the initiation of sustained corrective measures and the
continuous development of concepts for customer support takes place in cooperation with sales, production and development. geberit has
achieved a high standard in the processing of complaints, and reacts directly and in a solution-oriented manner in each individual case.

when it comes to training its employees on geberit products, competition, standards, industry or core topics, geberit relies on a bundle of
measures: these include a group-wide e-learning platform rolled out in the fall of 2012 as well as global product training by specially trained
instructors.


pr1 health and safety impact along the product life cycle

generally speaking, geberit products and services involve low risks for customers in terms of health and safety. geberit nevertheless adopts a
preventive approach within the scope of its comprehensive quality planning in order to test and ensure the health and safety requirements of all
products from development to certification, through manufacture and storage, to use and disposal. among other things, quality and safety
management include an fmea (failure mode and effects analysis) as a precautionary measure to prevent errors and increase the technical reliability
of products. eco-design workshops are held in the course of product development in order to optimize the use of suitable and ecological materials.
if the products or their use involve an increased risk to health or safety, geberit’s technical editorial staff ensures that this is communicated
appropriately to customers (see → pr3).


pr2 non-compliance with health and safety regulations

throughout the group, there have been no court judgments or warnings against geberit involving contraventions of regulations on the health and
safety of products and services or product and service information.


pr3 product labeling

most of the installation instructions are non-verbal, consisting of detailed illustrations in order to provide the most important customer-relevant
information. for all products that involve the use of electricity, gas or dangerous substances, comprehensive instructions regarding target group,
qualifications, use, maintenance, safety, disposal and constituent materials are provided and translated into all languages required in the respective
markets. where possible, all plastic components feature material labeling in order to facilitate recycling.

the well label (water efficiency label) introduced in 2011 by the european umbrella organization for valve manufacturers (eunited) is intended to
address the growing environmental awareness of consumers. it takes its direction from the well-known and well-established energy labels for
electrical household appliances and fulfills a similar function. well provides consumers with information about a product’s water efficiency at a
glance. the new classification system will also encourage responsible use of water as a resource. in 2013, eight geberit product groups
(comprising over 370 sales products) bore the well label, seven of which are represented in the top a class and one in the b class.

geberit was involved in the revision of sia recommendation 493 (“declaration of environmental attributes of building products”) from the swiss
society of engineers and architects (sia). this recommendation defines which attributes have to be declared for various building product groups
and is thus – similar to environmental product declarations (epd) – an important instrument for green building in switzerland.


pr4 non-compliance with labeling requirements

in the reporting period, there were no known cases of violation of applicable laws or voluntary codes.

a high degree of customer satisfaction in the regional markets is central to geberit’s success. of particular importance in 2013 was the new cross-
media geberit aquaclean advertising campaign in a total of eleven markets – including italy and poland for the first time. the geberit aquaclean
sela shower toilet was also introduced at the start of the new geberit aquaclean campaign. water is the key element of this campaign. brand
tracking studies for end users were carried out in all eleven markets where the campaign took place in 2013. in addition to sociodemographic data,
the studies also provided information on the respective awareness of the shower toilet product category, attitude and behavioral parameters, and
also the perception of the geberit aquaclean brand and the most important competitors. in all affected markets, the awareness of the product
category and the perception of the geberit aquaclean brand in particular have significantly increased since the start of the campaign – and the
upward trend shows no signs of abating. the study reflects the success of market cultivation and the campaign in the individual markets. the
intensive branding is thus proving a significant success factor for company growth.

the → ”geberit challenge” took place in switzerland, finland and twice in the united kingdom in 2013. garnering much media attention, the best
team of plumbers in each of these countries was chosen by geberit. the challenge was most popular in finland, where 850 participants were
registered. the geberit challenge was awarded the → “xaver” in 2013, the swiss event industry’s most important award. the format won over the
independent jury and stole the show from other high-profile competitors.

in recent years, geberit has built up a standardized customer relationship management (crm) process for all markets with the aim of further
boosting customer satisfaction. thanks to this system, which is specially tailored to geberit, customers benefit from more targeted
communication with the relevant contact persons. from 2014, the crm system will be gradually migrated to a new technological platform to
enable a deeper integration into daily business processes.
