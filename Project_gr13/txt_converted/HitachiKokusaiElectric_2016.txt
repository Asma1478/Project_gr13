         compliance with the fluorocarbons emission control law
         (production sites of the company and its group companies in japan)

      in april 2015, the fluorocarbons emission control law entered
     into force to limit emissions of fluorocarbons into the atmosphere.
     fluorocarbons deplete the ozone layer and contribute to global
     warming. the law requires users of commercial air-conditioning
     and refrigeration units using fluorocarbons to conduct simple
     inspections of the units and submit a report concerning the
     amount of fluorocarbons released.
      production sites of the company and its group companies
     in japan use commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration
     units. to comply with the requirements of the law, they, as
     managers of these units, identified all the units subject to the
     law and created a list before the law came into effect. they
     also conduct simple and periodic inspections and record the
                                                                                                                                                workers conducting simple

         receiving the fiscal 2015 green 21 awards excellence prize in the green curtain category
      the hitachi group has established the green 21 awards
     program to encourage environmental activities and disseminate
     best practices throughout the group. the awards honor
     advanced environmental initiatives, environmentally friendly
     products/services, and environmentally conscious business
     sites within the group. from fiscal 2015, green curtain project
     achievements, which had previously been recognized separately,
     were included as a new category at the green 21 awards.
                                                                                green curtain within the toyama technology
      as one of our summer power-saving measures, our group                     & manufacturing center
     promoted a green curtain project, under which our business
     sites and group companies worked independently on green
     curtain activities. since fiscal 2014, however, our group has
     worked as one to further improve green curtain activities. our
     activities include donating goya seedlings to local preschools,                                                                         certificate of commendation

realizing high throughput
■ batch thermal process system
 to meet the market needs for lower cost of ownership (coo)* and higher process quality
for next-generation devices, a new eco-friendly batch thermal process system has been
developed. the new system realizes high-quality batch thermal processing by further
enhancing the already high productivity and high reliability, which are the major advantages
of the vertical system, and by applying a new film-forming technology.
 while maintaining a footprint (the area occupied by a machine) equal to that of the
conventional vertical system, this new system has increased the throughput (number of
wafers that the system can process within a given amount of time) by about 30% and has
significantly reduced power consumption per wafer. it has done this by adopting a long,
high-speed temperature control furnace and wafer buffer shelf to increase the maximum
throughput as well as a high-speed wafer transfer robot to shorten the wafer transfer time.
 compared with the conventional vertical system (quixace-ultimate, released in fiscal
2010), this new system reduces co2 emissions by 21%.
* cost of ownership (coo) : all costs necessary for introduction, operation and management of a system                      batch thermal process system

  hc-ip3100hd ”electric network dome camera for
■“
    outdoor use
 the hc-ip3100hd is a surveillance camera equipped with an electric zoom lens, an
electric camera platform, and a live full-hd image transmission function to meet the needs
of the surveillance video market for image signal digitization and full hd (1920 x 1080)
compatibility.
 while maintaining the same size as the existing camera, the hc-ip3100hd achieves high
resolution by digital image processing. moreover, thanks to the power-saving technology
incorporated in the electric camera platform, the hc-ip3100hd reduces power consumption
so that it can be powered through a lan cable with poe+* technology (ieee802.3at
compliant).                                                                                                                         hc-ip3100hd

       in addition to making corporate donations, our company solicits
      donations from employees to support the people and areas affected
      by the kumamoto earthquake, which occurred in april 2016.
       in may, a series of scandals related to corporate social responsibility
      were reported in the media, causing us on the editorial team to
      often pause in our work and ponder for a while, before continuing
      with renewed determination.
       we have been familiar with the term“csr”for the last 10 years.
      however, each person has a different viewpoint and attitude toward
      csr, and its breadth of scope and depth of content seem boundless,
      ranging from social contributions through business activities to risk
      management and volunteerism. once a year, we report the major
      csr activities of the group, focusing on the activities undertaken in
      the previous fiscal year. we invite you to read through this english
      version of the csr report and fill in and send back the questionnaire
      to help us understand your opinions and suggestions.
