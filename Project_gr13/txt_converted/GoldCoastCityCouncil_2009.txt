              ment of how our activities have fulfilled our strategic objectives for
              a sustainable economy, environment and community.
              progress is measured both quantitatively and qualitatively against de-
              sired outcomes and performance measures for each of the 17 strategic
              priorities. this performance measuring and monitoring is the catalyst
              for continuous improvement in service delivery.
              it is important to note that many of our goals are beyond council’s
              direct control, although evaluating how our efforts contribute to
              community outcomes is a key input into future planning.

  control objectives for information and
 related technology (cobit) framework
 the annual independent review against the well recognised control
 objectives for information and related technology (cobit) framework
 has shown that movement towards the desired maturity status is
 evident across all principles. significant progress in addressing previ-
 ous audit actions also has been made, with all of the previous nine
 outstanding actions having been addressed. the independent review
 of the information management processes identified good progress
 against the maturity model established in 2006. this is due largely to
 the implementation of the electronic document and records manage-
 ment solution (ispot) across council, wider corporate access to the
 electronic system and the rollout of record keeping/ispot training.
