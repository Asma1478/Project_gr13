to hold a series of events to mark these momentous
events and our shareholders and loyal guests will be duly

several capital projects to stimulate the economy. once
the business environment in the country is more

hotels despite the strong economic headwinds. the
upgrade of transcorp hilton abuja is underway in
harmony with our commitment to stakeholders to build
africa's choice hospitality assets. the company also
received several awards in recognition of its relentless
focus to delivering the ultimate guest experience. and
most importantly, the company surpassed its nancial
targets during the year, in the midst of biting stagnation.

vision into reality. our regulators have also provided
invaluable oversight. with our professional board

d
       istinguished ladies and gentlemen, it
       is with great delight that i welcome
       you to the 3rd annual general
meeting of your company, transcorp
hotels plc. below are the nancial and
operating results for the year ended
31st december 2016.

economic and sectoral overview

transcorp hotels delivered a resilient performance even
in the face of the impact of economic recession in the
hospitality industry which has seen occupancy for large
hotels drop below 35% on the average.

transcorp hotel's position as the major destination in
abuja has seen her benet from trafc of high prole
state visits as well as hosting numerous marquee
private and public sector events in 2016.

operating results and financial performance review

revenue
gross revenue for the year was n14.6billion (2015:
n13.4billion). this was driven by certain key events
including visits by very high prole guests, many
foreign heads of governments and representatives of
various consulates. a number of annual general
meetings (agms) were held by several blue chip
companies, and we also recorded visits by the ceos
of world football governing body (fifa) and many
fortune 500 ceos and their equivalents. revenue also
improved due to aggressive business development
through market segmentation and competitive rates
for rooms, food and beverage and corporate events.

prot
the company's gross prot was n11billion
(2015:n10.3billion). this improvement was due to higher
revenue. prot before tax was n5.2billion (2015:
n5.5billion) while the company's prot after tax for the
year was n3.7billion (2015: n3.6billion). this is in spite of the
reduction in the number of rooms and escalating cost of
operation.

balance sheet
the company has maintained a stable balance sheet
consistent with the prior year. total assets was n88billion (2015:

report

transcorp hotels plc (“the company”) places great importance on maintaining high standards of corporate

and effectiveness without any compromise.

the board is responsible for embedding high standards of corporate governance across the company. they ensure
that management implements adequate policies, procedures and systems to produce an efciently functioning
company, geared towards the creation and sustenance of shareholder and other stakeholder value.
during the year ended december 31, 2016, the company complied with the provisions of the code of corporate
governance issued by securities & exchange commission (sec), as well as its internal corporate governance
policies.

1.       overview

         the board performs certain of its functions through its committees whose terms of reference are spelt out in
         the board and committees governance charter. the delegation of these functions does not in any way
         mitigate or dissipate the discharge by members of their duties and responsibilities.

         the following committees exist in the company: the nomination and governance committee (ngc), the
         finance and investment committee (fic), the board sub-committee on audit (bsca) and the statutory
         audit committee (sac).

         our existing corporate governance policies approved by the board of directors remained operational
         throughout the period under review and additional policies (whistleblowing policy, code of conduct, and
         revised board remuneration policy) were formulated or revised and approved.

         the following are details of some policies that promote good corporate governance in the company:
         · governance framework
            this framework explains the governance policies applicable to the company's businesses. it provides for
            policy development and application, policy classication, review and revision as well as policy

         ·   board and board committees governance charter

             responsibilities of the board, each committee, non-executive directors, ceo, executives and company
             secretary. it also provides for tenor, meetings, quorum, proceedings, appointments, and the overall
             governance framework for the board, board committees and members. the functions and proceedings
             of the sac are governed by the provisions of the companies and allied matters act, cap c20, laws of
             the federation of nigeria, 2004 (cama).

         ·   executive management charter
             this charter provides for the executive management committee (emc) of the company – its
             composition, role, terms of reference, proceedings and general governance framework for
             management.

         ·   code of conduct

             the policies and procedures to be followed on anti – corruption, conict of interest, anti –
             bribery/improper payments, money laundering, terrorism nancing and insider trading (black out

             this code.

1       general information

         transcorp hotels plc was incorporated on 12 july 1994 in nigeria under the companies and allied matters act
         as a private limited liability company, and is domiciled in nigeria. the company is engaged in the hospitality
         industry; particularly the rendering of hotel services.

         the company owns and operates transcorp hilton hotel abuja. the hotel which is situated in abuja provides

         the company's registered ofce is 1 aguiyi ironsi street, federal capital territory, abuja, nigeria.

2       summary of signicant accounting policies

2.1     basis of preparation
         the nancial statements have been prepared in compliance with the companies and allied matters act
         (cama) and in accordance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs) and interpretations
         issued by the ifrs interpretations committee (ifrs ic) applicable to companies reporting under ifrs. the
         nancial statements comply with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board (iasb).

         the preparation of nancial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting
         estimates. it also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the group's
         accounting policies. the areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
         assumptions and estimates are signicant to the nancial statements are disclosed in note 6.

         the preparation of nancial statements, in conformity with ifrs, requires the directors to make estimates and
         assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the nancial statements
         and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. although these estimates
         are based on the directors' best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may
         differ from those estimates.

         the nancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the fair value basis applied
         to certain property, plant and equipment, investment properties and intangible assets. these assets are
         subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation except for investment properties which are
         revalued annually.

         the nancial statements are presented in nigerian naira being the functional currency of the primary
         economic environment in which the company operates and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand
         (n'000), except when otherwise indicated.

2.1.1   going concern
         the nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. the directors have no doubt that
         the company would remain in existence for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

2.1.2   changes in accounting policy and disclosures

         (a) new and amended standards adopted by the group
         the group has applied the following standards and amendments for the rst time for their annual reporting
         period commencing 1 january 2016:

         clarication of acceptable methods of depreciation and amortisation – amendments to ias 16 and ias 38.

         annual improvements to ifrss 2012 – 2014 cycle, and

         disclosure initiative – amendments to ias 1.

         the adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current period or any prior period and is
         not likely to affect future periods.

         other standards, amendments and interpretations which are effective for the nancial year beginning on 1
         january 2016 are not material to the group.

         (b) new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
         certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31
         december 2016 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the group. the group's assessment
         of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below.

          title of standard   ifrs 9 financial instruments

          nature of           ifrs 9 addresses the classication, measurement and derecognition of nancial assets and
          change              nancial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for
                              nancial assets.

          impact              while the group has yet to undertake a detailed assessment of the classication and
                              measurement of nancial assets, debt instruments currently classied as available-forsale
                              (afs) nancial assets would appear to satisfy the conditions for classication as at fair value
                              through other comprehensive income (fvoci) and hence there will be no change to the
                              accounting for these assets.
                              the other nancial assets held by the group include:
                              i) equity instruments currently classied as afs for which a fvoci election is available
                              ii) equity investments currently measured at fair value through prot or loss (fvpl) which would
                              likely continue to be measured on the same basis under ifrs 9, and
                              iii) debt instruments currently classied as held-to-maturity and measured at amortised cost
                              which appear to meet the conditions for classication at amortised cost under ifrs 9.
                              accordingly, the group does not expect the new guidance to have a signicant impact on the
                              classication and measurement of its nancial assets.
                              there will be no impact on the group’s accounting for nancial liabilities, as the new
                              requirements only affect the accounting for nancial liabilities that are designated at fair value
                              through prot or loss and the group does not have any such liabilities. the derecognition rules
                              have been transferred from ias 39 financial instruments:
                              recognition and measurement and have not been changed.
                              the new impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on
                              expected credit losses (ecl) rather than only incurred credit losses as is the case under ias 39. it
                              applies to nancial assets classied at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fvoci,
                              contract assets under ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers, lease receivables, loan
                              commitments and certain nancial guarantee contracts. while the group has not yet
                              undertaken a detailed assessment of how its impairment provisions would be affected by the
                              new model, it may result in an earlier recognition of credit losses.
                              the new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in
                              presentation. these are expected to change the nature and extent of the group’s
                              disclosures about its nancial instruments particularly in the year of the adoption of the new
                              standard.


                                                                              transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016              51

         title of standard   ifrs 9 financial instruments (cont’d)


         mandatory           must be applied for nancial years commencing on or after 1 january 2018.
         application         based on the transitional provisions in the completed ifrs 9, early adoption in phases was only
         date/ date of       permitted for annual reporting periods beginning before 1 february 2015.
         adoption by         after that date, the new rules must be adopted in their entirety.
         group               the group does not intend to adopt ifrs 9 before its mandatory date.


         title of standard   ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers

         nature of           the iasb has issued a new standard for the recognition of revenue. this will replace ias 18 which
         change              covers contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covers construction contracts.

                             the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or
                             service transfers to a customer.

                             the standard permits either a full retrospective or a modied retrospective approach for the
                             adoption.



         impact              management is currently assessing the effects of applying the new standard on the
                             group’s nancial statements and has identied the following areas that are likely to be
                             affected:
                             i)accounting for the customer loyalty programme – ifrs 15 requires that the total consideration
                             received must be allocated to the points and goods based on relative stand-alone selling prices
                             rather than based on the residual value method; this could result in different amounts being
                             allocated to the goods sold and delay the recognition of a portion of the revenue.

                             ii) accounting for certain costs incurred in fullling a contract – certain costs which are currently
                             expensed may need to be recognised as an asset under ifrs 15, and

                             iii) rights of return – ifrs 15 requires separate presentation on the balance sheet of the right to
                             recover the goods from the customer and the refund obligation.

                             at this stage, the group is not able to estimate the impact of the new rules on the group’s nancial
                             statements. the group will make more detailed assessments of the impact over the next twelve
                             months.


         mandatory           mandatory for nancial years commencing on or after 1 january 2018. expected date of
         application         adoption by the group:
         date/ date of       1 january 2018.
         adoption by
         group



       there are no other standards that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material
       impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.

2.2   consolidation
       (a) subsidiaries
       subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has control. control
       exists when the group has power over the investee, is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its
       involvement with investee, and has the ability to use its power to affect the returns. subsidiaries are
       accounted for at cost in the separate nancial statements of transcorp hotels plc. in the consolidated
       nancial statements, subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the
       group. they are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

       business combination
       the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. the consideration
       transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to
       the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. the consideration transferred
       includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and the
       fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

       identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are
       with limitations, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. the group recognises any non-
       controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the present
       ownership instrument's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree's identiable net assets
       for components that are present and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the events
       of liquidation. all other components of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value.

       acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

       if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's
       previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains
       or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in prot or loss.

       any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition
       date. subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or
       liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in prot or loss or as a change to other comprehensive
       income.

       contingent consideration that is classied as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is
       accounted for within equity.

       the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and
       the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the
       identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

       if the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest
       measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain
       purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.

       inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies
       are eliminated. unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
       impairment of the transferred asset.

       accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the
       policies adopted by the group.



                                                                           transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016          53

         (b) disposal of subsidiaries
         when the group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint
         control or signicant inuence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the
         change in carrying amount recognised in prot or loss.

         in addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are
         accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. this may mean that
         amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to prot or loss.

         (c) common control transactions
         the group applies predecessor values method in accounting for business combination under common
         control. the nancial statements are prepared using predecessor book values, i.e. the book values of the net
         assets of the acquiree company in the consolidated accounts of transcorp hotels plc before the transaction,
         without any step up to fair value. the difference between any consideration given and the aggregate book
         value of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired entity is recorded as an
         adjustment to equity. this is recorded in retained earnings. no additional goodwill is created by the
         transaction.

2.3      segment reporting

         the chief operating decision-maker has been identied as the board of directors of transcorp hotels plc. the
         board reviews the group's internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources. the
         directors have determined the operating segments based on these reports. assessment of performance is
         based on operating prots of the operating segment that is reviewed by the board. other information
         provided to the board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the nancial statements.

         the board considers the business from an industry perspective and has identied one (1 ) operating segment
         which is the hospitality business as none of the subsidiaries consolidated qualify for segment analysis.

         the hospitality business is made up of transcorp hotels plc (thp) and its subsidiaries, transcorp hotels calabar
         limited (thc), transcorp hotels ikoyi limited and transcorp hotels port harcourt limited.

2.4     foreign currency translation

         (a) functional and presentation currency
         items included in the nancial statements of each of the group's entities are measured using the currency of
         the primary economic environment in which transcorp hotels plc operates ('the functional currency'). the
         functional currency of transcorp hotels plc and its subsidiaries is the nigerian naira. all entities in the group
         have the same functional currency. the nancial statements are also presented in naira.

         (b) transactions and balances
         foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
         at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. foreign exchange gains and
         losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates
         of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
         foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in
         the income statement within 'nance income or costs'. all other foreign exchange gains and losses are
         presented in the income statement within 'other (expenses)/income – net'. translation differences related to
         changes in amortised cost are recognised in prot or loss.

2.5   property, plant and equipment

       property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
       impairment losses. cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

       subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as
       appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the
       group and the cost can be measured reliably.

       all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of prot or loss during the nancial period in
       which they are incurred.

       increases in the carrying amounts arising on revaluation of land and buildings are recognised, net of tax, in
       other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in shareholders' equity.

        as often as it occurs, the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the
       asset charged to prot or loss and depreciation based on the asset's original cost, net of tax, is reclassied
       from the property, plant and equipment revaluation surplus to retained earnings.

       freehold land is not depreciated. depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method to
       allocate their costs or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:

        leasehold buildings              2%                plant and machinery                                   10 %
        furniture and ttings            20%               computer equipment                                    33 %
        motor vehicles                   25%

       the group allocates the amount initially recognized in respect of an item of property, plant and equipment
       to its signicant parts and depreciates separately each such part. the carrying amount of a replaced part is
       derecognized when replaced. residual values, method of amortization and useful lives of the assets are
       reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.

       where an indication of impairment exists, an asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its
       recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than it's estimated recoverable amount.

       the gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the
       sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in other income or expense - net in the
       statement of prot or loss for the period.

2.6   intangible assets

       (a) goodwill
       goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred
       over transcorp hotel plc's interest in the net fair value of the net identiable assets, liabilities and contingent
       liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. for the purpose of
       impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating
       units (cgus), or groups of cgus, that is expected to benet from the synergies of the combination. each unit
       or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the
       goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. goodwill is monitored at the operating segment
       level.




                                                                       transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016        55

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


       goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in
       circumstances indicate a potential impairment. the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the
       recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. any impairment is
       recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

       the goodwill in the books arose from the purchase of transcorp hotels calabar limited which operates the
       transcorp hotel, calabar.

       for purposes of impairment testing, the entire business is treated as one cash generating unit (cgu).

       (b) computer software
       costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as
       incurred. development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identiable and
       unique software products controlled by the group are recognised as intangible assets when the following
       criteria are met:
       - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
       - the directors intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
       - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
       - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benets;
       - adequate technical, nancial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
         software product are available
       - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

       directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software
       development, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.

       other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
       development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent
       period.

       computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives
       from the point at which the asset is ready for use. the estimated useful lives of the software of the group is
       between three to eight years.

2.7   investment properties

       properties that are held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that are not
       occupied by the entities in the consolidated group, are classied as investment properties.

       recognition of investment properties takes place only when it is probable that the future economic benets
       that are associated with the investment property will ow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.
       this is usually the day when all risks are transferred.

       investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, in the year of acquisition. the
       carrying amount includes the cost of replacing parts of an existing investment property at the time the cost
       was incurred if the recognition criteria are met; and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an
       investment property. subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value, which
       reects market conditions at the date of the consolidated statement of nancial position.

       gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in the consolidated
       income statement in the year in which they arise. subsequent expenditure is included in the asset's carrying



 56 transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


         amount only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the group
         and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to
         the consolidated prot or loss during the nancial period in which they are incurred.

         the fair value of investment properties is based on the nature, location and condition of the specic asset.
         the fair value is obtained from professional third party valuers contracted to perform valuations on behalf of
         the group. the fair value of investment property does not reect future capital expenditure that will improve
         or enhance the property and does not reect the related future benets from this future expenditure. these
         valuations are performed annually by external appraisers.

         if entity owns property that is leased to, and occupied by, another entity in the same group, the property
         does not qualify as investment property in consolidated nancial statements that include both entities. this is
         because the propertyis owner-occupied from the perspective of the group as a whole. however, from the
         perspective of the individual entity that owns it, the property is investment property.

2.8     impairment of non-nancial assets

         assets that have an indenite useful life – for example, goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested
         annually for impairment. assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever
         events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an
         impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
         amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. for the
         purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
         identiable cash ows (cash-generating units). non-nancial assets other than goodwill that suffered an
         impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.

2.9     financial assets

         the group classies its nancial assets in the following categories: at fair value through prot or loss, loans and
         receivables, and available for sale. the classication depends on the purpose for which the nancial assets
         were acquired. management determines the classication of its nancial assets at initial recognition.

2.9.1   classication of nancial instruments
         management determine the classication of its nancial instruments at initial recognition.

         (a) financial assets and liabilities at fair value through prot or loss
         financial assets at fair value through prot or loss are nancial assets held for trading. a nancial asset is
         classied in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. derivatives are also
         categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. assets in this category are classied as
         current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classied as non-current.

         (b) loans and receivables
         loans and receivables are non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not
         quoted in an active market. they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months
         after the end of the reporting period. these are classied as non-current assets. the group's loans and
         receivables comprise 'trade and other receivables' and 'cash and cash equivalents' in the balance sheet.

         (c) held-to-maturity investments
         held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative nancial assets with xed or determinable payments and
         xed maturities that the directors have the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than:
         (a) those that the group upon initial recognition designates as at fair value through prot or loss;



                                                                          transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016        57

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


          (b) those that the group designates as available-for-sale; and
          (c) those that meet the denition of loans and receivables.

          (d) financial liabilities at amortized cost
          financial liabilities at amortized cost consists of trade payables.
          trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course
          of business from suppliers. accounts payables are classied as current liabilities if payment is due within one
          year or less.

2.9.2  recognition and measurement
        (a) loans and receivables
        loans and receivables are initially recognized at the amount expected to be received, less, when material,
        a discount to reduce the loans and receivables to fair value. subsequently, loans and receivables are
        measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less a provision for impairment.
        trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using
        the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.

          (b) held-to-maturity investments
          held-to-maturity investments are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental
          transaction costs and measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

          (c) financial liabilities at amortized cost
          trade payables are initially recognized at the amount required to be paid, less, when material, a discount to
          reduce the payables to fair value. subsequently, trade payables are measured at amortized cost using the
          effective interest method.

2.10     offsetting nancial instruments

          financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of nancial position
          when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle
          on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

2.11     impairment of nancial assets

          assets carried at amortised cost
          the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a nancial
          asset or group of nancial assets is impaired. a nancial asset or a group of nancial assets is impaired and
          impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more
          events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a 'loss event') and that loss event (or events) has
          an impact on the estimated future cash ows of the nancial asset or group of nancial assets that can be
          reliably estimated.

          the criteria that the group uses to determine that there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:
          - signicant nancial difculty of the debtor or obligor;
          - a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
          - the company, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's nancial difculty, granting to the
            borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;
          - it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other nancial reorganisation;
          - the disappearance of an active market for that nancial asset because of nancial difculties; or
          - observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ows from
          a portfolio of nancial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet



58      transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


        be identied with the individual nancial assets in the portfolio, including:
            (i) adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio; and
            (ii) national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.

        the group rst assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists.

        for loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
        asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows (excluding future credit losses
        that have not been incurred) discounted at the nancial asset's original effective interest rate. the carrying
        amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of
        prot or loss. if a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
        measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. as a
        practical expedient, the group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument's fair value using an
        observable market price.

        a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the
        group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. if
        collection is expected in one year or less, they are classied as current assets. if not, they are presented as
        non-current assets.

        if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
        objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the
        debtor's credit rating), the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the
        consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

2.12    inventories

        inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value. cost is determined using the
        weighted average method. this includes the cost of direct materials to the company's premises and other
        direct costs. net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling
        expenses.

2.13    cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts

        cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly
        liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.

2.14   borrowings

        borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. borrowings are
        subsequently carried at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)
        and the redemption value is recognised in prot or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective
        interest method.

        fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent
        that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. in this case, the fee is deferred until the
        draw down occurs. to the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be
        drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of
        the facility to which it relates.




                                                                         transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016        59

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


        borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specied in the contract is
        discharged, cancelled or expired. the difference between the carrying amount of a nancial liability that
        has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash
        assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in prot or loss as other income or nance costs.

        borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement
        of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

        the fair values of borrowings are based on cash ows discounted using a rate based on the borrowing rate of
        16% (2015: 16%). the rate used is the average interest rate obtainable from commercial banks and has been
        determined as a level 2 measure within the fair value hierarchy.

2.15   borrowing costs

        general and specic borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
        qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their
        intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, (i.e. capitalised) until such time as the assets are
        substantially ready for their intended use or sale.

        investment income earned on the temporary investment of specic borrowings pending their expenditure
        on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. all other borrowing costs
        are recognised in prot or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

2.16   provisions

        provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past
        event, and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation and the amount has been
        reliably estimated. provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

        provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the
        obligation using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
        risks specic to the obligation. the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest
        expense.

2.17    current and deferred tax

        the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. tax is recognised in the statement of
        prot or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or
        directly in equity. in this case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,
        respectively.

        the tax currently payable is based on taxable prot for the year. taxable prot differs from net prot as
        reported in the statement of prot or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
        deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. the group's
        liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
        reporting date.

        deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying
        amounts of assets and liabilities in the nancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
        computation of taxable prot, and is accounted for using the liability method. deferred tax liabilities are
        generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the



 60 transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


        extent that it is probable that taxable prots will be available against which deductible temporary
        differences can be utilised. such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises
        from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and
        liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax prot nor the accounting prot.

        deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries
        except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
        temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

        the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent
        that it is no longer probable that sufcient taxable prots will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
        recovered. deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the
        liability is settled or the asset is realised. deferred tax is charged or credited to the statement of prot or loss,
        except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with
        in equity.

        deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
        assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
        authority and the group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis.

        deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current in the statement of nancial position.

2.18   employee benets

        (a)  dened contribution scheme
        the group operates a dened contributory pension scheme in line with the provisions of the pension reform
        act 2014. the employer's contributions are recognised as employee benet expenses when they are due.
        the group has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.

        (b) prot-sharing and bonus plan
        the group operates a bonus plan where staff are remunerated based on parameters determined by the
        board. bonus payments are at the discretion of the board and the expense is recognised as in the year it is
        incurred. there is no contractual obligation neither has there been a past practice to create a constructive
        obligation.

2.19   revenue recognition

        revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable stated net of discounts,
        returns and value added taxes. the group earns revenue from the sale of goods and services.

        revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from the sale of goods and
        services in the ordinary course of the company's activities. revenue is recognised when it is probable that
        the economic benets associated with a transaction will ow to the company and the amount of revenue
        and associated costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably.

        revenue includes hotel, entertainment and restaurant revenues, other service fees, rental income and the
        invoiced value of goods and services sold less returns and allowances. value added tax (vat) and other
        taxes are excluded from revenue and treated as overhead expenses, as these are borne by the company
        and not by its customers. vat on all other revenue transactions is considered to be a tax collected by the
        company as an agent on behalf of the revenue authorities and is excluded from revenue.




                                                                         transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016         61

notes to the financial statements (contn’d)


        transcorp hilton hotel abuja offers a customer loyalty programme called the hilton honours guest reward
        programme on behalf of the hilton international. under this programme, registered members earn points
        when they pay for rooms or services at the hotel. the group accounts for the points as a separately
        identiable component of the sales transaction in which they are granted (the 'initial sale' of rooms or
        service). the consideration received or receivable in respect of the initial sale is allocated between the points
        and the sale of rooms or service with reference to the fair value of the points. revenue is measured as the net
        amount retained by the hotel, i.e. the difference between the consideration allocated to the award credits
        and the amount payable to the hilton international for supplying the awards.

        interest income is recognised using the effective interest method. when a receivable is impaired, the group
        reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash ow discounted at
        the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income.
        interest income on impaired loans is recognised using the original effective interest rate.

 2.20 leases

        operating lease
        leases in which a signicant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by another party, the
        lessor, are classied as operating leases. payments, including prepayments, made under operating leases
        (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the prot or loss on a straight-line basis over the
        period of the lease. when an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any
        payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognised as an expense in the period in
        which termination takes place.

        finance lease
        leases of items by the group where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
        classied as nance leases. finance leases are capitalised at the lease's commencement at the lower of the
        fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.

        each lease payment is allocated between the liability and nance charges. the corresponding rental
        obligations, net of nance charges, are included in other long-term payables. the interest element of the
        nance cost is charged to the statement of prot or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant
        periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. the property, plant and
        equipment acquired under nance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and
        the lease term.

2.21    dividend distribution

        dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the group's nancial statements in the
        period in which the dividends are approved by the group's shareholders. in respect of interim dividends,
        these are recognised when declared by the board of directors.

2.22   share capital

        ordinary shares are classied as 'share capital' in equity. any premium received over and above the par
        value of the shares is classied as 'share premium' in equity.

       the group's main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings with xed interest rates. the group's
       borrowings at xed rate were mainly denominated in nigerian currency (naira).

       the group's xed rate borrowings and receivables are carried at amortised cost. they are therefore not
       subject to interest rate risk as dened in ifrs 7, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash ows will

3.2   credit risk
                              

       (i) risk management                            
       credit risk is managed on a group basis. for banks and nancial institutions, only independently rated parties
       with a minimum national rating of 'a' are accepted.

       there is no independent rating for customers. risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking
       into account its nancial position, past experience and other factors. the compliance with credit limits by
       customers is regularly monitored by line management.

       sales to customers are required to be settled in cash or using major credit cards, mitigating credit risk. there
       are no signicant concentrations of credit risk, whether through exposure to individual customers, specic
       industry sectors and/or regions.

       the credit ratings of the investments are monitored for credit deterioration.

       (ii) security
       no security is obtained for trade receivables either in the form of guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letters
       of credit which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.

       however, some guests are required to provide security deposits for credit transactions while others are
       granted credit on the strength of their credibility and past performances. in the case of default, unpaid
       balances are set off against security deposit while others are referred to debt collection agents.
                                        
       the credit quality of nancial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to
       external credit ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates.

       there are no credit ratings for transcorp hotel plc's current assets. however, the company’s cash and

      (iii)impaired trade receivables                         
      individual receivables which are known to be uncollectible are written off by reducing the carrying amount
      directly. the other receivables are assessed collectively to determine whether there is objective evidence
      that an impairment has been incurred but not yet been identied. other receivables are not impaired. for
      these receivables the estimated impairment losses are recognised in a separate provision for impairment.

      the group considers that there is evidence of impairment if any of the following indicators are present:
      - signicant nancial difculties of the debtor
      - probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or nancial reorganisation, and
      - default or delinquency in payments (more than 90 days overdue).
      receivables for which an impairment provision was recognised are written off against the provision when
      there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.

      impairment losses are recognised in prot or loss within other expenses. subsequent recoveries of amounts
      previously written off are credited against other expenses.

      individually impaired trade receivables relate to customers who had defaulted for more than 90 days
      where there is no evidence for recoverability of amounts owed. the group expects that a portion of the
      receivables will be recovered and has recognised impairment losses of n149 million and n120 million for
      group and company respectively. the ageing of these receivables is as follows:

       the other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past

       when due. the group does not hold any collateral in relation to these receivables.

3.3   liquidity risk
                              
       prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufcient cash and marketable securities and the
       availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet obligations when
       due and to close out market positions. at the end of the reporting period the group held deposits at call of
       n100 million (2015 –n12,917 million) that are expected to readily generate cash inows for managing liquidity
       risk.

       management monitors rolling forecasts of the group's liquidity reserve and cash and cash equivalents (note
       21) on the basis of expected cash ows.

       this is generally carried out at each of the respective companies of the group in accordance with practice
       and limits set by the group. these limits vary to take into account the liquidity of the market in which the entity
       operates.

       in addition, the group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash ows in major currencies and
       considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios
       against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt nancing plans.

       contractual maturities.

       the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows. for trade payables,
       balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not

       the group's objectives when managing capital are to
       - safeguard their ability to continue as a going concern, so that they can continue to provide               returns for
         shareholders and benets for other stakeholders, and
       - maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

       in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
       shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.                           

      the group's policy is to recognise transfers into and transfers out of fair value hierarchy levels as at the end of
      the reporting period.

      there were no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 for recurring fair value measurements during the year.
      the investment property was carried at cost in the prior period, being the year of acquisition.

      ii) valuation techniques used to determine level 2 fair values                                   
      the group obtains independent valuations for its investment properties at least annually.

      at the end of each reporting period, the directors update their assessment of the fair value of its property,
      taking into account the most recent independent valuations. the directors determine a property's value
      within a range of reasonable fair value estimates.

      the best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar properties. where such
      information is not available the directors consider information from a variety of sources including:



                                                                       transcorp hotels plc annual report 2016      69

      - current prices in an active market for properties of different nature or recent prices of similar properties in
        less active markets, adjusted to reect those differences
      - discounted cash ow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash ows
      - capitalised income projections based upon a property's estimated net market income, and a
        capitalisation rate derived from an analysis of market evidence.

      all resulting fair value estimates for properties are included in level 2. the key inputs under this approach are
      the price per square metre from current year sales of comparable lots of land in the area (location and size).

      iii) valuation processes                            
      the group engages external, independent and qualied valuers to determine the fair value of the group's
      investment properties at the end of every nancial year and for other land and buildings at least every three
      years.

      as at 31 december 2016, the fair values of the investment properties have been determined by ubosi eleh &
      company estate surveyors and valuers.
      in valuing the property, the valuers assumed :
      i.   that the title of the property is good and marketable;
      ii. that the property is not adversely affected by or subject to compulsory acquisition, road widening, new
           proposal or planning scheme;
      iii. that the property is free from all onerous charges and restrictions.

      the basis of valuation is the market value that is the price, which an interest in a property might reasonably be
      expected to realize in a sale by private treaty assuming:
      i.   a willing buyer;
      ii   a reasonable period within which to negotiate the sale taking into account the nature of the property
           and the state of the market;
      iii. values will remain static throughout the period;
      iv. the property will be freely exposed to the market;
      v. no account is to be taken of an additional bid by a special purchaser;
      vi. no account is to be taken of expenses of realization, which may arise in the event of a disposal.

      the investment property was carried at cost in prior period, being the year of acquisition.
      the main level 2 inputs used by the group are derived and evaluated as follows:
      - leased land – discount rates, terminal yields, expected vacancy rates and rental growth rates are
        estimated by ubosi eleh & company estate surveyors and valuers
      the estimates are consistent with the valuer's experience and knowledge of market conditions.

      critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty                
      the preparation of nancial statements requires management to use judgment in applying its accounting
      policies and estimates and assumptions about the future. estimates and other judgments are continuously
      evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations about
      future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. the following discusses the most
      signicant accounting judgments and estimates that the company has made in the preparation of the
      nancial statements:

      impairment of goodwill
      the group reviews goodwill at least annually and other non-nancial assets when there is any indication that
      the assets might be impaired. the group has estimated the value in use and fair value of operating segments
      to which goodwill is allocated using discounted cash ow models that required assumptions about future

      if the average budgeted gross margin used in the value-in-use calculation for transcorp hotels calabar
      limited (cgu) had been 1% lower than management's estimates at 31 december 2016 (69% instead of 70%),
      the group would have had to recognise an impairment against the carrying amount of goodwill of n291.9
      million.
                              
      the reasonably possible change of 1% reduction in average budgeted gross margin represents a reasonably
      possible reduction in sales of 2%.

      if the pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash ow projections of this cgu had been 1% higher than
      management's estimates (20% instead of 19%), the group would have had to recognise an impairment
      against investment in transcorp hotels calabar limited (thcl) of n200 million.

      in the prior year there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions that would
      have resulted in an impairment write-down in investment in thcl.

           the group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that intangible
           assets are impaired. the remaining amortisation period for computer software cost is between 3 to 6 years.
           goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually.

           the group periodically evaluates its non- current assets for impairment, whenever events or changes in
           circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. the group's
           judgements regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and
           operational performance of the business. future events could cause management to conclude that
           impairment indicators exist.

           goodwill arose from the excess of the consideration over acquisition-date fair values of identiable assets
           and liabilities of transcorp hotels calabar limited acquired. the goodwill amount relates to pre-existing
           goodwill from previous acquisition of transcorp hotels calabar limited. no additional goodwill was
           recorded during the year.

           in assessing goodwill for impairment at 31 december 2016 and 2015 , the company compared the
           aggregate recoverable amount of the assets included in the cgu to its respective carrying amounts.
           recoverable amount has been determined based on the value in use of the cgus using ve year cash ow

      periods beyond the budget period, cash ows were extrapolated using growth rates that do not exceed the
      long-term average growth rate for the business.

      based on the results of the impairment evaluation described above, the recorded goodwill was not impaired
      as the recoverable amount of the subsidiary exceeded the carrying value.

      the key assumptions used for the value -in-use calculations are as follows:

                                                                                           31 dec 2016          31 dec 2015

      terminal growth rate                                                                           3%                   6%
      pre -tax discount rate                                                                       19%                  17%

      management has determined the values assigned to each of the above key assumptions as follows:

       assumption used              approach used to determining values

       sales volume                 average annual growth rate over the ve-year forecast period; based on past
                                    performance and management's expectations of market development.

       sales price                  average annual growth rate over the ve-year forecast period; based on current
                                    industry trends and including long term ination forecasts.

       budgeted gross margin        based on past performance and management's expectations for the future.

       other operating costs        fixed costs of the cgu, which do not vary signicantly with sales volumes or prices.
                                    management forecasts these costs based on the current structure of the business,
                                    adjusting for inationary increases but not reecting any future restructurings or cost
                                    saving measures. the amounts disclosed above are the average operating costs for
                                    the ve-year forecast period.

       annual capital expenditure   expected cash costs in the cgu. this is based on the historical experience of
                                    management, and the planned refurbishment expenditure. no incremental revenue
                                    or cost savings are assumed in the value-in-use model as a result of this expenditure.

       long-term growth rate        this is the weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the
                                    budget period. the rates are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports.

       pre-tax discount rates       reect specic risks relating to the cgu and the countries in which they operate.




       reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of goodwill
       to fall below the carrying value.
