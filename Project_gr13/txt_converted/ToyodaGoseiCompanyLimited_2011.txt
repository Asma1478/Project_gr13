mobile phone cases are one of our main products. the production, supply,
and technological capabilities of our chinese subsidiary company have
been highly praised by new customers, leading to increased receipt of
orders of new models. as a result, our production in china in ﬁscal 2011

air puriﬁers represent our principal product in japan in terms of sales. due
to continued receipt of orders, we anticipate that production in ﬁscal
2011 will be approximately the same as the previous year. we will
improve the cost by shifting the production site of the models which used
to be manufactured in japan to china. in addition, we will make the most
of our automotive technologies to concentrate on home-use components
and construction machinery.

in the fourth environmental action plan we worked on from ﬁscal 2006 to ﬁscal 2010, all domestic
and overseas companies in the group collaborated with each other and implemented environmental
conservation activities step by step to achieve the goals.
as a result, we were able to achieve our goals for all items in the fourth environmental action plan .

                    hinode gomu kogyo co., ltd.

                 promoting environmental conservation by setting strict level of voluntary regulation
                 hinode gomu kogyo co., ltd. that manufactures, processes and sells automotive rubber
                 parts has concluded a resident agreement with the city of yokkaichi to set voluntary
                 regulations on water quality, air and noise stricter than the standard levels set by the city
                 and prefecture and routinely report the results of our eﬀorts to the city.
                 as part of 530 (zero waste) activities from both aspects of environmental conservation
                 and social contribution, we implement cleaning activities around our plants once in 3
                 months and our employees voluntarily participate in cleaning and trash-picking each time.
                 in the production process, we also promote use of exhaust heat by introducing a cogen-
                 eration system. we also focus our eﬀorts on measures for noise control within our plants
                 and are eﬀectively controlling noise by developing a technology that can lessen slip                  hinode gomu kogyo co.,ltd.

                 used for a long time to maintain the product quality and promote the reduction of waste.
                 in the mold-based incidental facilities, additional installment of a changeover valve to a
                 cold water circulator enabled us to stop the pump while cooling the mold, contributing
                 to the energy-saving eﬀect of about 32 ton co2 annually.

                 through invention and thorough management of facilities such as installment of an inverter
                 to a molding motor. we also made it possible to resin materials, which used to be diﬃcult,
                 and increased the recycling rate from 70% to 81% by proactively working on recycling of
                 resins and adding a regenerator. the improvement in coating eﬃciency reduced the usage
                 of voc*-containing solvents by 16%. these environmental activities have received high                            （foshan）

                                                i think the main purpose of this report by toyoda gosei is to report how the company is

                                                i recognize that a wide range of approaches have been taken to make automobiles safer

                                                and plastic ﬁller pipes. i also see the company s willingness and attitude to sincerely con-

                                                tribute to society through its main business. the examples include development of led

                                                business more clearly in the basic environmental policy to clearly position its contribution to

                                                lyze manufacturing processes. i also expect the company to include episodes behind the
                                                development of its products to convey thoughts and ideas of the developers in the report.
                                                i m sure such report will further inspire and attract readers.
