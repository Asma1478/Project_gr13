                  upm energy diversifies
                  its competencies
                  the upm energy business area has been actively developing its competencies and has
                  recruited energy experts from many fields. just in the past year, some 20 new energy experts,
                  e.g. energy market analysts, traders, portfolio managers and biomass procurement experts
                  have joined the upm energy team.

                  over the past few years, the former support function has been converted into a completely new
                  market-based business requiring high level of knowledge. mathematicians, economists and
                  electrical and power plant engineers are working towards a common target – to get the best
                  out of upm’s power production assets and help paper mills to procure their energy the best
                  way possible.

                  on-the-job learning is an important part of the competence development. the focus is on
                  cross-team task forces and empowerment.

                  “in 2011, we completed a people plan for upm energy. the plan supports the business strategy
                  by defining the most important competence development areas and relevant developmental
                  actions for the organisation. this plan is then cascaded to every individual in the form of a
                  personal development plan via the performance management process,” says anne särkilahti,
                  director of physical portfolio management at upm energy.

                  an active player in the energy market
                  upm is in the same position as any other big electricity producer in finland, selling electricity
                  to the wholesale market. upm energy is currently trading power, gas, coal and emission
                  allowances on nord pool spot, nasdaq omx, eex, ecx and otc markets. upm was one of
                  the first companies to start trading spot electricity on the nordic power exchange nord pool
                  in 1998.

                  the operating team is primarily based in helsinki and tampere in finland and in augsburg in
                  germany.

develop sustainable plantation
practices coordinated by wwf

                  working with wwf
                  for future plantations
                  wwf’s new generation plantations project (ngpp) identifies and promotes new-genera-
                  tion plantation practices. new generation plantations are forest plantations that maintain
                  ecosystem integrity, protect the high conservation values and are developed through
                  effective stakeholder participation, while contributing to economic growth and employment.

                  upm has been one of the key members of the ngpp since it began 2008. the ngpp
                  responds to a growing need for a better understanding of the role that well-managed and
                  appropriately located plantations can play in future societies. the target is to promote key
                  features of healthy, diverse and multi-functional forest landscapes, compatible with
                  biodiversity conservation and human needs.

                  “plantations that do not replace natural habitats, but help recover over-grazed and
                  degraded land, can help build a greener future economy. such plantations could help
                  supply the world’s future demand for timber, fibre and bioenergy without further depletion
                  of its natural capital. they just have to be done right,” says rodney taylor, wwf interna-
                  tional’s forest director.

                  taylor continues: “the project gives wwf a much deeper understanding of what is
                  possible and the challenges faced by the participating companies. there are certainly lots
                  of examples of new-generation practices. if we put them all together, we might have a
                  new-generation plantation.”

                  in 2011, upm hosted a conference in london to launch the publication of the ngpp report
                  on how this concept applies to bioenergy and carbon storage. the report included two
                  upm case studies on sustainable plantation management in the uk. “we are happy to
                  provide even more transparency to our operations to all relevant stakeholders by sharing
                  our case studies,” confirms vice president javier solari, who is responsible for upm
                  plantations in the southern hemisphere.

ecological and can be
reused and recycled

                     upm living develops sustainable
                     wood products for home and garden
                     wood’s renewability is only one aspect of its excellent environmental credentials as
                     a building material. in 2011, upm established a new business unit, upm living,
                     which manufactures wood-based products for home decoration and building
                     materials both for consumers and industrial customers using advanced technology
                     and in-depth material knowledge. upm timber continues to produce certified
                     nordic sawn timber.

                     anu puustinen, finnish architect and a member of the upm living design pool, says
                     that wood’s potential as a material is enormous.

                     “wood is genuine and in itself it is already an ecological product. it is not
                     necessarily just a surface either and the wooden structure of a house can be
                     emphasised, for example as a visible element of décor,” she says.

                     the other members on the upm living design pool are architects harri helorinne,
                     jarkko kallio and ville hara as well as industrial designer jaana karell.

                     world design capital 2012 pavilion made of upm’s wood products
                     when the entire world of design turns its gaze on helsinki and finland in 2012,
                     upm will have a great opportunity to show biofore thinking in practice.

                     fresh finnish design will emerge in partnership with world design capital helsinki
                     2012, when the pavilion acting as the meeting place for the design year is
                     constructed from upm’s wood materials. the pavilion, which will be built in the
                     centre of helsinki, will be made from renewable and recyclable wood products.

upm’s continuous target is to
improve energy efficiency

in energy savings of up to 30%

fruitful co-operation between
r&d and mills




                                                                                         the operators and supervisors start up the new

                       significant energy savings
                       in mechanical pulping
                       in paper production, a remarkable share of energy is consumed in the production of
                       mechanical pulp, one of the main ingredients in magazine paper.

                       the aim of upm’s strategic research programme concerning energy saving in mechanical
                       pulping, carried out during 2009–2011, was to develop and implement new, energy
                       efficient production technologies. to reach the target of 30% reduction in electricity
                       consumption, a reassessment of the traditional pulp manufacturing principles in co-opera-
                       tion with mills and research was required.

                       savings with process development
                       in 2011, new energy efficient pulp production concepts were implemented at several
                       mills. the process improvements were made by updating production lines with new
                       technology and by simplifying processes.

                       for example, the grinding technology was modernised at the plattling mill in germany
                       and madison in the usa. in addition, energy efficient solutions were implemented in
                       thermo-mechanical pulping processes at the kaipola and rauma mills in finland and
                       steyrermühl in austria.

                       the research that has been done over the years to find energy efficient solutions was put
                       into practice in the successful co-operation between upm’s r&d and its paper mills.

                       “the results have, in many ways, been even better than anticipated, with energy savings
                       of 10-30% in mill applications. several million euro savings at the mills encourage to
                       continue the development at other upm mills,” says vuokko pietarila, programme
                       manager.

the aim of upm’s water
programme is to use water
responsibly in all of its operations

upm is investigating the
management and the material
efficiency of water use at several
of its mills

the target is to reduce waste
water volumes and chemical
oxygen demand (cod) by 15%
between 2008 and 2020



                                                                                           process engineer samppa kutvonen participates
                                                                                           in the pilot water management system project
                                                                                           at the upm hürth paper mill.




                       upm makes its water use more efficient
                       water is an essential raw material in the pulp and paper production process. upm also
                       uses water as a power source and 20% of the company’s electricity is produced using
                       emission-free hydropower.

                       in 2011, upm carried out several projects aimed at improving water management.
                       the water footprint study performed at the german nordland paper mill in 2010 was
                       extended to include a water use sustainability assessment. other water footprint studies
                       are ongoing in upm’s plywood and wood plastic composite businesses.

                       ”by working with the water footprint network, upm has taken a leading role in
                       reviewing sustainable water use in the paper industry. upm’s pilot study shows that when
                       forests are managed sustainably, paper products will have little contribution for the
                       growing concerns about water scarcity,” says executive director ruth mathews from the
                       water footprint network.

                       at the end of the year, upm started to pilot a water management system at the upm
                       hürth mill in germany, in co-operation with the alliance of water stewardship (aws).

                       upm investigates the scarcity of water resources
                       the scarcity of water resources is one of the environmental concerns of the immediate
                       future. upm examined the scarcity of its water resources utilising the water scarcity index
                       tool. according to the results, upm mills are situated in areas where water is abundant
                       and scarcity is not a problem.

                       in 2011, a material efficiency programme was launched at all upm paper mills. the
                       objectives of the programme are to decrease the amount of suspended matter in waste
                       water and the use of process water consumption. these objectives are being pursued by
                       investments and sharing best practices between mills.

                       in the beginning of 2011, upm started a three-year research programme concerning
                       efficient water use in the future pulp mills. trial runs have been carried out at upm’s fray
                       bentos pulp mill in uruguay.

                   maximising the reuse of raw materials and recycling go hand in hand with upm’s
                   biofore thinking. the by-products from self-adhesive labelstock production are the
                   principal raw material for upm profi wood plastic composite products. the
                   by-products can also be used as fuel in upm’s combined heat and power plants.
                   siliconised release paper can be recycled into pulp and further back into upm
                   paper products by de-siliconising.

                   previously, these by-products were incinerated or taken to landfills because
                   recycling products that contain paper, plastic film, adhesive and silicone has been
                   challenging.

                   in 2011, rafcycle enabled recycling by-products from upm raflatac’s customers
                   and end users in addition to the by-products produced at upm raflatac’s own
                   factories. in addition to being beneficial for the environment, rafcycle benefits
                   upm raflatac’s customers and end users financially as well.

                   ”with the help of the rafcycle concept, upm strives to find solutions and uses for
                   the by-products of the labelstock industry’s entire value chain. the interest towards
                   the concept is growing constantly,” says erkki nyberg, director of business
                   development for the engineered materials business group at upm.

ways in order to improve its
properties, such as durability

services developed by upm

plywood is a true biofore product

                                                                                                 a house made by danish architects from
                                                                                                 upm’s spruce plywood provides a new
                                                                                                 model for sustainable building.




                  plywood research and development
                  enables sustainable end products
                  plywood has many good properties, the most important being the excellent weight-to-
                  strength-to-price ratio, which competing materials have not been able to attain.

                  upm has developed a new plywood floor solution for trailer chassis that makes it possible to
                  save energy in transportation.

                  the new technology, which has been developed in co-operation with upm’s partners, allows
                  the floor to be bonded to the trailer chassis, eliminating the need for screws. bonding
                  provides increased structural rigidity, which makes it possible to design lighter trailer chassis.
                  in 2011, dozens of trailers using the wisa bonded floor solution were introduced in europe.

                  durable and safe furniture in a more efficient way
                  upm grada plywood, the formable plywood based on upm’s new composite technology,
                  can be formed after manufacturing making production of form pressed products more
                  efficient. it also enables furniture manufacturers to cut out liquid glues and a number of work
                  phases requiring manual labour.

                  the composite is extremely rigid, which enables thinner structures to be used that are still very
                  durable. another significant benefit is that the adhesive used in upm grada plywood does
                  not contain any formaldehyde.

                  the plywood house with a small carbon footprint
                  in 2011, upm plywood supported a pilot project by two danish architects in which they built
                  a house using wisa-spruce plywood.

                  the modules and components of the ‘print a house’ concept were designed using computer
                  simulation and manufactured using a cnc machine. the result was a family house that was
                  easy to assemble on site. the house is ecological, healthy to live in and it has a small carbon
                  footprint. no concrete was used in the construction.

                       upm’s product range is expanding
                       with new innovative materials
                       the new biocomposite, upm formi, and fibril cellulose provide excellent examples of new
                       innovative products and materials that have a strong synergy with upm’s current businesses.

                       high-quality biocomposite material
                       upm formi is suitable for manufacturing both industrial goods and consumer products. “the
                       new biocomposite has extensive opportunities, from electronic and automotive industries to
                       furniture, tableware and other goods for everyday living,” says stefan fors, director of new
                       businesses and development.

                       the biocomposite is made of virgin wood fibres and clean plastic polymers. the share of
                       renewable material can reach up to 60%, meaning that the product is recyclable and can be
                       burned for energy at the end of its lifecycle. moreover, upm formi’s carbon footprint is
                       30–60% lower than traditional plastics.

                       fibril cellulose can be used in a wide range of applications
                       in 2011, upm started pre-commercial production of fibril cellulose at otaniemi, espoo,
                       finland. the target is to commercialise the material by providing different types of fibril
                       cellulose for extensive customer testing.

                       in the first stage, products are used in paper and packaging materials, as well as in the
                       concrete and paint industries. upm’s fibril cellulose can be used to make products tougher,
                       lighter or thinner. it can also be used in many industrial applications requiring a high
                       stabilisation capacity and high viscosity.

                       “upm’s fibril cellulose provides new properties and design opportunities for traditional materi-
                       als. for example, we have produced the first industrial-scale batch of speciality paper
                       reinforced with fibril cellulose at the upm tervasaari mill,” describes esa laurinsilta, director
                       of new businesses and development.

                     co-operation based on
                     continuous dialogue
                     upm’s relationships with environmental and community groups have been developed over the years around
                     tangible projects, based on everyday discussions and dialogue. upm has long traditions in engaging with the
                     community at most of its production locations.

                     co-operation with wwf and other environmental groups
                     in 2011, upm partnered with wwf both in finland and internationally. in finland, the un’s “international year
                     of forests” brought together wwf and upm to promote wwf’s global 2011 “living forests campaign”.

                     in the international arena, upm continued working with wwf in the new generation plantations project which
                     brings together expertise in plantation design and management in order to further ensure social and environ-
                     mental sustainability aspects of plantation operations (read more on page 25).

                     another successful project, clearly linked to upm’s global biodiversity programme, is the collaboration with
                     environment online (eno) global virtual school’s tree planting day, which upm supported in the uk, uruguay
                     and finland. the annual event is important in building future generations’ relationship with nature and forests.

                     in 2011, upm collaborated closely with birdlife finland on managing important nesting and resting areas for
                     bird species. for example, upm and birdlife finland jointly restored peat land area for red grouse and other
                     peat land species.

                     uruguay foundation achieves positive results
                     the upm foundation has been active in uruguay since 2006, promoting development in rural areas through
                     education, training and entrepreneurship, to foster a culture of safe and healthy living. in 2011, over 35,000
                     people in 45 communities benefited from the activities financed by the foundation.

                     in partnership with bio uruguay, a local ngo, upm foundation promoted sustainable farming practices in
                     sauce de batovi, a small rural community of 1,000 people located in the country´s largest and poorest province
                     and supported rural families whose livelihoods depend on the land they live in.

                     “thanks to upm foundation’s support, we were able to profoundly transform the community’s approach to
                     farming, both technically and culturally,” said alda rodriguez, bio uruguay’s leader and project coordinator.

workplace safety is a top
priority in upm’s operations

upm has launched a company-
wide safety initiative “step
change in safety 2012–2014”

targets: no fatal accidents at
upm premises and a significant
reduction in accident frequency




                                                                              upm’s safety principles, safety first, safety starts with me
                                                                              and we can prevent all accidents, are familiar to dave
                                                                              clancy, rollshop mechanical technician at the upm shotton
                                                                              paper mill in the uk.
                     safety first
                     the health, safety and security of employees, visitors, subcontractors and all other people impacted by
                     upm’s operations are of paramount importance to upm. despite the hard work and long term positive
                     development in upm’s safety performance, the accident frequency (the number of lost-time work
                     accidents per one million hours of work) has remained too high, at 15.

                     as a result, upm has launched a company-wide safety initiative called “step change in safety 2012–
                     2014”. in 2011, upm included safety in the company’s vision and revised its safety rule, which forms
                     the foundation of its safety work. in conjunction with the initiative, key company-wide performance
                     indicators and incentives, as well as a new set of safety standards, will be introduced. attention will
                     also be paid on the resources.

                     the upm occupational health and safety award 2011 was given to the upm blandin paper mill in
                     minnesota, usa. the award, presented since 2007, is given as recognition for a determined commitment
                     to improving health and safety matters in the workplace.

                     good local practices shared
                     blandin paper mill places a strong focus on safety management and has the best score in the occupa-
                     tional health and safety audits. in 2011, the mill also introduced an ergonomics programme as part of
                     its well-being and health management.

                     “blandin employees show their commitment through participation in safety activities such as training,
                     conducting audits, identifying unsafe conditions, reporting near misses, following safety rules, serving
                     on safety teams and more. we measure safety participation and know that there is a direct correlation
                     between safety performance and participation,” says joe maher, general manager of the mill.

                     upm changshu paper mill in china holds the record for the most lost-time accident free days – more
                     than two years without any accidents. the result has been reached by local safety programme and
                     integrating safety systematically into the daily operations: communications, safety observations,
                     preventative safety analysis, audit procedures and learnings from the best internal and external safety
                     practices.

                     in may 2011, the upm raflatac changshu labelstock factory was the first labelstock factory to reach
                     a lost time accident-free year. near-miss reporting and safety observations are part of the factory’s
                     continuous training programme.

                                                                          seedlings in 60 locations across finland during a two-week
                                                                          period.
                 investing in future talent
                 out of approximately 14,000 summer job applications, upm was able to provide
                 summer jobs to over 1,000 young people in finland. they were working at the produc-
                 tion plants, at upm forest finland, at the upm service centre in tampere and at the
                 group head office.

                 in 2011, upm forest implemented a trainee programme in finland. the 11 trainees, who
                 are located in offices across finland, are going through an 18-month training programme
                 to become versatile professionals in forestry business.

                 upm also promoted the youth forum of the finnish paper engineers’ association by
                 supporting the international exchange of future engineers. ten students were awarded a
                 scholarship at upm’s paper mills and upm raflatac labelstock factories and r&d centre
                 across the world.

                 getting started during school years
                 in the summer of 2011, upm employed some 160 young people aged 15–17, who
                 planted trees in 60 locations across finland in upm-owned and managed forests with the
                 help of upm silvesta forest workers.

                 around half a million seedlings were planted during a two-week period and the trees will
                 be ready for harvesting in 60 to 80 years.

                 “the response from both the young people and the forest workers was positive, even
                 though that the summer was quite hot and planting trees is hard work,” says jukka
                 koivumäki, managing director at upm silvesta.

                 in 2011, upm was also involved in the enterprise village project for children aged
                 between 11 and 13. this is an educational programme on the economy and working life,
                 which includes lessons held at the students’ schools and a day in a miniature society.

                     their entire lifecycle


                           upm was the first in finland to be awarded the fsc certificate for its
                           finnish forests after the new finnish fsc standard was endorsed

                           with the myllykoski integration, upm introduced equal environmental
                           targets into all the mills, including sharing best practices in environ-

                           upm concluded several studies and assessments with external stake-

                       ecodesign introduces lifecycle
                       thinking to product design
                       ecodesign means that environmental aspects are systematically integrated into
                       product design at an early stage. upm’s all businesses and r&d are adopting
                       ecodesign in their product development processes. upm’s biofore thinking entails
                       that each phase of the product lifecycle, including raw materials, production,
                       distribution, use and disposal, is taken into consideration when assessing the
                       environmental impacts of a product. good design can significantly decrease the
                       environmental impacts of a product as the majority of the final product’s environ-
                       mental impacts are defined during product development.

                       making our own processes and the processes of our customers and suppliers more
                       efficient and decreasing the environmental impacts of our products saves every-
                       one’s costs throughout the value chain.

                       aiming at minimising the environmental impacts
                       upm aims at minimising the environmental impacts of its products throughout their
                       lifecycle. for instance, the upm developed manufacturing process for formable
                       plywood improves the energy and material efficiency of the product and signifi-
                       cantly decreases its environmental impacts due to the new, innovative composite
                       technology.

                       environmental labels verified by third parties and certified management systems
                       expressing the sustainability of production and products are an essential part of the
                       ecodesign concept.

                       responsible sourcing is also a key element in ecodesign. upm uses a restricted
                       substances list, adopted in 2010, to ensure that it provides safe products. upm
                       and its suppliers have used the list during the development of several products and
                       found substitutive raw materials that are in accordance with the principles of
                       sustainable development.

                   upm awarded fsc certificate
                   for finnish forests
                   upm is the first in finland to be awarded a certificate to demonstrate compliance
                   with the new fsc standard. the fsc certificate covers around half of upm’s forests
                   in finland. upm’s forests have previously been awarded a pefc certificate.

                   ”the fsc certification of finnish forests further expands upm’s portfolio of
                   eco-labelled products. we already have the market’s most extensive selection of
                   paper products with the eu eco-label. forest certificates are a guarantee to our cus-
                   tomers that our wood fibre comes from sustainably managed forests,” says thomas
                   ehrnrooth, vice president, marketing and communications, paper business group.

                   the first upm products manufactured from fsc-certified finnish fibre became
                   available on the market in the autumn of 2011.

                   co-operation with environmental organisations
                   finland’s new fsc standard was approved in january 2011 and a certificate of
                   compliance with the new standard has been available for finnish forests since
                   may. an agreement on the new finnish fsc standard and its requirements was met
                   in negotiations between environmental organisations and the forest industry.

                   wwf and upm have been working closely together for a long time. liisa
                   rohweder, president of wwf finland, is pleased that upm is setting an example
                   for other finnish companies by obtaining fsc certification.

                   ”we hope that more forest owners will start to adhere to the fsc standard,” says
                   rohweder. upm will also start to offer fsc certification to private forest owners as
                   a forestry service.
