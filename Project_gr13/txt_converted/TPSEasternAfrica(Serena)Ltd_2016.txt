corporate governance statement (continued)
management gives the directors adequate notice for meetings and timely information so that they can contribute constructively and
knowledgeably at board meetings. this enables them to maintain effective oversight and control over strategic, financial, operational,
and compliance issues. the separation of the board’s non-executive, independent chairman’s role from that of the group’s management
obviated the possibility of conflict between the functions of the chairman and those of the executive managing director. this separation, in
turn, resulted in creating in-built checks and balances. the board maximized shareholders’ value and ensured the long-term sustainability
of the tps group by assuming an active leadership role..
the company’s shareholders re-elected messrs francis okomo-okello, mahmood manji, ameer kassim-lakha, jean-louis vinciguerra
and mr. jack jacob kisa as directors of tpseal board at the last annual general meeting held on 29th june, 2015.
the board appointed mr. damien braud as a director of tpseal board on 29th july, 2015. mr. braud, based in nairobi is currently
proparco’s regional director for eastern africa.
on 28th april, 2016, dr. ramadhani dau resigned as a director of the company, dr. dau, a tanzanian national, had been appointed as an
ambassador for his country and he had indicated that following the appointment he would not have adequate time to effectively discharge
his responsibilities as a director on the tpseal board including attending board meetings and participating in the other board related
activities as and when required.
in observing principles of good corporate governance and enhancing the capacity of tpseal directors, the directors attended a corporate
governance training conducted by strathmore university’s business school in january 2016. the training was part of the company's
observance of the principlas of good corporate governance for enhancement of directors' knowledge and effective discharge of their
responsibilities.
board of directors oversight role
as noted above, the board provides direction on policy and oversight in respect of the group’s internal controls, strategy, finance,
operations, budgets and compliance issues in order to ensure sustainable returns to the group’s shareholders. the board, in collaboration
with management, carries out reviews periodically comparing actual performance with set targets and takes corrective measures where
necessary, so as to ensure that the company’s business performance is as close as possible to the budgeted estimates.
board committees
the board has set up two main committees (the committees) and has delegated specific mandates to each one of them. the committees,
namely, board audit committee and board nomination and remuneration committee, have been established under specific written terms
of reference (tor). the board reviews the number of committees and their respective tor from time to time so as to respond to the
dynamic business environment and to comply with the ever-changing relevant legislation and regulations. the committees meet at least
quarterly in a calendar year as provided in their respective tor.
board audit committee
members of this committee comprised of mr. ameer kassim-lakha (chairman), mr. jean-louis vinciguerra, mr. guedi ainache, and
mr. mahmood manji. the committee works closely with the internal audit department and external auditors. it plays a critical role in
reviewing financial information and ensuring that the system of internal controls is effectively administered and reviewed as appropriate.
during the year under review, the committee reviewed significant audit findings identified by the group’s internal and external auditors
and followed up implementation of necessary actions.
the board authorized the committee, to seek directly from the company’s employees and independent professionals, whenever necessary,
any information or advice on matters pertaining to its work. the board reviewed the membership of the committee during the year
under review in accordance with the cma guidelines as well as the committee’s own tor. the committee held three (3) meetings

corporate governance statement (continued)
the committee initiated the strengthening of the group’s risk assessment process, a move aimed at mitigating various business risks. the
board adopted the enterprise risk management policy formulated and recommended by the committee. the policy is aimed at addressing
business risks entailed in the dynamic operating environment.
the committee developed a whistle blowing protection and fraud prevention policy during the year for enhancing accountability,
transparency and ethical practices. the board adopted the policy and management circulated it to all the employees and stakeholders. a
copy of the policy can be downloaded from the company’s website www.serenahotels.com
board nomination and remuneration committee
the committee’s membership comprised of messrs jack kisa (chairman), guedi ainache, mahmood manji, dr. ramadhani dau and mrs.
teddy mapunda. the board mandated the committee to consult experts, where necessary, to scrutinize the company’s organizational
structure and staff establishments and to recommend to the board appropriate human resources policies and capacity enhancement. the
committee held two (2) scheduled meetings during 2015.
the board mandated the committee to propose nominees for appointment to the board as may be required from time to time, and to assess
the effectiveness of the board as a whole, committees of the board, as well as individual directors and make necessary recommendations
to the board for enhancing the effectiveness of the board.
the committee conducts an evaluation exercise after every two years aimed at assessing the performance of the board, the chairman, the
managing director and individual directors. any weaknesses revealed by the results are addressed with a view to improving the board’s
performance. the committee conducted the scheduled 2015-2016 board perfomance evaluation in early january, 2016 and both the
committee and the board discussed the results of the evaluation and agreed on appropriate follow-up actions.
internal controls
the company has an organizational structure with appropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities. the structure is complemented
by detailed policies and procedures manuals, which provide an operational framework for the management team. the company updates
periodically its policies and procedures manuals to incorporate any subsequent changes to ensure that they remain relevant to the
group’s operational requirements. the company carried out a comprehensive review of the financial and information & communication
technology policies and procedures manuals in 2014 to cope with the changing business dynamics. to this end, the company held monthly
credit control, sales and marketing, and finance review meetings focusing on critical aspects of the company’s operations. the internal
control function is largely complemented by the internal audit function, which is an independent appraisal and review function whose
recommendations are discussed and adopted where necessary. the company has invested in an audit software application – ‘teammate
audit management system’ which helps in leveraging the existing audit expertise, harmonizing and strengthening the risk management
function, and enhancing the effectiveness of internal control processes across the group.
communication with shareholders and stakeholders
the company is committed to ensuring that management provides shareholders, securities & bond markets, and other stakeholders with
accurate and timely information on the company’s performance. this is done through the distribution of the tpseal annual report at
least 21 days before the annual general meeting, release of half-year and end-year financial results through the print media and
regulatory bodies, and issuance of monthly disclosures of shareholding statistics to the nairobi securities exchange (nse) and the capital
markets authority (cma).
shareholders and other stakeholders have direct access to the company’s information through the internet and management responds to
all enquiries in a timely manner. management also updates regularly the company’s website so as to provide current information on the
company’s affairs. the company complied with its obligations under the nse continuing listing rules and the cma act during the year
under review.
the company ensures that enquiries from shareholders and other stakeholders are addressed expeditiously by maintaining an open-door
policy in terms of communication both at board and management levels.

from the adverse effects of deforestation and at amboseli national
park where the destruction of forests by elephants is well on the
way to being reversed. serena hotels have established tree and
shrub nurseries at all its properties and over the years, this initiative
has grown to see a wholesome transformation of the environment
around serena properties. with a bigger focus which is now
conservation of the ecosystem, there is notable improvement not
just in forest cover but also in the abundant wildlife and increased
variety of bird species that ultimately depend on the environment.
to widen the foot print, serena hotels in the last five years has
been in partnerships with several organizations, through which
there has been value addition in terms of impact and synergies.

2 summary of significant accounting policies
the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. these policies have been consistently
applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
		
(a) basis of preparation
the financial statements are prepared in compliance with international financial reporting standards (ifrs). the measurement basis applied is the
historical cost basis, except where otherwise stated in the accounting policies below. the financial statements are presented in kenya shillings (shs),
rounded to the nearest thousands, except where otherwise indicated.


the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. it also requires management
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,
or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.


changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(i) new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the group
the following standards have been adopted by the group for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 january 2015 and have no
material impact on the group:


amendment to ias 32, ‘financial instruments: presentation’ on offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. this amendment clarifies that the
right of set-off must not be contingent on a future event. it must also be legally enforceable for all counterparties in the normal course of business,
as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. the amendment also considers settlement mechanisms. the amendment did not have a

(i) new standards, amendments and interpretations adopted by the group (continued)
  annual improvements to ifrss 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 cycles. the following amendments are effective 1 july 2014:-
  •ifrs 2 – clarifies the definition of ‘vesting condition’ and now distinguishes between ‘performance condition’ and ‘service condition’
  •ifrs 3 – clarifies that an obligation to pay contingent consideration is classified as financial liability or equity under the principles in ias 32 and that
    all non-equity contingent consideration (financial and non-financial) is measured at fair value at each reporting date.
  •ifrs 3 – clarifies that ifrs 3 does not apply to the accounting for the formation of any joint arrangement
  •ifrs 8 – requires disclosure of the judgements made by management in aggregating operating segments and clarifies that a reconciliation of
    segment assets must only be disclosed if segment assets are reported.
  •ifrs 13 confirms that short-term receivables and payables can continue to be measured at invoice amounts if the impact of discounting is immaterial.
  •ifrs 13 – clarifies that the portfolio exception in ifrs 13 (measuring the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net
    basis) applies to all contracts within the scope of ias 39 or ifrs 9
  •ias 16 and ias 38 – clarifies how the gross carrying amount and accumulated depreciation are treated where an entity measures its assets at
    revalued amounts
  •ias 24 – where an entity receives management personnel services from a third party (a management entity), the fees paid for those services must
    be disclosed by the reporting entity, but not the compensation paid by the management entity to its employees or directors.
  •ias 40 – clarifies that ias 40 and ifrs 3 are not mutually exclusive when distinguishing between investment property and owner-occupied property
    and determining whether the acquisition of an investment property is a business combination.


  amendments to ias 19,’defined benefit plans: employee contributions’. effective 1 july 2014. the amendments clarify the accounting for defined
  benefit plans that require employees or third parties to contribute towards the cost of the benefits.


(ii) new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 january 2015, and
have not been applied in preparing these financial statement. none of these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the
group, except the following set out below.


ifrs 9, ‘financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. the complete
version of ifrs 9 was issued in july 2014. it replaces the guidance in ias 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
ifrs 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised
cost, fair value through oci and fair value through p&l. the basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash
flow characteristics of the financial asset. investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the
irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in oci not recycling. there is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces
the incurred loss impairment model used in ias 39. for financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the
recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. ifrs 9 relaxes the
requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. it requires an economic relationship between the hedged
item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes.

(ii) new standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted (continued)
contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under ias 39. the standard is effective for accounting
periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. early adoption is permitted. the group is yet to assess ifrs 9’s full impact.

ifrs 15, ‘revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users
of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers.
revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the
good or service. the standard replaces ias 18 ‘revenue’ and ias 11 ‘construction contracts’ and related interpretations. the standard is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018 and earlier application is permitted. the group is assessing the impact of ifrs 15.

ifrs 11, 'joint arrangements'. this amendment adds new guidance on how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that
constitutes a business. the amendments specify the appropriate accounting treatment for such acquisitions. the amendment is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016.

ias 27, ‘separate financial statements’. these amendments allow entities to use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, joint
ventures and associates in their separate financial statements. the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016.

ifrs 10, ‘consolidated financial statements’ and ias 28, ‘investments in associates and joint ventures’. these amendments address an inconsistency
between the requirements in ifrs 10 and those in ias 28 in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint
venture. the main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed
in a subsidiary or not). a partial gain or loss is recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are
housed in a subsidiary. the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016.

ias 1, ‘presentation of financial statements’ these amendments are as part of the iasb initiative to improve presentation and disclosure in financial
reports. effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2016.
annual improvements 2014. these set of amendments, effective 1 january 2016, impacts 4 standards:
  •ifrs 5, ‘non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’ regarding methods of disposal.
  •ifrs 7, ‘financial instruments: disclosures’, (with consequential amendments to ifrs 1) regarding servicing contracts.
  •ias 19, ‘employee benefits’ regarding discount rates.
  •ias 34, ‘interim financial reporting’ regarding disclosure of information

ifrs 16, leases, effective date - 1 january 2019 after ten years of joint drafting by the iasb and fasb they decided that lessees should be required to
recognise assets and liabilities arising from all leases (with limited exceptions) on the balance sheet. lessor accounting has not substantially changed in
the new standard. the model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation
to pay for that right. in response to concerns expressed about the cost and complexity to apply the requirements to large volumes of small assets, the
iasb decided not to require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases (less than 12 months), and leases for which the underlying
asset is of low value (such as laptops and office furniture). a lessee measures lease liabilities at the present value of future lease payments. a lessee
measures lease assets, initially at the same amount as lease liabilities, and also includes costs directly related to entering into the lease. lease assets
are amortised in a similar way to other assets such as property, plant and equipment.

this approach will result in a more faithful representation of a lessee’s assets and liabilities and, together with enhanced disclosures, will provide
greater transparency of a lessee’s financial leverage and capital employed.

one of the implications of the new standard is that there will be a change to key financial ratios derived from a lessee’s assets and liabilities (for
example, leverage and performance ratios). ifrs 16 supersedes ias 17, ‘leases’, ifric 4, ‘determining whether an arrangement contains a lease’, sic
15, ‘operating leases – incentives’ and sic 27, ‘evaluating the substance of transactions involving the legal form of a lease’.
there are no other ifrss or ifric interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b)consolidation
(i) subsidiaries
   subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. the group controls an entity when the group is exposed
   to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
   subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. they are deconsolidated from the date that control
   ceases.

   the group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is
   the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. the
   consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. identifiable assets
   acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
   the group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling
   interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

   acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

   if the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree
   is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

   	any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. subsequent changes to the fair value
   of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with ias 39 either in profit or loss or as a change
   to other comprehensive income. contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted
   for within equity.

   inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. unrealised losses are also
   eliminated. when necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform to the group’s accounting policies.

   acquisition of entities under common control is accounted for using predecessor accounting.

(ii) changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control
   transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with
   the owners in their capacity as owners. the difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying
   value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

(iii) disposal of subsidiaries
   when the group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the
   change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for
   the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. in addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income
   in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. this may mean that amounts
   previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.

(iv) associates
   associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20%
   and 50% of the voting rights. investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. under the equity method, the
   investment is initially recognised at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of
   the investee after the date of acquisition. the group’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition.



                                 tps eastern africa limited annual report and financial statements 2015                                              49

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(b)consolidation (continued)
   if the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously
   recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.

   the group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other
   comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment.
   when the group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the group
   does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

   the group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. if this is the
   case, the group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and
   recognises the amount adjacent to ‘share of profit/(loss) of associates in the income statement.

   profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the group and its associate are recognised in the group’s financial
   statements only to the extent of unrelated investor’s interests in the associates. unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides
   evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with
   the policies adopted by the group. dilution gains and losses arising in investments in associates are recognised in the income statement.

(v) joint arrangements
   the group applies ifrs 11 to all joint arrangements. under ifrs 11 investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or
   joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor. ifrs gaap plc has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements
   and determined them to be joint ventures. joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

   under the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the group’s
   share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income.

   when the group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interests in the joint ventures (which includes any long-term interests
   that, in substance, form part of the group’s net investment in the joint ventures), the group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred
   obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint ventures.

   unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in the joint ventures.
   unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

   accounting policies of the joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.

(vi) separate financial statements
    in the separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost less impairment. cost is adjusted to reflect
    changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. cost also includes direct attributable costs of investment.

   dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

(c) functional currency and translations of foreign currencies
(i) functional and presentation currency		
     items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in
     which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). the consolidated financial statements are presented in kenya shillings, which is the company’s
     functional and presentation currency.
(ii) transactions and balances		
     foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation
     where items are re-measured. foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at
   year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(c) functional currency and translation of foreign currencies (continued)
   foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in the income statement within ‘finance income or cost’. all other foreign
   exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within ‘other operating income’ or ‘other expenses’.

   translation differences related to changes in amortised cost are recognised in the income statement, and other changes in carrying amount are
   recognised in other comprehensive income.

   translation differences on non-monetary financial assets and liabilities, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are recognised in
   the income statement as part of the fair value gain or loss. translation differences on non-monetary financial assets, such as equities classified as
   available-for-sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income.		

(iii) group companies		
   the results and financial position of all the group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional
   currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

    (i)     assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period;
    (ii)    income and expenses for each income statement amount are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable
            approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at
            the dates of the transactions); and
    (iii)   all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the currency translation reserve.
   on consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to other comprehensive
   income. when a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that are recorded in equity are recognised in the income
   statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.

   goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and
   translated at the closing rate.

(d) segment reporting
   operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (codm). the
   codm who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments has been identified as the managing
   director who makes strategic decisions.

(e) revenue recognition		
   revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the group’s
   activities. revenue is shown net of value-added tax (vat), returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group. the group
   recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the group and
   when specific criteria have been met for each of the group’s activities as described below. the group bases its estimates on historical results, taking
   into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.

   revenue is recognised as follows:
    (i)     sales of goods are recognised in the period in which the group has delivered products to the customer, and there is no unfulfilled obligation
            that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. delivery does not occur until the products have been accepted by the customer.
    (ii)    sales of services are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction
            assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a percentage of the total services to be provided.
    (iii) interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
    (iv) dividends are recognised as income in the period in which the right to receive payment is established.

2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(f) property, plant and equipment
   all categories of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. land and buildings are subsequently shown at fair value, based on
   periodic, but at least every five year, valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation for buildings. all other property,
   plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition
   of the items.

   subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that
   future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. all other repairs and
   maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.

   increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are credited to a revaluation surplus reserve in equity. decreases that offset previous
   increases of the same asset are charged against the revaluation surplus; all other decreases are charged to profit or loss. each year the difference
   between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset (the depreciation charged to profit or loss) and depreciation based on the
   asset’s original cost is transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings.

   depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight line method to write down their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their
   estimated useful lives, as follows:

                                                   useful life                                                residual values
                            land and buildings over the period of the lease                                         35%
                                     computers 3 - 4 years                                                            -
                                 motor vehicles 4 years                                                               -
                         furniture and fittings 10 years                                                            25%
                               lift installations 10 years                                                          25%
                            laundry equipment 10 years                                                              25%

   the assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

   on opening of a new unit, initial purchases of operating equipment, such as crockery and beddings are capitalised at cost and subsequent
   replacements to maintain operating equipment at par stock level are expensed in the year of purchase. carrying values are validated every three
   years.

   	an asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its
   estimated recoverable amount.

   gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are included in profit or
   loss. on disposal of revalued assets, amounts in the revaluation surplus relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings.

(g) intangible assets
   goodwill

   	goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the
   company’s interest in net fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree and the fair value of the non-
   controlling interest in the acquiree.

   for the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cgus, or groups of cgus, that is
   expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(g) intangible assets (continued)
   goodwill (continued)
   each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for
   internal management purposes. goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.

   goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.
   the carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. any
   impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.

(h) impairment of non-financial assets
   	assets that have an indefinite useful life – for example, goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use- are not subject to amortisation and are tested
   annually for impairment. assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
   that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds
   its recoverable amount. the recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

   for the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
   generating units). non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each
   reporting date.

(i) financial assets
(i) classification
   the group classifies its financial assets under loans and receivables. the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were
   acquired. management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates such designation periodically.

   loans and receivables
   loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value (plus transaction costs) and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
   interest method. they are included in current assets, loans and receivables are included in receivables and prepayments in the statement of
   financial position.

(ii) offsetting financial instruments
   financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right
   to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(iii) impairment of financial assets		
   assets carried at amortised cost		
   the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
   impaired. a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is objective evidence of
   impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has
   an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.		

   	evidence of impairment may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or
   delinquency in interest or principal payments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, and where observable
   data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears or economic conditions that correlate
   with defaults.




                                    tps eastern africa limited annual report and financial statements 2015                                             53

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
   for loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value
   of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective
   interest rate. the carrying amount of the asset is reduced and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. if a loan has a variable interest
   rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. as a practical
   expedient, the group and company may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value using an observable market price.

(j) accounting for leases
   	leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. payments
   made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.

   the group leases certain property, plant and equipment. leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks
   and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the fair value
   of the lease property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. 		

(k) inventories
   inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. cost is determined by the weighted average method and computed as the cost of
   purchase plus any incidental costs incurred in bringing inventory items to their present location. net realisable value is the estimate of the selling
   price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. inventories mainly comprise hotel consumables, food
   and beverage items.

(l) receivables		
   trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. if collection
   is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are a classified as current assets. if not, they are
   presented as non-current assets.

   trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less
   provision for impairment (note i).

   receivables are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from financial assets has expired or where the company has transferred
   substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

(m) payables
   trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. accounts
   payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). if
   not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

   payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. payables are
   derecognised when extinguished.

(n) share capital		
   ordinary shares are classified as ‘share capital’ in equity. any premium received over and above the par value of the shares is classified as ‘share
   premium’ in equity.

(o) cash and cash equivalents
   in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term
   highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in
   current liabilities on the statement of financial position.

(p) employee benefits
(i) retirement benefit obligations		
   for unionised employees in two subsidiaries, the group has an unfunded obligation to pay terminal gratuities under its collective bargaining
   agreement with the union. employees who resign after serving for periods of between five years and ten years, receive eighteen days salary and
   house allowance for each completed year of service at the rate of pay applicable at the date of resigning. those who resign after serving for more
   than ten years receive twenty four days salary and house allowance for each completed year of service. the defined benefit obligation is calculated
   annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.

   the group in kenya operates a defined contribution post-employment benefit scheme for all its permanent employees after their first year of
   employment. the assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund, which is funded by contributions from both the group
   and the employees. the group and all its permanent employees also contribute to the statutory national social security funds, which are defined
   contribution schemes. the group’s contributions to both these defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the year in
   which they fall due. the group has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid.

   the estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense accrual.

(ii) termination benefits
   termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee
   accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. the group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to a
   termination when the entity has a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal. in the
   case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to
   accept the offer. benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.

(q) current and deferred income tax
   the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred income tax. tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that
   it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive
   income or directly in equity respectively.

   the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. management periodically
   evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. it establishes
   provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

   deferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
   their carrying values in the financial statements. however, if the deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition
   of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
   combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. deferred income tax is determined using tax
   rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income
   tax liability is settled.

   deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the
   temporary differences can be utilised.

   deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the
   reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
   future.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
2 summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(q) current and deferred income tax (continued)

   deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities
   and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable
   entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.

(r) borrowings
    borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using
   the effective interest method; any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income
   statement over the period of the borrowings

   borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months
   after the reporting date.

(s) dividend distribution
   dividend distribution to the company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared. dividends are declared
   upon approval at the annual general meeting. proposed dividends are disclosed separately within equity until declared.

(t) comparatives
   where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.

3 critical accounting estimates and judgements		
   	estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including experience of future events
   that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.		

(i) critical accounting estimates and assumptions
   the group and company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. the resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom
   equal the related actual results. the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
   amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below.		

   impairment of goodwill
   the group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2(h). the
   recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations require the use of
   estimates (note 20).		

   impairment of property
   the group has assessed impairment of property in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2(h).

   income taxes
   the group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. significant judgement is required in determining the group’s provision for income
   taxes. there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
   the group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. where the final tax
   outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax
   provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

   gratuity scheme obligations				
   the present value of the gratuity obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
   the assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) for gratuity include the discount rate and future salary increases.

notes to the financial statements (continued)
3 critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)
    gratuity scheme obligations (continued)
    any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of gratuity obligations.

    the group relies on an independent actuary to determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of the year. this is the interest rate that should
    be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.

    other key assumptions for gratuity obligations are based in part on current market conditions. additional information is disclosed in note 16.
(ii) critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
    in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies, management has made judgements in determining:
    • the classification of financial assets and leases
    • whether financial and non-financial assets are impaired.

4 financial risk management
    the group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk and the effects of changes in debt and equity market prices,
    foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial
    markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.

    financial risk management is carried out by the board of directors under the guidance of management. board of directors identifies, evaluates
    and hedges financial risks. the board of directors provides guidance on principles for overall risk management covering specific areas such
    as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess
    liquidity.

    market risk
(i) foreign exchange risk
    the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to
    the us dollar. foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign
    operations.

    the group aims to minimise volatility arising from fluctuations in exchange rates by adopting natural hedges such as holding cash balances in
    foreign currencies to hedge against any foreign currency denominated amounts payable.

    the group manages foreign exchange risk by converting its foreign currency collections into local currency on an ongoing basis to cater for its
    operational requirements. as a result, the group does not hold large amounts of foreign currency deposits. in addition, the group receives its
    collections in foreign currency and therefore any future foreign currency commercial transactions are settled in the same currency to avoid the effect
    of swinging currency exchange rates.

    currency exposure arising from the net assets of foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign
    currencies.

    at 31 december 2015, if the shilling had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the us dollar with all other variables held constant, consolidated
    post tax loss for the year and equity would have been shs 11,486,465 (2014: profit for the year of shs 7,863,939) higher/lower, mainly as a result
    of us dollar receivables, payables and bank balances.
    the company has no balances denominated in foreign currencies.
(ii) price risk
    the group does not have any assets subject to price risk as at 31 december 2015 (2014: nil).

notes to the financial statements (continued)
4 financial risk management (continued)
   market risk (continued)
(iii) cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
   the group has borrowings at variable rates. the group does not hedge itself against interest rate risk. no limits are placed on the ratio of variable
   rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing. at 31 december 2015, an increase/decrease of 10% on interest rate would have resulted in an increase/
   decrease in consolidated post tax loss for the year and equity of shs 22,017,581 (2014: profit of shs 22,746,492).

   credit risk
   credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures to customers,
   including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations
   resulting in financial loss to the group.

   the credit controller is responsible for managing and analysing credit risk for each new customer before standard payment and delivery terms are
   offered. credit risk arises from cash at bank and short term deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. the group does not have
   any significant concentrations of credit risk.

   for banks and financial institutions, only reputable well established financial institutions are accepted. for trade receivables, the credit controller
   assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. the utilisation of credit
   limits is regularly monitored.

   the maximum exposure for credit risk equals the amounts disclosed on the statement of financial position in 2015 and 2014.

   related party and other receivables are neither past due nor impaired. the group’s bankers are reputable and sound financial institutions.
   there were no assets that are past due or impaired except for the following amounts in trade receivables (which are due within 30 days
   of the end of the month in which they are invoiced):
                                                                                           group                                    company

4 financial risk management (continued)
  liquidity risk
  prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash securities, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of
  committed credit facilities. due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, management maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining
  availability under committed credit lines. management monitors rolling forecasts of the group’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flows.
  the table below analyses the group’s and the company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the
  reporting date to the contractual maturity date. the amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. balances due
  within 12 months equal their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

capital risk management
the group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group
may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new capital or sell assets to reduce debt.
during 2015 the group’s strategy, which was unchanged from 2014, was to maintain a gearing ratio below 40%. the gearing ratios at 31 december
2015 and 2014 as follows:

 the reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from accommodation, food and beverage sales.
 the managing director assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profits before depreciation and amortisation, interest and
 tax, which is a measure of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). the measure also excludes the effects of
 unrealised gains/losses on financial instruments. interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by
 the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the group.
 the segment information provided to the managing director for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 december 2015 is as follows:

the carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate to their fair value. fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate
based upon the borrowing rate that directors expect would be available to the group at the balance sheet date. it is impracticable to assign fair values
to the group’s long term liabilities due to inability to forecast interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes.

none of the above borrowings was in default at any time in the year. the group had undrawn facilities of shs 240,933,000 for the year ended 31
december 2015.

under ias 19 revised, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the other comprehensive income. consistent with prior year, actuarial losses are
charged to income statement on the basis of materiality. the charge to profit or loss in 2015 is made up of interest charge and current service cost.

assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice, published statistics and experience in the industry. the directors
do not anticipate variation of the assumptions to impact the obligations significantly.

in the opinion of the directors, the provision for gratuity entitlement for employees fairly reflects the group’s future obligation under the terms of the
collective bargaining agreement. the scheme has no dedicated assets.

the kenyan company ceased operating the unfunded gratuity scheme and transferred the amount held to a pension scheme in 2014.

a summary of the segment level goodwill allocation is presented in note 5.
the recoverable amount of an operating segment is determined based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations use cash flow projections based
on financial projections approved by management covering a five-year period. cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated
growth rates. the growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the respective businesses in which the operating segments
operate.
key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations:

rates.
vii) guarantees
tps eastern africa limited has provided a corporate guarantee to the lenders of tanruss investment limited, the owner of dar es salaam serena hotel,
for an amount of shs 651,300,000 (2014: 407,700,000) which was obtained to settle loans to the previous owners and to fund capital expenditure
during the year.
the company has also provided corporate guarantee of shs 1,120,000,000, shs 65,000,000 and shs 400,800,000 to lenders of tourism promotion
services (kenya) limited, tps (op) limited and tourism promotion services (tanzania) limited respectively .
29 contingent liabilities
	at 31 december 2015, tourism promotion services (kenya) limited had given guarantees amounting to shs 7,800,000 (2014: shs 7,800,000) to banks
on behalf of third parties for supply of goods and services.
tourism promotion services (kenya) limited is a defendant in various legal actions and claims made by third parties. in the opinion of the directors,
after taking appropriate legal and other advice, no material liabilities are expected to crystallise from these claims. consequently no provision has been
set against the claims in the books of accounts.
there are some open tax issues with tax authorities and local authorities in respect of a subsidiary and an associate. the view of directors is that no
additional liabilities will arise from these matters.
30 commitments
capital expenditure contracted for at the reporting date but not recognised in the financial statements is as follows:
                                                                                                                                    group
