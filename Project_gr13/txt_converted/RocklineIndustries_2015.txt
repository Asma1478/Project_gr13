                                                rockline has grown and changed a great
                                                deal since we started our sustainability
                                                program in 2008. what hasn’t changed is
                                                our commitment to reducing our
                                                environmental impact.

                                                 rockline has always been a company that
                                                 works to do the right thing and focuses on
                                                 continuous improvement – which is really
                                                 what sustainability is all about. we
continue to drive improvement in our sustainability metrics. we retired our 2015 goals this
year and i am excited to share that we exceeded targets for energy, greenhouse gas
emissions, solid waste and land�ill rate, and made encouraging progress in transportation.
our achievements would not have been possible without the commitment and dedication of
our associates around the world. there is still work to be done on our water use; we must
continue to look for new and innovative ways to reduce it.

transparency is an integral part of our program. providing the hard data allows our
stakeholders to see where we hit our goals and where we fell short – knowing that our
work is never done.

as we look ahead to 2020 and our next set of targets, we know there will be challenges. our
intent is to remain fully engaged in identifying opportunities to enhance our sustainable
business practices and to stay focused on the things we can control. we will also keep our
eyes on our aspirations, and work toward an even more sustainable rockline.

we look forward to sharing our progress with you, and we appreciate you taking the time
to read this year’s report. as always, we welcome your feedback.

mission statement
rockline will take positive steps to develop environmentally sustainable
processes, products, packaging, and raw materials throughout the supply
chain that will deliver long-term value for our customers, communities,
and associates.


rockline values
      renew invest all earnings in continuous improvement
     respect treat others as we want to be treated
             (associates, suppliers, customers, community and environment)

   integrity do the right thing
  teamwork individual goals are secondary to team goals
  excellence best in class

organizational pro�ile
rockline industries is a privately-held manufacturer of wet wipe, coffee �ilter, and baking
cup products, headquartered in sheboygan, wis. founded in plymouth, wis. in 1976 by
ralph rudolph, rockline has grown to become a global enterprise.

rockline’s environmental sustainability program was started in 2008. the program is driven
by the recognition that the world’s population is growing and consuming resources at an
unprecedented rate, leading to more waste and more carbon emissions than ever before. we
have always sought to deliver long-term value to our customers, and today that means
offering them the highest quality product from the most sustainable business practices. if
we can accomplish this, we can ensure future generations have the resources and
opportunities to live full and healthy lives. more and more, consumers recognize this fact
and our customers increasingly expect best practices from us and we aim to deliver. our
program follows a top-down approach with executive review annually and an environmental
steering committee driving direction on strategic initiatives. we have successfully embedded
sustainability throughout the organization through designated green leads within our
facilities who are responsible for implementing speci�ic initiatives.

                                                                                               3

the purpose of this report is to update stakeholders on rockline’s progress against our sustainability
goals. rockline is committed to measuring, reporting and improving our environmental performance.


boundaries
this report covers operations over which rockline exercises �inancial control, with the exception of two
minor subsidiaries, rockline netherlands b.v. and rockline trading hong kong, which represent less
than 1% of our global business activities and environmental impact; and our russellville, arkansas
facility, which started operating in fiscal 2015. we have also excluded soshio (hk) industrial co. ltd., our
chinese manufacturing partner, as we do not exercise �inancial control over their operations.


scope
the greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions data in this report are comprised primarily of scope 1 and scope 2
data from our manufacturing facilities and of�ices. this report also contains a limited amount of scope 3
data (ghg emissions from outbound shipping of our �inished goods to customers).


methodology
unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all data, �igures and charts cover the period of our �iscal year
ending in 2015, which runs from july 1, 2014 to june 30, 2015. the data in this report has been collected
from invoices and statements of account sent to rockline by our utility providers and other vendors. we
have calculated our carbon footprint using the greenhouse gas protocol corporate standard, as well as
emission coef�icients from the united states environmental protection agency (us epa) and the united
kingdom department of farm, environment, and rural affairs (uk defra). in 2014, the us epa updated
the emissions factors and our data were adjusted to re�lect these updates. this is our seventh annual
report. our previous report was published in october 2014, covering our �iscal year 2014 (july 1, 2013,
to june 30, 2014). prior years’ data may be restated due to more accurate information.


stakeholders
our stakeholders were identi�ied as customers, suppliers, associates, and communities in 2008 by our
environmental sustainability steering committee. since then, we have engaged our stakeholders in a
myriad of ways. we have integrated environmental sustainability metrics into our supplier reviews and
have engaged suppliers in designing their own sustainability programs. we have engaged our customers
and play an active role in many of their sustainability programs, as well. we have an obligation to the
communities in which we operate to ensure we do our part to make them livable, clean, and safe.


contact
we welcome and appreciate all inquiries and feedback pertaining to our environmental
sustainability program.

3-tier vision
    long         term — aspirations
    aspirations are our hope for what a completely sustainable rockline might look like, at some point in
    the future.

    medium                  term           —      multi-year                  goals
    rockline’s �irst set of multi-year goals was retired in 2015. the current goals are set for our �iscal year
    2020 and are outlined on page 10. these more ambitious goals give shape to where rockline is
    headed in a strategic sense.

    short          term — annual goals
    rockline sets annual sustainability targets, as a way of measuring our progress from year to year.
    these goals are small, incremental steps toward sustainability.

energy
  our springdale, ark. facility replaced all production forced air heat systems, with 99%+ efficient ventless
  radiant heaters.




                                                                            recycling
  our springdale, ark. facility added air ducts to utilize exhaust heat from compressors to heat the warehouse.




                               energy
  our redditch, uk facility is undertaking an energy savings opportunity scheme to help identify
  excessive or unnecessary use of energy within the facility.

  our montville, n.j. facility reduced the number of propane forklifts, and within the 2015 calendar
  year, will be down to one.



  solid waste and land�ill
  our montville, n.j. facility maintained a recycle rate of approximately 99%.




 propane
  our sheboygan, wis. facility will begin recycling label backing in 2016.
  our montville, n.j. facility averaged 99 days between visits to the landfill.
  our booneville, ark. facility is actively pursuing opportunities for the re-use or recycling of baled
  substrates. this will be a continued focus in fiscal 2016.




  transportation
  rockline implemented a de-consolidation center in fife, wa where 40-foot containers are transferred to
  53-foot trailers, eliminating one container to be drayed inland for every three containers received. as a
  result of fife’s start-up on the west coast and the 2014 opening of the charleston east coast crossdock,
  no ocean containers will be coming inland with finished goods.

  a re-design of the layout of our liberty warehouse in booneville, ark has eliminated 976 forklift miles in




                                    recycle

in early fiscal 2015, the environmental sustainability steering committee came together to discuss our next
set of medium-term goals to guide our work until 2020. our conversation centered on what will make a
meaningful impact on our environmental footprint – and also what makes business sense. the committee
determined that we need to continue to build upon our past sustainability performance and renew our goals
in six operational areas that we have control over: energy, greenhouse gas emissions, water, solid waste,
landfill rate, and transportation. these renewed goals extend and reinforce rockline’s initiative to further
reduce the intensity in these focus areas. this direction also aligns with our corporate values of respecting
the environment and investing in continuous improvement. rockline is committed to the goals and the
steering committee believes that these targets will continue to drive innovation and transformation, enhancing
the way rockline operates across our entire business.

 looking ahead
thank you for taking the time to read our 2015 sustainability report. in this, our seventh annual report,
rockline is again demonstrating our commitment to open reporting of our performance. the report
addresses some of the challenges rockline is facing and showcases the achievements we have made in our
journey to further our commitment to environmental responsibility.

as we retire our 2015 goals, there are many victories to celebrate, but at the same time, we know that our
work toward a sustainable future is never truly �inished. as we grow, we will require more resources and our
focus will be growing with the least possible environmental impact.

i want to thank our steering committee for their commitment to rockline sustainability and for their help in
setting the direction for our 2020 goals. and i also want to thank our green teams for their dedicated focus
and creativity in �inding ways to continuously improve.

i am looking forward to seeing what we can achieve in these next �ive years!

we invite you to contact us with any questions or comments.

      kind regards,

      nina m. schaub
