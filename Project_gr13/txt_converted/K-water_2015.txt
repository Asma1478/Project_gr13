management program, and has been fulfilling its commitments. since the introduction of the ghg emission reduction goal in 2012, it has                                             resourced power plants, producing 2,209 gwh of clean energy
met its annual targets for three consecutive years. in 2014, k-water’s ghg emissions were reduced to 624,660 ton of co2, down 1% from                                              – equivalent to 3.77 million barrels of crude oil or a reduction of
2013 through energy and resource reduction efforts. k-water’s directly emitted ghg is mostly from pump operation for tap water supply,                                             970 thousand tons of co2. we have been proactively pursuing                                               3.37                                                           970
