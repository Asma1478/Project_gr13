2015 was a busy year for alstria. with the takeover of deutsche ofﬁce, the size of our port-
folio has more than doubled, creating a number of management and integration challenges.
nevertheless, this did not stop our effort to lead the way into sustainable real estate. we have
continued to make progress in reducing our overall carbon footprint and have extended the
application of our processes to the portfolio of deutsche ofﬁce.
in 2013, we decided to change our procurement policy to 100 % renewable energy to both
reduce our carbon emissions and stimulate the market for renewable energy. in 2015, we
reached our goal, with 100 % of the electricity procured by alstria being generated from
renewable sources. this move gave us the opportunity to improve our procurement process.
as a result, we have managed to get out of the carbon electricity market and simultaneously
reduce our overall electricity costs.
though our goal ﬁrst and foremost is to exit the carbon world as much as possible, we
are also looking to improve the energy efﬁciency of our operations. thus, we have sought




                                                                                                       management letter
iso 50001 certiﬁcation for our energy-management processes and obtained it over the
course of 2015. we also improved our reporting practices. for the ﬁrst time this year, we
have sought to receive third-party assurance for our non-ﬁnancial data. this assurance was
obtained for the data included in this report, and the certiﬁcate can be found in appendix c.
although we have made substantial progress in working to improve the efﬁciency of our
assets, there is still a lot to do to reduce the overall carbon footprint of our real estate. we are
now in the process of offering our tenants and employees the opportunity to beneﬁt from
our electricity procurement, allowing them to beneﬁt from reduced prices while switching
to renewable energies. the more our tenants subscribe to this concept, the lower the overall
carbon footprint of our portfolio will be in the future.
finally, we have continued to invest in r&d projects, either directly through our beehive-
co-working project or indirectly through investment in venture capital or grants to university
research. we strongly believe that our industry is underinvested in r&d and should be doing
more in that ﬁeld. we are committed to continuing on our current path, as our industry is
going through fundamental changes and its future is being designed as we speak, mainly
by players found outside of the industry. we need to take this process into our own hands
or risk having to pay a hefty price to catch up later.

we hope you enjoy reading this report as much as we enjoyed writing it and look forward
to your feedback.


kind regards

                                    business
                                     model
                 our business model can be summarized as follows: we buy and manage ofﬁce proper-
                 ties in germany. as a long-term-oriented owner, we focus on the expansion and active
                 management of our property portfolio. we have a fully integrated operating platform and
                 manage the assets throughout their life cycle. close relationships with our tenants, a high
                 degree of social responsibility and dedicated employees ensure a sustainable revenue base.
                 for our shareholders, our strategy facilitates a stable and predictable cash ﬂow and adequate
                 risk-adjusted returns.
                 given the limited opportunities for any quick or short-term trading of properties, which is
                 inherent in our business model, sustainability comes as a natural feature. we carefully manage
                 global sustainability challenges and consistently seize opportunities to develop innovative
                 solutions for our stakeholders.
                 driving a sustainable portfolio investment has a positive effect on all of our major business
                 areas. this can lead to an increased client demand, reduced speed of obsolesce, reduced
                 vacancy rate, reduced rates of depreciating and lower operational costs. at the same time,
                 delivering buildings in a better performing condition than they were received contributes in
                 reducing their carbon footprint. in addition, more than in any other business, our success
                 is directly linked to the location on which we invest. thus, we have a vested interest in the
                 strong development of the local community. we are convinced that a lasting economic
business model




                 success can only be materialized when we act responsibly against the environment and the
                 society that surround us.

                 our business objective is to create and manage efﬁcient ofﬁce spaces with enduring appeal to
                 our tenants. at every different stage of our business cycle, we work closely with our tenants,
                 partners and the communities in which we operate in order to safeguard their interest and
                 fulﬁl their expectations.
                 we manage almost all of our assets with our own property managers; thus, we are in a
                 position to better control real estate risks and act immediately when opportunities arise.
                 across our business, we build strong relations with our employees and the communities,
                 invest in bettering the building environment and thus create added value to the society.

                  we try as much as we can to keep an open ear for
                  our local communities’ concerns. this year we had the            5,352 m2
                  chance to offer space to the city of hamburg in one
                  of our buildings near the central station to support the

                  refugees’ action plan. we also continued supporting               leasing
                  the humanitarian work of unicef by providing it with
                  a lease in one of our buildings in hamburg at pref-
                  erential terms. we try to raise the standards among
                  our peers by leasing 5,352 m2 total space for diverse
                  cultural causes.


                                                        in july 2015, alstria was the ﬁrst real estate company

of electricity from renewable sources and 100 % of                 energy
climate-neutral natural gas for the energy we obtain
for our tenants, for the landlord shared services in our
portfolio and for our corporate ofﬁces. as one of germany’s largest real estate companies, we
bear responsibility to maximize our climate change action, and we thus raise the awareness
among our tenants to source renewable electricity. while we understand that the electricity
used in some of our assets might still be generated by fossil fuels, we are working to increase
demand for renewable energy and therefore incentivize investment in that ﬁeld.

           the reduction of carbon emissions is more and more becoming the key currency for all
           business operations. we see a trend toward the intensiﬁcation of all efforts to minimize
           carbon emissions on the governmental side. this post-paris trend will further develop as the
           scheme of the climate agreement ﬁnds its way into new domestic and national laws and
           restrictions regarding carbon emissions. this new era will bring challenges along with new
           opportunities, from which the real estate sector can beneﬁt. taking that into account, we
           will continue investing in research and innovation and try to keep ourselves and our assets
           in the best-in-class position.

           even if we make progress on that ﬁeld, data gathering will continue to be one of our great-
           est challenges in the future. the reason for this is that our tenants consume the major part
           of the energy and are the ones accountable for the majority of the ghg emissions in our
           operations. we must therefore rely on their cooperation and engage with them in order
           to achieve signiﬁcant carbon reductions. at the beginning of 2017, we are expecting to
           receive all energy consumption data from all the common areas of our buildings. this will
           be accomplished by installing smart meters. by using such systems, we are expecting to fully
           monitor the efﬁciency of our buildings and realize instant reductions on carbon emissions.

           we encourage dialogue and support our tenants in all decisions related to our buildings’
           efﬁciency. as of this year, we have successfully disclosed a framework agreement to procure
           renewable energy for our common areas. having achieved fair conditions on setting up the
           contract, we decided to offer the same beneﬁcial conditions to our tenants and employees,
           with us making no proﬁt. participation in the framework contract will have an immediate
           impact on the reduction of our portfolio’s carbon footprint. more information is available

           our real estate expertise allows us to recommend energy solutions that suit our tenants’
           individual needs. we are planning in 2017 to extend our energy training and additional
           information material we provide to our tenants in order to stimulate them in adopting
           environmentally sound practices.

                          challenges that our industry faces. such collaboration can also help to increase the level of
                          inﬂuence we have and promote systemic change. to this end, we are involved in a number
                          of local and global industry collaborations, partnerships and multi-stakeholder initiatives.

                          over the course of 2015, we held more than 270 meetings in eight different countries to
                          meet our institutional shareholders and keep them informed about the performance of
                          our company. with respect to the issuance of our ﬁrst benchmark bond (volume eur 500
                          million), we also initiated our ﬁrst debt roadshow. the special information requirements of
                          our new investors in the debt capital market will be an integral part of our investor relations
                          activities going forward.

                          our management roadshows and participation in numerous investment conferences all
                          around the globe ensured a constant dialogue with our shareholders. in addition, we carried
                          out a number of site visits to our properties, mainly in hamburg, düsseldorf and frankfurt.
                          furthermore, in order to maintain a constant dialogue, not only with our equity investors

    sustainability report 2015 / 2016

                               16


                                                 in d u st ry pa rt n er ships
                         since the company’s founding, we have participated in a number of working groups and
                         answered a number of public inquiries with respect to accounting, regulatory and sustainability
                         related topics. we are mainly engaged in initiatives aiming at improving transparency and
                         innovation in the real estate sector. this involvement gives us the opportunity to anticipate
                         future regulatory requirements, identify new trends at an early stage and be in a position to
                         take part in the new trend-setting process. as for the year 2015, our management board
                         invested 48 hours and around eur 50,000 in supporting relevant organizations.

                         with regard to sustainability, our company is engaged
                         in industry discussions at the highest industry level.
                         alstria’s ceo was part of the working group that set up
                         the global reporting initiative (gri) construction and
                         real estate sector supplement (cress) group, which
                         offers gri reporting-speciﬁc principles for the prepa-
                         ration of sustainability reports for the industry. moreo-
                         ver, the company contributed to the work around the
                         gri-g4 guidelines, a process in which our ceo was a
                         member of the ghg emissions working group.

                         alstria’s ceo is further involved in several working

                         groups at epra and currently holds the chair position
                         of epra’s sustainability committee and is a member of
                         epra’s advisory board. epra represents the interests of
                         the major european property management companies
                         and supports the development and market presence of
                         these companies by establishing, among others, best
                         practice recommendations in the ﬁelds of accounting,
                         reporting and sustainability.

                         alstria’s cfo is a member of the working group discus-
                         sions regarding climate change and sustainability within
                         zia. zia (german property federation) is a regulatory
                         and economic lobby group for policy in the property
                         sector. other alstria senior managers are involved in
                         working groups of zia on various topics, such as cor-
                         porate responsibility, innovation and ofﬁce properties
                         management. further discussions we held with the
                         ‘initiative corporate governance der deutschen immo-
                         bilienwirtschaft e. v.’ and the ‘dnk multi-stakeholder
                         forum’ focused on the development of the german
                         sustainability code.

                         since 2010, we are actively participating in the devel-
                         opment of green leases in germany. this year, we took
                         part in two working groups (green lease 2.0, zia-ag
                         green lease) and contributed to discussions with our
                         real estate expertise. we intend to use all or part of
                         green lease standards within our own lease contracts
                         in the coming years.

                                       in addition, we are a member of the german sus-

                                       finally, since 2010 we have supported the hamburg

                                                         our
                                                      priorities

                         we have developed over the years a sustainability approach tailored to address our different
                         stakeholders’ interests. to determine what is most relevant to our stakeholders, we decided
                         in 2014 / 2015 to review our priorities and align our resources and strategy accordingly. this
                         process included a survey that was sent to 1,420 identiﬁed stakeholders (shareholders, debt
                         providers, analysts, tenants, employees, press and others) and received a response rate of
                         4.3 %. the results obtained from this survey allowed us to produce the materiality matrix
                         presented below.
                         each point on this matrix represents a material aspect for alstria. the color of its material
                         aspect represents the category to which it belongs. the area on the top right of the map
                         contains the eight most important priority topics for alstria among those 17 examined.

                         a closer look at the materiality matrix shows that some topics of sustainability, such as bio-
                         diversity and transportation, are considered to have a low impact on the company’s opera-
                         tions. this fact alone doesn’t suggest that they are not priority topics for the environment.
                         such topics related to environmental protection are subject to strict european regulations
                         and are therefore perceived as being particularly important for alstria, irrespective of how
                         they are evaluated by the stakeholders. alstria’s efforts to review its sustainability priorities
                         are not limited to the results of this survey only but in fact revolve around all the major trends
                         and challenges that inﬂuence the global real estate market.

material aspects of our approach to sustainability. while these trends are not within our
control, we consider them important since they have a major impact on our business.

                      our business contributes to sustainable development by making our buildings as resource
                      efﬁcient as possible and by developing effective technologies that can automatically adjust
                      to the user behavior. we do this by:

                      having a budget dedicated to the energy efﬁciency of our buildings
                      our main objective when refurbishing our buildings is the creation of efﬁcient ofﬁce space
                      and reduction of the energy consumption and occupancy costs for our tenants. in 2015,
                      we invested approximately eur 28 million in refurbishment measures and eur 11.7 million
                      in development projects.

                      investing in cost-effective solutions
                      every year we review all of our standing assets in order to determine the needs for preventive
                      capital expenditure and renovations. life-cycle costing is the abc of our refurbishment policy.
                      for example, when choosing the appropriate construction techniques for a new renovation
                      project, we avoid using glass-façade as much as possible. this is mainly because of its high
                      thermal conductivity, which results in high-running costs over time. we also favor natural
                      ventilation and try to limit the use of cooling systems in our assets to the maximum extent
                      possible.

                      investing in research and development
                      we support fundamental research as we try to identify the future trends that we should incor-
                      porate in our analysis of our real estate portfolio. starting last year, we continued supporting
                      with a grant of usd 50,000 the research of professor chabinyc’s lab at the university of
                      california, santa barbara as well as his work on organic photovoltaics. we believe that such
                      collaborations are mutually beneﬁcial since they allow us to provide researchers with early




                                                                                                             alstria

                                                                                     25




feedback on whether we can see a direct application of their research to our business, and
they allow us to identify potential game-changing technologies early on at the same time.
this year, we also supported research concerning real estate by providing the university of
hamburg with relevant data. for more information, please see pages 50 to 51.

engaging with our employees and tenants
we help our tenants to make their own business more efﬁcient by sharing our expertise on
ofﬁces and offering them already tested effective solutions. we also encourage our employ-
ees in adopting green practices by offering specialized training. following our successful
certiﬁcation of iso 50001, we organized during this year, training sessions on the topics
of energy efﬁciency for ofﬁce buildings. all of our new as well as existing employees took
part in this training. such investment can eventually minimize our environmental impact.


                          fin a n c ia l h ig h l ights
in 2015, alstria made a substantial step in its corporate development by taking over its
competitor do deutsche ofﬁce ag (‘deutsche ofﬁce’) in a share-for-share transaction. the
combination of both companies allowed us to almost double the ofﬁce real estate portfolio




                                                                                                   economic prosperity
and to build up sizeable sub-portfolios in ﬁve of the six major german ofﬁce markets. the
diversiﬁcation of locations and single-tenant risk signiﬁcantly reduces our corporate risk going
forward and therefore improves the long-term stability of the company. the bigger portfolio
also allowed us to establish local ofﬁces. through the presence of local teams in our main
markets, we are improving the quality of our real estate operations on a sustainable basis,
as we are much closer to our assets and our tenants in our day-to-day business.

on the ﬁnancial side, the combination with deutsche ofﬁce also offered new opportunities,
as the combination of both companies allows us to substantially improve our corporate
efﬁciency and, hence, our operating proﬁt. at the same time, we did not compromise
with regard to our balance sheet quality and maintained our loan-to-value-ratio at around
50 %. the bigger size of the company also allowed us to further diversify our sources of
ﬁnancing. after achieving a bbb investment grade rating by standard & poors, we issued
a ﬁrst corporate bond in november 2015 and a second bond in early 2016 to make use of
the opportunities in the debt capital market.
we continued to redistribute most of our ﬁnancial resources to our shareholders, lenders,
government ofﬁcials, service providers and the wider community as well as our employees.
given the bigger balance sheet of the company and the associated substantial increase of
equity and debt, the distribution to our shareholders and lenders also increased signiﬁcantly.
as a reit company, alstria barely keeps any of the proceeds generated for itself. therefore,
it remunerates the capital it employs (both debt and equity), participates in government
ﬁnancing by paying taxes and stimulates the underlying economy by investing on its assets
and employees.
given the higher number of shares following the capital increase to eur 152.2 million (as
per year-end 2015), the dividend paid out to our shareholders amounted to eur 43.5 million
while our lenders received eur 43.3 million of interest payments for bonds and bank debt.
as of year-end 2015, we employed more than 72 people (excluding temporary student
employees) and paid eur 12.1 million in compensation and beneﬁts for full-time and part-
time employees.

                   on our business

physical variations from climate change, change in consumer behavior and energy consump-
tion practices, as well as new regulatory frameworks, will fundamentally transform the way
the urban landscape is constructed over time.
considering the long-term nature of our business and the immovable nature of our assets,
it is of key importance to take the effect of climate change on our future prospects. we are
thus committed on doing our part to contribute solutions to the global challenge of climate
change.
at alstria, we have implemented a group-wide risk management and an early warning system
in accordance with section (91) of the german stock corporation act. all risks, including
those of climate change, are recorded, evaluated and monitored on at least a quarterly basis.
to counteract climate change, we mainly focus on accelerating the building efﬁciency of
existing assets and avoid participating in greenﬁeld projects.

for a detailed description of the company’s risk management, please refer to the ‘risk and
opportunity report’ section in the annual report 2015, pages 23 to 40.

our main economic risk related to climate change is a regulatory risk. the company is
exposed to the risk of increasingly numerous and constantly changing regulations, notably
with regard to environmental or energy efﬁciency restrictions that might limit the possibility
of letting or operating certain buildings or impose more stringent obligations upon them;
for example, the german energy saving ordinance (enev). this legal norm implements
the eu energy performance of buildings directive 2002 into national law, thus requiring
the establishment of minimum energy performance levels for new and existing buildings.

climate change not only poses risks but also presents us with opportunities. for example,
being able to monitor current and future regulatory changes enables us to better control
the speed of the deterioration of our assets. in addition, changes in outside temperature
extremes give us the opportunity to extend the use of renewable energy sources and maintain
a comfortable indoor temperature in our buildings.

finally, by offering high-performing buildings and communicating with transparency on our
sustainability performance to the public, we gain a competitive advantage against our com-
petitors over the long term. a good reputation can ultimately increase the rental potential of
our portfolio and ultimately our market value for our customers and investors.

in our daily asset management, we take the opportunity and responsibility to support histor-
ical buildings and preserve places of cultural heritage. those refurbishment projects strive to
strike the right balance between the spirit of the asset, its history and future needs to meet
our tenants’ demands for the foreseeable future. by safeguarding historical buildings, we
ultimately increase the cultural value and attractiveness of our portfolio in the leasing markets.
in july 2015, we were honored to have two of our buildings located in the historic kontorhaus
district and speicherstadt in hamburg inscribed to the unesco world heritage list. inscrip-
tion on the list conﬁrms the outstanding universal value of a cultural, property which requires
protection for the beneﬁt of all humanity. as the owner of these buildings, we fully supported
this perennial application process.


                          c ommu n it y pr ojects
since our foundation, we have consistently been committed to supporting the local economy
and to enhancing the quality of life in our surroundings. this year, we continued supporting
a second-league basketball team: ‘hamburg towers’ in wilhemsburg, hamburg. beyond
the sport itself, the purpose of this team is to give younger people – especially those with a
difﬁcult social backround – the opportunity to be involved in sports activities and to develop
an attitude of fair play. to support this goal, approximately 10 % of the hamburg towers’
yearly income is invested in the further development of similar social projects in the area of




                                                                                                     economic prosperity
wilhemsburg.

we try as much as we can to keep an open ear for our local communities’ concerns. in 2015,
we had the chance to offer space to the city of hamburg in one of our buildings near the
central station to support the refugees’ action plan. we also continued supporting the
humanitarian work of unicef in hamburg by providing it with a lease in one of our buildings
at preferential terms. we further provided beneﬁcial rental agreements to diverse art and
cultural exhibitions in hamburg.

for us, social and environmental responsibility sees no geographic boundaries. although all of
our business operations are in germany, where rainfall is high, we do care about the world’s
most eminent problem of water shortage and accessibility. supporting the ‘viva con agua‘
initiative for another year was the least that we could do. the objective of this initiative is to
enable people who are living in developing countries to gain access to drinking water. sixty
percent of viva con agua’s proﬁt goes to long-term drinking water projects. the initiative
generates these funds by selling the water bottles it produces for the purpose of ﬁnancing its
projects. in 2015, we supported the initiative with more than eur 3,402 (2014: eur 3,100).
finally, with regard to our own ofﬁce supplies, we prefer buying only fair-trade coffee and in
that way support better trading and working conditions in developing countries.



                                                  in the coming years, we aim to annually
                                                  support at least two projects related with
                                                  research and development of the real estate

as our business grows, so does our envi-
ronmental responsibility. our real estate
assets, mainly through the tenants’ usage,
are responsible for producing a substan-
tial part of greenhouse gas emissions and
for consuming major resources. focusing
our efforts on finding solutions that meet
our business needs, support our tenants
and benefit the environment is how we try
to live up to this responsibility.

                our business success depends largely on efﬁciently managing our assets and offering long-
                term, appealing solutions to our tenants. in order to remain successful as a business, we
                have acknowledged the importance of laying personal sustainability targets. climate change,
                limited resources and air pollution are some of the major challenges facing our society
                today. at alstria, we believe that only by taking a holistic approach can our society move
                forward. the path to sustainability goes through the reduction of our carbon footprint and
                the resources used per building as well as the increase in the usage of renewable energy
                sources. our business climate change strategy includes short-, medium- and long-term
                plans for the energy and resource consumption of our portfolio and our corporate ofﬁces.

                the climate breakthrough of 2015 has been undoubtedly the paris agreement, where the
                world has decided to limit the global average temperature rise well below 2 degrees above
                pre-industrial levels. following this decision, the german government has immediately
                responded with a development of a national ‘climate action plan 2050’: a ﬂexible policy
                instrument that sets the essential measures and targets for a climate neutral future. the sec-
                tors of the economy mainly affected are: energy, industry, building, transport and agriculture.

                moving from the ‘why’ and ‘when’ to the ‘how,’ we are expecting new national legisla-
                tion on the topics of building and energy efﬁciency in the coming years. we are actively

                 sumption from shared services in the common areas of our buildings, the energy consumption
our buildings




                 (electricity and heating) in the tenant areas, and the energy consumption in our corporate
                 ofﬁces. according to epra’s recommendations, we will report the heating consumptions
                 divided into district heating and heating with fuels (i. e., natural gas, oil, electricity).

                 understanding the different types of utility procurement is particularly important to us for
                 determining the proper portfolio-wide performance measures. the procurement in our port-
                 folio is organized in two types: the landlord-obtained energy and the tenant-obtained energy.
                 as a landlord, we are solely responsible for the energy consumed from the shared services
                 in the common areas of our buildings and for the energy consumed in our corporate ofﬁces.
                 the energy procured in tenant areas is either obtained by alstria and sub-metered to our
                 tenants or exclusively supplied to them by different energy providers. more precisely, the
                 energy for the shared services in the common areas consists of the energy consumption
                 directly in those areas, such as staircase lighting, and of the energy consumption in common
                 technical areas. this includes services provided to the tenants, such as mechanical ventilation
                 and cooling systems.

                 we are continually encouraging our tenants to share their exclusive energy consumption data
                 with us. however, to which extent they cooperate is entirely up to them, and we therefore
                 cannot directly inﬂuence their energy behaviors. in many cases, these data are provided to
                 us, and we are thus able to report on them. yet, alstria has no control over, or means with
                 which to verify, these records.

of our buildings and in our corporate ofﬁces. in 2015, the absolute energy consumption
from our portfolio increased by 19 % compared to 2014. considering the fact that the size
of our portfolio doubled at the end of 2015, we are expecting to see an analogous increase
in the total energy consumption results in 2016.

a full like-for-like comparison of the portfolio consumptions is provided within appendix e.
the like-for-like ﬁgures for electricity from landlord shared services show a reduction of
10 %, which can be attributed to our efforts to reduce the energy consumption in the areas
of our main inﬂuence. on the contrary, the like-for-like ﬁgures for electricity in the tenant
areas show an increase of 5 %.

the overall heating consumption, including district heating and heating with fuels, shows an
overall increase of approximately 9 – 10 % compared to the heating needs of the signiﬁcantly
milder winter of 2014. the same tendencies can be observed in the analysis of the building
energy intensities of our whole portfolio. compared to the previous reporting year, the
energy intensity of landlord- and tenant-obtained energies increased by 15 %. this reﬂects
an increase in the heating and electricity consumption of tenants, mainly due to a longer
heating period as a consequence of a heavier winter.

furthermore, we applied two approaches to the analysis of the energy intensity of our
portfolio: by year of building construction and by region.

the comparison by year of construction shows what we had already been suspecting over
the past few years: the ofﬁce buildings from the era before 1945 have good energetic
behaviors thanks to their typical sturdy structures with solid facades and basic but efﬁcient
building services. buildings from the period of the 1950s to the 1970s are lacking in energy
efﬁciency, as during that time, new building technologies were developed and applied without
considering energy consumption. not surprisingly, buildings from the 1980s appear to have
the worst building efﬁciency in our portfolio. the extensive use of poor-quality glass façades
and non-efﬁcient building technologies in an age of massive corporations’ expansion makes
them perfect candidates for future refurbishment. finally, in the 1990s and the following
two decades, building efﬁciency appears to have gotten steadily better as new energy con-
servation laws and innovative building solutions demonstrate their positive effects already.

the regional analysis of our portfolio shows a wide spectrum of energy intensities. this is
directly linked to the predominant building ages of the regional portfolios. most of the oldest
buildings of our portfolio are located in hamburg, enriched with many buildings from the
1950s to the 1970s. the regional portfolio with the youngest building construction age is
concentrated in the rhein / ruhr area, whereas in stuttgart, our portfolio consists mostly of
building complexes from the 1980s.

                ambitious but necessary target, all business        actions are concentrated on procurement
                sectors, including real estate, need to take        strategies for renewable energies to allow a
                action. one of the top priorities for our long-     quick start into a carbon neutral future.
                term strategy is to reduce the total energy
                consumption of our portfolio.




                         electricity
                we started buying energy from renewable sources in 2013 for covering the electricity demand
                of our controlled areas and when acquiring it on behalf of our tenants. in 2015, we decided
our buildings




                to enter into a framework agreement for procuring 100 % of our electricity from renewable
                sources (hydropower) over a four-year period. with this action, we showed our ambition
                and commitment to running our business with the less harm possible to the environment.

                our ultimate goal is to stimulate our tenants in adopting similar environmentally sound
                practices, and thus, we offer them an opportunity to procure electricity from renewable
                sources with the same conditions of the framework contract. more information for our tenant

                electricity pool is available online at www.mieterstrompool.de. while we understand that
                the electricity actually used in the assets might still be generated by fossil fuels, our inten-
                tion is to increase the demand in the market place for ‘green’ electricity and consequently
                incentivize investment in that ﬁeld.

                german privacy- and energy-related laws until today made it impossible for landlords to
                acquire directly electricity consumption data in the tenant areas. this problem is expected
                to be solved with the new digital metering law ‘digitalisierung der energiewende’ that was
                passed in july 2016. this law will enable landlords to be fully responsible for the implemen-
                tation and maintenance of smart metering systems in their buildings. immediately upon
                being informed of the enactment of the current law, we made the decision to start by the
                end of 2016 with the rollout of smart metering systems for shared services in our buildings.
                the rollout of smart metering for electricity in the tenant areas will follow in 2017. this will
                give us an opportunity to receive all of the consumption data of our portfolio and design
                the appropriate energy-efﬁcient measures.

        heating
our preferred solution with regard to heating systems is district heating. germany’s district
heating supply system uses waste heat from refuse incineration plants and combined heat
and power plants (chps). this process saves energy that otherwise would be lost and
substantially reduces carbon emissions and pollutants. our second choice when it comes to
choosing a heating supply system is natural gas. as of 2015, we were responsible for most
of the procurement of natural gas in our buildings (34 of 48 buildings). with the beginning
of our new framework agreement in 2016, all natural gas we obtain will be carbon neutral
via offsetting.

however, carbon offsetting is not the path we want to pursue. we are strongly convinced
that district heating is the better option, and we thus replace whenever possible fuel-based
heating systems with district heating. in the case where our buildings have no access to a
district heating grid, we choose to replace the old heating systems, such as oil, to ‘cleaner’
and more efﬁcient natural gas.

over the medium term, we assume that district heating will become more carbon neutral
– a development that we will monitor. electric heating, generated by heat pumps, is also
another system we expect to grow in demand in the market. currently, it is not typically
used in large ofﬁce buildings. yet, we believe that heating with electricity from renewable
sources will be a good carbon-neutral alternative for ofﬁces in the long run. in the future, we
might consider switching the heating systems in some of our buildings to alternatives, such
as biogas, hydrogen and electricity, if those present us with better carbon-neutral choices.
by 2050, we expect that most heating consumption will be 100 % carbon neutral.

                 into three parts: resources used in tenant areas, resources used in our corporate ofﬁces and
                 resources used during the redevelopment phase of our buildings.

                 as all of our business operations take place in germany, the water challenges we face are
                 mostly related to an increasingly scaling rate of rainfall events. especially, the water suppliers
                 of the metropolitan regions have to confront problems such as overloaded sewers and water
                 sources, groundwater salinization and ﬁnding new ways of attaining high rates of self-suf-
                 ﬁciency in wastewater treatment processes. for the biggest part of our portfolio (98 of 113
                 buildings), we procure water and then exclusively sub-meter it to our tenants. we believe
                 that, by measuring water consumption properly, we can manage water more effectively;
                 therefore, we publish and share our water usage data every year.

                 the same applies to the measurement of the waste generation of our portfolio. to increase
                 the recycling rate of materials in our portfolio, we have successfully applied a waste man-
                 agement system in 54 out of 113 buildings of our portfolio. the newly acquired deutsche
                 ofﬁce portfolio was also immediately introduced to our waste management system, and
                 we expect to see the ﬁrst results in the next year.

in 2015, the total water consumption (landlord and tenant obtained) from our portfolio
increased by 54 % compared to 2014, which corresponds to the signiﬁcantly bigger portfolio
size following the do acquisition.
the like-for-like ﬁgures for landlord-obtained water consumption show an increase of 12.5 %
and for tenant-obtained water consumption an increase of 2.4 %. a full like-for-like com-

contrary to the previous ﬁgures, the water intensity of our portfolio has dropped down
by 3 % and remains (0,289 m³/m²/day) half as much as the average german ofﬁce water

as a long-term real estate investor, we hold assets over their entire lifecycles. during an
asset’s lifetime, two key moments can result in the creation of signiﬁcant value. the ﬁrst is
when a lease expires and a new lease needs to be put in place. this is the ‘bread and butter’
of each and every real estate company. the second moment is when an asset undergoes
refurbishment or redevelopment. this is the process that shapes the asset for the next 20 to
30 years. it deﬁnes its future cash ﬂow, its ability to be let, and the experience of its occupiers.

at alstria, we design for the safety, health and comfort of the building’s users, including
aspects such as natural lighting and thermal insulation. having the choice between a standard
building technology and an energy-efﬁcient one, we are likely to select a solution subject
to the best available technology at no extra cost (batnec approach). we also design to
enhance the quality of life around our buildings. we thus try to integrate an asset within
a vivid environment, including access to essential day-to-day needs and connectivity to
public transport.

our business model involves an annual review of each of our assets to determine the need
for any preventive capital expenditure and renovations. in 2015, we invested approximately
eur 28 million in refurbishment measures and eur 11.7 million in development projects.
the following table summarizes the highlights of our development activity in 2015.

                our buildings every day are welcoming thousands of employees, visitors, tenants, suppliers
                and contractors. they provide space for businesses to operate more effectively and to con-
                tribute to the well-being of their occupants.
                our goal when we design an ofﬁce space is the creation of long-term value for our tenants,
                our local communities, our partners and ourselves. we consider the following factors to be
                important to increase the immaterial value of our ofﬁce buildings:

                › health and safety
                › visual and thermal comfort
                › indoor air quality
                › ease of access to recreation areas and transport

                health and comfort
                we understand the pivotal role that our buildings play in their environment and the risks
                they may impose to the health of their occupants and the communities surrounding them.
                at alstria, we take the health, safety and comfort of our employees, tenants, suppliers,
                contractors and local communities very seriously. we comply with applicable german health
                and safety regulations.

                our main focus is to prevent potential risks for people and the environment. our objective
                is to rebuild or refurbish buildings to make them more durable and increase the occupants’
our buildings




                well-being. to achieve this, we run for every building that we acquire a due-diligence process
                that includes the monitoring of technical, regulatory, environmental, and health and safety
                procedures and risks, including soil pollution and climate change.

                during the redevelopment of an asset, we communicate our construction activities and
                our time plan to the affected tenants and to the immediate neighbors beforehand. in the
                occasion of a conﬂict of interest, we aim to ﬁnd solutions and to reduce the negative effects
                for our tenants. this includes minimizing the incremental noise generated by our activities
                on all construction sites.

                every construction company working for us is responsible for the safety and training of its
                workers. to ensure optimal work in a construction site, ‘bg bau,’ the german social accident
                insurance institution for the building trade, supervises all of our sites regularly for the safety
                and training of workers. additionally, ‘si-ge-ko,’ the safety and health coordinator, is enti-
                tled to visit on our behalf the construction sites and even to proceed with their closure or
                with the termination of workers’ contracts when proved necessary. since the founding of
                the company in 2006, there have been no fatal accidents neither at our ofﬁces nor at our
                constructions sites.

accessibility to transport
when it comes to real estate, location is everything. in the context of growing cities, the
locations of ofﬁce buildings and their access to transportation networks determine in part
their lettability. due to the immobile nature of our assets and the limited control we have
over their surroundings, it is essential for us to know their connectivity to the urban fabric.
for this reason, we have decided to run a survey on our complete portfolio (119 buildings)
to examine their accessibility to existing transportation systems.
to deﬁne the level of accessibility to transport, we set 13 rating criteria in ﬁve broader
categories: type of transport, number of transport lines, frequency of transport, innovative
transportation models, distance to local supplies and recreational areas.

the ﬁve categories of the survey are:
›public transport: distance to metro / bus / tram stations, bicycle-sharing, car parking
›long distance transport: access / distance to airport, central railway stations, highways
›innovative transport: access / distance to e-mobility, charging stations, car-sharing
›local supply: access / distance to food supply, drugstores, pharmacies, atm / banks
›recreation areas: access / distance to public parks, green areas

the study was focused on the typical interests of the occupants of our buildings. each
criterion was evaluated based on two parameters – distance and access to existing transpor-
tation systems – and was then rated accordingly on a top-down scale: ‘very good’, ‘good’,
‘reasonable’ and ‘poor’.




                                                                                                  our buildings
access to transport of our buildings

very good                          16 %

good                                                      39 %

reasonable                                     35 %

poor                                    19 %



the results of this analysis show that more than 55 % of our buildings have a ‘good’ to ‘very
good’ access to transportation systems and local supplies. this can mainly be attributed to the
composition of our portfolio, with most of our buildings located in dense metropolitan areas.

more than 41 % of our buildings were found to have a charging station for electric cars in a
distance of less than 500 meters. following this new trend, many of our tenants started in
cooperation with us to install charging points in their parking lots for new electric vehicles.
to support the transition to e-mobility, we will continue exploring our sites for potential
public charging stations. following this survey, we will review the buildings that received a
‘poor’ rating and deﬁne the appropriate measures we need to take to improve their transport
accessibility.

                we adopt and adapt necessary technologies to keep our business fresh and our ideas
                sharper. the real estate sector is manifested by innovations and technologies, but still, there
                are only a few companies in the reit industry spending money on r&d. at alstria, we started
                thinking about supporting fundamental research, as we tried to identify the trends we should
                incorporate into our analysis of our portfolio.

                after initially supporting the research of professor chabinyc’s lab at the university of cali-
                fornia, santa barbara, and his work on organic photovoltaics last year, we have decided to
                continue supporting it for another year. we consider that this key technological development
                will allow for better usage of building structures to produce energy and consequently will
                allow us to be energy independent in the years to come.

                a major milestone we achieved in this year was the creation of the ﬁrst co-working place
                ‘beehive’ in hamburg. we are proud to be the ﬁrst german real estate company to move
                in that direction, as we believe that tomorrow’s ofﬁces will need to be ﬂexible and creative.

in 2015, the energy consumption of our ofﬁces increased by 4 % compared to 2014. con-
versely, the energy intensity per employee dropped by 9 %, while the number of employees
working in the same bureau premises increased signiﬁcantly. as part of our annual energy
management system review, we were able to take a closer look at our total energy consump-
tion by sections. the results of this analysis show that we had no signiﬁcant material changes
as compared to last year. the predominant consumer groups responsible for approximately
77 % of the total electricity usage of our ofﬁces remain the servers and lighting.

concentrating our efforts on both sections, we have started to replace light bulbs with
led lighting and to update our server with modern and more efﬁcient components. as we
consider ourselves a typical ofﬁce user in terms of these parameters, a similar scenario can
be applied to most of our tenants’ ofﬁce buildings. this acquired knowledge helps us to
support our tenants with the application of efﬁciency-improvement measures in their ofﬁce

our portfolio and the average german ofﬁce premises*, it is apparent that our ofﬁces are
already reasonably efﬁcient.
in 2015, the solar panels installed on the rooftop of our headquarters in hamburg generated
1,478 kwh (+ 80 % to 2014) of solar energy. this energy was fed into the power grid and
covered around 2 % of our corporate ofﬁces’ demand for electricity.

                water consumption
                our goal is to conserve as much water as possible. in 2015, the total consumption of fresh
                water in our corporate ofﬁces in hamburg and düsseldorf increased by 6 % in comparison
                to the previous year. conversely, the water intensity per employee per day dropped down
                by 7 %. toward our goal for water conservation, we have installed a rainwater tank at our
                headquarters in hamburg. this enables us to collect rainwater, direct it into the undrinkable
                water distribution system and thus reduce the amount of water required to operate the entire
                building. the rainwater collected helped us to save approximately 40 % of our annual fresh
                water demand. similarly, rainwater and water detention tanks have been installed in two of
                our buildings in steinstrasse, in hamburg and siemensstrasse, and in ditzingen. the latter
                has a capacity of 700 m3 of storm water.
                comparing the water intensity of our corporate ofﬁces to the water intensity of our port-
                folio and the average german ofﬁce premises*, it is apparent that our water consumption

construction waste
we report on the waste of our redevelopment projects on a regular basis. however, a
comparison of these data is not possible, due to the different designs of our buildings and
the different types of waste that are generated. moreover, our development projects are
at different stages, so even a comparison between two reporting periods of one project is
not feasible.
during 2015, construction waste was generated due to the refurbishment of one asset in
hamburg, the harburger ring. in our development project in ditzingen, we were able to
recycle almost the entire demolition waste on site in 2015. more than 24,000 tonnes of
concrete and construction waste were re-introduced into the new construction and not
transported to any landﬁll site.

in 2015, we printed 1,560 kg (equal to 300,000 sheets of paper). this corresponds to
16 sheets of paper per employee per working day. the paper used is fsc certiﬁed. the
printers consumed 2 % of our annual electricity consumption in our ofﬁces.

indirect emissions are associated with the consumption of intermediate energy, such as elec-

heating for the landlord shared services of our buildings, as well as the energy consumption
of our corporate ofﬁces in hamburg and düsseldorf.

after the takeover of the deutsche ofﬁce, our portfolio grew substantially. even though
those buildings were part of our portfolio for the last two months of 2015, we decided to
report on their energy consumptions for landlord shared services and associated emissions
(scope 2) in the same manner as we do for our existing buildings.
due to this fact, the total scope 2 emissions appear to have grown in comparison to the
previous years. this will change signiﬁcantly once our efﬁcient measures and our procurement
strategies are implemented in the new portfolio.

                                    workforce
alstria is constantly growing. the number of employees increased by 14 %, from 63 people in
2014 to 72 people in 2015. this signiﬁcant increase can be attributed to the recent acquisition
of the deutsche ofﬁce, which nearly doubled the size of our portfolio and strengthened our
workforce. more than half of our employees’ tasks are related to operating activities, such as
management, acquisition and development of real estate. the other part of the workforce
is split between administrative departments such as ﬁnance & controlling, legal, reporting &
accounting and ofﬁce administration.

we offer secure jobs and provide long-term career prospects to our employees. in 2015, the
number of employees under ﬁxed-term contracts remained at 6 %. these contracts were
mainly offered for replacement positions and two-year trainee program positions.
at alstria, when a business cycle closes or our staff’s needs change, we take every possible
measure to retain our people instead of releasing them. these measures include: employee
transfer to equivalent positions in other departments and training them to succeed in their
new roles; voluntary transfer to equivalent positions in different locations; and promotion
from within in the event of an in-house vacancy. in 2015, 3 % of people were internally
promoted. our main target is to keep our annual employee turnover rate below 10 %. in
2015, we reached our goal, with having an employee turnover rate of 8 %.
with respect to the recent takeover of the deutsche ofﬁce, we followed our principle of
keeping our people, offering all of the deutsche ofﬁce’s employees a position at alstria.
more than 30 % of deutsche ofﬁce employees accepted this option. those who decided
not to join alstria were offered generous compensation packages.

             later retirements and longer life spans have resulted in four generations of people working
             together in the same workplace. this new ‘normal’ calls for ﬂexibility and foresight. at alstria,
             our recruitment policies are designed to attract, develop and retain the best talents on the
             market. we strive to create an inclusive work environment where the contribution of each
             individual is valued and equal treatment is fostered.

             aside from speciﬁc positions that require certain expertise or technical know-how nearly all
             recruiting is handled in-house and guided by our hr specialists. the common recruitment
             process includes a two-step selection interview, attended by the associated senior manager, a
             team member and an hr specialist. in this interview, applicants are handled individually and
             are presented with a set of fundamental questions as well as case studies. another common
             practice is the ‘applicant days,’ a program usually used to select young professionals for
             trainee positions. this offers us the advantage of getting to know the candidate better and
             simultaneously allows the candidate to learn more about our corporate culture and people.

             all interviews are held fairly and objectively. we differentiate ourselves from our peers by
             holding a fast and inclusive recruitment process and by treating our applicants with trans-
             parency from the ﬁrst encounter. the selection criteria are occasionally reviewed to ensure
             they are suitable for achieving the company’s objectives and preventing discrimination.
             as a matter of principle, we seek to hire people from the local community. we post available
             positions on our website, job portals and social media.

             we consider trainee programs particularly favorable to our corporate culture, for they increase
             internal interdisciplinary cooperation and improve long-term succession planning within the
             company. therefore, we hire young professionals every year to complete a two-year trainee
             program especially designed to provide hands-on experience with our real estate business and
             our corporate culture. since this program’s inception in 2013, we have hired six trainees. four
             have successfully ﬁnished their traineeship, and three now form part of our permanent staff.

             everyone at alstria has the opportunity to learn and to improve skills while working. it is in
             our own best interest that employees continue their career development and extend their
             knowledge and qualiﬁcations as desired. for this reason, employees are offered a wide
             variety of learning and development opportunities that build on their strengths, grow their
             skills and help them achieve their full potential.

             to this end, we offer ﬂextime and pay our employees’ training costs in most cases. in
             2015, we spent approximately eur 113,000 on training sessions (2014: eur 131,000). this
             investment represented an average of eur 1,570 per employee. each employee received an
             average of 27 hours of training (2014: 25 hours). female employees received an average of
             29 hours of training and male employees received 25 hours.

             our training program is based on our business needs and employees’ personal interests. at
             the start of the year, each employee undergoes an annual appraisal guided by the manager
             in charge, in which a variety of topics are discussed, including individual career development
             planning. after this session, the employee’s speciﬁc training goals are further discussed and
             agreed upon by hr specialists. after the successful completion of training sessions, the
             employee is evaluated by his supervisor at the following annual appraisal.


                                                                                                     alstria

                                                                                                          65




this year’s emphasis has been on supporting new employees in quickly adjusting to their
new positions. accordingly, on-boarding sessions and especially it ofﬁce programs amounted
to 10 % of the total number of training hours. topics related to real estate totaled the most
hours, at 66 % of the total number of training hours provided within the company. another
important program, which was fully implemented in 2015, provided senior managers with
speciﬁc training to develop business and soft skills. management training will continue to
take place once a year, contributing to future successful senior management. a detailed
breakdown of employee training is provided in the chart below.

our training cycle ends each year with a unique two-day off-site team event. the main
objective of this workshop is to inform all employees of the company’s annual performance
and upcoming projects. during this workshop, employees receive training in various topics
such as compliance mechanisms, human rights aspects, sustainability and energy strategy.
at the same time, employees participate in team activities and have the opportunity to share
their ideas on a variety of topics, which allows employees to genuinely contribute to the
company’s corporate identity.

             each and every one of our employees is treated fairly and respectfully by supervisors and
             other employees. we seek to prevent discrimination on any grounds throughout the com-
             pany’s upstream and downstream activities.

             alstria’s ‘equal treatment policy’ vehemently prohibits any sort of discrimination based on
our people




             ethnic or national background, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, religion, ideol-
             ogy, political attitude, age, or any disability to affect the working relationship we have with
             our employees, from hiring to termination process. additional details regarding the prohibition
             of discrimination and harassment in the workplace are included in the handbook provided
             to each of alstria’s employees.

             employees experiencing or witnessing any discriminatory incidents must report such incidents
             to their direct supervisors or the company’s compliance ofﬁcer. the company’s exter-
             nal compliance hotline lets employees anonymously and conﬁdentially report any relevant
             breaches. since the foundation of the company in 2006, no concerns related to possible
             discrimination were ofﬁcially addressed within alstria.


                              p r omotin g f ema le emplo yees
             at alstria, we honor variety and multiculturalism in our perspectives, as illustrated by the fact
             that our staff includes people from eight different nationalities, representing three different
             continents.

             we are committed to promoting gender diversity and increasing the representation of women
             in management positions. as of september 2015, the management board has determined
             that female representation for the ﬁrst management level below the management board
             shall not fall below 27.3 % until june 2017. a target quota for female representation for
             the second management level has not been determined, for the company has no further
             management level with decision-making competence and budget responsibility. a similar
             target of 30 % for has been set for the supervisory board until 2017.




                                                                                                     alstria

in 2015, we employed 41 women and 31 men. this equates to a female-to-male ratio of
57 % to 43 % (2014: 48 % to 52 %). the share of female employees in senior management
positions was 33 % (+ 10 %, 2014: 30 %). in germany, the equivalent proportion of women
in senior positions was 13 % *. in the supervisory board, the female representation was
16.7 %. in germany, the equivalent proportion was 22.6 %*.

we consider equal remuneration for female and male employees a key priority, even a
necessity. in 2015, female employees at alstria earned 31 % less, on average, than male
employees (2014: 13 %). in germany, the equivalent difference in similar industries was
30 – 32 %*. however, across equivalent positions, the salaries of female and male employees
are aligned and do not differ more than 0 – 6 %.


                                          a g e d iv er sity
with a business history spanning almost ten years, alstria has a relatively young workforce
whose average age is 37 years old. given that the number of years each employee works
for the company is increasing as is the retirement age, we expect to eventually have four
generations of people working at the same place.

when it comes to the creation of a new location of operations or a new division, we recruit




                                                                                                         our people
people regardless of age. for example, during our recent business expansion with local oper-
ational teams in frankfurt, düsseldorf, and stuttgart, we recruited mixed-aged workforce
from the beginning. this principle allows us to beneﬁt from the special strengths of each
age group and avoid future conﬂicts.

options regarding gradual retirement have not yet been considered, as none of our employees
has reached retirement age. due consideration will be given once it is relevant.
the measures we take in order to beneﬁt from the experiences of employees of different
ages include programs to support the health of our employees. in addition, we offer ﬂextime
and remote work options. to complement this, we raise our managers’ awareness of the
challenges posed by mixed-age teams.




                                                            over the next few years, we would like to
                                                            intensify internal communication between

                                                            toward strengthening our corporate culture
                                                            and ensuring that our core values are well

our employment contracts are based on the principles of collective bargaining agreements
in the real estate sector. in principle, we compare our standard employment contracts to
the ones proposed by collective bargaining on a regular basis to strengthen the position
of our workforce. the main differences between our employment contracts and collective
bargaining ones are the ﬂextime model and our bonus payment. most recommendations
in the collective bargaining agreement with respect to paid holidays, termination notice,
retirement age, sick payment, travel expenses, etc. are fully covered in our contracts. in most
cases, they exceed these standards.

alstria follows the german labor laws and constitution and all ratiﬁed labor standards by
the international labour organization (ilo) in germany. freedom of association is a right
guaranteed to employees in germany. as such, the company does not, by any means,
restrict employees’ rights as it operates under the rules of german law.

the health, safety and wellness of our employees are a top priority at alstria. we actively
foster a positive work environment that enables our employees to reach their full potential.
to accomplish this, we have implemented a health, safety and environmental (hse) policy
that speciﬁes that we will:

                                                                                                    our people

we ensure that occupational health and safety hazards are addressed before they result
in possible injuries by carrying out authorized inspections in all our workplaces twice per
year. in the event that a hazard is identiﬁed, the safety commissioner shall report this to the
committee for safety at work and propose an appropriate solution. the committee is then
responsible for removing, eliminating or guarding against this hazard (when removal and
elimination are not possible).

in principle, the committee for safety at work is accountable for guaranteeing the improve-
ment of the company’s health and safety performance. it is comprised of the management
board, the security ofﬁcer, an external company’s doctor and an industrial safety expert. the
committee organizes regular meetings with different departments to inform and discuss
matters of safety and health protection.

at alstria, each employee receives speciﬁc training in health, safety and environmental prac-
tices upon hiring. this training is organized by the new employee’s direct supervisor; this
training is complemented by annual updates. our employees individually bear responsibility
for understanding and following our hse policy as well as actively participating in training
programs to expand their knowledge. finally, we encourage our suppliers and contractors
to adopt the same practices and conduct their operations in a socially and environmentally
responsible manner.

             improve the wellness of our employees, we have arranged our employees’ workstations in
             accordance with the following principles:

             in addition to offering ergonomic workstation equipment, we provide diverse beneﬁt plans to
             meet the health and wellness needs of various employee groups. these include a yearly vac-
             cine against inﬂuenza, vision care, business travel accident insurance and work-life coaching.
             the aforementioned precautionary measures have contributed to low absenteeism due to
             illness in 2015, corresponding to 9.1 days per employee (2014: 8.2 days). we have reduced
             this rate by ten days in comparison to the german average of 19.5 days*.
             finally, as a responsible employer, we offer adequate positions for employees suffering from
             chronic conditions or disabilities; we try to integrate these employees into our daily work
             life as best as possible. in such cases, we engage in long conversations with the affected
             employee and offer individualized solutions.

             we support our employees in maintaining a healthy work-life balance in many ways. in
             addition to the statutory working arrangements, we offer our employees ﬂexible working
             hours and the possibility to work remotely. this means that each and every employee is free
             to arrange his personal time model in cooperation with the manager in charge in light of the
             business’ needs; this schedule is based entirely on trust. our employees are also encouraged
             to perform part of their job off-site. such arrangements are mainly based on the nature of
             the work involved. in principle, most real estate operations include heavy in-house commu-
             nication to tenants and suppliers, which results in managers tending to stay at the ofﬁce.
             however, in cases of an employee caring for a child or other dependent, remote work may
             be the appropriate solution insofar as it enhances personal freedom and ﬂexibility. to ensure
             instant remote work, we offer smart devices to the majority of our employees.

as an employer, it is our responsibility to offer adequate positions for employees with fam-
ily and home care responsibilities. therefore, we offer part-time work arrangements and
job-sharing positions. the number of people employed part-time in 2015 amounted to 18 %
of the total workforce (2014: 9 %). among our senior female managers, approximately
67 % expressed a desire to work part-time due to family care responsibilities. we ensure
that none of our part-time employees faces discrimination in terms of working conditions,
salary, recruitment or training.

                  we maintain direct control of our company, and we pride ourselves on strong accountability
                  with regard to public authorities and our stakeholders. hence, we apply sound corporate
                  governance practices at every level of our organization. the company operates under a dual
                  management and supervisory board system.

                  our management board is responsible for, and committed to, leading and executing the
                  company’s overall strategy as well as overseeing our corporate affairs. to successfully fulﬁl
                  its responsibility, the management board advises the senior managers and receives regular
                  updates on a wide variety of business matters affecting the company. the management
                  board, in turn, informs the supervisory board at least four times per year, ensuring com-
                  prehensive information on all matters pertaining to planning, business development, risk
                  situations and risk management. this also includes new environmental strategies and targets.
                  the group* complies with most recommendations included in the german corporate
                  governance code. the annual declaration of compliance, in accordance with section161
                  aktg, is permanently available to shareholders on the company’s website.

                           g o ve r n a n c e r elat ed to sustainability
                  our sustainability strategy has been gradually integrated into our everyday management.
                  depending on ﬁeld of expertise, the company’s staff are increasingly involved in sustainable
                  practices in recognition of the major impact that the real estate sector has on the environ-
                  ment. the highest level of direct responsibility for all decisions and issues concerning sus-
                  tainable development within the company resides with the chief executive ofﬁcer (ceo).
                  the management board, which consists of two members, the ceo and the chief financial
                  ofﬁcer, is responsible for the company’s risk management practices. this concerns all risks,
                  including those related to climate change.

                  in august 2014, alstria established a new department, sustainability and quality manage-
                  ment, and appointed a senior manager to expand its sustainability program. the respon-
                  sibilities inherent to this position include development of the sustainability strategy and
                  management of the implementation of this strategy in cooperation with the real estate
                  operations department. the head of sustainability and quality management is a member
                  of the company’s leadership team and directly reports all relevant issues concerning sus-
                  tainability to the ceo at least once per month.
                  at an operational level, the sustainability team is responsible for regularly assessing the
                  level of implementation of the csr program. the team collects and evaluates all adequate
                  environmental performance data resulting from the company’s operations and is responsible
                  for the annual publication of the corporate sustainabilty report. moreover, it is responsible
                  for implementing and controlling operational measures designed to improve the company’s
                  nonﬁnancial performance.

business ethics




                  in conjunction with the existing code of conduct, the management board has set up a com-
                  pliance organization to strengthen the implementation of alstria’s ethical standards within the
                  company. a compliance ofﬁcer was appointed to control compliance with the company’s
                  internal guidelines and ensure that all employees are well informed.

                  our employees are encouraged to raise concerns with regard to compliance, ethics or any
                  other business conduct with their direct supervisor or the compliance ofﬁcer. accordingly,
                  the compliance ofﬁcer collects all complaints, breaches and actions taken and reports them
                  directly to the management board. employees may also use an external whistle-blower
                  hotline, through which they can anonymously report any violations of the code of conduct
                  or the company’s internal guidelines. our policy is explicit in that it affords protection for
                  the whistle-blower, and employees will face no sanctions due to reporting of incidents.

                  to ensure consistent compliance with our internal guidelines, we offer regular training to
                  all employees. these courses include all important information concerning alstria’s anti-
                  corruption policies, data privacy protection and unlawful behavior. all new employees receive
                  speciﬁc training regarding the compliance policy of the company upon hiring. moreover,
                  ‘refresher’ courses are delivered each year to all employees. finally, with regard to new policy
                  amendments, we immediately update our employees. all relevant information is available
                  via the company’s intranet and is available to all employees.

deals with:

  and regulations                                › managing of conﬂicts of interest

corruption is understood as the acceptance or granting of advantages or beneﬁts used to
unfairly inﬂuence business or ofﬁcial decisions. a possible failure to prevent corrupt behavior
can have consequences not only for the individual but can also negatively affect alstria’s
business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations. it could also lead to an imminent loss
of alstria’s reputation in the real estate market and thereby negatively affect future business
opportunities.

alstria’s operations are located exclusively in germany, where the legal environment and
business practices against corruption, bribery and labor rights abuse are binding and mature.
in order to systematically protect the group from corruption-related risks, we have imple-
mented an early-warning risk identiﬁcation system that evaluates and monitors all associated
risks at least on a quarterly basis. this evaluation helps deﬁne speciﬁc prevention measures,
which include various controls and access security measures. the group’s anti-corruption
policies are supervised by the compliance ofﬁcer. moreover, we maintain a ‘two-man’ rule
as a control mechanism for most internal processes. the materialization of compliance risks
(including corruption) is assessed as unlikely unchanged from the previous year.




                                                to safeguard the company from poten-
                                                tial compliance risks, we are planning to
                                                strengthen our process for risk assessment
                                                and enhance the principles that govern
                                                employee behavior.

                  icantly dependent on our service providers
                  and suppliers, service contractors, consultants
                  and builders.

business ethics




                  to us, every service provider is equally important and can have both a positive or negative
                  impact on the company’s reputation. therefore, when entering into new business relation-
                  ships, we prefer to trust service providers that have been previously vetted with respect to
                  certain activities that may expose us to high compliance risks.

                  as a result, we have established a ‘green list’ that includes all the providers with whom
                  the company is allowed to enter into a business relationship. contractors on this list have
                  been vetted for reputation and market behavior prior to the company’s engagement in any
                  business with them. the ‘green list’ is compiled by all senior managers and supervised by
                  the compliance ofﬁcer on an annual basis.

                  over the last few years, we have developed many strategies and key tools to support rela-
                  tionships with our service providers and suppliers. since 2014, we have included a range of
                  issues in our contracts, such as energy efﬁciency, waste recycling and the use of eco-friendly
                  materials. furthermore we have enhanced most of our building contracts with provisions
                  covering protection of minimum wages.

                  the most important step we took this year, with regard to improving our supplier relationship
                  management, was the creation of a code of conduct for service providers and suppliers. this
                  code, similar to the one for employees, deﬁnes the company’s ethical and legal guidelines and
                  sets forth the speciﬁc behavior expected from our service providers and suppliers. we direct
                  all existing and potential business partners to read the code of conduct on the company’s
                  website and be aware that compliance with the code is recommended. the code is available

with local small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes).

given that our business is continually expanding, we invested over eur 52.3 million in the
refurbishment, development and maintenance of our buildings this year. this corresponds
to supporting 324 jobs in the construction sector (2014: 205 jobs). this year, we contin-
ued working with local smes and hired approximately 30 % locally-based suppliers and
contractors.




                                               we will continue our intensive efforts to
                                               engage our suppliers in following ethical
                                               business practices. we will also continue to
                                               expand our training with regard to compli-
                                               ance practices to all new ofﬁce locations.

             every year, since 2009, we issue a sustainabilty report that provides readers with comprehen-
             sive information on the progress we have made in environmental, ﬁnancial, governance and
             social areas. in this 2015/2016 sustainability report, all of the quantitative data cover the
             ﬁnancial year from january 1 to december 31, 2015. some of the information we provide
             in this report reﬂect decisions and events that took place in 2016, so that readers receive
             more up-to date information.
             the report is organized and presented based on the gri g4 framework, using the ‘core’
             option. we also present our sector’s speciﬁc information, as speciﬁed by the ‘construction
             and real estate sector supplement (cress)’ as well as the ‘european public real estate
             association (epra) best practices recommendations on sustainability reporting.’ more

             information on gri and epra is available at www.globalreporting.org www.epra.com

             for the ﬁrst time, we have ran a third-party assurance for all our energy and resources
             consumption data. those data were audited by deloitte gmbh, with limited assurance in
             accordance with isae 3000. indicators from the area of occupational health and safety were
             reviewed by external experts in accordance with the german directive 89/391/ ewg. finally
             our energy management system receives internal and external third-party auditing every year.

             we report every year on the environmental performance of our buildings, including those
appendix a




             used from us as corporate ofﬁces. the data provided, refer to electricity, heating and resources
             consumptions of the whole portfolio. unless otherwise stated those data do not include
             joint ventures. in order to increase comparability between years, we provide results on
             the most recent two full reporting years. by applying this ‘like-for–like’ approach to our
             portfolio, we are able to disregard assets that were added or excluded from the portfolio
             during the reporting period and solely focus on the ones that have contributed over the
             entire period. however, a like-for-like comparison can only be applied to absolute indicators,
             whereas intensity indicators take the total portfolio at the date of reporting into account. for
             measuring properly our carbon footprint, we apply the operational control approach of the
             greenhouse gas protocol initiative. this approach clearly identiﬁes emissions in areas over
             which we have direct control and where emissions accrue due to the company’s activities.
             overall, no adjustments for special circumstances, such as weather patterns or the age of
             the buildings in question, have been made.

             all information covering the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of alstria group are prepared in
             accordance with the international financial reporting standards (ifrs) and receive annually
             third-party assurance. a detailed description of our ﬁnancial performance can be found in

             6qcnuvtkcqhʉeg4'+6#)*codwti

             we have been engaged to perform a limited review of the quantitative and qualitative
             information within the sections ‘our portfolio – energy consumption’, ‘our portfolio – use
             of resources’, ‘our corporate ofﬁces’, ‘carbon footprint’ in the chapter ‘our buildings’ and
             the ‘epra tables’ in the appendix of the sustainability report (hereinafter: the report) of alstria
             ofﬁce reit-ag, hamburg, for the business year starting january 1st to december 31st 2015.
             it was not part of our engagement to review any product or service related statements, any
             links to external sources, future-looking statements or statements from external experts in
             these sections.

             management’s responsibility
             the company’s board of directors is responsible for the establishment of the report in
             accordance with the criteria stated in the sustainability reporting guidelines g4 of the global
             reporting initiative (gri).
             this responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare
             the report as well as the usage of reasonable assumptions and estimates for individual sus-
             tainability disclosures. furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and
             maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the report in a way that
             it is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements.

             our independence and quality control
appendix c




             we have met the requirements regarding independence along with the additional require-
             ments relating to professional conduct of the iesba code of ethics for professional account-
             ants, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional
             competence and due care, conﬁdenti-ality and professional conduct worthy of the profession.
             the quality assurance system of deloitte gmbh is based on the international standard
             on quality control 1 ‘quality control for audit, assurance and related service practices’
             (isqc 1) and in addition to that, on national statutory requirements and professional stand-
             ards, especially the professional code for certiﬁed accountants as well as the joint statement
             of wpk (chamber of public accountants) and idw (institute of public auditors in germany):
             requirements for quality assurance in the auditing practice (vo 1/2006).

             practitioner’s responsibility
             our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed and the evidences
             obtained on the above mentioned sections of the report.

             procedures and extend of the assurance engagement
             we conducted our work in accordance with the international standard on assurance engage-
             ments (isae) 3000 (revised): ‘assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of
             historical financial information’. this standard requires that we comply with our professional
             duties and give an at-testation, based on the results of our work, as to whether any matters
             have come to our knowledge that could give rise to the assumption that the information as
             stated the above mentioned sections within the sustainability report 2016 do not comply,
             in all material respects, with the above mentioned crite-ria of the sustainability reporting
             guidelines g4 of the gri. in a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering pro-
             cedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement. hence, the scope of
             a limited review is less comprehensive and may not reasonably assure all material facts in
             comparison with a reasonable assurance. the selection of audit activities is subject to the
             auditor’s own judgement. this includes the assessment of the risk of material misstatement
             in the report under consideration of the gri reporting criteria.



                                                                                                       alstria

                                                                                      93




within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures when
conducting the limited assurance engagement:

› interviews with relevant staff at group level responsible for providing the data and informa-
    tion, carrying out internal control procedures and consolidating the data and information,
    including the explanatory notes
›   analytical procedures on relevant data in the above mentioned sections
›   inspection of process and system documentations on the environmental management
    system as well as the structure and procedures of the systems and processes for collecting,
    calculating, validating and aggregating environmental data

our conclusion
based on our limited review, nothing has come to our knowledge that could give rise to the
assumption that the quantitative and qualitative information as stated within the sections ‘our
portfolio – energy consumption’, ‘our portfolio – use of resources’, ‘our corporate ofﬁces’,
‘carbon footprint’ in the chapter ‘our buildings’ and the ‘epra tables’ in the appendix of
the sustainability report 2016 of alstria ofﬁce reit-ag, hamburg, does not comply with the
criteria of the sustainability reporting guidelines g4 of the gri.

without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for

                          d – energy policy



             responsibility
             as a responsible company, alstria ofﬁce reit-ag is committed to limiting the impact of its
             operations on the overall environment to the largest extent possible. in line with this objective,
             the management board recognizes the signiﬁcance of energy management and provides all
             necessary reasonable resources for appropriate energy management. in particular, it ensures
             all of alstria’s business activities will be performed in accordance with legal and regulatory
             obligations.

             improvement
             we are committed to continually improving our energy management system through regular
             reviews. our ultimate goal is to reduce our environmental footprint and, subsequently, our
             energy consumption. we believe that reducing our energy demand is the most sustainable
             path for alstria in the long term. whenever possible, we endeavor to decrease our depend-
             ence on fossil fuels by increasing the use of renewable energy sources.

             energy
             we ensure the responsible use of energy throughout all business operations. to this end,
             we will begin a process that allows us to monitor energy data for energy used in our oper-
             ational processes. through such measures (including operational energy audits), we will be
appendix d




             able to analyze our energy requirements and identify all viable measures to save energy.
             the successful implementation of these measures ensures the optimal energy use, from an
             economic and environmental perspective.

             awareness
             through regular and speciﬁc training sessions, we keep our employees informed on our
             energy goals and encourage them to act responsibly and participate actively in our energy
             management program.
             the company’s illustration and understanding of its own energy consumption effectively
             raises employees’ awareness with regard to tenants’ energy requirements.

             communication
             we conduct open, objective and comprehensive dialogue with the public and our busi-
             ness partners. we also work closely with authorities and adequately inform stakeholders
             regarding relevant energy topics. in so doing, we develop a deeper mutual understanding.

             this policy applies to all operations of alstria ofﬁce reit-ag.

absolute values (abs) are used to report the indicators for the year in question. all con-
sumption data refer to the whole year. assets under major redevelopment and buildings
that were only recently acquired without a set of consumption data for the whole running
year are excluded.

the like-for-like ﬁgures (lfl) include all alstria buildings that have been consistently in oper-
ation, and their consumption data is available for the most recent two-full-year period.
although the deutsche ofﬁce portfolio was acquired in the end of 2015, its consumption
data is included in the like-for-like ﬁgures, depending on availability for the years 2014 and
2015.

energy consumption data originates from different sources. in some cases, we possess only
partial data from speciﬁc areas or services of our buildings, such as tenant or common area.
in other cases, all building consumptions are managed by our tenants (single-tenant build-
ings) and we receive non-veriﬁable data (for all energy, water and waste data). however, all
available data is used and no estimates were made to ﬁll data gaps. the data from landlord
shared services in common areas is a mix of direct consumption in those areas, such as stair-
case lighting, and consumption from shared services in common areas that are used in tenant

areas, such as mechanical ventilation and cooling. when calculating the intensity metrics,
we use the appropriate denominators, i. e. for the landlord-shared services in common areas,
we use the combined common and tenant ﬂoor space.

intensity indicators (int) give the ratio between energy or water consumption and the cor-
responding ﬂoor space. for ofﬁce buildings we use in addition to the standard intensity
denominator ‘per ﬂoor space’ the intensity of use denominator ‘per workstation’ as well
(one workstation equals 25 m² of ofﬁce space).

figures from 2014 have been restated, including intensity metrics, as additional or more accu-
rate energy consumption data have been obtained since the previous sustainability report.
where necessary and possible, restatements are explained in footnotes to the respective
graphics. all absolute ﬁgures from 2014 include only the former alstria portfolio.

all ghg emissions are reported under the operational control approach, rather than ﬁnancial
or procurement control.
scope 1 includes only direct (dir) emissions from alstria own use. scope 2 includes energy
from indirect (indir) emissions from alstria own use and landlord shared services in common
areas. scope 3 includes landlord-obtained energy that was sub-metered to tenants and
tenant-obtained energy.

no district cooling is used within our portfolio.

water consumption data is only from water that was (sub)metered exclusively to tenants or
was directly obtained by tenants (single-tenant buildings).

           all the information in this report has been compiled in good faith and from various sources
           with great care. to the best of our knowledge, the information and data contained in this
           report reﬂect the truth. nevertheless, we cannot assume liability for the correctness or com-
           pleteness of the information provided herein that is not under our direct control.
           in particular, this also applies to any forward-looking statements made with respect to the
           development of business matters and the ﬁnancial results of alstria ofﬁce reit-ag; such
           statements are based on our current plans, assessments, prognoses and expectations, as well
           as on economic, political and other developments and factors that are, to the most extent,
           beyond our scope of inﬂuence. the actual results and developments may, therefore, differ
           signiﬁcantly from the assumptions we have made at this point in time. we furthermore do
           not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements if new information is
           obtained or unexpected events occur. insofar as the masculine form is used in the contents
           of this report, it is assumed that the underlying reference is to both genders on equal terms.

           we would like to thank all colleagues and external partners for their friendly support in
           compiling this report.
