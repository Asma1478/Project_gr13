  responsible leadership
  tvo believes in corporate social responsibility that supports business operations and is based on tvo’s values, goals, and
  corporate social responsibility policy as well as legislation and stakeholder expectations.
  the responsible leadership theme of the corporate social responsibility 2014 report includes a review by the ceo, a
  description of the operating environment, strategic objectives, a description of good corporate governance, risk
  management, and the corporate management system, as well as an account of company­level policies and the company’s
  code of conduct.

  review by the ceo
  the energy industry is undergoing a substantial, radical change that began suddenly and may
  continue for several years.
  the demand for energy has decreased due to the stalling of economic growth. simultaneously,
  subsidized investments in renewable energy have led to an increase in the supply of electricity.
  as a result, the market price of electricity has decreased. at the same time, the costs relating to
  the production of nuclear power have increased, which has undermined the profitability of nuclear
  power­produced electricity.
  currently, more than a quarter of the electricity consumed in finland is generated using nuclear
  power. in the future, the proportion will be significantly higher. nuclear power­produced electricity
  plays an important role in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and meeting of climate
  goals. without nuclear power is not any plausible path to a low­carbon society. tvo’s olkiluoto
  nuclear power plant is in good, safe production condition, with large investment projects
  underway. furthermore, tvo keeps improving its operations in order to maintain its
  competitiveness in the challenging electricity production market environment.

  stable electricity production, ol3 project progressing

  in 2014, the olkiluoto nuclear power plant produced 14.76 terawatt­hours (twh) of electricity, achieving record production
  output for the second consecutive year. thanks to modernizations implemented in accordance with the principle of
  continuous improvement and the personnel’s long­term competence development efforts, the power plant is in excellent
  condition, technically as well as production­wise.
  surrounded by four nature conservation areas, the power plant, situated at the small island of olkiluoto produces 23 percent
  of finland’s total electricity output, and 18 percent of all electricity consumed in finland. the concentration of energy
  production in a small geographic area minimizes environmental impacts and makes it possible to preserve other areas in
  their natural state.
  to prepare for the renewal of the operating license of the plant units in 2018 the power plant is currently undergoing
  modifications which will further improve the safety and reliability of the plant units. new safety features will, for example,
  improve the plants ability to cope with events caused by exceptional natural phenomena. another ongoing project aims to
  draw more attention to the company’s safety culture and the associated practices and procedures.
  despite the delays, the olkiluoto 3 project has achieved also good results. the pressure and leak­tightness test carried out
  in the spring showed that the quality of the work is good and that the plant unit will meet the set quality requirements.
  advances were made in the design of the automation system, which play an important part in the completion of the plant unit.
  furthermore, testing of the automation systems was carried out in accordance with the plans and as scheduled.
  the delays of the ol3 project will have a further impact on future growth projects. the government rejected tvo’s
  application for the extension of the validity of the decision­in­principle concerning the ol4 project and the postponement of
  the implementation of the project to a more economically feasible time. the associated preparation, design, implementation

  and operational phases make nuclear power plant investment projects long and economically challenging. large base­load
  power production projects are important to society. however, for investments and implementation to take place, the
  operating environment and the necessary political decisions must be predictable. the decision­in­principle concerning ol4 is
  valid until june 30, 2015.

  integral part of finnish society

  tvo was established 45 years ago to produce electricity for its owners using nuclear power. today, tvo still continues to
  fulfill this mission. the production of electricity in olkiluoto began 35 years ago. ever since then, tvo has systematically
  increased its production by modernizing the plant units and developing its operations further. the ol3 project is a billion­
  euro­scale investment in the future. together with the final disposal facility for spent fuel, it will ensure that active operations
  will continue at olkiluoto for more than a hundred years from now.
  for years, tvo has engaged in long­term, multidisciplinary work to promote overall development in the nuclear power
  industry and to guarantee its continuity. the olkiluoto site has been developed taking into account the requirements of the
  future production increase. the development of a sustainable waste management concept has also required an enormous
  amount of work and investments. the achievement is the most extensive and advanced final disposal solution for spent
  nuclear fuel in the world. the completion of the extension of the interim storage facility for spent fuel at the end of the year is
  an important part of the implementation of the well managed solution.
  like the production of electricity in olkiluoto, decision­making at tvo is firmly in domestic hands; the company’s owners are
  finnish. funding for the investments is acquired from international financial markets. the procurement of fuel is subjected to
  competitive bidding and distributed between several western suppliers. these suppliers are expected to demonstrate
  responsibility in their operations and are regularly subjected to assessment.

  looking responsibly towards a profitable future

  as our operating environment is undergoing a change, tvo will keep up with the pace of development. after renewing our
  strategy in conjunction with our current large nuclear facility investments, we are now planning to reorganize our operations
  and develop our practices in order to improve our efficiency. with the development work progressing rapidly, spring will see
  the completion of the operations descriptions as well as the design and implementation of new, more efficient operations.
  cost savings are required to ensure stable production of electricity in the future. as one means of achieving the necessary
  savings, the company started co­operation negotiations with the employees in january 2015.
  whenever changes are made in the company that affect the personnel, the significance of a corporate culture and
  responsibility is heightened. at tvo, this means, among other things, that in parallel to implementing measures to increase
  shareholder value, we develop our safety culture and well­being at work. these three things form the core of our
  development program, which also provides a frame for our other everyday development and human resources activities.
  as we implement our strategy, we take tvo towards better profitability and competitiveness. the competitiveness of the
  electricity produced in olkiluoto serves to strengthen the operating preconditions of tvo’s owners and the success of other
  industrial production operations in finland. thus, the emission­free electricity produced in olkiluoto using nuclear power will
  continue to have a great significance on the economic development, electrical self­sufficiency and general well­being of
  whole finland.

  operating environment
  nuclear power accounts for approximately 11 percent of the world’s electricity
  production. nuclear power is the second most important form of low­emission
  electricity production after hydropower. the current nuclear power capacity is
  392,000 mw, with another 76,000 mw under construction. like other forms of
  production, nuclear power has external benefits and costs. the most important
  external benefits are the virtual avoidance of co2 releases and local pollution,
  and the improvement of energy security. the associated concerns include
  nuclear safety and the management of radioactive waste. 1)
  in 2014, the consumption of electricity in finland totaled 83.3 terawatt­hours
  (twh). compared to the previous year, consumption decreased by 0.8%. the
  share of imported electricity remained high at slightly over one­fifth of total consumption. the production of nuclear power­
  generated electricity amounted to 22.7 twh, which accounted for 27.2% of consumption.
  the energy industry is undergoing a substantial, radical change that began suddenly and may continue for several years. the
  stalling of economic growth has resulted in a decrease in the demand as subsidized investments are made in renewable
  energy. at the same time, the costs relating to the production of nuclear power have increased. this development has
  undermined the profitability of nuclear power production.
  finland needs new, emission­free electricity production. in january 2015, the
  ministry of employment and the economy published a new report, according to
  which domestic electricity production is not, nor will be in the future, sufficient to
  cover consumption during peak demand periods. in the next few years, the
  demand for imported electricity will be 2,800 mw during peak consumption
  periods and up to 4,000 mw in extremely cold winters. the completion of
  olkiluoto 3 will alleviate the situation, but not completely solve it. the probability
  of short­term consumption restrictions has increased.
  in october 2014, the parliamentary committee on energy and climate issues
  published roadmap 2050, a report describing the steps to be taken on the way to a carbon­free future. according to the
  report, when domestically produced nuclear power is included, finland’s degree of energy self­sufficiency can be increased
  to 80 per cent.

  strategic objectives
  tvo’s strategy is based on its mission, vision and business model, and the key
  indicators that steer the company’s operations. tvo’s values and code of conduct,
  together with an uncompromising safety culture, create a solid basis for responsible
  day­to­day operations.
  the main goal of tvo’s strategy is three­pronged: increase owner value, maintain
  production costs at a competitive level, and improve growth opportunities. the
  strategic drivers are: anticipation of changes in the operating environment and
  customer­orientation, compliance with tvo’s values and safety objectives, interactive
  and productive management, and stakeholder trust.
  tvo believes in corporate social responsibility that supports the company’s business
  operations and is based on its values and goals as well as legislation and stakeholder

  expectations. tvo’s corporate social responsibility policy and its practical implementation form the core of the company’s
  social responsibility effort. responsibility is at the core of tvo’s corporate culture and is an integral part of its day­to­day
  operations. as a value behind the work of every tvo employee, it means uncompromising quality, adherence to strict safety
  requirements, and compliance with the rules and regulations that have been agreed and are in force. tvo’s personnel are
  committed to an uncompromising safety culture, valued by us all.
  the president and ceo, with the approval of the management group, is responsible for the objectives and planning relating
  to tvo’s corporate responsibility. in the management group, the senior vice president responsible for corporate relations
  and the corporate social responsibility manager present issues related to the development, monitoring and reporting of
  corporate social responsibility. in the development and implementation of corporate social responsibility, the management of
  tvo is assisted by the corporate social responsibility group. the group acts as an expert, advisor, and information
  forwarder in matters concerning corporate social responsibility. the group monitors and develops the company’s corporate
  social responsibility policy and other related matters and reports and communicates these to the management, personnel,
  and stakeholders. the president and ceo appoints the members, chairperson, and secretary to the group. the members of
  the group hold various positions within the organization. the corporate social responsibility group, and the corporate social
  responsibility development group that acts within it, convened seven times in 2014.
  the year under review saw the launching and implementation of a corporate social responsibility program with the following
  themes: safe electricity production, research and development, open and interactive communication and stakeholder
  cooperation, responsible supply chain, impact on the owners’ competitiveness and the society, climate and environment­
  friendliness, nuclear waste management, energizing leadership and value­oriented operating culture, and strengthening of the
  nuclear power industry’s safety culture competencies. these building blocks of responsibility were utilized to create a
  summary of the responsible actions inherent to the planning and practical aspects of the operations of various units as well
  as the goals, measures and indicators relating to tvo’s impact on society and on the group itself. the responsibility program
  was fine­tuned by the corporate social responsibility group during the fall, approved by the management group in
  december, and adopted at the beginning of2015. on the basis of the revised materiality assessment, improvement of safety
  culture, cost­efficient practices, and a high level of well­being at work were chosen as development targets for 2015.

  management, planning, and development projects continued
  projects focusing on the management, planning, and development of operations continued in 2014. tvo’s strategy and
  business model were developed further. the company’s strategic choices and focus areas included the completion and
  operational stabilization of ol3, ensuring the availability of ol1/ol2, profitability and cost­efficiency, and customer­
  orientation. in tvo’s vision, the nuclear power­generated electricity produced by the company commands a competitive
  price and holds a strong position in the production and investment palette of tvo’s electricity consumers. in 2014, the unit­
  specific indicators and targets derived from company­level strategy were monitored with the help of the annual management
  schedule.
  the operations development project aims to create shared practices for the entire company and to increase efficiency
  through unified procedures. the development projects currently underway aim to improve the profitability and cost­efficiency
  of our operations in accordance with our strategy. the goal of the development activities is to create a cost­effective
  operating model. in 2014, the development project progressed to a concrete planning phase. this phase comprised outlining
  changes to existing practices and structures throughout the group. shared procedures are also expected to help build a
  clear and fair management system. numerous people from various branches of the group have participated in the process.
  the development project focused on establishing and developing strategic performance indicators for matters that are most
  critical to our success at present and in the future. key indicators for the group and its various operations were reviewed
  during the development of the performance indicators. our objective is to take these performance indicators into use in
  2015.

  zero accidents target

  the basis of all tvo’s operations is an uncompromising safety culture, an integral component of safe, cost­efficient electricity production and nuclear waste management.
  in terms of accident frequency, the target is set at zero. in order to reach this target, tvo has set interim targets. in 2014, the target for accident frequency was set at less than
  3.5 accidents per one million working hours (over a rolling period of 12 months). at the end of 2014, the accident frequency was 8.4. this figure includes tvo and posiva
  personnel, as well as all contractors active in olkiluoto, excluding the ol3 site which is reported by the areva­siemens consortium. the target was not met.

  as regards the development of the safety culture, the focus is on making safety observations and taking appropriate action. tvo strives to set an example for its partners to
  follow in their operations in olkiluoto. consequently, the responsibility program sets out to increase the number of proactive observations and development proposals*. in 2014,
  the target set for the number of observations 950; at the end of december, 946 observations had been made. the target was slightly missed.

  * proactive observations and development proposals are considered to include safety observations recorded in the quality management system, occupational safety­related field observations, development proposals made in conjunction with internal audits
  and initiatives recorded in the initiative system.

  leadership
  energizing leadership and value­oriented operating culture


  the sub­objective set for leadership and value­oriented operating culture is that the personnel survey results will improve in 2015 in comparison to the previous survey, carried
  out in 2012. in 2014, leadership and change surveys were carried out in accordance with the company’s personnel survey model, and the results were discussed in the
  organizational units in order to improve their operations. the target was to develop the work of supervisors and the whole organization by generating discussion supporting the
  planning and steering of operations. comprehensive navigation discussions as per the survey model were carried out within the organization; the coverage was over 80%.
  the target was met.

  the target was to implement the recommendations yielded by the safety culture self­assessment carried out in 2013. the recommendations are expected to help the company
  reach the iaea’s highest safety culture rating and become a learning organization. the related measures include the promotion of a blame­free atmosphere, continuously
  emphasizing the importance of following instructions, and focusing on the lessons learned from plant events. in 2014, the results of the self­assessment were discussed in all
  organizational units.

  research and development
  tvo’s r&d operations focus on supporting the acquisition and renewal of nuclear power plants’ construction and operating licenses through the production of high­quality
  technical information, and on validating data and calculations for the needs and use of the plant units. the responsibility program sets research and development­related
  subtargets: voluntary research and development work should account for 30% of the total costs (as per the 2014 cost structure), and 4% of the tvo personnel should actively
  engage in r&d activities. at the end of the year, voluntary research and development accounted for 21% of the total costs, and over 4% of the personnel participated in r&d
  activities. the target was partially met.

  another subtarget was set for cooperation with institutes of higher education; each year, 10–20 people should complete a university or polytechnic college thesis, and 15–20
  people should take the national nuclear safety training course (yk). as the numbers of theses completed and courses taken were 15 and 15, respectively, at the end of 2014,
  the target was met.

  ensuring the nuclear energy and safety culture competence of the personnel
  competent and motivated personnel form the basis of the safe operation of a nuclear power plant. tvo continuously organizes training events in order to maintain the
  professional skills and competence of its personnel. ensuring the nuclear energy and safety culture competence of the personnel is central to the training of the company’s
  personnel as well as subcontractors.

  the target was to implement training in accordance with the annual training program, and it was successfully met. the degree of implementation of the annual training program
  was 84%.

  corporate relations
  supply chain management

  tvo only procures products and services from suppliers approved by the company. a systematic evaluation process is carried out before any contracts are signed. in addition
  to the requirements set for the product or service, the process also considers the reliability and responsibility of the supplier. the target for 2014 was the completion of the
  vastuullinen hankintaketju (sustainable supply chain) report. the target was met.

  open and interactive communication and stakeholder cooperation

  tvo communicates its operations in an open and neutral manner, without delay and based on facts. the objective is to increase knowledge of nuclear power and build mutual
  trust among stakeholders, as well as to support open and constructive interaction in the immediate region, in finnish society, and within the international nuclear energy sector.
  based on energy attitude surveys, the target was that 44% of the respondents would feel that finland’s nuclear power experience has been positive. as the actual percentage
  was 43.2%, the target was slightly missed.

  further information: interaction , transparency , cooperation

  positive impact on society and the owners’ competitive ability

  in 2014, the electricity output of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant was 14,763 gwh, an all­time plant record. the reason behind the excellent production figures in 2014 was
  the exceptionally low number of production disruptions. furthermore, annual outages proceeded more smoothly than before. tvo produced approximately 18% of all the
  electricity consumed, and approximately 23% of all the electricity produced, in finland.

  environment
  climate­friendly with low environmental impact

  by the end of 2014, the olkiluoto plant units had produced a total of 439 billion kilowatt­hours (kwh) of climate­friendly electricity. the environmental key figures monitored are
  the thermal load on the sea caused by the cooling water (in 2014, 1.85 gwh per gwh produced) and the carbon dioxide emissions avoided annually using nuclear electricity
  produced in olkiluoto (in comparison to electricity produced in a coal­fired condensation power plant). every year, the nuclear power­generated electricity produced at olkiluoto
  helps prevent approximately 12 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in finland compared to producing the same amount of electricity using coal. the amount saved
  corresponds to the total annual carbon dioxide emissions of all road traffic in finland. the target – zero major environmental non­conformances – was reached.

  another objective was to keep radioactive releases well below the limits set by the authorities. the target for noble gases was <0.04% of the official limit, and <0.1% for aquatic
  releases. as noble gas releases amounted to 0.00% and aquatic releases to 0.026% of the limits set by the authorities, the target was met.

  successful nuclear waste management

  one of the sub­objectives of the responsibility program is to cut the volume of low and intermediate level waste in the long term. the concrete target for 2014 was to launch
  a survey to establish radioactive waste management alternatives. the target was met.

  risk management
  risk management is an important part of the planning and operations of tvo group. risk management is carried out in
  accordance with the risk management principles, approved by the board of directors, which define the purpose and
  objectives of risk management.
  tvo’s risk management is developed in accordance with the principle of continuous improvement. the risk management
  group, which operates under the management group, prepares an annual assessment of the risk management and identifies
  improvement targets. practical risk management is carried out by the various units of the company.
  identification of risks is based on tvo’s business objectives. unified practices are applied to the assessment of risks. in
  addition to financial impacts, consequences are assessed based on their impact on safety, production operations and
  reputation.
  in 2014, the emphasis of risk management development was in building a more efficient follow­up system for the preparation
  and recovery measures required by identified risks. the concrete actions taken include the introduction of quarterly reporting
  of the most significant risk management measures implemented by the company to the management and board of directors.
  in 2015, the particular focus of the company’s risk management operations will be on the development of risk management
  procedures for project activities and implementation of new practices. furthermore, the operations of the company’s risk
  management group will be reorganized in order to provide better support for the implementation of tvo’s strategy.

  management system
  tvo’s mission, vision, strategic objectives, business model, values, code of conduct, and company­level policies give
  direction to all of its operations. tvo uses an activity­based management system that supports the adherence to plans. the
  system provides the procedures for ensuring safe, competitive, high­quality, and environmentally sound electricity
  production.
  operations are developed according to the principles of continuous improvement. the management process aims at practical
  strategic and operative steering that ensures the realization of both short and long­term goals as well as the motivated and

  cases, concerning non­compliance with the code of conduct. these reports were dealt with, and guidelines and
  recommendations were issued as required to further specify the course of operations.
  code of conduct

  safety
  the safe operation of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on high­quality power plant engineering, the principle of
  continuous improvement, highly capable and conscientious employees, and independent external supervision. tvo’s
  personnel are committed to a high standard of safety culture.
  the safety theme of the corporate social responsibility 2014 report includes a description of tvo’s safety culture and its
  development, a report on special events, and an account of research and development operations.

  safety culture

  safety at the core of operations
  the nuclear energy act requires that the use of nuclear energy must be safe; it shall not
  cause injury to people or damage to the environment or property. the safe operation of the
  olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on safe power plant engineering, highly capable and
  conscientious employees, and independent external supervision. safety – and the
  promotion thereof – is a factor shared by the entire nuclear power industry.
  safety is a special area of focus for nuclear power plants because the uranium fuel
  becomes highly radioactive during the power production process, and continues to
  generate heat even after being removed from the reactor. spent nuclear fuel is cooled in
  water­filled pools, as water also acts as an efficient radiation shield. the olkiluoto power
  plant has abundant water reserves to ensure the cooling of both the fuel in the reactor and
  the spent fuel. the plant also has multiple power supply back­up systems for cooling water
  circulation systems.

  nuclear safety and safe power plant engineering                                                                              case
  nuclear safety is developed by analyzing risks and by making provisions for them. nuclear                                    everything is based on
  safety is always based on the valid and constant laws of physics.                                                            safe procedures

  release barriers. the diverse and redundant safety systems reduce the probability of
  accidents.
  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant has four­fold safety systems. if one system fails, the next one takes over. an operator
  error or even several equipment failures cannot cause a serious accident.
  tvo has implemented modifications at olkiluoto to improve the safety of the plant throughout its operating life. new
  improvements will also be designed and implemented in the future.

  competent and responsible personnel
  tvo’s entire personnel, suppliers, and subcontractors are committed to an uncompromising safety culture. all factors that
  affect the nuclear power plant’s safety receive attention in proportion with their significance and are given priority in decision
  making. the principle of continuous improvement and safety culture are present in all day­to­day work.

  tvo uses the star approach to everyday safety. the star approach means that employees should always first stop and
  think, and only then act, and finally review whether everything went as it should have. tvo encourages employees to report
  errors and observations, and aims to maintain a low threshold for such reporting.
  safety culture­related principles:

     follow the approved procedures and instructions without compromise

     make sure that you and others use safe working practices and work in safe conditions

     stop and think before you act, and review the consequences of your actions

     report all problems and deficiencies without delay

     maintain an atmosphere where reporting can be done freely and without blame

     question practices and develop operations in the spirit of continuous development
  self­evaluations are carried out at tvo to examine the state of the safety culture. based on these, the state of the tvo
  safety culture is good. however, we have identified some development areas. 2014 saw the launching of a safety culture
  survey at tvo. performed by external experts, the survey is mainly carried out through interviews. the results of the survey
  will be available in early 2015.
  the performance of the safety culture survey is in line with tvo’s nuclear safety and quality policy. tvo must ensure the
  high quality of the working methods used in the company. they lay the foundation for safe and economical operations.
  according to tvo’s practice, matters are discussed in an open manner, and competencies and operating methods are
  developed according to the principle of continuous improvement. the sharing of development areas, observed deficiencies,
  deviations, and errors is encouraged.
  in 2014, the focus of the safety culture was on the development areas identified in a peer review carried out by the world
  association of nuclear operators (wano). wano is an international organization of nuclear operators. its aim is to develop
  the safety of the nuclear facilities owned by its members and prevent the occurrence of severe accidents in the future. one
  of the development areas identified in the review is supervisory work. supervisors are encouraged to more often involve
  themselves with the work of their subordinates, familiarize themselves with the work in progress and provide support in any
  problematic situations that may arise.

  development

  safety – shared by the entire nuclear power industry
  tvo’s operations are subject to a license and supervision by the authorities. the radiation
  and nuclear safety authority (stuk) supervises nuclear and radiation safety.
  tvo is not alone in thinking about safety issues. other nuclear power companies,
  organizations, research institutes, and public authorities are looking for ways to develop the
  safety of nuclear power and safety culture at nuclear power plants. for example, wano
  supports the gathering of operating experiences and their utilization by its members.
  in 2011, following the fukushima nuclear accident, several surveys were conducted to
  analyze the power plant’s preparedness for extreme natural phenomena and other external
  threats. the work included both national surveys and participation in eu ”stress tests”. in
  spring 2012, the ensreg expert group that compiled the final report for the nuclear power
  plant safety reviews stated that no safety defects or previously unidentified development

  needs that would call for improvements were detected at olkiluoto. the olkiluoto nuclear
  power plant received praise for its multiple power supply back­ups and the severe accident
  management system that can prevent any major releases in the very unlikely case of a
                                                                                                                               case

  continued carrying out preliminary surveys, planning, and implementation of plant
  modifications. the most important improvements implemented during the year were the
  construction of the make­up water supply system for the fuel pools of the interim storage for spent nuclear fuel (kpa) and the
  significant reduction in the dependence of reactor core cooling from the operability of the sea water cooling system at the
  ol1 plant unit. tvo provides stuk with progress reports every six months. tvo’s safety team regularly follows the
  associated projects.
  update of official safety regulations was completed in 2013, and stuk published most of the regulations at the end of the
  year. in 2014, tvo prepared a suitability analysis for the new yvl guides for the ol1 and ol2 plant units and submitted it
  to stuk. for the ol3 plant unit, a suitability analysis will be prepared in 2015 and submitted to stuk in conjunction with the
  operating license application in 2016.
  over the years, tvo has continuously carried out modernization and safety improvements at its plants. in 2014, the most
  important of these included the improvements made to electrical systems, plant modifications resulting in the reduction of the
  dependence of residual heat removal on sea water at ol1, the commencement of the main circulation pump reconstruction
  project, and the ongoing emergency diesel generator replacement project. these projects will continue in 2015.
  the power plant is currently undergoing modifications, with more in the planning stages. the purpose of these modifications
  is to prepare for the renewal of the operating license of the plant units in 2018. the modifications will further improve the
  plant’s ability to survive various events caused by exceptional natural phenomena, which, in the worst case, can involve the
  simultaneous loss of the operability of several plant units or safety systems. also underway is a project to improve the
  company’s safety culture and the related procedures.
  tvo will replace the emergency diesel generators as part of an ongoing major modernization project. the emergency diesel
  generators ensure the power supply of the plant in the possible but unlikely loss­of­power situation. the new emergency
  diesel generators have both seawater and air cooling systems. the preparation of the emergency diesel replacement project
  began in the early 2000s, and the project is the most extensive single plant modification project to ever have been carried
  out at olkiluoto. tvo acquires the emergency diesel generators from wärtsilä finland oy. the agreement on the delivery of
  emergency diesel generators and their auxiliary systems to the olkiluoto nuclear power plant was signed in may 2013. the
  implementation of the replacement project will begin in 2016 and is estimated to continue to 2020.
  in july, tvo signed a contract with westinghouse electric sweden (wse) on the replacement of the main circulation pumps
  of olkiluoto 1 and 2. covering a total of 12 main circulation pumps, the contract is worth over eur 40 million. the
  replacement of the main circulation pumps is one of the most significant modernization efforts in the history of tvo. the
  current pumps have been in operation for 35 years. their replacement helps to ensure that the safe and reliable operation of
  the plant units can continue in the future.

  special events

  reporting of special events
  the events that take place at a nuclear power plant are classified on the international ines scale according to their degree
  of severity. the ines scale has seven categories of severity. category 4–7 events are classified as accidents, category 1–
  3 events as incidents or anomalies with a negative effect on safety, and category 0 events as deviations with no
  significance for safety.
  tvo reported three events in 2014. of these events, two were rated at severity level 0 on the ines scale (no significance to
  nuclear or radiation safety), and one was rated at severity level 1 (anomaly; an exceptional event affecting safety). tvo has

  reported all ines events on its web site in the news section (linkki).
  tvo processes all operational events that take place at the olkiluoto nuclear power plant, and follows the events at other
  nuclear power plants around the world. operations are continuously developed based on the observations made of such
  events.
  various human factors relating to working methods, communication, and other corresponding matters have been identified by
  tvo as the cause of the most recent events. necessary changes are implemented based on the assessments to further
  develop the procedures.
  tvo regularly carries out emergency preparedness drills either independently or in cooperation with the authorities. in
  october 2014, olkiluoto played host to an extensive national­level emergency preparedness drill organized to practice the
  management of a hypothetical radiation accident.
  tvo submits separate case­specific reports to stuk for all special events and operating transients.




  research and development
  tvo’s r&d operations focus on supporting the acquisition and renewal of nuclear power
  plants’ construction and operating licenses through the production of high­quality technical
  data, and on validating data and calculations for the needs and use of the plant units.
  modernization and modification work carried out at the plant units, as well as following and
  using new technology, create research needs as well. in 2014, measures based on safety
  assessments have been carried out at the plant. these measures have also resulted in
  new research approaches. changes made to national regulations (yel, vna and yvl
  guides) have been taken into account in the definition of research projects. the storage,
  handling and final disposal of waste comprise another important research area. the
  development of a safe spent nuclear fuel disposal solution by posiva oy is by far the most
  important objective of tvo’s research work beginning of 2020s.
  the total costs of tvo’s research and development operations were eur 33.4 (37.7)
  million. the figure includes nuclear waste management research and development costs, of
  which posiva’s share was eur 27.5 (31.5) million. in addition to these, approximately 13
  man­years were spent at tvo on operations relating to various r&d projects.
  tvo is the biggest contributor to the financing of national public research programs on                                      case
  nuclear power plant safety (safir2014) and nuclear waste management (kyt2014). in

  comprehensive views and, as regards final disposal, to achieve readiness to assess long­
  term safety using independent methods to meet the authorities’ needs.
  primary areas of focus for research in 2014 included the ol1 and ol2 lifecycle management and modernization projects.
  for lifecycle management, an extensive integrated information system has been adopted to combine strength calculation,
  process simulations, and the operating history of plant structures. the development of the system began at tvo in the
  1990s; currently, the development work focuses on the integration of the calculation systems. research in i&c technology
  focuses on the solutions required for the modernization of ol1 and ol2 and the construction of ol3. primary research
  targets include the adoption and licensing of digital i&c technology.
  fuel research supports ensuring safety; the research aims at safe reactor operation, good fuel economy, and safe final
  disposal of spent fuel. fuel research is tvo’s most important area of international research cooperation, which requires
  special competence, available testing reactors, and fuel hot cell studies. the best option to obtain all of these is international
  cooperation. research further specifies and validates the safe use of the fuel and accident safety margins with a higher
  burnup. the behavior of fuel in storage and during final disposal is another important field of study. tvo also participates in
  euratom first nuclides project which focuses on the behavior of actual spent uo2 fuels in groundwater environments. the
  project is carried out in cooperation with european research institutes, power companies, and organizations responsible for
  the development of final disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
  tvo also actively participates in the operations and research projects of more extensive international cooperation networks.
  tvo joined the european nugenia association after it was established in fall 2012. the purpose of the association is to
  steer and carry out european research and development in the field of fission energy, focusing on existing reactors, that is,
  genii and geniii nuclear power plants. furthermore, tvo participates in the swedish elforsk reactor technology research
  program, the main topics of which are concrete structures and reactor circuit components. in 2014, tvo also launched
  cooperation with the u.s.­based electric power research institute (epri). the cooperation enables the acquisition and
  utilization of new information from an international source.
  tvo also supports research operations carried out to develop new research infrastructures. new experimental technology is
  being built eg. into the jules horowitz material testing reactor in france which can be used for reactor materials and fuels
  research required by modern nuclear facilities, supporting the development within the next decades. this cooperation relates
  to the implementation of the national nuclear energy strategy (yes). strategy work was completed in spring 2014.

  uranium from bedrock to bedrock
  the safe use of nuclear fuel is ensured at all stages of the electricity production chain, from the responsible procurement of
  uranium to the safe final disposal of spent fuel.
  the “uranium from bedrock to bedrock” theme of the corporate social responsibility 2014 report includes the following
  sections: procurement of uranium; production of electricity at olkiluoto 1 and olkiluoto 2; progress of the olkiluoto 3 and
  olkiluoto 4 projects; nuclear waste management and the finnish state nuclear waste management fund; and final disposal
  of spent nuclear fuel.

  procurement of uranium

  procurement of uranium

  from responsible partners only
  uranium is an element widely present in nature – it is approximately 40 times more common
  than silver. nearly half of all uranium is produced using conventional mining techniques in
  underground mines and open pits, while roughly the same quantity is produced by in­situ
  leaching. the rest, approximately 7%, is produced as a by­product of other mining
  operations. in 2013, primary production covered approximately 90% of the uranium
  requirement of the world’s nuclear power plants. the remaining 10% is obtained from
  various inventories and the reprocessing of spent fuel.
  the largest producers of uranium (based on 2013 statistics) are kazakhstan, canada,
  australia, niger, and namibia. together, these countries account for more than three
  quarters of the world’s total production volume. uranium is usually produced by large
  international companies with operations in several countries. the eight largest companies
  cover approximately 85% of all production, with ten mines producing roughly half of all
  uranium.
  environmental protection and monitoring of mining operations, as well as occupational and                                    case
  radiation safety requirements, are defined on the basis of the legislation and regulations
  valid in the country where the operations take place. the requirements set for the                                           implementation of a

  for waste management, the closure of the mine and the ore enrichment plant, and
  landscaping should be gathered during production operations.
  certification of quality, environmental, and occupational health and safety management systems is widely applied; large
  operators in particular have certified the management systems of their production facilities. responsible companies follow
  the same standards and the principles of safety and social responsibility in all their locations, which in turn promotes the
  development of legislation and procedures of new mining countries.

  well-planned fuel procurement
  tvo has high­level expertise in all phases of the fuel procurement process. furthermore, the composition of the fuel and the
  manner in which it is used are designed by tvo itself. this is not very common, as most operators procure their fuel from a
  single supplier on a turnkey basis. the policy chosen by tvo clearly strengthens the company’s position as finland’s leading
  supplier of nuclear power.
  tvo procures its fuel through a decentralized supply chain, entering into negotiations and making procurement contracts with
  each separate supplier in the various stages of the supply chain. there are several suppliers for each stage of the chain,
  and the procurement operations are regularly subjected to competitive bidding.
  procurement operations are based on long­term contracts with leading suppliers. if required, tvo purchases additional
  batches and services from the market, the developments of which are followed actively.
  the majority of the uranium procured by tvo comes from kazakhstan, canada, and australia, and the fuel elements ordered
  by the company are constructed and assembled in germany, spain, or sweden.

  tvo subjects fuel suppliers to strict evaluation
  tvo employs a supplier evaluation method and only procures uranium and nuclear fuel refining services from suppliers who

  have passed the evaluation process. a systematic evaluation process precedes the closure of each supply contract. in
  addition to the requirements set for the products, the process also considers the reliability and responsibility of the supplier.
  tvo’s supplier evaluation also includes active monitoring and evaluations at fixed intervals. remote monitoring from finland
  and excursions to production sites both provide tvo with an opportunity to examine suppliers’ practices and, when
  necessary, to demand that changes are made to them. the purpose of supplier evaluation is to ensure that suppliers pay
  appropriate attention to environmental issues, the well­being of personnel, and quality management. special issues
  concerning mines are also considered, such as the impact of operations on local people.

  nuclear power plant ol1 and ol2
  tvo produces electricity at olkiluoto, eurajoki, with two plant units, olkiluoto 1 and 2 (ol1
  and ol2). they have been in production operation for over 35 years. olkiluoto 1 was
  connected to the national grid on september 2, 1978. safe, economical and
  environmentally benign base load energy has been produced in olkiluoto for the needs of
  finnish society ever since. after their first few years of operation, olkiluoto 1 and olkiluoto
  2, commissioned in 1980, have been continuously among the most reliable nuclear power
  plant units.
  the competent expert staff of tvo is the number one success factor behind the stable
  long­term power production. tvo has a strong safety­oriented operating culture based on
  committed personnel who build their competencies in the spirit of continuous improvement.

  the plant’s ability to survive various events caused by exceptional natural phenomena,
  which can involve the simultaneous loss of the operability of several plant units or safety
  systems.
  in addition to production output, the modernization has also improved the energy efficiency of the plant units, which means
  benefits for the environment. tvo is a party to the energy efficiency agreement and complies with the related energy
  production action plan that aims at the implementation of energy efficiency improvement measures as well as improving the
  efficiency of primary energy usage and the overall efficiency of energy production. tvo’s energy efficiency objective based
  on the energy efficiency agreement is to save 340 gwh in 2008–2016. the efficiency plan will be valid until the end of the
  agreement period. tvo already achieved its objective, savings of 340 gwh of electricity, by the end of 2011. the saved
  amount corresponds to the annual consumption of approximately 18,000 houses with electrical heating systems.

  annual outage with refueling and maintenance
  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is constantly kept in an excellent condition by alternating refueling and maintenance
  outages. the annual outages that take place every spring at olkiluoto usually begin with a refueling outage where part of the
  uranium fuel is replaced and the necessary repairs and maintenance operations are carried out, together with any
  preparatory work for the following year’s maintenance outage. the refueling outage usually takes about one week.
  the annual maintenance operations then continue with the maintenance outage of the other plant unit where major
  maintenance and modification work is carried out in addition to refueling. the maintenance outage usually takes two to three
  weeks. extensive modernization and reconditioning operations have been carried out during the maintenance outages at
  approximately five­year intervals.
  the 2014 annual outages of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant took place from may 11 to june 9. ol2 underwent an eight­
  day refueling outage, and ol1 a maintenance outage of approximately 17 days.
  the main focus of the ol1 outage was on the replacement of low­voltage switchgear and the modification of the auxiliary
  feedwater system. two subsystems were provided with new low­voltage switchgear and transformers that meet the
  requirements of the latest regulations, the relevant standards, and future plant modifications. replacement of switchgear is
  part of the systematic long­term development of the plant units. other important work included refueling, the replacement of
  an auxiliary transformer, and the maintenance of sea water channels.
  at ol2, refueling was followed by replacement of one main sea water pump and annual maintenance, testing and repair
  work.
  approximately 1,000 subcontractor employees, 900 of whom were finnish, participated in the annual outages in addition to
  tvo’s own personnel.

  olkiluoto 3
  a third tvo plant unit, ol3, is currently under construction at olkiluoto. the ol3
  construction site is a major international project. at the end of 2014, approximately 780
  people were working at the ol3 construction site. an uncompromising safety culture is a
  basic requirement at the site, and occupational safety indicators remained at a very good
  level.
  the construction of the plant unit has progressed to an advanced state. in december 2013,
  the plant supplier announced that it would focus its effort on the design tasks that are the
  most urgent and critical for the project. at the same time, the plant supplier, areva­
  siemens, made public its plans to reduce the number of subcontractors and workers at the
  ol3 site. tvo required that the plant supplier provide an updated overall schedule and an
  account of the measures to be carried out to ensure the appropriate progress of the
  project. in september 2014, tvo received further information on the ol3 project schedule
  from the plant supplier. according to this information, regular production of electricity at the
  ol3 plant unit is slated to commence in late 2018.
  the pressure and leaktightness tests of the olkiluoto 3 plant unit containment building were
  successfully completed in february 2014. the i&c testing started in april. the testing is                                    case
  carried out in the testing environment of the plant supplier, areva­siemens, in germany.
  the purpose of the testing is to verify the operation of the i&c equipment before it is                                      containment pressure
  transferred to the plant site at olkiluoto. cabling work continued in the fall. the initial                                  and leak-tightness
  commissioning phase continued at the turbine island.                                                                         tests completed

  same from all companies with operations at olkiluoto. tvo requires the plant supplier and
  subcontractors to observe, among other things, the laws and regulations governing taxation                                   read more
  and working hours, as well as union contracts. tvo has worked systematically to eradicate
  the gray economy and to promote the related legislation.
  compliance is continuously monitored. there are several alternative channels available at the site for reporting any
  deficiencies or for expressing concerns to tvo. tvo will report any suspected failures to observe regulations to the plant
  supplier and require the plant supplier to investigate the situation and take the necessary action for improving it. tvo will
  also report suspected infringements to public authorities, when necessary. authorities can be granted permanent access
  permits to the ol3 site to facilitate and streamline unannounced inspections.
  tvo is involved in a cooperation team established at the initiative of the employment and economic development office of
  rauma, with the representatives of various authorities processing current issues related to the ol3 project and discussing
  possible methods of advancing official procedures. the team includes representatives from the ministry of employment and
  the economy, the regional state administrative agency, the finnish centre for pensions, tax administration, the police, the
  local parish, stuk, tvo, and the plant supplier consortium, areva­siemens. representatives of trade unions are also
  regularly invited to participate.

  olkiluoto 4

  olkiluoto 4 at the bidding and engineering phase
  on july 1, 2010, the finnish parliament confirmed a favorable decision­in­principle by the
  government concerning the construction of the new ol4 unit. the project advanced in
  2014 to the bidding and engineering phase including a procurement process aiming to the
  selection of the plant alternative.
  due to further delays to the olkiluoto 3 project, tvo submitted on may 20, 2014 to the
  finnish government an application requesting that a new deadline be set for the submittal
  of the ol4 construction license application and that a decision be issued stating that the
  construction of ol4 will benefit society as a whole in spite of the changes in the project
  schedule. the government rejected tvo’s application on september 25, 2014.
  according to the decision­in­principle concerning ol4, the deadline for the submittal of the
  construction license application is june 30, 2015.

  nuclear waste management
  low and intermediate level waste, also called operating waste, accumulates during the
  operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plant. some of the nuclear power plant
  structures become radioactive during the operation of the plant and need to be disposed of
  when the plant has been decommissioned. nuclear power plants use uranium fuel which,
  during operation, becomes high level radioactive waste that requires final disposal at a
  repository. before final disposal, spent nuclear fuel is kept in the interim storage facility for
  spent nuclear fuel.
  responsibility for nuclear waste management lies with the nuclear power companies that
  must carry out the necessary nuclear waste management measures for their own waste at
  their own cost. according to the finnish nuclear energy act, nuclear waste generated in
  finland must be treated, stored, and finally disposed of in finland, and the import of nuclear
  waste into finland is prohibited.
  tvo also takes care of the operating waste and the power plant decommissioning waste. it
  is disposed of in the operating waste repository located at olkiluoto. the repository also
  accommodates small radioactive waste generated in finnish healthcare, industries, and                                        case
  research institutions.
                                                                                                                               increase in capacity for
  tvo also carefully manages the intermediate storage of spent nuclear fuel. the interim
                                                                                                                               interim storage of
  storage for spent nuclear fuel in olkiluoto was expanded in 2010–2014 in order to provide
                                                                                                                               spent fuel
  for the interim storage of spent fuel elements from both the existing ol1 and ol2 plant
  units and the ol3 plant unit currently under construction. the extension was officially                                      read more
  commissioned in december 2014. the extension doubled the available fuel pool capacity.
  furthermore, the extension doubled the space available for the interim storage of spent fuel
  assemblies from the olkiluoto plant units and provided improved safety features.

  advance collection of waste management funds
  the cost of final disposal of nuclear waste and spent fuel is collected from the owners of tvo in the price of nuclear power­
  produced electricity and deposited in a fund for future use.
  in finland, nuclear power companies bear the costs of nuclear waste management, and the funds for that purpose are

  collected into the state nuclear waste management fund. each year, the ministry of employment and the economy
  determines the share of each nuclear power company in the state nuclear waste management fund as well as the waste
  management fee to be paid to the fund. each nuclear power company’s share of liabilities in the fund is decreased by the
  investments it has made in final disposal.
  the annual fee payable to the fund is determined on the basis of the amount of disposable nuclear waste accumulated less
  the effect of actions taken for nuclear waste management. the fee is also increased or decreased on the basis of how well
  the fund succeeds in its investments: if the interest income is higher than expected, the fee is correspondingly reduced. the
  objective is to accumulate enough assets in the fund so that it allows for the final disposal of accumulated nuclear fuel to be
  carried out.

  final disposal

  final disposal of spent nuclear fuel
  spent nuclear fuel must be managed to avoid any risk to people or organic nature. a
  responsible producer of nuclear power­generated electricity will look after the fuel all the
  way, from bedrock to bedrock. tvo and fortum have established a company, posiva oy,
  to handle the final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel produced in the olkiluoto and loviisa
  nuclear power plants.
  final disposal has been researched and tested for 40 years, first by the tvo nuclear
  waste office, and later by posiva. the multi­discipline research and development
  cooperation has yielded a solution that has gained wide acceptance in finland, in the eu,
  and throughout the nuclear power community.
  in the solution developed by posiva, spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters
  and placed in the olkiluoto bedrock at an approximate depth of 400 meters.
  the safety of the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is based on the multiple barriers
  principle. the barriers ensure that nuclear waste does not come into contact with people or organic nature. one deficient
  barrier, a predictable geological change, or other similar factor will not compromise effective isolation. barriers include the
  solid state of the fuel, the final disposal canister, the bentonite clay buffer, the tunnel filling material, and the surrounding
  bedrock.
  the plan is to pack the spent fuel into canisters in the encapsulation plant. after encapsulation, the canisters are transported
  to the underground disposal facility by an elevator.

  before final disposal, the spent fuel is kept in an interim storage facility at tvo’s olkiluoto power plant. from the power plant,
  the fuel will be transported to the encapsulation plant of the final disposal facility in special containers. spent fuel from tvo’s
  and fortum’s power plants in olkiluoto and loviisa will be placed in the olkiluoto repository.
  plenty of time has been reserved for the preparation and practical execution of final disposal. thorough preparations and
  careful implementation ensure the safety of the final disposal. the disposal of spent fuel is scheduled to begin in the 2020s; it
  will continue for nearly 100 years.
  posiva submitted a final disposal facility construction license application to the ministry of employment and the economy in
  late 2013. during the year under review, the final disposal facility construction license application was supplemented with
  additional reports required by the radiation and nuclear safety authority (stuk). according to stuk, it will submit its
  statement on the long­term safety of final disposal to the ministry of employment and the economy in early 2015. the
  advisory committee on nuclear safety will evaluate the statement and the safety assessment prior to their submittal to the
  ministry of employment and the economy. a construction license is required for the construction of the actual final disposal
  facility to commence.
  in 2014, posiva launched implementation planning for the final disposal facility and encapsulation plant with the objective of
  achieving readiness for the procurement of the facility subassemblies, and strengthened its organization in preparation for
  the launching of the implementation phase. an international tunnel closure testing program, coordinated by posiva and
  partially financed by the eu, continued in the final disposal research facility onkalo at the depth of 420 meters. eight
  countries are involved in the program. furthermore, posiva has had prototype equipment constructed for the purpose of
  carrying out the component­specific full­scale final disposal installation tests.

  environment
  the climate­friendliness of nuclear power­generated electricity makes tvo an important contributor to the mitigation of
  climate change and advocate of sustainable development. while the level of tvo’s environmental management is already
  high, we aim for the continual improvement of operations and a high level of environmental protection. the production of
  electricity with nuclear power generates no greenhouse gas or particle emissions. the most significant environmental impact
  of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is the warming up of the sea water near the plant.

  established in 1969, tvo is a limited liability company. its nuclear power plant in olkiluoto,          reputation
  eurajoki, has been producing electricity for over 35 years. the olkiluoto 1 and 2 plant units           read more
  were built to satisfy the increasing need for electricity of finnish energy­intensive
  industries. during the past decades, tvo has developed from an industrial resource to a
  base load producer that benefits the entire society. the olkiluoto power plant currently produces approximately one­sixth of
  finland’s total electricity output. approximately half of the electricity produced by tvo is used by industry. the other half is
  used by households, in service production and in agriculture via power utilities.
  after their early years, ol1 and ol2 have remained among the most reliable nuclear power plant units in the world. on
  olkiluoto island, tvo has all the competence, structures, functions, and waste management required for the safe production
  and construction of nuclear electricity. tvo’s nuclear power expertise and operating experience attract worldwide interest
  among the industry.
  during their operation, the olkiluoto plant units have produced a total of 439 billion
  kilowatt­hours (kwh) of climate­friendly electricity. every year, the nuclear power
  produced at olkiluoto helps prevent approximately 12 million tons of carbon dioxide
  emissions in finland compared to producing the same amount of electricity using coal.
  the saved amount corresponds to the total annual carbon dioxide emissions of all
  road traffic in finland.
  the olkiluoto site also features a 1­megawatt (mw) wind power plant, as well as a
  100 mw gas turbine reserve power plant built as a joint project of fingrid oyj and
  tvo. tvo’s share of the electricity produced by the meri­pori coal­fired power plant is
  45%. in addition to olkiluoto, tvo has an office in helsinki and branch offices in
  rauma and pori.
  through its direct owners, tvo’s nuclear power­produced electricity brings well­being
  to 135 municipalities. these municipalities are shareholders in more than 50 energy
  companies that serve as a route for distributing electricity from olkiluoto throughout
  finland.

  group structure
  tvo’s majority shareholder is pohjolan voima oy with its share of 58.5% of the tvo stock. teollisuuden voima oyj is a joint
  venture of pohjolan voima and several other companies.
  tvo nuclear services oy (tvons) is a subsidiary fully owned by tvo. tvo and fortum also have a joint venture, posiva
  oy, of which tvo owns 60%.

  financing
  tvo’s financing situation has developed as planned, and an efficient mix of financing
  sources has been used. the role of the international capital market as a source of
  financing has increased further. in terms of obtaining capital market financing, credit ratings
                                                                                                                               case

  proper financing ensures tvo’s solvency in all circumstances. tvo’s basic principle is to                                    read more
  raise about three quarters of the funding required for investments from the financial
  markets, with about one quarter coming from the owners. tvo prefers long­term financing
  arrangements. financing is always sought for the company, not for individual projects.
  tvo is in the middle of major investments; their financing arrangements require strong trust. while major projects are in
  progress, it is important to maintain the trust of investors. from the point of view of investors, the good electricity production
  capacity of ol1 and ol2 is very valuable. these plant units have already been generating electricity for more than 35 years
  with high load factors, and the original investments have been amortized.
  tvo’s owners are very committed to the company and trust its operations. the solid trust was reflected in shareholder loan
  commitments made for the completion of the ol3 project and financing of the ol4 project bidding and engineering phase, as
  well as successful bond issues.

  economic aspects
  tvo creates well­being, employment and income by producing cost­price electricity for its shareholders. the company has a
  significant impact on the economy of the municipalities in the immediate region, and it directly or indirectly touches the
  everyday life of thousands of people all over finland.
  tvo’s operations are based on the production of electricity to shareholders at cost price. owners cover all of tvo’s
  operating costs and, in return, receive electricity pro­rata to their ownership. tvo’s owners consume the power themselves
  or sell it on to third parties. the cost price model allows electricity companies and electricity users of different sizes to
  participate in major investments, such as those required for nuclear power, and reap the benefits of large­scale production.
  tvo’s owners include 134 municipalities, which means that stable costs and predictability, the benefits of cost­price
  electricity, are felt all over finland.
  the financial performance of companies is compared using various indicators. due to the cost price operating principle, tvo
  cannot be analyzed using conventional financial indicators, as they were created for comparing companies that aim to make
  a profit. important indicators to tvo and the owners include the amount of electricity produced and the load factors of the
  plant units.
  in 2014, tvo’s olkiluoto nuclear power plant achieved a record production output for the second consecutive year. the
  combined electricity production of the two plant units, 14.76 twh (billion kilowatt­hours), exceeded the previous record,
  made in 2013, by nearly 130,000 mwh. the combined load factor of the plant units was 96.0%. the reason behind the
  excellent production figures was the exceptionally low number of production disruptions. taking into account tvo’s share of
  the meri­pori power plant, the company produced a total of 15.15 twh of electricity. olkiluoto accounted for approximately
  18% of all the electricity produced in finland.
  the 2014 annual outages of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant took place from may 11 to june 9, 2014. ol1 underwent a
  maintenance outage of approximately 17 days, and ol2 an eight­day refueling outage.
  tvo makes investments to improve the availability, productivity and safety of its nuclear power plant. modernizations have
  brought the net electrical output of ol1 and ol2 from 660 mw to 880 mw, 1,760 mw combined, and significantly improved
  the safety and efficiency of production operations. tvo aims to maintain the plant units as good as new.
  in july 2014, tvo signed a contract with westinghouse electric sweden (wse) on the replacement of the main circulation
  pumps of ol1 and ol2. covering a total of 12 main circulation pumps, the contract is worth over eur 40 million. the pump

  electricity at a stable price
  the price of electricity charged from tvo’s owners remains stable when operations follow
  plans and both costs and production figures are in line with the budget. tvo produces a
  steady supply of electricity and maintains its future production capacity.
  the operations were according to plan in 2014; the production of electricity, turnover, and
  the production cost of electricity were all in line with the targets set. a stable and
  predictable price for electricity is important to our owners.
  in 2014, tvo’s turnover was eur 324.8 (362.8) million. the reasons for the decreased
  turnover were the decrease in the production of the meri­pori plant and the lower costs of
  the olkiluoto plant in comparison to the previous year. of the turnover, eur 28.8 (40.4)
  million was accumulated from the electricity produced at the meri­pori coal­fired power
  plant. tvo’s share of the meri­pori power plant’s production capacity is 45 %.

  flexible hours have been in use for more than 20 years, allowing employees to better
  balance their work with their free time. with flexible work arrangements, employees are
  able to arrange their daily and weekly working hours according to their needs. other systems promoting occupational well­
  being at tvo include the internal sabbatical system applied since the early 1990s, job alternation leaves, and part­time
  working arrangements.

  tvo promotes diverse club activities. the clubs provide an opportunity for recreation through exercise, culture, and other
  activities. the personnel also have access to vacation destinations for spending their free time. opportunities for
  maintaining skills and competencies also form an important part of occupational well­being. the personnel’s training and
  development needs are reviewed every year in the result and development discussions.

  competence development
  competent and motivated personnel form the basis of the safe operation of a nuclear
  power plant. tvo continuously organizes training events in order to maintain the
  professional skills and competence of its personnel. internal training is available in fields
  such as plant technology, nuclear power, and plant operation. a high level of competence is
  achieved through practices such as training programs, job rotation, and induction targeted
  at different occupational groups.
  each tvo employee has a task­specific and a personal training plan. in 2014, the
  employees received a total of 7,272 (7,892) days of training, which means on average 8.5
  (8.8) days per each tvo employee. annual training programs are prepared with attention to
  task­specific training programs and other detected training needs. the implementation of
  the annual training program is monitored, and during the year under review, it was found to
  follow the plan for the most part.
  the development of online training and learning continued with the introduction of a new,
  modernized online learning environment, oppinet. the first online course organized in the
  modernized environment was an induction training refresher course. all employees working at the olkiluoto nuclear power
  plant must complete induction training every three years. the general section of the training is intended for everyone working
  in the olkiluoto area, while the radiation protection section is only intended for those working in the controlled area. in 2014,
  1,894 people completed the general section of induction training in the classroom, and 671 completed the radiation
  protection section (reported on january 13, 2015). both sections of training were provided in finnish and english. in 2014,
  344 people completed the induction training general section refresher course online, and 229 completed the radiation
  protection section.
  to improve supervisor skills, training and topical subject days on various themes are arranged for supervisors. basic
  supervisor training was organized for 7 new supervisors. furthermore, more than 50 supervisors took part in leadership
  training (jopo training) relating to the development of the company’s operations. the supervisor forum supports the work of
  supervisors. the forum offers supervisors with current information, background information, examples of the application of
  instructions, links, and other helpful materials.
  the operating personnel of the power plants receive extensive training throughout their career. in 2014, operators of ol1
  and ol2 participated in operating training events and advanced simulator courses in the spring and in the fall as required by
  their refresher training program. the members of the new operators’ training group, who started in the position in 2014,
  participated in the basic course in nuclear engineering and system­specific training courses according to plan.
  in 2014, the ol3 operators participated in operating training events in the spring and in the fall as required by their refresher
  training program. furthermore, simulator training was organized for shift supervisors. the same opportunity was used to give
  tvo’s trainers training and practice in the use and maintenance tasks of the ol3 simulator. the ol3 operators work in shifts
  in the operating organization jointly established by the plant supplier and tvo, carrying out system operating and monitoring
  tasks. the ol3 operators and ol3 operating department trainers have also participated in system automation testing
  organized by the plant supplier.
  tvo is aware of its role in competence development as well as its needs as a future employer of new nuclear energy
  experts. tvo has engaged in different kinds of cooperation with students and schools. in recent years, tvo has ordered an
  average of 10–15 thesis or diploma projects per year.

  occupational safety

  occupational health and safety operations are guided by an occupational health and safety system compliant with
  the requirements of the ohsas 18001 certificate.
  systematic occupational safety operations are a basic prerequisite of the zero accidents
  approach. the operations include periodic risk assessments and analyses, implementation
  of corrective measures to reduce risks, performance of safety rounds of various degrees,
  and the continuous monitoring and development of operations. safety observations, made
  by everyone working in olkiluoto, are an important indicator of proactive occupational
  safety work. in 2014, the total number of safety observations and occupational safety­
  related field observations made was 703 (589).
  field observation is a tool for supervisors to promote the development of the company’s
  operations and sharing of good practices. the tool has been systematically adopted in
  2014. see the accompanying case article for more information on field observation.
  focus areas of occupational safety in 2014 included the maintenance of occupational
  safety indicators that serve the organization, attention to safety during design, development
  of work guidance and induction training, and improvement of cooperation between the
  various occupational safety organizations active in olkiluoto. measures were defined to

                                                                                                                               case
  achieve these objectives, and indicators were put in place to follow the implementation of
  the measures during the year.
  since 2008, tvo has been in the process of implementing a human performance (hu)                                             even safer working
  program that aims to manage human errors and strongly supports occupational safety. the
                                                                                                                               read more
  hu tools in use include pre­job and post job briefings, confirmation of other work
  independent verification or peer checking, and clear communication. training courses and
  various campaigns, including a poster campaign, were organized to promote awareness of
  the use of the hu tools. practical use of the tools has been monitoring with internal audits
  and field observation. human error­based events during annual maintenance were reported                                      case
  in an event report which examined the role that human factors had in the event.
                                                                                                       subcontractors'
  occupational safety operations are coordinated by an occupational safety organization that           accident figures
  includes an occupational health and safety manager and an occupational health and safety             reduced through
  engineer. in addition, the ol3 site has a dedicated occupational safety team with three              safety assessments
  members. the occupational safety teams of the existing plant units and the ol3 project
                                                                                                       read more
  work closely together. the personnel have elected occupational safety representatives
  from among themselves as follows: an occupational health and safety representative and
  two deputies, seven occupational health and safety delegates, and the occupational health and safety representative of the
  officials, also with two deputies. meetings with the occupational health and safety representatives are regular, and during
  annual outages, safety rounds are conducted together with them at the plant units every other day.
  during the course of the year, 8 (4) accidents leading to a tvo employee being absent from work occurred. the accident
  frequency was 5.9 (2.9) accidents per one million working hours. the accidents led to 39 (12) days of absence. two (3)
  commuting accidents resulting in absence took place during the year. all accidents that led to absences have been
  investigated and corrective measures have been defined for them to prevent similar situations from occurring.
  a total of 14 (5) accidents resulting in absence occurred to tvo’s contractors in olkiluoto, the accident frequency being 14.3
  (5.2) accidents per one million working hours. the number of absence days resulting from these accidents was 183 (137).
  the figures for the areva­siemens consortium are not included in this number.
  the combined accident frequency in olkiluoto was 8.4 (4.1). this figure includes tvo personnel, posiva personnel and all
  contractors active in olkiluoto, excepting the ol3 site which is reported by the areva­siemens consortium.
  at the ol3 site, contractors had 8 (15) accidents resulting in absence during the year, the accident frequency being 3.4 (3.2)

  accidents. the total number of absence days accumulated of all accidents that occurred at the ol3 site was 112 (71).
  in the course of the year, attention was paid to the increase in the number of accidents, and the definition of corrective
  measures was launched. one of the corrective measures implemented was the contractor assessment procedure, described
  in more detail in the referenced case article.

  the occupational radiation exposure of employees at olkiluoto has been low, remaining
  clearly below the dose limits specified by the authorities. in 2014, the collective dose of
  employees working in the controlled area was 643 (649) man­msv, which is the lowest

  interaction with society

  communications build a sense of togetherness
  tvo communicates its operations in an open and neutral manner, without delay and based
  on facts. tvo aims for open and active interaction with all levels of society, including
  decision­makers, opinion leaders and the general public. the objective is to increase
  knowledge of nuclear power and build mutual trust among stakeholders, as well as to
  support open and constructive interaction in the immediate region, in finnish society, and
  within the international nuclear energy sector.
  tvo listens to and observes the issues raised by stakeholder groups, and wishes to be an
  active participant in public discussion, bringing out various themes. for the stakeholder
  groups, the most important matter of concern is the safety of nuclear power production and
  the final disposal of nuclear fuel.
  in 2014, the company engaged in cooperation with its stakeholders in accordance with its
  revised stakeholder strategy.from the point of view of communications, the general public
  is the most important stakeholder group. extension of interaction to new stakeholder groups
  continued in 2014. participation in various events all over finland continued. it is

  eurajoki, rauma, lahti, heinola, and kouvola.

  acceptability of nuclear power
  tvo monitors the general acceptability of nuclear power with annual opinion polls and surveys. according to the latest
  survey, finnish people still hold relatively positive views towards nuclear power, and it appears that the current discussion
  on nuclear power has not had a significant impact on their views on the subject. fifty­one per cent of the respondents felt
  that finland’s nuclear power experience has been positive, with only 20% expressing a contrary opinion. the respondents

  also expressed trust in the responsibility of the finnish nuclear power companies and the authorities. fifty­six per cent of the
  respondents consider that the companies conduct their business in a responsible manner, with 17% expressing an opposed
  opinion.
  climate change is a major source of concern for finnish people, and the majority thinks that its prevention is very important.
  nuclear power is seen to have a significant role in the climate project, and the majority of the respondents believe that
  finland will find it very difficult to cut its greenhouse gas emissions without building new nuclear power plants. the majority of
  finns think that the export of electricity is a good idea. the survey was conducted in october 2014 by iro research oy at
  the request of finnish energy industries. in total, 1,091 respondents were interviewed. the margin of error for the survey
  was +3.2%. tvo is a member of finnish energy industries.
  matters with particular importance to tvo’s stakeholders were established in a survey conducted in fall 2013 by
  pohjoisranta burson­marsteller oy. the survey was directed at decision­makers, people with influence, public officials,
  experts, the media, non­governmental organizations, and tvo personnel and owners. the response rate was 36%, which is
  typical for surveys of this type. according to the responses, tvo is generally seen as a responsible company. attention to
  safety is the most important aspect of responsibility. other important areas include securing production operations and the
  continuous development of operations. awareness of tvo’s operations has also increased, and the company’s reputation
  remains excellent. non­governmental organizations are the stakeholder group that is most critical towards tvo’s operations.
  the next survey is scheduled to take place in 2015.

  communicates its operations and their impact on its stakeholders openly, honestly, and
  without delay, in compliance with legislation and the obligation to provide information. tvo
  engages in open, objective, and interactive cooperation with its stakeholder groups.
  the company participates in the public energy production discourse in which many different
  values are expressed. tvo also respects the views and values of those who have a
  negative attitude towards nuclear power and tvo’s operations.
  tvo cooperates with political decision­makers and the government to develop and execute
  energy legislation and guidelines. tvo’s interaction with stakeholder groups is always
  guided by a high code of conduct, thus strengthening trust in the operations of tvo and the
  stakeholder group, and does not jeopardize the reputation or objectivity of either party. tvo
  does not provide any support for political activity.

  project were discussed with stakeholder groups.

  cooperation

  cooperation in the neighboring region
  the population and local communities in the vicinity of olkiluoto belong to the immediate
  region of the nuclear power plant as defined by tvo. the immediate region covers
  eurajoki, rauma, nakkila, eura, luvia and pori. the economic, social, and environmental
  impacts of the operations primarily concern the municipalities and population of the
  immediate region.
  on the other hand, the entire country can be considered to be within the immediate region
  of tvo, as the cost price electricity of tvo benefits the whole country through the
  municipally owned power utilities included in tvo’s shareholders. tvo produces
  approximately 18% of all electricity consumed in finland. through its minor and major
  shareholders, electricity from olkiluoto keeps machines, services and domestic appliances
  going all over finland.
  tvo aims to be a good and active neighbor. this means open dialog and listening to its
  neighbors. the company organizes various events and meetings to maintain interaction with the residents of neighboring
  areas.
  tvo publishes the uutisia olkiluodosta (news from olkiluoto) magazine for the people living in the immediate region, and
  organizes regular interaction in various forums. these forums include the municipal cooperation committee and the regional
  olkiluoto committee. tvo maintains close interaction with eurajoki in the municipality’s own cooperation team. tvo also
  participates in the operations of the vuojoki foundation and the vuojoki cooperation group.
  the olkiluoto regional cooperation committee was established in 2010 to promote regional interests during the processing of
  the decision­in­principle for ol4. the committee now aims to promote cooperation between olkiluoto and the immediate
  region. the committee consists of key representatives of tvo and posiva, the municipalities and towns of eurajoki, pori,
  and rauma, the satakunta and rauma chambers of commerce, local entrepreneur associations, prizztech oy, the regional
  council of satakunta, the centre for economic development, transport and the environment, and the educational institutions
  in the region. the committee met two times in 2014, while three working groups met a total of seven times during the year.
  the municipal cooperation committee was established in the 1970s upon the initiative of tvo. the committee is a forum for
  interaction and the exchange of information, providing local municipal decision­makers with first­hand information. in addition
  to representatives of tvo and posiva, the committee includes representatives appointed by the municipalities and towns of
  eurajoki, rauma, nakkila, eura, and luvia. in 2014, the committee convened three times.
  in addition to these groups, tvo carried out informal discussions with the residents of the region at market place events
  organized in rauma in june and in eurajoki in july. lively discussion on matters concerning tvo and nuclear power took
  place at these events. the rauma event was attended by about 500 people, while the event in eurajoki attracted about 300
  people. at the eurajoki market in august, tvo’s tent pavilion was visited by approximately 1,000 people. furthermore, we

  organized a three­day coffee and chat tour, with events taking place at the market places of lahti, heinola, and kouvola.
  combined, these events drew some 500 visitors.
  in addition to these events, tvo conducts cooperation with the eurajoki comprehensive school, organizing thematic events
  and the energy in western finland theme weeks together with other west­coast power plants. tvo supports the schools in
  the immediate region when they visit other power plants on the west coast. similarly, olkiluoto receives visits from other
  schools in the west coast region.
  tvo’s strongest positive impact on the immediate community is related to economic well­being and activity in the area,
  achieved through employment. the real estate taxes paid by tvo have a significant economic impact on the municipality of
  eurajoki, and the neighboring municipalities in the region also benefit from the taxes paid by tvo employees. tvo’s most
  significant negative measurable effect on the region is the increase in the temperature of the sea in the vicinity of the power
  plant. the increase in the temperature of seawater is regularly monitored and measured, together with the impact of the
  increased temperature on the sea bed.

  visits

  visits to olkiluoto
  the views of stakeholder groups regarding tvo’s corporate social responsibility issues are
  best obtained from the continuous flow of visitors to olkiluoto. a visit to the visitor center
  and the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is the best and most effective way for stakeholders to
  learn about nuclear power.
  the olkiluoto visitor center is open from october to april from monday to friday between

  activation product: a radioactive nuclide created by neutron radiation in the reactor.

  activity: the number of spontaneous nuclear disintegrations occurring in a given quantity of radioactive material within a
  certain time. the unit of radioactivity, the becquerel (bq), equals one disintegration per second.

  aerosols: a gaseous medium containing solid or liquid particles. in the case of emissions or releases from a nuclear power
  plant, these particles may be radioactive.

  alara (as low as reasonably achievable): an internationally used principle regulating the amount of radiation doses at
  nuclear power plants.

  energy produced in a year by a power plant as a percentage of the energy it would have produced had it been operating at
  full capacity for the entire year.

  carbon­14: carbon­14 is a long­lived, naturally occurring, beta­emitting radioisotope created by cosmic rays in the earth's
  atmosphere. it is also formed in a nuclear reactor when the oxygen in the coolant is activated. carbon­14 then enters the

  emission right: eu­wide carbon dioxide emission rights trading began in 2005. for the entire eu area, annual carbon
  dioxide quotas were specified for industry and energy plants emitting carbon dioxide. the target is to allocate cost­efficiently
  emission reduction measures to where their implementation is the most inexpensive. plants that successfully and cost­
  efficiently reduce their emissions to a lower level than their quota allows may sell their spare emission rights in emissions
  trading. the plants for which the reduction of emissions is costly can purchase emission rights from the market.
  environmental policy: the overall intentions and direction of an organisation relating to its environmental performance as
  formally expressed by top management including compliance with all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment
  and also a commitment to continuous improvement of environmental performance. it provides a framework for action and for
  the setting of environmental objectives and targets.

  environmental performance: the measurable results of an organisation’s management of its environmental aspects.

  environmental aspect: an element of an organisation’s activities, products or services that has or can have an impact on
  the environment. significant environmental aspect means an environmental aspect that has or can have a significant
  environmental impact.
