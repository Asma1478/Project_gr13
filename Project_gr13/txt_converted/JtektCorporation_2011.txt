     enhancing and
     broadening communication with society
     an important factor in the promotion of csr is
     enhancing communication with all stakeholders.
     to date, jtekt have maintained open, sincere dialogue with
     customers, business partners, employees, local communities,
     shareholders and investors, in order to better determine which
     corporate social responsibilities are appropriate for jtekt.
     while valuing our existing connections,
     we will strive to enhance and broaden communication with society and acquire
     even more input to incorporate in our csr activities.
     in fy2010, we made a special effort to build solid relationships with local communities,
     an aspect covered in detail in this year’s report.

     environmental
     report
     establishing a group environmental vision and
     broadening environment conservation activities.
     jtekt thought long and hard about what we can do and
     what future action we should take in order to contribute
     to the conservation of the global environment.
     in fy2010, we established a guideline to lead us down the right path,
     the “jtekt group environmental vision”.
     this guideline will bring the jtekt group, our customers and our business partners
     together regarding approaches to environment conservation and
     make a specific environmental action plan our common goal.
     for our fy2010 milestone, we incorporated biodiversity conservation and
     are promoting activities for the next generation.

     enforcement of environmental accident
     prevention
 at jtekt, we assume environmental risks such as accidents
 and violation of regulations and therefore engage in risk
 reduction and preventative measures.
 we have set internal standards(*) for water quality, atmosphere
 and so on, more stringent than regulations and manage daily
 inspections, monitoring and measurements to prevent abnor-
 malities from occurring. we also conduct emergency drills to
 be prepared for environmental accidents if they occur.

 furthermore, we disseminate information internally regarding
 cases which did not result in accidents or violation of regula-
 tions, but came close. this is done as a preventative measure.                             environmental patrols by the plant manager

 in fy2010 there were no cases of exceeding regulation

 environmental accidents and complaints. there were also no
 environmentally-related lawsuits (fines, penalties).

 we keep emergency procedures for each piece of equipment.                             environmental patrol (hanazono plant)

toyota group forest management experience
in may and october of 2010, the “toyota group forest manage-
ment experience” was held at kise (toyota, aichi). a total of
seven jtekt employees participated and tried their hand at
forest thinning. they learnt about the current status of forests
and the importance of thinning and by actually getting their own
hands dirty, increased their awareness of environmental protec-
tion.
jtekt also proactively engage in activities such as the
kameyama city eco-forest project, which contribute to biodiver-
sity.

 dear readers
we welcome your opinions and
comments regarding this report.
thank you for taking the time to read through our
2011 csr report. this time, we have reflected on
csr activities over the past 5 years since jtekt
was formed. in addition, we have overturned many
new issues through the important guidance of the
iso26000 and the unparalleled earthquake/tsunami
disaster. many of these issues could not be
addressed in this report but it is our hope that we
have impressed upon you that jtekt is evolving.
we would highly appreciate any thoughts or sugges-
tions you may have, as we aim to further improve
our csr activities and this report in the future.
