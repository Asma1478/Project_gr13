                                                                          the nsk group’s vision and initiatives for society and the environment

                                 editorial policy
                    this report outlines the nsk group’s vision for society and the
                  environment and introduces its current initiatives in these areas,
               reﬂecting the group’s commitment to its stakeholders.
              the nsk group believes that its business activities facilitate the sustainable
             development of society and the conservation of the environment. the group
            hopes to succinctly convey its thoughts and actions to the community in this report.
           the report includes a conversation with journalist and author kazuma yamane,
          during which the nsk president clearly explains the nsk group’s mission and its
          role in society. there is also a special article on the company’s products that focuses
          on precision machinery and parts, one of the group’s core businesses. the group
           decided to highlight these products because their sophistication supports many
           industries, and the ball screw, one of the products featured in the article, is a good
            example of an nsk product that has contributed to the development of society.
             a second special article discusses the group’s activities in china, where nsk
              group companies are expanding more rapidly than elsewhere in the world.
                 the csr report working team is made up of leaders from various
                   divisions such as the ir & csr office and the global environment
                     department. the team met and decided on the report’s content
                         after thorough discussion. the report is intended to help
                             deepen readers’ understanding of the nsk group’s
                                 business and its commitment to society.




                                                                                          what is csr?

                                                                                csr is the abbreviation of corporate

    the ball screw technology that has helped

nsk is supporting industrial development and contributing to a prosperous society
between the 1950s and 1970s, japan achieved rapid economic growth
along with scientiﬁc and industrial development to become a world leader
in manufacturing. the tv set, washing machine, and refrigerator that were
once known as the “three treasures” of the japanese household, and later
automobiles as well, were coveted by ordinary people, gained popularity,
and were subsequently mass-produced. since those days, these products have
advanced to become safer, easier to use, and more environmentally friendly,                                                    ball screws

and as a result, people’s lives have become easier and more prosperous.
    amidst these developments, the numerical controlled (nc) machine tool ap-
peared; this is a machine that has advanced the rapid manufacture of complex
parts. and, at the heart of these nc machine tools are nsk’s ball screws.

    a computer controls the motion of nc machine tools, moving the cutting
tools or the object being cut—or both—in six directions to work in a complex
three-dimensional manufacturing process. with its smooth motion, the ball
screw assembled in the drive mechanism of these nc machine tools allows
their speed and stopping position to be accurately controlled. in this way, the
ball screw has increased precision in manufacturing, and contributed to the
mass production of automobiles, leading to advances in vehicle quality and
environmental friendliness.

the nsk group contributes in various industrial ﬁelds to shape a prosperous
future. the company is expanding from the arena of industrial manufacturing,
into medical and social services that are closer to people’s daily lives.
    during a ct scan used in full physical examinations, for instance, a
patient lying on the bed is moved smoothly, with high precision, and x-rayed
through 360-degree scanning in a tomographic examination.
    during such scans, it is nsk’s ball screw technology that meets the need
for smooth, quiet, vibration-free motion that is non-intrusive for the patient.

is growing expectation for controlling technologies that carefully move
specimens with the high-precision and smooth motion of ball screws and at
the same time quickly and accurately perform examinations.

meeting the challenge of bringing prosperity
reliability is the most highly valued characteristic for machines working in
the medical ﬁeld, where lives are at stake. to provide the vital machines that
people’s lives depend on, the nsk group is constantly focused on delivering
higher levels of product reliability.
    the nsk group is also striving to develop quiet and environmentally
friendly products in consideration of the need for such technology in the
medical ﬁeld.

   development of low-torque bearing transmissions for use in hybrid cars
   today, in many parts of the world, a range of technologies              for the future, beginning with low torque bearings,
   are being developed to improve automobile fuel efﬁciency.            we are doing our best to play a part in improving the fuel

   each subsequent year there are further demands to reduce
   bearing torque loss.
       in transmissions, lubricant oil is used to lubricate gears,
   bearings, and other parts, but it is known that bearing
   torque loss is greatly inﬂuenced by the amount of lubricant

                 many resources are used in the process of manufacturing products. the nsk group aims to
                 protect the global environment by further reducing its total consumption of resources through
                 the pursuit of more efﬁcient use in the production process.
