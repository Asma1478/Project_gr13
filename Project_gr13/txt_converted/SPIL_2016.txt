    strengthen management of drawings that are distributed to suppliers, spil establishes a rapid and prompt drawing distribution (for
    suppliers) management system. the process starts with he introduction of customer requirements, updated drawings, and prompt
    drawing information sharing. suppliers can use this e-platform to get the most updated drawing information at all times. this system
    saves on paper wastes and efficiently distributes drawings, and also reduces much unnecessary paper drawing delivery work. this                                        drawing content is     can use system

     expected to improve carbon reduction performance. the carbon emission per unit of product at the siliconware technology (suzhou)
     facility showed an increase in 2015. this was also caused by expansion of production line and heavy use of electricity during the
     process. however, the expanded production lines are not yet in use, which contributed to increase in carbon emissions per unit product.
