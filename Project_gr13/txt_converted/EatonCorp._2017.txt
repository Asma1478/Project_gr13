                  greenhouse gas generation

indexed to sales, our greenhouse gas (ghg) generation increased by 0.2% in 2016 compared to 2015. on
an absolute basis, we decreased our ghg generation by 51,000 metric tons (from 1,010,000 to 959,000), or 5.1% compared
to the prior year. since 2014, we have reduced the total amount of ghg generated by our operations from 1,020,000
metric tons to 959,000, which equals a 6.0% reduction. indexed to sales, we increased our
ghg emissions by 7.3% over the period.

indexed to sales, our water consumption decreased by 1.1% in 2016 compared to 2015. on an absolute basis, we
decreased our water consumption by 6.4% compared to the prior year. eaton does not consume large volumes of water,
therefore the majority of the decrease relates to reduction efforts of a few targeted plants. since 2014, we have reduced
water consumption from 5,751,000 to 4,834,000 cubic meters, which equals a 15.9% reduction. indexed to sales, we
reduced water usage by 4.0% over the period.

                                            supplier diversity

a diverse supplier base is important to the continued growth and success of our company and communities. in 2016,
we purchased more than $1.5 billion of goods and services from small and diverse suppliers. while our total u.s. spend
with all suppliers was down nearly 20 percent, our combined spending with minority, women and veteran-owned diverse
businesses increased slightly compared to the previous year (10.6 percent in 2015 versus 10.9 percent in 2016). our
spending with women-owned, veteran-owned and small business suppliers each increased by more than 20 percent.
despite the acquisition of one of our large, minority-owned suppliers last year, which resulted in a drop of 18.2 percent in
minority-owned business spend from the previous year, we maintain our commitment to partner with innovative diverse
companies that generate value, improve efficiencies and provide high-quality products and services.
