3. financial instruments
1. status of financial instruments
(1) policies on financial instruments
	the companies procure funds necessary for capital investment and raise short-term working capital mainly through bank loans
    and the issuance of bonds. the companies manage temporary surplus funds through financial assets that have a high level of
    safety. the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk and do not
    enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

(2) details of financial instruments and associated risks
	trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. in addition, receivables denominated in foreign currencies
    from overseas operations are exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. investment securities are primarily the stocks of
    business partners and customers and are exposed to market price fluctuation risk.
		 most trade notes and accounts payable are due for payment within one year. those denominated in foreign currencies are
    exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.the companies generally raise working capital required for business transactions
    through short-term borrowings and procure funds required for capital expenditure and investment through long-term debt and
    bonds.the companies use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations associated with
    receivables, payables and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies within the actual demand. refer to
    “significant hedge accounting methods” in note 2, “summary of significant accounting policies,” for a description of the
    company‘s accounting policies related to hedging activities.

(3) risk management framework for financial instruments
    1) credit risk management (counterparty risk)
		the company has established internal rules and procedures for receivables under which the business planning & administration
       division and finance and accounting department are primarily responsible for monitoring counterparty status. the departments
       manage amounts and settlement dates by counterparty and work to quickly identify and mitigate payment risk that may result
       from situations such as the deterioration of the financial condition of a counterparty. consolidated subsidiaries of the company




                                                                                             kansai paint co., ltd. corporate report 2017   39

           are subject to the same risk management rules. in using derivative transactions, the company mitigates counterparty risk by
           conducting transactions with financial institutions with high credit ratings.
       2)	market risk management (risk of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations)
     		for some receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the companies use forward foreign exchange contracts
           to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on a monthly and currency-by-currency basis.
     			 for securities and investment securities, the companies periodically examine the fair value of the instruments and the
           financial condition of the issuing entities. in addition, the companies regularly evaluate whether securities other than
           those classified as held-to-maturity should be maintained taking into account their fair values and relationship with the
           issuing entities.
     			 for derivative transactions, the finance & accounting department handles the transactions after receiving approval from
           those with final approval authority in accordance with the company‘s internal rules. administrative reports on the results are
           periodically provided to the management committee.
       3) management of liquidity risk associated with capital procurement (payment default risk)
     		in the companies, the financial & accounting department is responsible for maintaining adequate liquidity and manages
           liquidity risk by creating and updating a capital deployment plan based on reports from each division.

     (4) supplementary explanations about matters concerning fair value of financial instruments
     	the fair value of financial instruments is based on their market price and, in cases in which market price is not available, a
         reasonably calculated price. such prices are calculated using certain assumptions and may differ if the assumptions change.

(4) write-down of securities
	in the year ended march 31, 2017, a write-down of ¥2 million ($18 thousand) was recognized on available-for-sale securities,
    consisting of listed equity securities in the amount of ¥0 million ($0 thousand) and non-listed equity securities in the amount of ¥2
    million ($18 thousand) .
		 in the year ended march 31, 2016, write-down was not recognized on securities.
		 write-down is recognized if the fair value has fallen to less than 50% of the acquisition cost. if the fair value is less than the
    acquisition cost by an amount between 30% and 50% of the acquisition cost, write-down is recognized as deemed necessary
    considering the recoverability of the value. write-down of securities which do not have readily determinable fair value is basically
    recognized if the financial condition is deteriorating and the value is less than 50% of the acquisition cost unless the value is
    considered to be recoverable on an individual basis.

     9. net assets
     under japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock.
     however, a company may, by a resolution of the board of directors, designate an amount not exceeding one half of the price of the
     new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus.
         under the japanese corporate law, in cases in which a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to
     10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in capital and legal earnings
     reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in capital or legal earnings reserve. legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings
     in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
         legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital may be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit by a resolution of the
     shareholders‘ meeting. all additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and
     retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends.
         the maximum amount that the company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial
     statements of the company in accordance with japanese laws and regulations.
         at the annual shareholders‘ meeting held on june 29, 2017, the shareholders approved cash dividends of ¥11 ($0.10) per share
     amounting to ¥2,840 million ($25,314 thousand). this appropriation was not accounted for in the consolidated financial statements
     at march 31, 2017. such appropriations are recognized in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.

16. segment information
1. segment information
(1) general information for reportable segments
	the reportable segments of the kansai paint group are defined as components of the group for which separate financial
    information is available and reviewed regularly by the board of directors in determining how to allocate management resources
    and evaluate operating performance. the company and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates are primarily engaged in the
    manufacturing and sale of paints and coatings. the company is mainly in charge of business activities in japan while locally
    incorporated overseas subsidiaries are in charge in each region. locally incorporated overseas subsidiaries are independent
    business units that develop their own business activities and establish their own comprehensive strategies in each region.
    accordingly, the kansai paint group, being composed of regional segments based on manufacturing and selling systems, has the
    following five reportable segments: japan, india, asia, africa and europe.
		 starting from the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017, the kansai paint group has changed the method of reporting as reportable
    segment because quantitative importance of “europe” included in “other” increased.
		 the segment information for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2016 is disclosed based on the reporting segment classification
    for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2017.

(2) methods of measurement for sales, profit and loss, assets and essentially all other items for each reportable segment
	the accounting methods applied to reportable segments are the same as those described in note 2, “summary of significant
    accounting policies.” intersegment sales and transfers are based on prevailing market prices.

(3) information about sales, profit and loss, assets and other material items by reportable segment
    segment information for the fiscal years ended march 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:

       1) outline of the plan

          (hereinafter, the “target period”), and delivers, etc. company shares, etc. according to the relevant board director’s position,
          and achievement, etc. of business performance targets for each fiscal year at the time of the board director’s retirement.
          however, the target period of the trust that is set up in 2017 is two fiscal years from the fiscal year ending on march 31, 2018
          to the fiscal year ending on march 31, 2019 (hereinafter, the “initial target period”), which is the remaining period of the
          current medium-term management plan. if the trust is continued as per 3)b. below, the three fiscal years that correspond to the
          subsequent medium-term management plan shall be set as the target period.
     			 officers’ remuneration under the plan consists of a “fixed portion,” which grants a certain amount of points every fiscal
          year, and a “performance-based portion,” which grants points according to the achievement of business performance targets
          of every fiscal year during the period subject to the medium-term management plan. the “fixed portion” aims to further raise
          awareness of corporate management that emphasizes shareholders, while the “performance-based portion” aims to provide an
          incentive for board directors, etc. to be more aware of contributing to improving the company’s medium-to-long-term business
          results and increasing corporate value. the ratio of the “fixed portion” and the “performance-based portion” is half of the
          stock compensation base amount that is determined by position, respectively.

      2) persons subject to the plan (beneficiary requirements)
     		board directors, etc. may receive from the trust the delivery, etc. of company shares, etc. equivalent to the accumulated
         number of points (defined in 4) below) following the designated beneficiary confirmation procedures, on condition that the

         etc. retires due to his/her death; hereinafter the same shall apply).

     		 the beneficiary requirements are as follows:

     		 c. the person is a resident of japan

            was not dismissed due to a serious violation of office or internal regulations
     		 e. other requirements deemed necessary to achieve the objectives of a performance-based stock compensation plan

       3) the trust period
     		 a.	the trust period of the trust

     		 b. continuance of the trust
     			the trust may be continued at expiration of the trust period by changing the trust agreement or making additions to the
             trust. in such cases, the trust period will be extended for a further three years. for each extended trust period, the company
             makes an additional contribution up to the upper limit of the trust money that was approved at the meeting, and continues
             to grant points to board directors, etc. during the extended trust period. however, when making such additional
             contribution, if there are any remaining company shares (excluding company shares, etc. equivalent to the points granted
             to board directors, etc. that have not yet been delivered, etc.) and money (hereinafter, “remaining shares, etc.”) in the trust
             assets on the last day of the trust period before the extension, the sum of the value of the remaining shares, etc. and the
             additionally contributed trust money shall be up to upper limit of the trust money approved at the meeting. the trust period
             is not limited to being extended only once, but may be extended again subsequently.
     		 c. treatment of termination of the trust (extension of trust period that does not accompany additional contribution)
     			if the trust agreement is not changed or additions to the trust are not made at the time of expiry of the trust period, points
             will not be granted to board directors, etc. thereafter. however, when a board director, etc. who may satisfy the beneficiary
             requirements at the time is in office, the trust period of the trust may be extended up to 10 years until said board director,
             etc. retires and the delivery, etc. of company shares is completed.

  4) company shares, etc. delivered, etc. to board directors, etc.
		the company grants points that were computed based on the formula detailed below to board directors, etc. who are in office
     on the last day of each fiscal year (including board directors, etc. who retire on the same day due to the expiry of their term of
     office) during the trust period (the first year is the fiscal year ending march 31, 2018) at the designated time after the end of
     said fiscal year. the granted points are accumulated each year. company shares, etc. are delivered, etc. according to the
     accumulated number of points upon the retirement of the board directors, etc.
			 points that are granted to board directors, etc. are computed by aggregating the fixed portion that is equivalent to half of
     the stock compensation base amount by position that is predetermined according to the position of the board director, etc.
     (hereinafter referred to as the “fixed base amount”) and the remaining half, which is the performance-based portion
     (hereinafter referred to as the “performance-based base amount”), multiplying it by the performance-based coefficient and
     dividing it by the closing price of the company shares at the tokyo stock exchange on july 1 (or the following business day if
     this day is not a business day; july 3, 2017 for the initial target period) of the first year of the target period of the trust
     (hereinafter referred to as the “underlying share price”).
			 one point is equivalent to one company share, with fractions of less than one point rounded down. however, when a stock
     split or reverse stock split of company shares is carried out during the trust period, the number of company shares per point
     will be adjusted according to the split ratio and reverse split ratio, etc. of company shares.

		 (formula for computing points of the fixed portion)
		 fixed base amount / underlying share price (fractions after the decimal point are rounded down.)
		 (formula for computing points of the performance-based portion)
		performance-based base amount / underlying share price × performance-based coefficient* (fractions after the decimal point
   are rounded down.)
		    *the performance-based coefficient changes within a range from 0 to 150% based on the degree of achievement of targets such as ebitda, etc. in each fiscal year.


  5) method and timing of delivery, etc. of company shares, etc. to board directors, etc.
		board directors, etc. who meet beneficiary requirements are delivered company shares (shares less than a unit are rounded
     down) equivalent to a certain percentage of the accumulated number of points that are computed based on 4) above at the
     time of retirement of the relevant board director. company shares equivalent to the remaining accumulated number of points
     will be converted into cash within the trust. money equivalent to the amount of the conversion into cash will be provided to
     the relevant board director.
			 if a board director, etc. who meets the beneficiary requirements is deceased during the trust period, company shares
     equivalent to the accumulated number of points computed at that time will be converted into cash within the trust. money
     equivalent to the amount of the conversion into cash will be provided to the heir of the relevant board director by the trust. if it
     has been decided during the trust period that a board director, etc. who meets the beneficiary requirements will become a
     non-resident of japan, company shares equivalent to the accumulated number of points computed at that time will be
     converted into cash within the trust, and the money equivalent to the amount of conversion into cash will be promptly
     provided to the relevant board director by the trust.

  6)	the maximum trust money contributed to the trust and the maximum total number of points granted to board directors, etc. in
      the trust
		the total amount of trust money contributed to the trust during the trust period and the total number of points granted to
      board directors, etc. in the trust are subject to the following upper limits.
		 a.	upper limit of trust money contributed to the trust: ¥190 million (for two years)*
			 (however, when continuing the trust as per 3)b. above, the upper limit shall be ¥270 million [for three years].*)
			       * the sum of share acquisition funds and trust fees and expenses for the trust.
		 b. upper limit of the total number of points granted to board directors, etc. during the trust period of the trust:
			the maximum total number of points per year that board directors, etc. may be granted is 40,000. the number of shares
      that board directors, etc. can be delivered, etc. by the trust is subject to the upper limit of the number of shares equivalent
      to such points. therefore, the maximum number of shares that the trust acquires during the initial target period to be
      delivered, etc. to board directors, etc. (hereinafter, “number of acquired shares”) is the number of shares equivalent to such
      maximum number of points granted per year multiplied by two, the number of years of the trust period (80,000 shares). if
      the trust is continued as per 3)b. above, the maximum number of acquired shares during the target period is the number of
      shares equivalent to said maximum number of points granted per year multiplied by three, the number of years of the trust
      period (120,000 shares).




                                                                                                                    kansai paint co., ltd. corporate report 2017          63

      7) method of acquiring company shares by the trust
     		the initial acquisition of company shares by the trust is planned to be made from the stock market up to the maximum
         amount of trust money and the maximum number of acquired shares stated in 6) above.

      8) exercise of voting rights on company shares in the trust
     		to secure neutrality in business management, voting rights on the company shares in the trust (company shares before
         delivery, etc. to board directors, etc.) will not be exercised during the trust period.

      9) treatment of dividends on company shares in the trust
     		dividends on company shares in the trust will be accepted by the trust and applied to trust fees and trust expenses of the
         trust.

      10) treatment of remaining shares and remaining dividends upon expiration of the trust period
     		any remaining shares at the expiration of the trust period due to the non-achievement of performance targets during the
          target period or others shall be subject to delivery, etc. to board directors, etc. if the company continues using the trust as the
          plan or a similar incentive plan. if the trust will be terminated due to expiration of the trust period, the trust shall surrender the
          remaining shares free of charge as shareholder return to the company, which plans to eliminate them by resolution of the
          board of directors.
     			 furthermore, while any remaining dividends on company shares in the trust at the expiration of the trust period will be used
          as share acquisition funds if the trust continues to be used, if the trust will be terminated due to expiration of the trust period,
          the portion exceeding the trust expense reserves, which is trust money minus share acquisition funds, is planned to be donated
          to organizations with no conflicts of interest with the company or its board directors, etc.
