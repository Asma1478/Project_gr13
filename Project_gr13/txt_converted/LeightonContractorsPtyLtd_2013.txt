reaches new goals
leighton contractors was the major sponsor of the 2012
kari’s tour de freedom 1000. the wa charity started by
the late kari rummukainen, founder of our construction
subsidiary broad, is dedicated to helping families and
teenagers struggling with substance abuse.

the 2012 bike ride saw 40 cyclists tackle the tough course
between esperance and perth. cyclists endured a gruelling
1,000 kilometres over six days.

ten leighton contractors employees participated in the cycling
event, which raised a staggering $420,000 for community drug
and alcohol rehabilitation program, teen challenge. the funds
raised will enable the fit out of a new training facility in perth,
allowing teen challenge to continue to provide services at a
minimal cost to participants.
