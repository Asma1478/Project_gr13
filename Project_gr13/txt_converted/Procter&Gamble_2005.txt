we have also established safe drinking water for children as p&g’s
corporate signature program of our live, learn and thrive efforts.
with the u.s. centers for disease control, we have developed
technology that can purify even heavily contaminated drinking water
with a single sachet that costs pennies and treats 10 liters of water.
this is critical because 5,000 children die every day from diseases
caused by unsafe drinking water.

p&g’s main challenges regarding pur are providing it where it’s

p&g teams with partners such as population services international
(psi), which markets health care products in developing countries
around the world on a nonproﬁt basis. these partnerships help
p&g make connections in communities, distribute pur at no cost in
emergencies, and sell pur at cost for everyday use. together, p&g,
psi, and other partners develop and execute plans to reach people
who desperately need pur. plans include carefully thought-out
steps: building awareness and acceptance for the product, then
building support with communities and retailers.

it is difﬁcult to comprehend the enormity of this urgent task. p&g
is attacking it with all the tools in its arsenal – not just the pur
product but also our expertise in distribution, marketing, and

uganda
with our partner psi, p&g coordinated pur distribution in uganda
and also worked with local health and social service groups to gain
their help in teaching people to use pur.

a concern among the people is whether pur will continue to be
available. they need assurance they’ll be able to get the product
over time before they adopt it into their daily lives. to assure
availability, psi has been building relationships with retailers and

to karachi to be crammed with nearly 5 million packets for sri
lanka. the organization worldvision took the job of getting the
pur through customs and distributing it to various aid groups to
bring to the survivors.

various groups worked with p&g to distribute instructions on how
to use pur. the organization samaritan’s purse translated the
instructions into both tamil and sinhala.

at the start of the tsunami disaster, it seemed inevitable that a
second wave of deaths would occur from the lack of safe drinking
water. but the world health organization is reporting that, due
to the enormous relief efforts, a major disease outbreak has been
avoided. p&g people who worked on getting pur to tsunami
survivors feel fantastic about that, knowing that our work has
played an important role in this humanitarian effort.




collaborative efforts succeed
following the december 2004 tsunami, p&g worked with
americares, population services international, unicef,
worldvision, care, aquaya, and the international federation of
red cross and red crescent societies to get enough pur to hard-
hit areas to make 150 million liters of water drinkable. this effort
is credited with saving many lives by preventing post-disaster
illness from contaminated water.

in total, p&g and individual p&g employees contributed more
than $3 million in product and cash donations to the tsunami
relief effort. many employee contributions memorialized p&g
thailand country manager orapim milindasuta, who lost her life
in the tsunami.

international water decade
world water day, in march 2005, kicked off the u.n.’s international
water decade (2005-2015). the goal of international water
decade is “a greater focus on water-related issues, with emphasis
on women as managers of water, to help to achieve internationally
agreed water-related goals.” this includes halving by 2015 the
proportion of people unable to reach or afford safe drinking water
and basic sanitation.

            p&g recognized world water day by announcing a grant
   on the
    web     from the uk government to expand our safe drinking
            water work in haiti. see www.pghsi.com for details.

       p&g’s unique organizational structure of global business units               linking opportunity with responsibility in la moran
       (gbus) and market development organizations (mdos) drives                    a key challenge when linking business opportunity with
       clear focus, accountability and go-to-market capability. this                corporate responsibility is whether we can create new business

       understand the business and better serve consumers and

       party partners provide these services.

       corporate functions covers two main focus areas: 1) upstream
       research and development, working with new, cutting-edge
       knowledge, and 2) corporate needs not covered by gbus or
       mdos, such as corporate human resources and corporate
       external relations, as well as the sales effort called customer
       business development.

       both the corporate functions and global business services
       organizations leverage our size to deliver better-quality services
       internally, at significantly lower cost.

       in july 2005 we changed the names of the gbus. beauty care
       became p&g beauty. health, baby & family care changed
       to p&g family health. household care was renamed p&g
       household care. these changes have no impact on the
       composition or historical results of the gbus.

major acquisitions
net cash used for acquisitions in the current year totaled
$572 million. this includes acquisitions of a pharmaceuticals
business in spain and fabric care businesses in europe.

p&g and gillette
on january 27, 2005, p&g entered into an agreement to acquire
the gillette company. the acquisition, which has been approved
by the boards of directors and the shareholders of both companies,
is subject to approval by all global regulatory authorities and is
expected to close in fall 2005.

the acquisition of gillette will add five billion-dollar brands to p&g’s
stable of 17 billion-dollar brands. gillette had $10.5 billion in sales
in fiscal 2004. it has more than 70 percent global market share
of razors and blades, 40 percent global market share in alkaline
batteries, and 36 percent share of the global toothbrush market.

the gillette acquisition will accelerate p&g’s goal to increase its
presence in the beauty and health care markets. gillette will help
p&g achieve better balance – in brands, geographic presence, and
retail customers. balance helps the company reach its goals despite
external pressures. p&g and gillette have similar corporate cultures,
and operating as one company is projected to bring more than
$1 billion in cost synergies.



major divestitures
proceeds from asset sales, $517 million, increased primarily due to
the divestiture of the juice business in august of 2004.




restructuring program
in 1999, concurrent with a reorganization of our operations
into product-based gbus, we initiated a multi-year organization
2005 restructuring program. total restructuring program
charges were $538 million after tax in 2003. the program
was substantially complete at the end of june 2003, with a
remaining reserve of $335 million. substantially all of the liability
was settled through cash payments through june 30, 2004.

the company continues to undertake projects to maintain
a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing
consolidations and work force rationalization, as part of its
normal operations. we expect to recognize between $150
million and $200 million after tax per year in charges for
these types of projects. spending in both 2005 and 2004 was
consistent and within the range described above.

business and community partnerships
improving lives in the countries and communities in which we
operate is a long-standing p&g value. we are committed to making
a difference in all our communities – from india to kenya, from
canada to brazil, from france to australia. around the world, p&g
and its employees strive to improve lives every day. this has led to a
focus on building effective business and community partnerships in
areas where we can make a meaningful difference:
education, volunteerism to improve the quality of life in our
communities, and economic development.

education is a means of improving quality of life and a pathway
to fulfill personal aspirations. p&g supports educational programs,
from preschool through college, through financial contributions
and mentoring/tutoring programs. the volunteer leadership of p&g
employees, who can be counted on to help with virtually every
significant community project, greatly enhances the effectiveness
of our contributions. through volunteerism, p&g provides ongoing
support, sponsorship, and leadership for many civic, cultural, and
nonprofit organizations across all geographies in which we operate.
this year alone, p&g and the p&g fund contributed more than
$100 million to support our communities.

child labor and worker exploitation policy
p&g does not use child or forced labor in any of our global
operations or facilities, and we expect suppliers and contractors
with whom we do business to uphold the same standards.
more speciﬁcally, we will not conduct business with suppliers
employing child, prison, indentured, or bonded labor, or using
corporal punishment or other forms of mental or physical
coercion as a form of discipline.

in the absence of any national or local law, we will deﬁne “child”
as less than 15 years of age. if local minimum-age law is set
below 15 years of age but is in accordance with developing
country exceptions under international labor organization (ilo)
convention 138, the lower age will apply.

iams brings pet food studies into homes
with assistance from its international animal care advisory
board, iams is changing the way pet food feeding studies are
being done. more and more dogs and cats participating in
feeding studies have been “working from home.” this past year,
more than 90 percent of dogs and cats in feeding studies lived
with their families.

after october, 2006, most dogs and cats in feeding studies will
be pets living in their homes, with others living at the iams pet
health & nutrition center. iams will no longer have any dogs or
cats in university or contract facilities.

the new iams pet health & nutrition center opened in december
2004. dogs have roommates and share large windows. they
have full-time access to the outdoors, where they have play
yards with toys and places to climb and hide. there are no cages.
when the dogs and cats complete their work at the center, the
socialization and play skills developed there make them good
candidates for adoption.                                              iams helps orphan pets find homes

company to report data on a wide range of operational categories.

our actions are not just profit-driven but also progress-driven, to ensure a better quality of life for
everyone, now and for generations to come. our extensive consumer research related to our brands also
helps us identify ways we can best address sustainability.

as the diagram illustrates, p&g’s use of material resources is highly efﬁcient. the vast majority of
materials are converted to products, and the output of the manufacturing waste (which is largely
non-hazardous) is low.

unique recycling effort produces fuel
at several of p&g’s cincinnati technical centers, clean harbors
environmental services collects flammable solvents from the labs
and bulks them into 55-gallon drums. these solvents contain a wide
variety of hazardous wastes such as acetone, toluene, and methanol.
the drums of solvent are blended with other flammable liquids and
oils to achieve the right btu value for fuel. cement kilns use this
“waste derived fuel” to replace coal, oil, and other fossil fuels.

this practice provides an alternative to incineration for p&g’s
organic waste streams that contain more than 5,000 btus. since
the beginning of 2004, the health care research center alone has
sent more than 7,000 gallons of flammable solvents and oil for fuels
blending, for a total cost savings of more than $27,000 versus the
cost of incineration.

environmental liabilities
p&g is subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to
matters such as governmental regulations, income taxes, and
other actions arising out of the normal course of business. we
are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws
and regulations that in the future may require us to take action
to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing
and waste disposal practices. accrued environmental liabilities
were not material.

while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of
management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the
various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our ﬁnancial
condition, cash ﬂows, or results of operations.

business continuity drills practice coordination
of emergency services
p&g sites around the world regularly conduct business
continuity planning and crisis drills, involving key local
emergency agencies. in the united states, drills sometimes
involve local, county, state, and federal agencies, depending on
site location and testing requirements.

business continuity planning drills help p&g learn how best to
protect its people and assets and how to recover critical business
operations if a disaster occurs. most sites are required to conduct a
drill of varying scope once a year.

these photos show a business continuity planning drill at p&g’s
world headquarters in cincinnati in may 2005. the drill involved five
engine companies from the cincinnati fire department, cincinnati
and hamilton county bomb squad and canine units, the cincinnati
police, and the american red cross. these local agencies were very
pleased with p&g’s preparedness and will conduct joint exercises
with p&g in the future.

european safety achievement demonstrates
p&g’s high standards
p&g safety standards worldwide are at the highest level, as
illustrated by the company’s experience in europe.

in the european union, all of p&g’s big household care sites are
registered under the control of major industrial accident hazards
(seveso ii) directive, one of the most demanding pieces of legislation
in the field of industrial safety today. the sites obtained registration
because their corporate safety management systems meet key
requirements of the directive. p&g’s safety management system
is implemented uniformly, with the same level of rigor, at all p&g
production sites in every region of the world.




lima plant sets safety record
the fabric & household care plant in lima, ohio, has reached
a safety milestone – 4 million work hours without a lost-time
injury. this means that none of the more than 400 employees
at lima have lost any work time because of injury for more than
four-and-a-half years.

only a few p&g plants have celebrated 4 million safe hours, and this
is the first time for lima, which opened more than 30 years ago.

more than 40 p&g sites have more than a million safe hours.
more than 20 have between 1 and 2 million. fifteen have
between 2 and 4 million, and three are at greater than 4 million.
the best p&g safety record is thailand’s bangkok plant, with
more than 7 million safe hours.

water: cool-water washing makes new energy savings possible
there’s an energy-saving laundry revolution going on. with tide
coldwater in the united states and canada and ariel actif à froid
(ariel cold active) in france, both launched in early 2005, plus
ariel coolclean, launched mid-2004 in the uk – p&g is making
it possible for consumers to turn down the temperature dial of
their washing machines, as they no longer need hot water to get
the laundry clean.

lowering wash temperatures can save signiﬁcant amounts of energy
and cost. estimates are that a north american household can save
up to 20 percent of the energy it uses to heat water. a french
household can reduce its electricity usage by up to 3 percent.

washing machines are one of a home’s highest energy users,
taking most of the energy to heat water. in north america, the
proportion of energy used to heat wash water may be as high as
95 percent of the total energy used by the washing machine.

the numbers show that washing in cold water makes a lot of
sense for both consumers and the environment. so why do many
households in europe and north america still use hot water to
wash? the key reason is that lower temperatures have not given
them the cleaning performance they want.

with the introduction of tide coldwater and ariel actif à froid,
all that has changed. these detergents are speciﬁcally designed
for improved cold-water washing performance. the scientiﬁc
explanation is that they use smarter chemical energy to clean,
thus requiring less help from heat. all consumers need to know
is that they can save energy and money and still achieve excellent
cleaning performance.
                                                                          what if an average household

hiv/aids continued


pur and hiv/aids
in haiti and kenya, we are seeing that safe drinking water is
helping people live better with hiv/aids. cnn’s global health
watch featured jemima odo, telling how she used pur to help
regain her strength after contracting hiv and how selling pur
helps her support her grandchildren and also community orphans
whose parents have died from aids. see more on jemima odo’s
story on page 4.

it’s clear that the global response to hiv/aids needs to include
provision of safe drinking water. people who have hiv/aids are
more susceptible to water-borne diseases, including parasites,
viruses, and pathogenic bacteria. p&g’s pur puriﬁer of water
effectively removes all of these from contaminated water and
has become one of the most critical health tools for people with
hiv/aids.

consumer organizations exist in many countries. these organizations
contact companies to compare products and voice comments they
receive from their members. p&g continuously provides consumer
organizations with information on new initiatives and cooperates
with them in answering consumer questions.



scientific community
p&g works a great deal with external scientists in various
disciplines (e.g. human and/or environmental toxicology, new
technologies, etc.). this happens during many phases of a
product’s life: at the initial development of new technologies,
during the early marketing phases, and on an “as needed” basis
while the products are on the market.

as a technology-based company, p&g has long established
relationships with many leading scientists at various universities all
over the world. p&g often asks for their advice in panels which
take place before a product is placed on the market. on key
developments, the company organizes scientific advisory groups
(sags) consisting of leading external scientists. they review the data
p&g scientists have collected so they can assess aspects such as
safety. then they recommend additional work or modifications to
the program to ensure the company has adequately addressed all
safety issues.
