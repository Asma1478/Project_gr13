we rely on skilled staff and
invest in training programs
to promote their professional
development and we offer
internships and scholarships
to university students.
education assistance
in 2015, five employees benefited from our
educational assistance program, which
aims to help turkmen and uae nationals
to continue their studies abroad. this
year it included study at universities in
russia, ukraine, the uk, switzerland and
the uae in subjects such as production,
project management, safety, logistics
and marine studies. under this program
we provide the tuition fees for specific
educational studies, which helps motivate
the employees towards self-development,
career planning and promotion to
higher responsibilities.

competencies
we engaged the international human
resources development corporation
(ihrdc), which specializes in training
and competency development for
the oil and gas industry, to introduce
a global standardized competency
management system, focused on our
employees’ development and to help
in our succession planning.

our hr department has completed a
number of phases of the project since
3q 2015, including software deployment
and training; job description reviews
for head office and expat employees in
turkmenistan; job competency modeling
based on up to 15 technical competences
per position aligned to dragon oil’s
business strategy.

work-life balance
there’s more to life than work, and
dragon oil is keen to ensure that our
employees enjoy a good work-life balance.

and as part of this, we organized a
family fun day in dubai in march 2015
that was attended by almost all dubai-
based employees who also brought
along their families. as well as offering
children a good time on bull rides,
climbing walls and soft play, their
parents could take part in a day of
fun-filled team building through events
such as tug of war and racing a boat
that they had just built.
