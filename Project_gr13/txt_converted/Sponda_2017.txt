financial targets
the long-term goal is to maintain the company’s equity ratio
at above 40 per cent. the equity ratio was 47 per cent at
the end of 2016 (2015: 46%). sponda distributes a dividend
amounting to approximately 50 per cent of the operational
cash earnings per share for the financial period, taking into
account, however, the company’s financial position and
development needs.

our work consisted of, amongst others, the following
procedures:

• interviewing a representative of senior management
  of the company.
• visiting the company’s head office.
• interviewing employees responsible for collecting
  and reporting the selected information on energy
  and ghg emissions.
• assessing how group employees apply the reporting
  instructions and procedures of the company.
• testing the accuracy and completeness of the
  information from original documents and systems
  on a sample basis.
• testing the consolidation of information and performing
  recalculations on a sample basis.



limited assurance conclusion

based on the procedures we have performed and the evi-
dence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that sponda plc’s selected informa-
tion on energy and ghg emissions for the reporting period
ended 31 december 2016 is not properly prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria.
    when reading our assurance report, the inherent limi-
tations to the accuracy and completeness of sustainability
information should be taken into consideration.
    our assurance report has been prepared in accordance
with the terms of our engagement. we do not accept, or
assume responsibility to anyone else, except to sponda plc
for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we
have reached.
