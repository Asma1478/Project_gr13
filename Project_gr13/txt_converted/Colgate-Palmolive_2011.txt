                                       company works closely with worldwide regulatory agencies to examine how non-animal
                                       tests can be incorporated into their safety requirements for consumer products.
                                       n recently, people for the ethical treatment of animals (peta) created a “working for

                                       palmolive is the first company to meet peta’s stringent requirements and heads this list.

                                       necessary safety studies can be performed without the use of animals and will continue
                                       to work to make that day come sooner.

                                       assessing alternative energy sources
                                       on-site cogeneration units provide heat and power at three colgate facilities located in
                                       italy, mexico and the united states. cogeneration technologies recover and reuse waste
                                       heat, saving on the fuel used to produce heat or steam. this means colgate facilities with
                                       cogeneration need less fuel to produce the same amount of useful energy. cogeneration
                                       facilities can be 15 to 40 percent more efficient than traditional facilities, leading to fewer
                                       greenhouse gas emissions.
                                           along with a focus on increasing energy efficiency and cogeneration, colgate is as-

                                       scheme. colgate facilities emitted less than the number of allowances allocated in 2008,
                                       2009 and 2010.

                                       efficiency of its manufacturing processes. colgate started collecting and analyzing
                                       water use and wastewater loading data in 1998 with a primary focus on
                                       manufacturing operations. from 2002 to 2010, colgate facilities around the world
                                       focused on decreasing water use and wastewater loading.

                                       colgate works with thousands of suppliers worldwide that provide the
                                       goods and services required to produce and market colgate-palmolive
                                       products. the company looks at price, quality, service, and availability,
                                       as well as other factors in its procurement decisions. as a company that
                                       holds itself to high standards, colgate is committed to extending this
                                       responsibility across its value chain to its suppliers. operating in a more
                                       sustainable manner will only be achieved in partnership with colgate’s
                                       business partners.

                                       colgate-palmolive’s supplier code of conduct
                                       over time, colgate has built its reputation as an organization that has utilized ethical
                                       business practices and high levels of integrity as a vital business asset. the strength of
                                       colgate’s reputation is based not only on its own conduct, but also on the behavior of its
                                       business partners. for that reason, colgate aspires to work only with those suppliers that
                                       share its values. colgate’s board of directors, senior management and all colgate people
                                       are committed to the highest standards of integrity and full compliance with the com-
                                       pany’s code of conduct, as well as the regulations and policies affecting the business. as
                                       such, it is colgate’s goal to ensure that its relationships with supplier partners reflect and
                                       support the same high ethical standards.
                                          colgate’s global procurement professionals work directly with suppliers, negotiating

                                       program of suppliers’ facilities. this involves a complete audit process and set of tools
                                       for assessing and working with suppliers to ensure compliance with colgate standards
                                       for quality and for service and supply excellence. the program is used for both exist-
                                       ing suppliers and for qualification of new suppliers. colgate’s supplier selection process
                                       includes, when appropriate, an audit of suppliers’ production facilities to ensure that
                                       the supplier can meet standards for quality and good manufacturing practices, and can
                                       meet required material specifications on a consistent basis. the questionnaires utilized for

                                       colgate’s supplier diversity team in the u.s. encourages increased and expanded
                                       business relationships with minority-owned and women-owned businesses, building
                                       strong diverse suppliers and developing mutually beneficial supply relationships, while
                                       strengthening the communities in which colgate consumers live and work. colgate has
                                       made a substantial and ongoing commitment to supplier diversity, both with direct
                                       suppliers and with their suppliers, and has increased spending with diverse suppliers
                                       each year for more than ten years.

                              commitment to responsible sourcing
                              consumers, shareholders and other stakeholders are increasingly interested in colgate’s point of
                              view on responsible procurement of several materials:

                              palm oil
                              palm oil is the most widely traded vegetable oil in the world, and is used in many food and
                              household products. over 85 percent of the world’s palm oil comes from indonesia and malay-
                              sia, where land is sometimes converted from forest to palm plantations, resulting in greenhouse
                              gas emissions, lower levels of biodiversity and social concerns.
                                 colgate has long been committed to identifying sources of certified sustainable palm oil and
                              derivatives or to replacing palm oil derivatives with alternative ingredients in colgate products.
                              while palm oil and palm oil derivatives are important ingredients for colgate, less than approxi-

                              who have direct contact with the producers.
                                 in 2009, colgate committed to purchasing palm oil and palm kernel oil from rspo members
                              only and advised each of its suppliers of that commitment. during these discussions we also
                              confirmed that none of the palm oil or its derivatives should be sourced from the borneo region.
                                 initially the company established a target date of 2011 for sourcing 100 percent certified
                              sustainable palm oil and palm kernel oil. however, as a result of a lack of availability within the
                              marketplace, in 2011 colgate revised the target date to 2015.
                                 it is important to note that colgate’s need is for palm kernel oil, a palm oil derivative, rather
                              than crude palm oil. although the production of sustainable crude palm oil increased somewhat
                              between 2009 and 2011, the production of palm kernel oil has not. as of september 2011, it
                              was reported that there were only 0.4 million metric tons of certified sustainable palm kernel oil
                              in production (representing just 7 percent of total production). colgate’s recent effort to convert
                              to certified sustainable palm kernel oil in one of its european markets, although successful, dem-
                              onstrates how challenging it is to identify a consistent supply stream. only one supplier globally
                              had the capacity to satisfy the request.
                                 a challenge remains as to how to verify supplier compliance. as colgate does not have
                              direct contact with the growers we must rely on the rspo who conducts audits and on the
                              legal documents provided by the three brokers from whom we purchase palm oil and palm oil
                              derivatives.

                                       engaging suppliers
                                       colgate recognizes that its emissions and water use are not only limited to its own opera-
                                       tions, but are also embedded in the supplies required to make and market colgate-palmo-
                                       live products.

           70%                         operations, colgate has participated in the carbon disclosure project’s supply chain lead-

                                       sent a letter encouraging the suppliers to set energy reduction targets, participate in the
                                       u.s. epa energy star program and to make their disclosure publicly available.

                                       water use
                                       colgate’s focus on water use extends beyond operations and product use to its suppliers.
                                       as water availability and quality decline in some areas, the company continues to assess
                                       and minimize associated risks to the business.
                                          colgate is consistently working to understand future risks and opportunities to its sup-
                                       pliers, its facilities and its consumers; colgate believes it will be well prepared to address
                                       the issues if regional water availability and quality change due to climate change or other
                                       factors.
                                          in 2010, colgate performed a geographical water risk assessment of eighteen key sup-
                                       pliers in asia, europe, latin america and north america using the world business council
                                       for sustainable development’s global water tool. some suppliers are in regions with ex-
                                       treme water scarcity, while other suppliers are located in regions with water abundance.
                                       colgate plans to use the assessment results and other tools to engage key stakeholders to
                                       better understand any potential water risks.

                                       another important element of colgate’s sustainability strategy is the way it
                                       makes use of external partnerships to complement the company’s strong
                                       internal capability. colgate has many such partnerships with a broad array
                                       of suppliers, research institutions, universities and other industry sources.
                                       notably, the company has developed key partnerships with innovative
                                       ingredient suppliers and leaders in scientific research including the forsyth
                                       institute and dupont.
