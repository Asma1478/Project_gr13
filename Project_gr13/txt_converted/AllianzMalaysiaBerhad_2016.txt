  diverse board facilitates optimal decision making by harnessing different insights, perspectives, experience and exposure.

	the board’s commitment to diversity permeates throughout all levels of the organisation including the appointment of candidate to the board.

     whilst the board supports the universal move to appoint more women directors to the board, the board is guided by the principal that appointment
     of new board member shall not be based solely on gender but rather the candidate’s skill set, competencies, experience and knowledge in areas
     identified by the board.

	the nominating committee will ensure that women candidates be included in the evaluation process for appointment of new directors to the board.

     independent non-executive directors




                                                                                                                                                           allianz malaysia berhad (12428-w)
	an independent non-executive director is a director who is independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which
  could interfere with the exercise of independent judgment or the ability to act in the best interests of the company.

	the primary responsibility of independent non-executive directors is to protect the interest of minority shareholders and other stakeholders.
  the effective participation of independent non-executive directors serves to promote greater accountability and balance in the board’s decision-
  making process.

     the responsibilities of an independent non-executive directors, among others, include the following:-

     (a)   to enhance the independence and objectivity of the board’s deliberations from the executive arm of the company;
     (b)   to mitigate any possible conflict of interests between the policy-making process and the day-to-day management of the company;
     (c)   to constructively challenge and contribute to the development of strategies for the company;
     (d)   to ensure that the board uses adequate systems and controls to safeguard the interests of the company;
     (e)   to provide the ‘check and balance’ function to the board; and
     (f)   to monitor and provide an objective view on the performance of executive directors and management in meeting the agreed goals and objectives.

	independent non-executive directors made up more than half of the board members. all of them complied with the requirements of independent
  director as prescribed by bnm and bursa securities. by virtue of their roles and responsibilities as prescribed by bnm and bursa securities, they are
  in effect, representing the interest of the minority shareholders of the company. the independent non-executive directors play a significant role
  in bringing impartiality and scrutiny to board deliberations and decision-making, so that no single party can dominate such decision-making in the
  company.

	the board is chaired by an independent non-executive director who does not represent the interest of the controlling shareholder. the chairman
  and the independent non-executive directors do not engage in the day-to-day management of the company or participate in any business
  dealings with the group, do not have any equity interest in the company or its related corporation and do not have any relationship with the
  substantial shareholders that could materially interfere their exercise of independent judgment.

	the independent non-executive directors engage proactively with the management, the risk management, compliance and human resource
  functions and with both the external and internal auditors via their respective roles as the chairman or members of the board committees, to
  ensure that concerns and issues relevant to the management and oversight of the business and operations of the group are properly addressed.

	the board, through the nominating committee, evaluated the independence of the independent non-executive directors using the assessment
  criteria as approved by the board taking into account, among others, the independent non-executive directors’ contribution, ability to display
  independent judgment in the boardroom, family relationship, contractual relationship, shareholding in the group and financial links with other
  directors or shareholders of the group.

	assessment of independence of the independent non-executive directors will be conducted annually, upon admission of independent non-
  executive director and more frequently when a change in position or relationship warrants it or when any new interest or relationship develops.

                                         tenure of independent non-executive directors

                                    	in line with the recommendation of the code, the maximum tenure of services for independent non-executive directors in the group has been
                                      revised from 12 years to 9 years.

                                    	an independent non-executive director who has served the board for a consecutive service of more than 9 years may continue to serve on the board
                                      but in the capacity of a non-independent non-executive director. the shareholders could, in exceptional cases and subject to the assessment of
                                      the nominating committee, decide that an independent non-executive director can remain as an independent director after serving a cumulative
                                      term of 9 years. in such a situation, the board must make a recommendation and provide strong justification to the shareholders in the annual
                                      general meeting. the company should seek shareholders’ approval at the nearest annual general meeting before the independent non-executive
                                      director serves for a cumulative term of 9 years. shareholders’ approval should be sought annually if the company wishes to retain the independent
                                      non-executive director who has served for more than 9 years.

                                    	as at the date of this statement, save for mr. foo san kan, none of the independent non-executive directors of the company has served for a
                                      cumulative term of 9 years. the tenure of the independent non-executive directors as at 25 may 2016 are as follows:-

                                    	the board accepted the recommendation of the nominating committee and recommended for shareholders’ approval at the 42nd annual

                                          risk management framework

                                     	the board recognises the importance of internal controls and risk management in sustaining its business activities and strives to make it an
                                       essential component of the group’s business culture. the group is committed to manage risks in line with the defined risk strategy and risk
                                       appetite through a systematic framework which identifies, analyses, assesses and manages risks that potentially have a material impact on the
                                          value of the group or potentially hinder the group in achieving its stated business objectives and goals in a consistent manner across the group.

                                          risk governance structure

                                          as one key element of the risk management framework, the risk governance approach is designed to ensure that the risk profile remains consistent
                                          with the risk strategy and the capacity to bear risks.

                                          the risk governance structure is defined top-down with the highest oversight function being performed by the board, specifically the risk
                                          management committee. the board assumes ultimate responsibility over the effectiveness of the group’s risk management and internal control
                                          systems by establishing and supervising the operation of the risk management framework. the risk management framework including all group
                                          policies is subject to the approval of the board.

                                     	the risk management committee oversees the senior management’s activities in managing the key risk areas of the group and to ensure that
                                       the risk management process is in place and functioning effectively. the risk management committee drives the risk management framework
                                       of the group and report to the board on its recommendations and/or decisions. through structured reporting from risk management working
                                       committee (“rmwc”), the risk management committee consolidates the status of the risks and presents them to the board for consideration.

                                     	the rmwc is established at the management level and serves as a platform for two way communications between the management and the board
                                       on matters of the organisation’s risk strategy and management.

                                          an independent risk management function (“rmf”) headed by the chief risk officer implements the approved risk management framework
                                          within the group and to ensure adherence to the requirements stipulated by the various regulatory bodies.

                                     	the internal audit function complements the rmf in the implementation of the group’s risk management by performing independent assessment
                                       to ensure that the policies are adhered to and their relevant procedures and processes are effectively practised and continually updated to reflect
                                       the change in environment and technology according to approved standard operating process.

                                     	the legal and compliance functions identify and assess any legal, compliance and fraud risk that the group may be exposed to. they also roll out
                                       and/or cascade any compliance related initiatives/requirements from the regulators.

                                     	at the operating level, the heads of divisions/departments/operating units are responsible for the validity and accuracy of the risks and mitigation
                                       actions for which they are appointed as risk owners. the risk owners shall be responsible for the implementation of risk management activities
                                       including risk mitigation plan within their respective unit/department/division or project.

    •    all material risks.
    •    allowing for breakdown of risk appetite.
    •    taking into account requirements imposed by regulators as well as the protection of both policyholder obligations and shareholder net asset value.

    the risk strategy will also define the core elements of the group’s risk appetite namely target rating of top risks, capital adequacy, earning volatility,
    liquidity, as well as operational, strategic and reputational exposures that might cause significant loss to the group.

	the risk strategy and risk appetite is reviewed and approved by the board on an annual basis.

    risk management process

    risk management is considered and managed as part of the daily process of managing and directing the business. the risk management process is
    integrated with core management processes of the business so that it can make value-added contributions to establishing sustainable competitive
    advantage and improving business performance. these include the implementation of a limit system and various frameworks, manual and policies.

    besides the embedded process, the following risk management cycle to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report will also be carried out by the
    rmf together with the respective risk owners.

                                        (b) 	operational risk management

                                            operational risk management (“orm”) is a continuous process which includes operational risk identification, measurement, quantification,
                                            management and monitoring to mitigate the operational loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, system or from
                                            external events.

                                            orm is monitored through a combination of the following activities:-

                                            •    the rcsa;
                                            •    analysis of actual loss events reported into the loss data capture (“ldc”) database;
                                            •    periodic audits by the internal audit department and reviews by rmf; and
                                            •    other key indicators and feedback from subject matter experts (e.g. business continuity management officers, anti-fraud and anti-
                                                 corruption coordinators).

     (c) reputational risk management




                                                                                                                                                                 allianz malaysia berhad (12428-w)
          all activities and non-activities within group can influence its reputation, which is determined by the perceptions and beliefs of its stakeholders.
          hence, thorough management of reputational risks is required. any risks that might have significant impact on other allianz operating entities
          or the allianz se group will be escalated to allianz se.

     	the corporate communications function of the group actively manage the reputational risk by assessing any potential risk arising from media
       press or any transaction relating pre-defined sensitive areas. reputational risk and issues management policy has been put in place to address
       the management of reputational risk and the methodology to assess reputational risk.

     (d) liquidity risk management

          liquidity risk is a consequential risk, i.e. another adverse event has to happen before the group runs into liquidity issues. on this background,
          the group has identified various events that might lead to liquidity shortages. to mitigate this, limits on the cash position have been put in
          place and closely monitored.

internal capital adequacy assessment process

internal capital adequacy assessment process (“icaap”) is an overall process by which the group adopted to ensure it has adequate capital to meet
its capital requirements which reflects its own risk profile on an on-going basis. the formal assessment is conducted at least on an annual basis and its
results are reported to the board.

the review of the icaap coincides with the annual planning process and any changes in the strategic directions of the respective companies and
business plans will be updated into the risk strategy and accordingly all risks identified will also be taken into account when computing the internal
capital target level (“itcl”).

the itcl is validated by stress testing to ensure that it will still be above the supervisory target capital level even after the occurrence of a severe
plausible event.

as part of the monitoring, thresholds are identified with the respective capital management action plans to be executed once the thresholds are
triggered.

stress testing

stress test is an effective risk management tool and the group conducts such stress test regularly.

the stress test process is designed based on the respective insurance subsidiaries’ solvency position, lines of business, current position within the market,
investment policy, business plan, and general economic conditions. the results of the stress test will then be incorporated into the respective insurance
subsidiaries’ capital management plan, in determining the extent of capital affected by the threats arising from adverse events and the actions required
to mitigate such threats.

the board and management participated actively in providing feedback and appropriateness of its methodology and assumptions and its results.

                                     	to raise awareness of the whistleblowing policy and avenues for reporting, compliance department had conducted the awareness programmes
                                       to the group’s employees on a periodic basis to ensure effective implementation of the whistleblowing policy while the adherence of the
                                       whistleblowing policy will be reviewed by internal audit department based on their internal audit programme.

                                          all fraud cases are assessed confidentially by the integrity committee to determine the validity and appropriate actions to be taken; and the findings
                                          are reported to the audit committee.

risk management and internal control

this statement on risk management and internal control (“statement”) is made pursuant to bursa malaysia securities berhad’s main market listing
requirements (“mmlr”) that requires the board to include in its company annual report a statement about the state of its internal control.




                                                                                                                                                             allianz malaysia berhad (12428-w)
this statement has been prepared in accordance with the statement on risk management and internal control – guidelines for directors of listed
issuers issued by an industry-led task force in december 2012.

board responsibility

the board recognises the importance of sound internal controls that cover risk management, financial, operational and compliance controls. the board
is fully committed to ensure that effective risk management and internal control systems are in place within allianz malaysia berhad and its subsidiaries
(the “group”) and continuously review the adequacy and integrity of these systems. such systems, designed to safeguard shareholders’ investments
and the group’s assets, however, can only mitigate rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives of the group. these
systems, by its nature, can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

the board has established an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks encountered by the group in achieving
its business objectives. the process, which is reviewed and updated from time to time to cater for changes in business environment, has been in place
throughout the financial year ended 31 december 2015 and has continued up to the date on which this statement was approved.

control structure

the key processes that the board has established for reviewing the adequacy and integrity of risk management and internal controls of the group are
as follows:

risk management framework

the board recognises the importance of having in place a risk management system to identify key risks and implement appropriate controls to manage
such risks as an integral part of the group’s operations. the group has in place a risk management framework manual (“rmfm”) for all companies
within the group (“oes”). the rmfm outlines the guiding principles of the risk management approach, structure, roles, responsibilities, accountabilities,
reporting requirements as well as the risk identification, evaluation and monitoring process of the group. it is designed to formalise the risk management
functions and practices across the group and to increase awareness of the group’s employees to risk identification, measurement, control, on-going
monitoring and reporting.

the rmfm is in compliance with the relevant bank negara malaysia (“bnm”) and allianz se group guidelines and policies.

the system of risk governance process is integrated into the core management processes and forms part of the daily business process so that a value-
added contribution in terms of sustainable competitive advantage and improved business performance can be established. various standards are
implemented by the group, including organisational structure, risk strategy, written policies, limits, system documentation and reporting, to ensure
accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a disciplined approach towards decision making and execution.

the group also adopts the three lines of defence model where the “first line of defence” rests with the business managers. they are responsible in
the first instance for both the risks and returns of their decisions. the “second line of defence” is made up of the oversight functions comprising legal,
compliance, and risk management that are independent from business operations.

•	the legal function seeks to mitigate legal risks arising from legislative changes, major litigation and disputes, regulatory proceedings and unclear
     contractual terms.

•	the compliance function assists the board and senior management in managing and mitigating the compliance risks due to any non-compliance
     of the requirements of the law, regulations and regulatory and industry guideline.

•    risk management function assists the board and senior management to achieve its strategic goals and objectives by implementing risk management
     activities across the organisation.

•    both the compliance and risk management functions report to the risk management committee (“rmc”) which assists the board to discharge
     its oversight function effectively. as part of its responsibilities, the compliance and risk management functions advise the board and senior
     management on compliance, risk and regulatory matters; and provide training to the group’s employees.

                                     in addition to the above oversight functions, actuarial function constitutes additional components of the “second line of defence”. actuarial function
                                     contributes towards assessing and managing risks in line with regulatory requirements and they report to the board and senior management. its scope

                                     of work includes the coordination and calculation of technical reserves for accounting and regulatory, oversight on product pricing/profitability and
                                     contribution to an effective risk management system. an appropriate control framework has been established to avoid any potential conflict of interest
                                     to fulfil their role as the second line of defence.

                                     internal audit

                                     internal audit forms the “third line of defence”. the internal audit function of the group, which reports to the audit committee, undertakes independent
                                     reviews or assessments of the group’s operations and its system of internal controls and provides monitoring of the controls and risk management
                                     procedures as well as highlights significant risks impacting the group. the internal audit personnel are independent from the day-to-day activities of the
                                     group and have unrestricted access to all activities conducted by the group.

                                     the audit scope covers auditable areas encompassing financial operations, product development, investments, pricing operations, back office functions,
                                     agency operations, regulatory compliance and information technology and systems. an annual audit plan is developed based on annual risk assessment
                                     and approved by the audit committee.

                                     internal audit findings are discussed at management level. senior and functional line management are tasked to ensure that management action plans
                                     are carried out in accordance with internal audit recommendations. follow-up audits are also performed to monitor continued compliance.

                                     all internal audit reports are submitted to the audit committee. the audit committee will deliberate on the key audit findings and management actions
                                     to address these findings during the audit committee meetings. the internal auditors will provide quarterly/ bi-yearly updates to the audit committee
                                     on the progress of the management action plans as well as progress of the audit plan.

                                     other key internal control process

                                     the other key processes that the board has established to provide effective internal control include:

                                     clear and defined organisational structure

                                     •    the group has established an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility, authority limits and accountability aligned to its
                                          business and operation requirements and control environment. relevant board committees with specific responsibilities delegated by the board
                                          are established to provide oversight governance over the group’s activities. the board committees have the authority to examine matters under
                                          their terms of reference as approved by the board and report to the board with their recommendations.

                                     •	management committees are established by the management to assist in managing the day-to-day operations and ensure its effectiveness. the
                                          management committees formulate tactical plans and business strategies, monitor the performance of the group and ensure activities are carried

    the regulator and the allianz se group. reinsurance needs are reviewed annually in respect of reinsurance treaties and on case to case basis on
    facultative arrangements.

financial control procedures

other statutory information

before the financial statements of the group and of the company were made out, the directors took reasonable steps to ascertain that:-

(i)     all known bad debts have been written off and adequate provision made for doubtful debts;

(ii)    any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business have been written down to an amount which
        they might be expected so to realise; and

(iii)   there was adequate provision for insurance contract liabilities in the group in accordance with the valuation methods specified in part

        liabilities in the group and in the company inadequate to any substantial extent, or

(ii)    that would render the value attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the group and of the company misleading, or

(iii)   which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the group and of the company
        misleading or inappropriate, or

(iv)    not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements that would render any amount stated in the financial statements of
        the group and of the company misleading.

      1.2	basis of measurement
             the financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis other than as disclosed in note 2.

      1.3	functional and presentation currency
             these financial statements are presented in ringgit malaysia (“rm”), which is the group’s and the company’s functional
             currency. all financial information is presented in rm and has been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

      1.4	use of estimates and judgements
             the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with mfrss requires management to make judgements, estimates
             and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and
             expenses. actual results may differ from these estimates.

      	estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in
        the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

             there are no significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have
             significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than those disclosed in the following notes:

2.	significant accounting policies
      the accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to the periods presented in these financial statements and have
      been applied consistently by group entities, unless otherwise stated.

      2.1	basis of consolidation

              2.1.1	subsidiaries
                      subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the company. the financial statements of
                      subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date
                      that control ceases.

                      the group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity
                      and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. potential voting rights are considered
                      when assessing control only when such rights are substantive. the group also considers it has de facto power over an
                      investee when, despite not having the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the activities of the
                      investee that significantly affect the investee’s return.

                      investments in subsidiaries are measured in the company’s statement of financial position at cost less any impairment
                      losses, unless the investment is classified as held for sale or distribution. the cost of investments includes transaction
                      costs.

                                                 2.1.2	business combinations

                                                 	business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the acquisition date, which is the date on
                                                   which control is transferred to the group.

                                                         for new acquisitions, the group measures the cost of goodwill at the acquisition date as:

                                                         •       the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
                                                         •       the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
                                                         •       if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
                                                         •       the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

                                                         when the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

                                                         for each business combination, the group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interests in the acquiree
                                                         either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.

                                                         transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the group incurs in
                                                         connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

                                                 2.1.3	acquisition of non-controlling interests

                                                         the group accounts for all changes in its ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control as
                                                         equity transactions between the group and its non-controlling interest holders. any difference between the group’s
                                                         share of net assets before and after the change, and any consideration received or paid, is adjusted to or against group
                                                         reserves.

                                                 2.1.4 	loss of control

                                                 	upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the former subsidiary, any
                                                   non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the former subsidiary from the consolidated
                                                   statement of financial position. any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss. if the
                                                   group retains any interest in the former subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is
                                                   lost. subsequently it is accounted for as equity accounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset depending
                                                   on the level of influence retained.

                                                 2.1.5	non-controlling interests

                                                         non-controlling interests at the end of the reporting period, being the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly
                                                         or indirectly to the equity holders of the company, are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position
                                                         and statement of changes in equity within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owners of the company.
                                                         non-controlling interests in the results of the group is presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and
                                                         other comprehensive income as an allocation of the profit or loss and the comprehensive income for the year between
                                                         non-controlling interests and the owners of the company.

                                                 	losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if
                                                   doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.

                    intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions,
                    are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

      2.2	foreign currency transactions

            transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of group entities at exchange rates at the
            dates of the transactions.

            monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the reporting period are retranslated to the
            functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.

            non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are not retranslated at the end of the reporting date
            except for those that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that
            the fair value was determined.

            foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for differences arising on the
            retranslation of available-for-sale equity instruments or a financial instrument designated as a hedge of currency risk, which are
            recognised in other comprehensive income.

      2.3   property, plant and equipment

            2.3.1	recognition and measurement

                    freehold land and work-in-progress are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. other items of property,
                    plant and equipment are measured at cost/valuation less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
                    impairment losses.

                    the group revalues its properties comprising land and buildings every five years and at shorter intervals whenever the
                    fair value of the revalued assets is expected to differ materially from their carrying value.

                    the revalued amounts of property are determined by using the comparison method. the comparison method entails
                    critical analysis of recent evidence of values of comparable properties in the neighbourhood and making adjustment for
                    differences such as differences in location, size and shape of land, age and condition of building, tenure, title restrictions
                    if any and other relevant characteristics.

            	valuation of the properties involves a degree of judgement before arriving at the respective property’s revalued
              amount. as such, the revalued amount of the properties may be different from its actual market price.

                    surpluses arising from revaluation are dealt with in the revaluation reserve account. any deficit arising is offset against
                    the revaluation reserve to the extent of a previous increase for the same property. in all other cases, a decrease in
                    carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.

                                                        cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other costs directly
                                                        attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing
                                                        the items and restoring the site on which they are located. the cost of self-constructed assets also includes the cost
                                                        of materials and direct labour. cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow
                                                        hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.

                                                        purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

                                                        the cost of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on fair value at
                                                        acquisition date. the fair value of property is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged between
                                                        knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted
                                                        knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. the fair value of other items of plant and equipment is based on
                                                        the quoted market prices for similar items when available and replacement cost when appropriate.

                                                 	when significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
                                                   as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

                                                        the gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from
                                                        disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and is recognised net within “realised gains and
                                                        losses” in profit or loss. when revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in the revaluation reserve are transferred
                                                        to retained earnings.

                                                 2.3.2	subsequent costs

                                                        the cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount
                                                        of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the group or
                                                        the company, and its cost can be measured reliably. the carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised
                                                        to profit or loss. the costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss
                                                        as incurred.

                                                 2.3.3 depreciation

                                                        depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. significant components of individual assets are
                                                        assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component is
                                                        depreciated separately.

                                                        depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of

                   depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at end of the reporting period, and adjusted as
                   appropriate.

      2.4 	intangible assets

            2.4.1	goodwill

                   goodwill arises on business combinations is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. in respect of
                   equity-accounted associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment
                   and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the
                   carrying amount of the equity-accounted associates.

            2.4.2 development costs

            	expenditure incurred on software development is capitalised, only if development costs can be measured reliably, the
              product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the group
              intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use the asset.

                   the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads costs that are directly attributable
                   to preparing the asset for its intended use. other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
                   capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
                   impairment losses.

            2.4.3	other intangible assets

                   intangible assets, other than goodwill, that are acquired by the group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at
                   cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

                   the fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted cash flows expected
                   to be derived from the use and eventual sale of the assets.

            2.4.4	subsequent expenditure

                   subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific
                   asset to which it relates. all other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

                                                 	amortisation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value.

                                                        goodwill with indefinite useful lives is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an
                                                        indication that it may be impaired.

                                                        intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised from the date that they are available for use.

                                                   classified as finance leases. upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower
                                                   of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is
                                                   accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.

                                                        minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction
                                                        of the outstanding liability. the finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a
                                                        constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. contingent lease payments are accounted
                                                        for by revising the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is
                                                        confirmed.

                                                   are classified as operating leases and, except for property interest held under operating lease, the leased assets are
                                                   not recognised on the statements of financial position. property interest held under an operating lease, which is held
                                                   to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as investment property and measured using fair
                                                   value model.

                                                        payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the
                                                        lease. lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the
                                                        term of the lease. contingent rentals are charged to profit or loss in the reporting period in which they are incurred.

      2.6	financial instruments

            2.6.1	initial recognition and measurement

                    a financial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the
                    group or the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

            	a financial instrument is recognised initially, at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair
              value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial
              instrument.

            	an embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only
              if, it is not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not
              categorised as fair value through profit or loss. the host contract, in the event an embedded derivative is recognised
              separately, is accounted for in accordance with policy applicable to the nature of the host contract.

            2.6.2	financial instruments categories and subsequent measurement

                    the group and the company categorise and measure financial instruments as follows:

                    financial assets

                    (a)	financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

                            fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial assets that are held for trading, including
                            derivatives (except for a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging
                            instrument) or financial assets that are specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition.

                            derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of unquoted equity instruments whose fair values
                            cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.

                            financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair values
                            with the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.

                    (b)	held-to-maturity investments

                    	held-to-maturity investments category comprises debt instruments that the group or the company has the
                      positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity.

                            financial assets categorised as held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortised cost
                            using the effective interest method.

                    (c)	loans and receivables, excluding insurance receivables

                    	loans and receivables category comprises debt instruments that are not quoted in an active market that
                      include loans, other receivables, deposits and cash and cash equivalents.

                            financial assets categorised as loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
                            effective interest method.

      2.6	financial instruments (continued)

            2.6.3 	financial guarantee contracts

            	a financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder
              for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or
              modified terms of a debt instrument.

                    fair value arising from financial guarantee contracts, if any, are classified as deferred income and is amortised to profit
                    or loss using a straight-line method over the contractual period or, when there is no specified contractual period,
                    recognised in profit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee. when settlement of a financial guarantee contract
                    becomes probable, an estimate of the obligation is made. if the carrying value of the financial guarantee contract is
                    lower than the obligation, the carrying value is adjusted to the obligation amount and accounted for as a provision.

            2.6.4 	regular way purchase or sale of financial assets

            	a regular way purchase or sale is a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require delivery
              of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.

            	a regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised and derecognised, as applicable, using trade date
              accounting. trade date accounting refers to:

                    (a)     the recognition of an asset to be received and the liability to pay for it on the trade date, and

                    (b)     derecognition of an asset that is sold, recognition of any gain or loss on disposal and the recognition of a
                            receivable from the buyer for payment on the trade date.

            2.6.5 	hedge accounting

                    cash flow hedge

            	a cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
              with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect the profit or loss. in a cash
              flow hedge, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is
              recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.

                    subsequently, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity into profit
                    or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss. if the hedge item is
                    a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is removed from
                    equity and included in the initial amount of the asset or liability. however, loss recognised in other comprehensive income
                    that will not be recovered in one or more future periods is reclassified from equity into profit or loss.

                    cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated
                    or exercised, the hedge is no longer highly effective, the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the
                    hedge designation is revoked. if the hedge is for a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging
                    instrument remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. when the forecast transaction is no longer expected
                    to occur, any related cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income on the hedging instrument is
                    reclassified from equity into profit or loss.

                                                   having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. losses expected as a result of future events, no matter how
                                                   likely, are not recognised. for an investment in an equity instrument, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below
                                                   its cost is an objective evidence of impairment. if any such objective evidence exists, then the impairment loss of the financial
                                                   asset is estimated.

                                                   is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.

      2.7	impairment (continued)

            2.7.2	insurance receivables

                    insurance receivables are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence of impairment as
                    a result of one or more events having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. losses expected as
                    a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised. an objective evidence of impairment is deemed to
                    exist where the principal or interest or both for insurance receivables is past due for more than 90 days or 3 months for
                    those individually assessed, as prescribed in the guidelines on financial reporting for insurers issued by bnm.

            	an impairment loss in respect of insurance receivables is recognised in profit or loss and is measured as the difference
              between the financial asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the
              financial asset’s original effective interest rate. the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced through the use of
              an allowance account.

                    if, in a subsequent period, the fair value of insurance receivables increases and the increase can be objectively related
                    to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed, to
                    the extent that the insurance receivable’s carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have
                    been had the impairment not been recognised at the date the impairment is reversed. the amount of the reversal is
                    recognised in profit or loss.

            2.7.3	other assets

                    the carrying amounts of other assets (except for investment properties that are measured at fair value and deferred tax
                    assets) are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
                    if any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. for goodwill that has indefinite useful
                    lives, the recoverable amount is estimated usually at each reporting date.

                    for the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash
                    inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (known
                    as “cash-generating unit”). for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, cash-generating units to which goodwill
                    has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level
                    at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. the goodwill acquired in a business combination, for
                    the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units that are
                    expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

                    the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs
                    of disposal. in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-
                    tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset
                    or cash-generating unit.

            	an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit exceeds its
              estimated recoverable amount. impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

                    impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of
                    any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) and then to reduce the carrying
                    amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit (groups of cash-generating units) on a pro rata basis.

                                                   prior periods are assessed at the end of each reporting period for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer
                                                   exists. an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
                                                   amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the
                                                   asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation
                                                   or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. reversals of impairment losses are credited to profit or loss
                                                   in the financial year in which the reversals are recognised, unless it reverses an impairment loss on a revalued asset,
                                                   in which case it is credited directly to revaluation reserve. when an impairment loss on the same revalued asset was
                                                   previously recognised in profit or loss, a reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.

                                                 2.8.1	investment properties carried at fair value

                                                         investment properties are properties which are owned or held under a leasehold interest to earn rental income or for
                                                         capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business.

                                                         investment properties are measured initially at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised
                                                         in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

                                                 	where the fair value of the investment property under construction is not reliably determinable, the investment
                                                   property under construction is measured at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably determinable or construction
                                                   is complete, whichever is earlier.

                                                         cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. the cost of self-
                                                         constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable
                                                         to bringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.

                                                 	an investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future
                                                   economic benefits are expected from its disposal. the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying
                                                   amount is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognised.

                                                 2.8.2	reclassification to/from investment property

                                                 	when an item of property, plant and equipment is transferred to investment properties following a change in its use,
                                                   any difference arising at the date of transfer between the carrying amount of the item immediately prior to transfer and
                                                   its fair value is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as a revaluation reserve.
                                                   however, if a fair value gain reverses a previous impairment loss, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. upon disposal
                                                   of an investment property, any surplus previously recorded in equity is transferred to retained earnings; the transfer is
                                                   not made through profit or loss.

                                                 	when the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property, plant and equipment, its fair value at the date
                                                   of reclassification becomes its deemed cost for subsequent accounting.

      2.8	investment properties (continued)

             2.8.3 determination of fair value

             	an external, independent valuation firm, having appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent
               experience in the location and category of property being valued, values the investment properties portfolio annually.

                     the fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged
                     on the date of the valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper
                     marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.

                     the determination of the fair values involves a degree of judgement. as such, the fair value of the investment properties
                     may be different from its actual market price.

      2.9	non-current assets held for sale

             non-current assets, or disposal group comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale
             rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale.

             immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance
             with the group’s accounting policies. thereafter generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their
             carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal.

      	any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata
        basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets, deferred tax assets and investment properties, which continue to
        be measured in accordance with the group’s accounting policies. impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale
        and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. gains are not recognised in excess of any
        cumulative impairment loss.

             intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not amortised or depreciated.

      2.10	cash and cash equivalents and placements with financial institutions

             cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hands, balances and deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid
             investments which have an insignificant risk of changes in fair value with original maturities of three months or less, and are
             used by the group and the company in the management of their short term commitments.

             cash and cash equivalents are categorised and measured as loans and receivables in accordance with policy note 2.6.2 (c).

      2.11	equity instruments

             instruments classified as equity are measured at cost on initial recognition and are not remeasured subsequently.

             2.11.1	ordinary shares

             	ordinary share capital is classified as equity.

                                                           preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable, or is redeemable but only at the company’s
                                                           option, and any dividends are discretionary. dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity.

                                                           preference share capital is classified as financial liability if it is redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the
                                                           equity holders, or if dividend payments are not discretionary. dividends thereon are recognised as interest expense in
                                                           profit or loss as accrued.

                                                   2.11.3 dividends on ordinary share capital

                                                           dividends on ordinary share capital are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity when they are approved by
                                                           the company’s shareholders. interim dividends are deducted from equity when they are paid.

                                                           dividends for the year that are approved after the end of the reporting period are dealt with as a subsequent event.

                                           2.12    provisions

                                           	a provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the group and the company have a present legal or constructive
                                             obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle
                                             the obligation. provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
                                             market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. the unwinding of the discount is recognised
                                             as finance cost.

                                           	contingent liabilities

                                           	where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably,
                                             the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the
                                             probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the
                                             occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability
                                             of outflow of economic benefits is remote. contingent liabilities do not include liabilities arising from contracts of insurance
                                             underwritten in the ordinary course of business of the group.

                                           	other financial liabilities and insurance payables are recognised when due and measured on initial recognition at the fair value
                                             of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at
                                             amortised cost using the effective interest method.

                                           2.14    product classification

                                                   product classification applies to the group’s general insurance and life insurance subsidiaries.

                                                   the insurance subsidiaries issue contracts that transfer insurance risk or financial risk or both.

                                                   financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange
                                                   rate, index of price or rate, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the
                                                   variable is not specific to a party to the contract. insurance risk is the risk other than financial risk.

      2.14   product classification (continued)

             insurance contracts are those contracts that transfer significant insurance risk. an insurance contract is a contract under which
             the insurance subsidiary (the insurer) has accepted significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholders) by agreeing
             to compensate the policyholders if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholders. as
             a general guideline, the insurance subsidiary determines whether it has significant insurance risk, by comparing benefits paid
             with benefits payable if the insured event did not occur.

             investment contracts are those contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk.

      	once a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, it remains as an insurance contract for the remainder of its life-
        time, even if the insurance risk reduces significantly during this period, unless all rights and obligations are extinguished or
        expired. investment contracts can, however, be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes
        significant.

             insurance and investment contracts (if any) are further classified as being either with or without discretionary participation
             features (“dpf”). dpf is a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to guaranteed benefits, additional benefits that are:

             •        likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;
             •        whose amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the issuer; and
             •        that are contractually based on the:
                      –         performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract;
                      –         realised and/or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer; or
                      –         profit or loss of the company, fund or other entity that issues the contract.

      	under the terms of the contracts, surpluses in the dpf funds can be distributed on a discretion over the amount and timing
        of the distribution of these surpluses to policyholders. all dpf liabilities, including unallocated surpluses, both guaranteed and
        discretionary, at the end of the reporting period are held within insurance or investment contract liabilities, as appropriate.

              for financial options and guarantees which are not closely related to the host insurance contract and/or investment contract
              with dpf, bifurcation and unbundling are required to measure these embedded derivatives separately at fair value through
              profit or loss. however, bifurcation is not required if the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract and/or investment
              contract with dpf, or if the host insurance contract and/or investment contract itself is measured at fair value through profit or
              loss.

      	when insurance contracts contain both a financial risk component and a significant insurance risk component and the cash
        flows from the two components are distinct and can be measured reliably, the underlying amounts are unbundled. any
        premiums relating to the insurance risk component are accounted for on the same basis as insurance contracts and the
        remaining element is accounted for as a deposit through the statements of financial position similar to investment contracts.

                                           2.15	reinsurance

                                                 reinsurance applies to the group’s general insurance and life insurance subsidiaries.

                                                 insurance risk is ceded in the normal course of business for all of its businesses. reinsurance assets represent balances due
                                                 from reinsurance companies. amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding
                                                 claims provision or settled claims associated with the reinsurer’s policies and are in accordance with the related reinsurance
                                                 contracts.

                                                 ceded reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the insurance subsidiary from its obligations to policyholders. premiums and
                                                 claims are presented on a gross basis for both ceded and assumed reinsurance.

                                                 reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment
                                                 arises during the reporting period. impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event that occurred
                                                 after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset that the insurance subsidiary may not receive all outstanding amounts due
                                                 under the terms of the contract and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the insurance subsidiary
                                                 will receive from the reinsurer. the impairment loss is recorded in profit or loss.

                                                 the insurance subsidiary also assumes reinsurance risk in the normal course of business for life insurance and general (non-
                                                 life) insurance contracts when applicable.

                                                 premiums and claims on assumed reinsurance are recognised as revenue or expenses in the same manner as they would be
                                                 if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business.
                                                 reinsurance liabilities represent balances due to reinsurance companies. amounts payable are estimated in a manner
                                                 consistent with the related reinsurance contract.

                                                 reinsurance assets or liabilities are derecognised when the contractual rights are extinguished or expired or when the contract
                                                 is transferred to another party.

                                                 reinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for directly through the statements of
                                                 financial position. these are deposit assets or financial liabilities that are recognised based on the consideration paid or received
                                                 less any explicit identified premiums or fees to be retained by the reinsured. investment income on these contracts is accounted
                                                 for using the effective yield method when accrued.

                   (b)	reinsurance premiums

                           inwards facultative reinsurance premiums are recognised in the financial period in respect of the facultative
                           risks assumed during that particular financial period, as in the case of direct policies, following the individual
                           risks’ inception dates.

                           inwards treaty reinsurance premiums comprise both proportional and non-proportional treaties. in respect
                           of reinsurance premiums relating to proportional treaties, it is recognised on the basis of periodic advices
                           received from the cedants given that the periodic advices reflect the individual underlying risks being incepted
                           and reinsured at various inceptions dates of these risks and contractually accounted for, as such to reinsurers
                           under the terms of the proportional treaties.

                           in respect of reinsurance premiums relating to non-proportional treaties which cover losses occurring during
                           a specified treaty period, the inwards treaty reinsurance premiums are recognised based on the contractual
                           premiums already established at the start of the treaty period under the non-proportional treaty contract.

            2.16.2	unearned premium reserves (“upr”)

            	unearned premium reserves (“upr”) represent the portion of the net premiums of insurance policies written that
              relate to the unexpired periods of the policies at the end of the financial period.

                   in determining upr at the end of the reporting period, the method that most accurately reflects the actual unearned
                   premium used is as follows:

                   •       25% method for marine cargo, aviation cargo and transit
                   •       1/24th method (or other more accurate) method for all other classes of malaysian general policies
                   •       1/8th method for all other classes of overseas inward treaty business
                   •       non-annual policies are time-apportioned over the period of the risks

            2.16.3 	claims and expenses

            	a liability for outstanding claims is recognised in respect of both direct insurance and inward reinsurance.

                   the amount of outstanding claims is the best estimate of the expenditure required together with related expenses less
                   recoveries to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period.

                   provision is also made for the cost of claims, together with related expenses, incurred but not reported at the end of the
                   reporting period, using a mathematical method of estimation.

                                                 2.16.4 	acquisition costs and deferred acquisition cost (“dac”)

                                                        the gross costs of acquiring and renewing insurance policies and income derived from ceding reinsurance premiums
                                                        are recognised as incurred and properly allocated to the periods in which it is probable they give rise to income.

                                                        those costs are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable out of future premiums. all other acquisition
                                                        costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.

                                                        subsequent to initial recognition, deferred acquisition cost is amortised/allocated to the periods according to the
                                                        original policies which give rise to income. amortisation is recognised in profit or loss.

                                                 	an impairment review is performed at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of impairment
                                                   arises. when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
                                                   dac is also considered in the liability adequacy test for each accounting period.

                                                        dac is derecognised when the related contracts are either settled or disposed of.

                                                 2.16.5	general insurance contract liabilities

                                                        general insurance contract liabilities are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged.

                                                        these liabilities comprise claims liabilities and premium liabilities.

                                                 	claims liabilities

                                                        claims liabilities are recognised in respect of both direct insurance and inward reinsurance. claims liabilities refer to
                                                        the obligation by the insurance subsidiary, whether contractual or otherwise to make future payments in relation to
                                                        all claims that have been incurred as at valuation date (see note 2.25.1). these include provision for claims reported,
                                                        claims incurred but not reported (“ibnr”) together with related claims handling costs. claims liabilities consist of the
                                                        best estimate value of the claim liabilities and the provision of risk margin for adverse deviation (“prad”) calculated
                                                        at the overall insurance subsidiary level. the liability is not discounted for the time value of money. no provision
                                                        for equalisation or catastrophe reserve is recognised. the liabilities are derecognised when the contract expires, is
                                                        discharged or is cancelled.

                                                        premium liabilities

                                                        premium liabilities is the higher of the aggregate of the upr and the best estimate value of the insurer’s unexpired risk
                                                        reserves (“urr”) at the valuation date and the prad calculated at the overall insurance subsidiary level.

                                                        the provision for unearned premiums represents premiums received for risks that have not yet expired. generally the
                                                        reserve is released over the term of the contract and is recognised as premium income.

                                                        the urr is the prospective estimate of the expected future payments arising from future events insured under policies
                                                        in force at the valuation date and also includes allowance for the insurer’s expenses, including overheads and cost of
                                                        reinsurance, expected to be incurred for administering these policies and settling the relevant claims, and expected
                                                        future premium refunds.

             2.17.1 	surplus of life fund

                    the surplus transferable from the life fund to profit or loss is based on the surplus determined by an annual actuarial
                    valuation of the liabilities to policyholders, made in accordance with the provisions of the financial services act, 2013
                    by the insurance subsidiary’s appointed actuary.

             2.17.2 	gross premiums

                    gross premiums are recognised as soon as the amount of the premiums can be reliably measured. first premium is
                    recognised from inception date and subsequent premium is recognised when it is due.

             	at the end of the financial year, all due premiums are accounted for to the extent that they can be reliably measured.
               premiums not received on due dates are recognised as revenue in profit or loss and reported as outstanding premiums
               in the statements of financial position.

             2.17.3 	reinsurance premiums

                    gross reinsurance premiums are recognised as an expense when payable or on the date on which the policy is effective.

             2.17.4 	benefits, claims and expenses

             	benefits and claims that are incurred during the financial year are recognised when a claimable event occurs and/or the
               insurer is notified.

             	benefits and claims, including settlement costs, are accounted for using the case-by-case method and for this purpose,
               the amounts payable under a policy are recognised as follows:

                    •       maturity and other policy benefit payments due on specified dates are treated as claims payable on the due
                            dates;
                    •       death, surrender and other benefits without due dates are treated as claims payable, on the date of receipt of
                            intimation of death of the assured or occurrence of contingency covered; and
                    •       bonus on dpf policy upon its declaration.

                    reinsurance claims are recognised when the related gross insurance claim is recognised according to the terms of the
                    relevant contracts.

                                                          these liabilities are measured by using a prospective actuarial valuation method (see note 2.25.2). the liability is
                                                          determined as the sum of the present value of future guaranteed benefits and, in the case of the participating life

                                                          rate. the liability is based on best estimate assumptions and with due regard to significant recent experience. an
                                                          appropriate allowance for provision of risk margin for adverse deviation from expected experience is included in the

                                                          the liability in respect of policies of a participating insurance contract is taken as the higher of the guaranteed benefit
                                                          liabilities or the total benefit liabilities at the insurance fund level derived as stated above.

                                                          in the case of a life policy where a part of, or the whole of the premiums are accumulated in a fund, the accumulated

                                                          as calculated using the prospective actuarial valuation method.

                                                          for non-unit liability of investment-linked policy, the liability is valued by projecting future cash flows to ensure that
                                                          all future outflows can be met without recourse to additional finance or capital support at any future time during the

                                                  	adjustments to the liabilities at each reporting date are recorded in profit or loss. profits originated from margins of
                                                    adverse deviations on run-off contracts, are recognised in profit or loss over the life of the contract.

                                                          the liability is derecognised when the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.

                                                          investment contracts (if any) are classified between contracts with and without dpf. the accounting policies for
                                                          investment contract liabilities with dpf are the same as those for life insurance contract liabilities.

                                                          investment contract liabilities without dpf are recognised when contracts are entered into and premiums are charged.
                                                          these liabilities are initially recognised at fair value being the transaction price excluding any transaction costs directly
                                                          attributable to the issue of the contract. subsequent to initial recognition, investment contract liabilities are remeasured
                                                          at fair value through profit or loss.

      2.17	life insurance underwriting results (continued)

             2.17.6 	investment contract liabilities (continued)

                     deposits and withdrawals are recorded directly as an adjustment to the liability in the statements of financial position.

                     fair value adjustments are performed at each reporting date and are recognised in profit or loss. fair value is determined
                     through the use of prospective discounted cash flow techniques. for unitised contracts, fair value is calculated as the
                     number of units allocated to the policyholder in each investment-linked fund multiplied by the unit-price of those
                     funds at the end of the reporting period. the fund assets and fund liabilities used to determine the unit-prices at the
                     end of the reporting period are adjusted to take into account the effect of deferred tax on unrealised gains on assets in
                     the fund.

                     the liability is derecognised when the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled. for a contract that can be cancelled
                     by the policyholder, the fair value cannot be less than the surrender value.

      2.18	fees and commission income

             insurance contract policyholders are charged for policy administration services, investment management services, surrenders
             and other contract fees. these fees are recognised as income over the period in which the related services are performed. if the
             fees are for services to be provided in future periods, then, they are deferred and recognised over those future periods.

      2.19	commission and agency expenses

             gross commission and agency expenses, which are costs directly incurred in securing premium on insurance policies, and
             income derived from reinsurance in the course of ceding of premiums to reinsurers, are charged to profit or loss in the period
             in which they are incurred.

      2.20	other revenue recognition

             revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the company and
             the revenue can be reliably measured. the following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised.

             2.20.1	interest income

                     interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method in profit or loss except where an
                     interest bearing financial investment is considered non-performing i.e. where repayments are in arrears for more than
                     six months, in which case recognition of such interest is suspended. subsequent to suspension, interest income is
                     recognised on the receipt basis until all arrears have been paid.

             2.20.2	rental income

                     rental income from investment properties and self-occupied properties are recognised in profit or loss on a straight-
                     line basis over the term of the lease. lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental
                     income over the term of the lease on an accrual basis. rental income from subleased property is recognised as other
                     income.

                                                   2.20.3 dividend income

                                                           dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date the group’s and the company’s right to receive payment is
                                                           established, which in the case of quoted securities is the ex-dividend date.

                                                   2.20.4 	realised gains and losses on investments

                                                           realised gains and losses recorded in profit or loss on investments include gains and losses on financial assets and
                                                           investment properties. gains and losses on the sale of investments are calculated as the difference between net sales
                                                           proceeds and the original or amortised cost and are recorded on occurrence of the sale transaction.

                                           2.21	short-term employee benefits

                                                   short-term employee benefit obligations in respect of salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and sick leave are measured on
                                                   an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

                                           	a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the group and
                                             the company have a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee
                                             and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

                                                   the group’s and the company’s contributions to the statutory pension funds are charged to profit or loss in the financial year
                                                   to which they relate. once the contributions have been paid, the group and the company have no further payment obligations.
                                                   prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payment is available.

                                           2.22	income tax

                                                   income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to
                                                   the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity, insurance contract liabilities or other
                                                   comprehensive income.

                                                   current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or
                                                   substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous financial years.

                                                   deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
                                                   and liabilities in the statements of financial position and their tax base. deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary differences
                                                   arise from the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
                                                   combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are
                                                   expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively
                                                   enacted by the end of the reporting period.

                                           	where investment properties are carried at their fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2.8.1, the
                                             amount of deferred tax recognised is measured using the tax rates that would apply on sale of those assets at their carrying value
                                             at the reporting date unless the property is depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economic
                                             benefits embodied in the property over time, rather than through sale. in all other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised is
                                             measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax
                                             rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

      2.22	income tax (continued)

             deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and
             they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they
             intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

      	a deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
        temporary difference can be utilised. deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced to
        the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

      2.23	earnings per ordinary share

             the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (“eps”) data for its ordinary shares.

      	basic eps is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted
        average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.

             diluted eps is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number
             of ordinary shares in issue adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise convertible notes.

      2.24	operating segments

      	an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and
        incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components. all
        operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, which in this case is
        the chief executive officer of the group, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its
        performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

             2.25.1 	valuation of general insurance claims liabilities

                     for general insurance contracts, claims liabilities are the outstanding claims reserve required for the future settlement
                     of losses on claims which have occurred but have yet to be fully settled. claims liabilities fall into two categories:
                     expected ultimate cost of claims reported and expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not yet reported (“ibnr”)
                     at the end of the reporting period.

                     it can take a significant period of time before the ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty and for some
                     type of policies, ibnr claims form the majority of the statements of financial position liability. the ultimate cost of
                     outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as chain
                     ladder and bornheutter-ferguson methods.

                     the expected ultimate cost of claims reported are based on estimates of future payments that will be made with
                     respect to individual claims. such estimates are made on a case-by-case basis, based on the information available at the
                     time the reserves are established. the estimates reflect the informed judgement of claims personnel based on general
                     insurance reserving practices and knowledge of the nature and value of a specific type of claim. these reserves are
                     regularly re-evaluated in the ordinary course of the settlement process and adjustments are made as new information
                     becomes available.

                                                          ibnr reserves are established to recognise the estimated cost of losses that have occurred but where the insurance
                                                          subsidiary has not yet been notified. the valuation of ibnr reserves is carried out by an appointed actuary approved by
                                                          bnm using her professional judgement in applying actuarial methodology and assumptions, based on the insurance
                                                          subsidiary’s current and past claims experience, taking into account the insurance subsidiary’s underwriting practice and
                                                          industry experience. ibnr reserves are estimated based on actuarial statistical projections of the expected cost of the
                                                          ultimate settlement and administration of claims. the projections are based on available information at the time and
                                                          include factors such as trends in claims frequency, severity and speed of settlement. ibnr reserves are reviewed and
                                                          revised quarterly as additional information becomes available with the actual claims development.

                                                  	as with all projections, there are elements of uncertainty and thus the projected future claims experience may be different
                                                    from its actual claims experience. these uncertainties may arise from changes in the underlying risks, changes in the
                                                    spread of risk, changes in the speed of reporting and settlement of claims as well as the suitability of the methodology used
                                                    in the projection model and its underlying assumptions.

                                                  2.25.2	valuation of life insurance contract liabilities

                                                          the valuation of life insurance contract liabilities is based on the risk-based capital framework for insurers, issued by bnm.

                                                          the life insurance contract liability is valued using a prospective actuarial valuation based on the sum of the present value
                                                          of future guaranteed benefits and, in the case of a participating life policy, appropriate level of non-guaranteed benefits,
                                                          and the expected future management and distribution expenses, less the present value of future gross considerations
                                                          arising from the policy discounted at the appropriate risk discount rate. the expected future cash flow is determined using
                                                          best estimate assumptions and with due regard to significant recent experience.

                                                          for non-unit liability of investment-linked policy, the liability is valued by projecting future cash flows to ensure that all
                                                          future outflows can be met without recourse to additional finance or capital support at any future time during the duration
                                                          of the investment-linked policy.

                                                  	an appropriate allowance for provision of risk margin for adverse deviation from expected experience is included in the
                                                    valuation of non-participating life policies, the guaranteed benefits liabilities of participating life policies and non-unit
                                                    actuarial liabilities of investment-linked policies.

      2.26	fair value measurement

             fair value of an asset or a liability is determined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
             an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. the measurement assumes that the transaction
             to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market, in the
             most advantageous market.

             for non-financial asset, the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
             benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in
             its highest and best use.

      	when measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the group uses observable market data as far as possible. fair value are
        categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the valuation technique as follows:


             level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the group can access at the
                      measurement date.
             level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or
                      indirectly.
             level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

             the group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date the event or change in circumstances
             that caused the transfers.

      3.1	revaluation of properties

      	all the group’s land and buildings were revalued in 2011 and 2015 by external independent professional qualified valuers using
        the sales comparison method. during the year, the group has revalued one of its buildings, resulting in a revaluation surplus
        amounting to rm9,188,000. the revalued building with carrying amount of rm46,186,000 was subsequently transferred to
        investment properties following the change in its use.

      	had the land and buildings of the group been carried under the cost model, their carrying amounts would have been as follows:

              level 2 fair value

      	level 2 fair values of land and buildings have been generally derived using the sales comparison approach. sales price of
        comparable land and buildings in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as location, property size,
        shape and terrain of land, tenure, title restriction if any, availability of infrastructure, building construction, finishes and services,
        and other relevant characteristics.

      4.1	goodwill (continued)

            impairment test for cash-generating unit (“cgu”) containing goodwill

            for goodwill attributable to the acquisition of cab, following the scheme on 1 january 2009, the carrying amount of goodwill
            has been allocated to the entire integrated general insurance business of the group as one cgu, which represents the lowest
            level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. the estimated recoverable amount
            is calculated based on value in use, determined by discounted cash flows generated by the general insurance business using
            approved 5-year financial budgets projected to perpetuity.

            the following key assumptions have been used in the cash flow projections in respect of the determining the value in use for
            cgu containing goodwill:


            key assumptions
            discount rate - post tax                                         11.2%
            terminal growth rate                                             3.0%

            for goodwill attributable to the acquisition of alim, the annual impairment test was done by comparing the estimated
            recoverable amount of alim with its carrying amount including the goodwill attributed. the recoverable amount is the value
            in use which is measured by the embedded value attributable to alim calculated by an appointed actuary. alim computes the
            embedded value using market consistent embedded value approach whereby the embedded value is the present value of
            future shareholders distributable profits after tax discounted at the risk free yield curve with volatility adjustment plus the net
            assets value. the projected future cash flows are based on the best estimate of assumptions, either derived from the operating
            unit experience or industry experience.

            the estimated recoverable amounts of both the cgus were determined to be higher than their carrying amounts and thus no
            impairment loss was recognised.

      4.2	software development costs

            the software development costs are in relation to internal development expenditures incurred for the open product
            underwriting system (“opus”), integrated insurance management system (“iims”), alternate front end system (“alpha”) and
            business intelligence system (“bi”). these systems are integrated systems designed to improve the efficiency of the business
            activities of the subsidiaries. the costs of developed software are amortised over a period of five years.

            the carrying amounts of other intangibles assets are as follows:

                                           segment information is presented in respect of the group’s business segments. each business segment is managed separately based
                                           on the group’s management and internal reporting structure.

                                           performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation, as included in the internal
                                           management reports that are reviewed by the group’s chief executive officer (the chief operating decision maker). segment profit is
                                           used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain
                                           segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

                                     	segment assets

                                           the total segment asset is measured based on all assets (including goodwill) of a segment, as included in the internal management
                                           reports that are reviewed by the group’s chief executive officer. segment total asset is used to measure the return of assets of each
                                           segment.

                                     	segment capital expenditure

                                           segmental capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more
                                           than one period.

	as a provider of insurance services, the group considers risk management to be one of its core competencies. it is an integrated part of
  the group’s business process. in order to protect the assets of the group, the group has established a risk management framework to
  promote a risk management culture supported by a robust risk governance structure.

       this framework ensures that risks are identified, analysed and evaluated. risk appetite is defined by a risk strategy and limit structure.
       close monitoring and reporting allows the group to detect deviations from its risk tolerance limits at an early stage.

       the allianz risk management framework consists of the following four primary components:

       risk underwriting and identification

	a sound risk underwriting and identification framework including risk assessment, risk standards, and clear targets form the foundation
  for adequate risk taking and management decisions such as individual transaction approval, new product approval, strategic or tactical
  asset allocation.

	risk reporting and monitoring

       the group’s qualitative and quantitative risk reporting and controlling framework provides transparency and risk indicators to senior
       management with regards to its overall risk profile and whether the profile is within delegated limits and authorities.

	risk strategy and risk appetite

       the group’s risk strategy clearly defines its risk appetite. it ensures that returns are appropriate for the risks taken and that the delegated
       authorities are in line with the group’s overall risk bearing capacity. the risk-return profile is improved through integration of risk
       considerations and capital needs into management and decision making process. this also keeps risk strategy and business objectives
       consistent with each other and allows the group to take opportunities within its risk appetite.

	communication and transparency

       finally, a transparent and robust risk disclosure provides a basis for communicating this strategy to the group’s internal and external
       stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing.

	risk governance structure

       the board of directors of the company (“the board”) assumes the ultimate responsibility over the effectiveness of the group’s risk
       management and internal control systems by establishing and supervising the operation of the risk management framework. the board
       has delegated the responsibility to establish and supervise the operation of the risk management framework to the risk management
       committee (“rmc”) to discharge its oversight function effectively.

       rmc bears the overall responsibility for effective risk identification, measurement, monitoring and control functions of the group. rmc
       also oversees the senior management’s activities in managing the key risk areas of the group and to ensure that the risk management
       process is in place and functioning effectively. the rmc is responsible for driving the risk management framework of the group and
       to report to the board on its recommendations and/or decisions. through structured reporting from the risk management working
       committee (“rmwc”), rmc will consolidate the status of the risks and present them to the board for consideration.

       rmwc serves as and provides a platform for two way communications between the management and the board on matters of the
       group’s risk management framework and its strategies. rmwc is responsible in formulating risk management strategies, policies and
       risk tolerance for rmc review and onward transmission of recommendation to the board. rmwc determines the allocation of risks
       by cascading and/or escalating to the relevant owners. rmwc also oversees the compliance of all risk management process by all
       departments of the group and provides pre-emptive recommendations to ensure timely action is taken in managing and mitigating
       the identified risks.

                                     	asset and liability management (“alm”) framework

                                           the investment committee (“ic”) has been tasked to manage business practices so that decisions and actions taken with respect to
                                           assets and liabilities are coordinated. it involves various management activities and responsibilities, including the formulation of long-term
                                           strategic goals and objectives and the management of various risks including liquidity risk, interest rate/profit yield risk and market risk.

                                           the alm process chosen will reflect external and internal constraints.
                                           •      external constraints include supervisory and legislative requirements, the interests and expectations of policyholders and other
                                                  stakeholders. a significant constraint is the liquidity of the assets and liabilities which may compromise the ability to price,
                                                  measure and hedge exposures.
                                           •      internal constraints such as asset allocation limits reflect the group’s management philosophy or professional judgement
                                                  (although this may also be influenced by external constraints).

                                     	governance and regulatory framework

                                           the group is required to comply with the requirements of the financial services act, 2013, relevant laws and guidelines from bnm, life
                                           insurance association malaysia (“liam”), persatuan insurans am malaysia (“piam”) and bursa securities malaysia berhad.

                                           the group is also required to comply with all allianz se group’s policies and standards. if there is any conflict with the local laws or
                                           regulations, the stricter will apply.



                                     38.	insurance risk

                                           insurance risk includes the risk of incurring higher claims costs than expected owing to the random nature of claims, frequency and
                                           severity and the risk of change in the legal or economic conditions of insurance or reinsurance cover. this may result in the insurer
                                           having either received too little premium for the risks it has agreed to underwrite and hence has not enough funds to invest and pay
                                           claims, or that claims are in excess of those expected.

                                           the group seeks to minimise insurance risk through a formalised reinsurance arrangement with an appropriate mix and spread
                                           of business between classes of business based on its overall strategy. this is complemented by observing formalised underwriting
                                           guidelines and limits and standards.

                                           38.1	life insurance contracts

                                                   the insurance risk of life insurance contracts consists of mortality/longevity and calamity risks. mortality/longevity risk
                                                   represents the risk of loss attributable to positive or negative changes in the assumed medical prognosis for life expectancy,
                                                   occupational disability, illness and the need for long-term care as well as underestimation of these probabilities. calamity risk
                                                   represents the risk of loss because of strong short-term fluctuation in the mortality rate, for example as a result of war or
                                                   epidemics.

      	as all of the business is derived from malaysia, the entire life insurance contract liabilities are in malaysia. there is no investment
        contract issued by the company during the current and previous financial years.

              key assumptions

              significant judgement is required in determining the liabilities and in the choice of assumptions. assumptions in use are based
              on past experiences, current internal data, external market indices and benchmarks which reflect current observable market
              prices and other published information. assumptions and prudent estimates are determined at the date of valuation. they are
              further evaluated on a continuous basis in order to ensure realistic and reasonable valuations.

              the key assumptions to which the estimation of liabilities is particularly sensitive are as follows:

              • mortality and morbidity rates
              	experience study on mortality and morbidity rates is carried out on an annual basis. the actual claim experience is
                compared against industrial mortality table and reinsurers’ morbidity risk charges. mortality and morbidity assumptions
                vary by product type and underwriting procedures.

              	alim can increase the mortality/morbidity risk charges in future years in line with emerging experience for investment-
                linked and universal life contracts.

              	an appropriate allowance for provision of risk margin for adverse deviation from expected experience is made in the
                valuation of non-participating life policies, the guaranteed benefits insurance liabilities of participating life policies, and
                non-unit actuarial liabilities of investment-linked policies.

                                                   cost of underwriting, issuing and maintaining the policies. expense assumption varies by premium term, distribution
                                                   channel, policy duration and underwriting procedures. the expense assumption is reviewed annually; it is compared to
                                                   actual expense that the subsidiary incurred.

                  respective reinsurance risk rates.

            sensitivities

            the analysis below is performed for reasonable possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions held
            constant, showing the impact on gross and net liabilities and profit before tax. sensitivities testing on individual assumptions
            are meaningful to analyse the magnitude of reserve changes for each assumption. however, it should be studied with care as
            it does not capture the possible correlation effect when all assumptions are being stressed simultaneously. it should be noted
            that movements in these assumptions are non-linear. sensitivity information will also vary according to the current economic
            assumptions.

                                                 of loss resulting from deviations between payments for incurred losses that have not yet been settled and the reserves set up to
                                                 cover these payments, or the use of an insufficient basis for the calculation of reserves.

             key assumptions

             the principal assumption underlying the liability estimates is that the subsidiary’s future claims development will follow a
             similar pattern to past claims development experience. this includes assumptions in respect of average claim costs, claim
             handling costs and claim numbers for each accident year. additional qualitative judgements are used to assess the extent to
             which past trends may not apply in the future, for example one-off occurrence as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix,
             policy conditions and claims handling procedures.

             no discounting is made to the recommended claims and premium liability provisions as a prudent measure. in addition, no
             explicit inflation adjustment has been made to claims amount payable in the future. however, implicit inflation is allowed for
             future claims to the extent evident in past claims development. it is worthwhile to note that discounting is unlikely to result in
             any material impact due to the short tail nature of almost all classes, coupled with the low prevailing interest rate environment.

             the subsidiary has based its risk margin for adverse deviation (“prad”) for the provisions for unexpired risks and insurance
             claims at the minimum 75% of sufficiency, according to the requirement set by bnm under the rbc framework.

             sensitivities

      	analysis of sensitivity around various scenarios provides an indication of the adequacy of the company’s estimation process in
        respect of its insurance contracts. the table presented below demonstrates the sensitivity of the insurance contract liabilities
        estimates to particular movements in assumptions used in the estimation process.

                                                  the analysis below is performed for reasonable possible movements in key assumptions with all other assumptions held

                                                  a significant effect in determining the ultimate claims liabilities, but to demonstrate the impact due to changes in assumptions,
                                                  assumptions had to be changed on an individual basis. it should be noted that movements in these assumptions are non-linear.

                                                  claims development table

                                                  the following tables show the estimate of cumulative incurred claims, including both claims notified and ibnr for each
                                                  successive accident year at the end of each reporting period, together with cumulative payments to date.

                                           	while the information in the tables provides a historical perspective on the adequacy of the unpaid claims estimate established
                                             in previous years, users of these financial statements are cautioned against extrapolating redundancies or deficiencies of the
                                             past on current unpaid loss balances.

                                                  the management of the subsidiary believes that the estimate of total claims outstanding as of 31 december 2015 is adequate.
                                                  however, due to the inherent uncertainties in the reserving process, it cannot be assured that such balances will ultimately
                                                  prove to be adequate.

	exposure to credit, liquidity, market (currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk) and operational risk arises in the normal course
  of the group’s and the company’s business. the group and the company are guided by its risk management framework as well as
  policies and guidelines from the ultimate holding company, allianz se which set out its general risk management philosophy. through
  financial risk management, business strategies are evaluated to ensure their appropriateness to the strategic, operational and financial
  risks tolerance.

        39.1	credit risk

                credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the group and the company if a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet
                its contractual obligations. the group’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from the reinsurance and the investment/
                placement in fixed income instruments. the company’s exposure to credit risk arises principally from subordinated loan to
                subsidiary. financial loss may materialise when the counterparties failed to meet payment obligations for various reasons.

                the group has credit policies in place to mitigate the credit risk from underwriting of insurance business and it is monitored on
                an ongoing basis. reinsurance is mainly to local insurers or reinsurers, and if the group has to place overseas, only counterparties
                that have a credit rating that is acceptable based on allianz group reinsurance security principles and guidelines are used.

        	with effect from 12 september 2008, all new bond investments must carry a minimum rating of aa- by rating agencies
          established in malaysia or a minimum rating of bbb- by any internationally recognised rating agency as outlined in the group’s
          investment mandate which is approved by the board of directors.

                the group and the company consider ratings bbb and above as investment grades and ratings below bbb as non-investment
                grades. assets which are not rated by rating agencies are classified as non-rated.

                credit exposure by credit rating

                the table below provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of the group and the company by classifying financial

              	as at 31 december 2015, based on combination of collective and individual assessment of receivables, there are
                impaired insurance receivables of rm20,493,000 (2014: rm22,359,000) and other receivables of rm1,325,000 (2014:
                rm6,363,000) respectively. no collateral is held as security for any past-due or impaired financial assets. the group
                records impairment allowance for insurance receivables and other receivables in separate allowance for impairment
                accounts. a reconciliation of the allowance for impairment losses for insurance receivables and other receivables are as

      39.2 	liquidity risk

      	liquidity risk is the risk of loss resulting from the danger that short-term current or future payment obligations cannot be met
        or can only be met on the basis of altered conditions, along with the risk that in the case of a liquidity crisis of the group and the
        company, refinancing is only possible at higher interest rates or that assets may have to be liquidated at a discount.

      	besides monitoring the liquidity position of the group and the company on a daily basis, the investment strategies particularly
        focus on the quality of investments and ensure a sufficient portion of liquid assets in the portfolio. some other tools used by
        the group include ensuring that its assets and liabilities are adequately matched and drawing down of funds to meet claim
        payments should the claim events exceed a certain amount as provided for in the reinsurance contracts.

              maturity profiles

              the table below summarises the maturity profile of the group’s and the company’s financial liabilities at the end of the reporting
              period based on remaining undiscounted contractual obligations, including interest/profit payable.

              for insurance contract liabilities and provision for claims, maturity profiles are determined based on estimated timing of net
              cash outflows from the recognised insurance liabilities.

              investment-linked funds’ liabilities are repayable or transferable on demand and are included in the “up to a year” column.
              repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately.

      39.3 	market risk

            market risk is the risk of loss arising due to changes in market prices or parameters influencing market prices, and in particular
            the resultant interest rate guarantee risks from asset liability management or from changes to participations. this includes
            changes in market prices due to worsening of market liquidity. market risk comprises of currency risk, interest rate risk and
            equity price risk.

            the following risk mitigation actions are in place to control and monitor such risk:

            •       investment committee actively monitors the investment activities undertaken by the group.
            •       investment committee would recommend the initiatives after balancing competing and legitimate objective of various
                    stakeholders.
            •       the investment policy and mandate which formulated the single counter limits, company limits and sector limits are
                    in place. compliance to such limits is monitored monthly and reported to risk management working committee/risk
                    management committee on a quarterly basis.
            •       stress tests are performed as and when needed.
            •       stop loss policy is in place.

            the group also issues investment-linked policies in a number of products. in the investment-linked business, the policyholders
            bear the investment risk on the assets held in the investment-linked funds as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value
            of the assets in the funds. the group’s exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from
            fund management charges is based on the value of the assets in the funds.

            39.3.1 	currency risk

                    currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to the changes
                    in foreign exchange rates.

                    the group’s primary transactions are carried out in ringgit malaysia (rm) and its exposure to foreign currency risk
                    arises principally with respect to us dollar (usd), singapore dollar (sgd), thai baht (thb) and indonesian rupiah (idr).
                    as the group’s business is conducted primarily in malaysia, the group’s financial assets are also primarily maintained
                    in malaysia as required under the financial services act, 2013 and hence, primarily denominated in the same currency
                    (rm) as its insurance contract liabilities. thus, the main foreign exchange risk from recognised assets and liabilities
                    arises from transactions other than those in which insurance contract liabilities are expected to be settled.

            	as the group’s main foreign exchange risk from recognised assets and liabilities arises from reinsurance transactions
              for which the balances are expected to be settled and realised in less than a year, the impact arising from sensitivity in
              foreign exchange rates is deemed minimal as the group has no significant concentration of foreign currency risk. all
              foreign currency risk in investment-linked funds is borne by policyholders.

            39.3.2	interest rate risk

                   the group is affected by changes in market interest rates due to the impact of such changes on fair value and will
                   incur an economic loss when the interest rates drop since the duration of policy liabilities is generally longer than the
                   duration of the fixed income financial assets.

            	besides the uncertainty of the cash flows of the insurance funds and scarcity of the longer dated instruments, it is not
              possible to hold assets that will perfectly match the policy liabilities.

                                                 39.3.3	equity price risk

                                                 	equity price risk is the risk that fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes
                                                   in market prices (other than those arising from changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates), whether those
                                                   changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument of its issuer or factors affecting similar
                                                   financial instruments traded in the market.

                                                         the group’s equity price risk exposures relates to financial assets and financial liabilities whose values will fluctuate as a
                                                         result of changes in market prices, principally investments securities not held for the account of the investment-linked
                                                         business.

                                                         the group’s equity price risk policy requires it to prioritise capital preservation besides setting limits on overall portfolio,
                                                         single security and sector holdings. the group complies with bnm stipulated limits during the financial year and has no
                                                         significant concentration of equity price risk.

                                                         equity price risk sensitivity analysis

                                                         the analysis below is performed for reasonable possible movements in key variables with all other variables held
                                                         constant, showing the impact on profit before tax, equity and insurance contract liabilities. the correlation of variables
                                                         will have a significant effect in determining the ultimate impact on equity price risk, but to demonstrate the impact due

                                                         variables are non-linear.

                           unfavourable direction. the impact on profit before tax would be dependent on whether the equity price risk
                           resides in shareholders’ fund, life non-participating fund, life participating fund or investment-linked funds.
                           where the equity price risk resides in shareholders’ fund and life non-participating fund, the impact will be
                           directly to profit before tax and equity of the group. in respect of life participating fund and investment-linked
                           funds, impact arising from changes in equity price risk would affect the insurance contract liabilities.

                   *       impact on equity reflects adjustments for tax, where applicable.

                                           39.4	operational risk

                                           	operational risk is an event or action that may potentially impact partly or completely the achievement of the group’s objectives
                                             resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human factors or external events.

                                                  relevant operational risks and control weaknesses are identified and evaluated via a structured self-assessment. besides,
                                                  operational risk events are collected so that significant losses can be used to analyse and provide measures aimed at avoiding
                                                  or reducing future losses.

                                                  the group puts in place the following controls to monitor and mitigate such risk:

                                                  •       effective segregation of duties;
                                                  •       access controls, authorisation and reconciliation procedures;
                                                  •       automation of processes where possible;
                                                  •       staff training; and
                                                  •       evaluation procedures such as internal audit.

                                           39.5	fair value of financial instruments

                                                  the group’s and the company’s basis in estimation of fair values for financial instruments is as follows:

                                                  -       the fair values of structured deposits, negotiable certificate of deposits, put option, collateralised forward starting
                                                          interest rate swap and forward purchase agreements are based on the indicative market prices from the issuing banks.
                                                  -       the fair values of quoted equity securities of corporations in and outside malaysia and quoted unit trusts in malaysia are
                                                          based on quoted closing market price as at the end of the reporting period.
                                                  -       the unquoted equity securities of corporations in malaysia are stated at cost. where in the opinion of the directors, there
                                                          is a decline other than temporary in value of unquoted equity securities, the allowance for impairment is recognised as
                                                          an expense in the financial year in which the decline is identified.
                                                  -       the fair values of malaysian government securities, malaysian government guaranteed bonds, ringgit denominated
                                                          bonds by foreign issuers outside malaysia and unquoted bonds of corporations in malaysia are based on the indicative
                                                          market yields obtained from three financial institutions.
                                                  -       the fair values of unquoted unit trusts in and outside malaysia are based on the net asset values of the unit trusts as at
                                                          the date of the statements of assets and liabilities obtained from fund managers.
                                                  -       the carrying amounts of malaysian government guaranteed loans, policy loans, mortgage loans, automatic premium
                                                          loans, subordinated loan, other secured loans, fixed and call deposits and advance from holding company are assumed
                                                          to reasonably approximate their fair values.
                                                  -       the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, insurance receivables, other receivables and deposits, other
                                                          financial liabilities, insurance payables, other payables and accruals reasonably approximate their fair values due to the
                                                          relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.

                                           	estimation of the fair values of malaysian government securities, malaysian government guaranteed bonds, ringgit
                                             denominated bonds by foreign issuers outside malaysia, and unquoted bonds of corporations in malaysia are based on the
                                             average indicative market yields obtained from three financial institutions which involve projections of the market yields based
                                             on past transactions. there are elements of uncertainty in projecting the expected market yields and these uncertainties arise
                                             from changes in underlying risk and overall economic conditions. as such, the projected market yields may be different from
                                             the actual market yields in future.

                                                  it was not practicable to estimate the fair value of the group’s investment in unquoted equity securities of corporations in malaysia
                                                  due to the lack of comparable quoted market prices and the inability to estimate fair value without incurring excessive costs.

      regulatory capital requirements

      the risk-based capital framework (“rbc”) came into effect on 1 january 2009. under the rbc framework, insurance companies need
      to maintain a capital adequacy level that commensurate with their risk profiles. all insurance companies are required to maintain a
      minimum capital adequacy ratio (“car”) of 130% and an internal target capital level required by bnm or level determined under the
      internal capital adequacy assessment process. the internal target will include additional capacity to absorb unexpected losses beyond
      those that are covered under the minimum required car.

      the insurance subsidiaries of the group have met their regulatory requirements.

an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. the procedures

opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

     1.	continuation in office as independent non-executive director (“ined”)

           pursuant to the recommendations of the malaysian code on corporate governance 2012, the tenure of an ined should not
           exceed a cumulative term of nine (9) years. the board must justify and seek shareholders’ approval in the event it retains as an
           ined, a person who has served in that capacity for more than nine (9) years.

           mr. foo san kan, an ined of the company, was appointed to the board on 25 november 2005. at the last annual general
           meeting of the company in 2015, the shareholders of the company had approved for mr. foo san kan to continue to serve as
           ined of the company until the conclusion of 42nd agm.

           mr. foo san kan has expressed his willingness to continue to serve as an ined of the company.

           the nominating committee and the board of the company had assessed the independence of mr. foo san kan and were of the
           view that mr. foo san kan remains independence and shall continue to serve as an ined of the company.

           the board recommended for shareholders’ approval, the resolution for mr. foo san kan to continue to serve as an ined of the
           company after serving for a term of more than nine (9) years.

           mr. foo san kan is interested in this proposal and had accordingly abstained from deliberation and voting at the nominating
           committee meeting and board meeting.

           the ordinary resolution 8, if passed, will enable mr. foo san kan to continue to serve as an ined of the company until the
           conclusion of the next annual general meeting.

           the justifications for this proposal are disclosed in the statement on corporate governance of this annual report.

           the company is principally engaged in investment holding whilst the principal activities of the subsidiaries are underwriting of
           all classes of general insurance business and underwriting of life insurance and investment-linked business.

           it is anticipated that the company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “group”) will, in the ordinary course of
           business, enter into recurrent related party transactions with classes of related parties as set out in section 2.2 of the circular to
           shareholders dated 26 april 2016 (“shareholders’ mandate circular”).

           shareholders’ approval for the proposed resolutions 9, 10 and 11, to allow the group in its ordinary course of business, to
           enter into categories of recurrent related party transactions with the respective related parties as detailed in the shareholders’
           mandate circular, provided that such transactions are made on arm’s length basis and are on terms not more favourable to the
           related parties than those generally available to the public and are not to the detriment of the minority shareholders.

           detailed information in relation to the proposed shareholders’ mandate for recurrent related party transactions are set out in
           the shareholders’ mandate circular, despatched together with this annual report.
