annual review 2014                           alma media corporation

an interview with the president and ceo
in your opinion, how did alma media succeed in 2014?
the year was characterised by two different forces. firstly, as the economy in finland continued to be weak, the
development of finnish printed media business was poor. good digital growth did not fully compensate for the decline
in printed media. secondly, our business outside finland grew better than expected and its profitability remained
excellent.

due to the economic recession and weakened macroeconomic forecasts, in 2014 we sought cost savings by streamlining
our operations, processes and organisation. the streamlining efforts and good digital development efficiently dampened
the negative effect of the weak operating environment and declining demand on our performance.



to what extent did alma media achieve its financial targets in
2014?
our long-term financial target of 15 per cent return on equity was not achieved in the prevailing market conditions.
however, our digital business grew 12 per cent, which is rather satisfactory. last year, digital products and services
accounted for 32 per cent of group revenue.



in your opinion, what were alma media’s most important
development steps in 2014?
we continued to develop and increase our international recruitment business by merging alma media’s recruitment
operations in different countries under one company. alma career started operations at the beginning of 2014. the
company, which we own jointly with monster worldwide inc, expanded our digital recruitment business into countries
in which we were not present before, namely hungary and poland.

i am particularly glad that the strong growth of alma media’s digital business continued in 2014. in the third quarter,
our digital advertising sales exceeded printed media advertising sales. in the whole year 2014 advertising sales from
digital and printed media were on par.

in publishing operations, one of the highlights of the year was the establishment of lännen media. in my opinion, the
agreement signed by alma media and five other finnish newspaper publishers on journalistic collaboration and the
establishment of lännen media oy is a significant step towards ensuring the quality of regional publishing operations
and the cost-efficiency of business. the collaboration has resulted in the regional papers benefiting from a significant
amount of new content to be utilised in both the print newspaper and paid online services.



how has the operating environment changed during the year?
unfortunately, the general economic situation has not improved in finland and the rest of europe. in 2014, consumer
demand was weak, due to consumers’ declining purchasing power. this had a particularly strong impact on the sales
and marketing investments of retail and specialty trade, both important for newspaper advertising sales.

as consumers’ patterns of media use are increasingly characterised by digitisation, advertisers are at an accelerating
rate investing in online stores and digital marketing channels. digitisation has led to globalisation of the market, and we
are now facing a new type of competitive situation: we have to compete for the attention of finnish consumers with the
largest american players in the media field, such as google and facebook.

however, alma media is well established in the new competitive field, and the company has the resources for continued
success.




annual review 2014                                          1                                    alma media corporation

many media companies invest heavily in the it development, for
purposes such as more efficient use of consumer data in business.
can this development be seen in alma media?
media companies are increasingly developing their business towards the it industry, and technical development plays a
strong role in our daily work. the use of so-called intelligent data will be one of our most important areas of
development in the next few years. we build consumer data by analysing our content and our services for advertisers,
and we develop our advertising and content sales.

systems for data analysis and the use of data are already in daily use at editorial offices. minute by minute, we analyse
consumers’ moves in online services and modify the content to serve consumers in the best possible way. our media
sales also use technology developed for the analysis and management of advertising. with these tools, we can target
advertising in accordance with customers’ needs. at the same time, of course, we keep consumers’ privacy protection
strictly in mind.



what were the key issues in 2014 in terms of corporate
responsibility?
last year, alma media continued its own activities and co-operation to mitigate the environmental impacts of the
media sector, develop the competence of its employees and reduce youth unemployment. corporate responsibility
activities particularly highlighted the effects of journalism on society, responsible management of consumer data and
the local social responsibility of journalism.

recently, the role of freedom of speech in society has become a strongly debated issue in finland and around the world
after the terrorist attack on the french weekly. the attempt to suppress freedom of speech with violence and terrorist
activity has been widely condemned around the world.

at the same time, in finland, we also have to consider the existence and working conditions of a pluralistic and free
press from a wider perspective. the general instability of the economy has challenged finnish media companies and
will, at worst, deplete our diverse media landscape. without a functional, wide-ranging, pluralistic high-quality media,
democracy cannot exist. alma media wants to prevent such development by improving our media to respond to
consumers’ needs even better—without compromising the quality of the content. in addition, responsible collection, use
and storage of consumer data is always essentially important for alma media’s business.



what are alma media’s sources of growth in 2015 and in the near
future?
in the next few years, the majority of growth in alma media will come from digital media—through existing brands and
new products and services, both in finland and internationally. in addition to digital service business, in the near future
we will develop our delivery and printing services. we will invest in information services and various consumer and
lifestyle services, and we will continue to increase our international recruitment business. our balance sheet position
has improved according to plan. this makes it possible for us to make use of suitable investment opportunities, when
the time comes.

the operating environment will continue to be very challenging. alma media must be alert in reading weak signals and
adapt its operations accordingly. in a time of transformational changes in the media industry, alma media is supported
by a strong strategy and a clear direction towards a digital future. all of alma media’s business units will continue to
focus their resources on digital business and invest strongly in developing their digital expertise.

i want to thank our customers, employees, investors and partners for the past year. alma media is in a good position to
develop its operations and serve its stakeholders even better, also in the future.




annual review 2014                                          2                                    alma media corporation

operating environment
for media companies, 2014 was a difficult year. the reasons for this were, in particular, the weak
economic situation in europe and finland, and the accelerating changes in media consumption
habits. advertising decreased, and media consumption shifted to digital channels – especially to
mobile media.
uncertainty in the global economy continued, and the finnish economy remained in a downward economic cycle in
2014. the weakness of the eurozone and the deterioration of the economic situation in russia due to the ukrainian
crisis had an impact on finland in the form of lower exports and decreased domestic demand. the productivity and
competitiveness of the finnish economy has diminished, and there are no clear signs of a turn for the better.

according to economic forecasts, finnish gdp growth for the full year 2014 is estimated to be negative. negative growth
has now continued for three years. both consumers’ and businesses’ confidence in the economy was weak through the
whole year.

the economies of eastern central europe have developed favorably and the gdp growth in alma media’s main market
areas there has supported the company’s recruitment business. according to economic forecasts, the gdp is estimated
to grow 2.5 percent in the czech republic and 2.4 percent in slovakia in 2014 (european economic forecast 11/14).



media advertising volume continued to decline
media advertising volume, which is closely linked to gdp growth, decreased in finland in 2014 according to tns media
intelligence by 3.5 percent compared to the previous year, totalling meur 1,175.8. the media advertising share of gdp
was at a historical low.

advertising fell by 8.3 percent from the previous year. the contributing factors included difficult economic situation,
changes in marketing and advertising and the weak situation of the retail trade, among others. alma media estimates

online advertising has been more resilient to macroeconomic changes than other media advertising. according to a
forecast published by emarketer (july 2014), global spending on digital advertising grew by 16.7 percent in 2014, and its
share of total advertising spending exceeded 25 percent for the first time. online advertising spending exceeded tv
advertising spending for the first time in the united states as well as in finland (tns ad intelligence, iab finland).

in online advertising, growth is fastest in mobile advertising. according to emarketer, mobile advertising grew by 84.7

advertising in 2014, according to emarketer’s estimate. in finland, total spending on mobile marketing in 2014 is
estimated at approximately meur 12.4. at alma media, the mobile ad views grew by 100 percent year-on-year.

mobile advertising is forecasted to account for 58 percent of total digital advertising by 2018.

the growth in online advertising is supported by increased social media advertising and video advertising, as well as
technological development, such as new tools for targeting campaigns and measuring their effectiveness.

much untapped potential remains in digital growth. in finland, the share of online advertising is still lower than in the
other nordic countries at 22.5 percent of all media advertising. the total volume of online advertising amounted to
meur 264.8, up 10.8 percent from the previous year. display advertising, which also includes facebook advertising,
grew by 15.5 percent. classified advertising declined by 1.2 percent. spending on search engine advertising and
advertising in online directories grew by approximately 9 percent from the previous year.

alma media’s share of the finnish market for classified and display advertising online is slightly below one third and its
share of all online advertising (including, in addition to the aforementioned, search engine advertising and online
directories) is approximately one seventh.



consumers are shifting to mobile
the media industry is inevitably moving towards digitality due to a change in consumer habits. media consumption is
becoming increasingly fragmented between different media and the use of time, and the diversity of devices is
increasing as supply grows. for media companies, this calls for building an around-the-clock media consumption
experience and comprehensively analysing customer preferences and media use. content must be flexibly created for
different devices, and the consumer must be followed from screen to screen.

the operating environment of finnish media companies in 2014 was affected by customers increasingly shifting to the
internet, and mobile content in particular. according to an international study conducted last year, online media is now
the number one source of news for finns, even exceeding tv news in reach. the same study reveals that one out of five
finns now reads the news primarily on their smartphones. the same trend can be seen in alma media’s services, with
an increase in mobile traffic of 109 percent over the past 18 months.

improved economic situation speeds up the growth of recruitment
markets in eastern central europe
recruitment services constitute the majority of alma media’s international operations. most of alma media’s
recruitment service companies are the leaders in online recruitment in their respective markets. at the beginning of
2014, the geographical scope of our recruitment operations expanded to hungary and poland after alma media
acquired monster worldwide inc.’s companies in poland, hungary and the czech republic. in conjunction with the
acquisition, alma media sold a 15% share of all recruitment companies it owns to monster worldwide inc.

in alma media’s fastest-growing market area, eastern central europe, the recruitment advertising situation in 2014 was
more stable than in the company’s home market in finland. in finland, the recruitment advertising market declined by
almost 11 percent and the market value in 2014 is estimated at meur 30. the czech market for recruitment advertising
grew by 13 percent in 2014, reaching an estimated total value of approximately meur 27. there were approximately
33,000 job openings every month, of which approximately 65% were advertised on the recruitment portals owned by
alma media.

as in finland and the rest of the eu, high unemployment presented a challenge to the markets in eastern central
europe. in october 2014, the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent in finland, 5.7 percent in the czech republic and 12.9
percent in slovakia (eurostat). the unemployment rate in the czech republic was the fourth-lowest in the eu after
germany (4.9 percent), austria (5.1 percent) and malta (5.6 percent). the average unemployment rate in the eu was
11.5 percent in october 2014.

youth unemployment in particular has been a challenge across the eu for a long time. in october 2014, the youth
unemployment rate was 20.2 percent in finland and 14.2 percent in the czech republic. in slovakia, youth
unemployment is as high as 29.5 percent.



winds of change in the world of media: big data and new pilot
projects
in 2014, the major emerging topics in the media industry included data utilisation and native advertising. new pilot
projects and experimentation in the industry was particularly focused on the upcoming changes to people’s daily lives
brought about by the internet of things.


use of big data becoming an essential part of daily life for media companies
the rise of big data is a trend that has a strong impact on the media industry. according to an international study
carried out in autumn 2014, in western europe alone, businesses intend to nearly triple their technology and service
investments related to big data over the next few years. the term “big data” generally refers to massive amounts of
heterogeneous and unorganised digital data created by consumers on the internet as well as various devices connected
to the internet.

the rise of big data has also been noticed by media companies. according to a report released by the reuters institute
at oxford university in late 2014, the strategic leveraging of big data is the next big change in media companies. media
companies can utilise big data in areas such as product development and the targeting of content and advertising.


growth in native advertising
last year native advertising broke through into the mainstream of marketing. native advertising refers to marketing
that is integrated seamlessly into the environment of its publication platform, making consumers perceive it more as
high-quality content than traditional advertising.

native advertisements are often designed primarily for mobile consumption. native advertising is expected to grow
rapidly in the next few years as mobile content consumption increases.


the internet of things is coming
in 2014, media companies also carried out their first content pilots and experiments related to the internet of things.
the research company gartner estimates that, by 2020, there will be 25 billion devices or things connected to the
internet worldwide. having many of the things in our daily environment constantly connected to the internet will
enable the production of content and advertising specifically designed for them. while developments in this area are

still in their early stages, some international media companies already began content pilots and experiments related to
the internet of things in 2014. media companies offered content applications for new consumer products in the area of
wearable technology, such as the smartwatch launched by samsung.

business segments
alma media group’s reporting structure was changed at the beginning of 2014. alma media’s
reportable segments are digital consumer services, financial media and business services,
national consumer media and regional media.
the group has five operating segments as shown in the table below. the operating segments that produce similar
products and services are combined into reportable segments due to their uniform profitability and other uniform
characteristics.

the change in the segment structure is due to the transformation of the business environment in the media industry,
with media consumption increasingly shifting to digital channels.

centralised services produced by the group’s parent company and centralised digital support services for the entire
group are reported outside segment reporting.

in publishing, which includes regional, local and city newspapers, the daily tabloid iltalehti and the financial media
kauppalehti with their respective online services, business is based on a relationship with readers built through good
journalistic content. as media develops, the reader relationship becomes a multidimensional customer relationship
with a media brand. the strength of this relationship can vary from an occasional website visit to an ongoing
newspaper subscription and the use of online services as a paid and registered user.

the reader relationship and the resulting coverage of the desired target audience are the foundation of advertising
sales. the combined reach of alma media's brands has increased in recent years as a result of strong growth in website
visitors. alma media reaches currently 3.3 million finns every week. media brand's reader relationships and their
strong regional visibility also enable the extension of brands to new areas such as digital services.

in order to offer better service for readers and advertisers, it is important to measure the reader relationship. in the
third quarter of 2014 alma media started together with sanoma media finland, yleisradio (finland's national public
service broadcasting company) and mtv a joint development project for audience measurement. the project lasts for
few years and its goal is to create common methodology and terminology for measurement and to advance the design
development of new media planning tools. company called media metrics finland was established to lead the project
and the goal of the company is to understand the media consumption in finland even better.

the revenue of alma media’s digital services (such as etuovi.com, autotalli.com, monster.fi, prace.cz, telkku.com and e-
kontakti.fi) is based on fees charged for classified advertising, display advertising, service sales as well as revenue
streams from service content and/or advertising targeted at the users of the service. the customers of digital services
include both businesses and consumers.

in the competition for market share, brand appeal is of crucial importance. alma media’s digital services are the best-
known brands in their segments in finland, the baltic states, the czech republic, slovakia and other countries the
group operates in. the popularity of these services among users is based on a high level of usability, unique content
and, in many cases, the importance of the social or communal dimension. for an advertiser, this opens up valuable
opportunities to specifically target the businesses or consumers in a particular category.

corporation and monster worldwide inc. strengthened their cooperation at the beginning of 2014. the recruitment
businesses in poland, hungary and the czech republic that were transferred to alma media as part of the expanded
cooperation compensated for the decline in the segment’s domestic business operations.

the marketplaces improved its result due to recruitment businesses
outside of finland
the digital consumer services segment’s marketplaces business unit continued to grow despite the weak economic
situation in finland and europe.

the growth was particularly attributable to recruitment businesses outside of finland, as they accounted for 58.4 (52.1)
per cent of the segment’s revenue in 2014.

the recruitment business was developed and growth was achieved by engaging in closer cooperation with monster
worldwide inc. the expansion of the cooperation saw monster’s services being added to alma media’s recruitment
service offering, which is available in finland, estonia, latvia, lithuania, poland, czech republic, slovakia, hungary
and croatia. the companies are managed under alma career oy, which began operations at the beginning of 2014.
alma career oy integrates recruitment services in all of alma media’s nine operating countries more closely and
thereby enables international sales growth through monster's global network. synergies are also achieved through the
ability to take advantage of monster’s technologies and service concepts in selected markets.

the focus on digital recruitment services in the international market was also strengthened by the divestment of a non-
core marketplace. in the fourth quarter, the marketplaces unit sold city24, a housing portal operating in the baltic
countries. in finland, the business unit continues with its current service offering in the areas of recruitment, housing
and cars.

the housing-related online services in the finnish market, etuovi.com and vuokraovi.com, completed a significant
renewal of their services in 2014. the service renewals were implemented in the second quarter and were well received
by both advertisers and users. the renewal of etuovi.com included improvements to the service’s usability and search
engine optimisation.

vuokraovi.com launched elämyshaku, a service aimed at increasing awareness of the vuokraovi.com brand as a
service for renting holiday homes, as well as providing new kinds of entertaining and useful content to users.

the marketplaces unit’s services in the housing and car sectors were also strengthened through acquisitions.

in the third quarter, alma media’s subsidiary alma mediapartners oy acquired 15 per cent of the share capital of
remonttibulevardi oy, which produces the urakkamaailma.fi online service. urakkamaailma.fi helps property
managers and consumers arrange competitive bidding for renovations, and offers contractors opportunities to find new
contracts. the acquired online service further expands the range of services provided by alma media’s etuovi.com
service.

alma mediapartners oy strengthened its automotive software expertise by purchasing all of the shares in alma media’s
associated company alkali oy in the second quarter of 2014. through alkali, alma media can offer an extensive range
of applications for the automotive retail industry. alkali develops software applications for various automotive industry
needs such as retail, rental and leasing.



alma diverso expands its service offering
the online business development and service unit alma diverso sought growth in 2014 through the renewal of its
existing online services and the expansion of its service offering.

in early 2014, the business unit introduced a new marketing service, meedio, which compiles all finnish companies
under one website and offers a self-service tool for companies’ marketing management. meedio responds to the
growing trend of automation and self-service in the world of marketing, where the purchasing of marketing is
increasingly taking place via automated online services.

alma media responded to the growth of online commerce in the travel industry by acquiring 35 per cent of the share
capital of finland’s leading online travel service rantapallo oy. the shareholding in rantapallo supports alma media’s
strategy of pursuing growth particularly by expanding the group’s digital service offering. alma diverso will be
responsible for cooperation with rantapallo oy.

development work also continued in alma diverso’s existing services. one example was the launch of a service for
mobile and tablet devices by the online dating service e-kontakti.fi in late 2014.

financial media and business services
the year 2014 was a time of strong growth in digital media for the financial media and business
services segment.
the financial media and business services segment’s revenue in 2014 was meur 53.0 (56.8), of which online business
accounted for 43.0 (33.4) per cent. revenue decreased by 6.7 per cent year-on-year. the divestment of the bns business
operations in february 2014 had an effect on the decline in revenue.

content revenue for the financial media and business services segment declined by 3.5 per cent to meur 16.2 (16.8),
but digital content revenue increased by 20.2 per cent in 2014, and the increase partly covered the decline in content
revenue for print media. online advertising revenue also continued to grow. the increase from the previous year
was 14.4 per cent.

digital development continues
during the year, the financial media and business services segment took several steps forward to provide even better
service to both audiences and advertisers. kauppalehti developed multi-channel content, including the launch of new
mobile news services for iphone and android devices. in addition, a digital edition of kauppalehti optio was launched
during the year. kauppalehti also published new blogs aimed at experts in various sectors, built using new social media
elements.

kauppalehti’s digital renewal project progressed to the beta stage in the second quarter, and the renewed website was
launched in january 2015. the site has been entirely rebuilt to respond to the changing usage habits and needs of the
audience and advertisers. the content has been designed to serve the information needs of the finnish decision-maker
in the best possible way throughout the day. for advertisers, the new site allows more specific targeting and, for
instance, new solutions for the challenges posed by corporate communications. kauppalehti will also expand its video
production in conjunction with the renewal of the website.

the business premises service, one of kauppalehti’s digital business services, also underwent a renewal process. the
service’s design and visual style were renewed along with the technological platform, making it easily accessible across
all devices. kauppalehti’s business information service offering was expanded in january 2015 by alma media’s
acquisition of jm tieto, which specialises in information and expert services in b2b sales and marketing. jm tieto will
be reorganised in spring 2015 to form a part of the kauppalehti information services.

due to the recession and weak macroeconomic outlook, alma media initiated several measures in the third quarter to
increase its cost efficiency. in relation to these measures, the content agency alma 360, which is part of the financial
media and business services segment, implemented organisational changes. as a result of statutory employee
negotiations, the number of employees in alma 360 was reduced by 12 people.

the financial media and business services segment focused its operations increasingly on financial media and digital
business services by selling bns group, a news agency and media monitoring unit that was previously reported under
financial media and business services, in march 2014.

il-media’s video production and advertising solutions as the focal
area of development
il-media had a strong focus on the development of online tv in 2014. in the first quarter of 2014, il-tv implemented a
new distribution platform that improves video functionality in applications. il-tv also launched a number of new
shows and programme formats, such as the pelipäivä (game day) studio, which follows the nhl, il-doc, which reports
on surprising and touching topics, and kämppikset (roommates), a new action comedy series that is finland’s first
fictional series written exclusively for online television.

the new and renewed services attracted new viewers and advertisers. the volume of video publishing and viewing in
il-tv grew approximately by 100 per cent in 2014, and advertising sales in this new channel developed favourably. the
most-viewed videos on il-tv in 2014 were videos related to finnish independence day, with more than 1.5 million
viewers.

digital media was also developed by introducing tablet content and implementing organisational changes. il-media
introduced new tablet content free to consumers, such as the cars 2014 and summer kitchen tablet publications. also
in 2014, il-media established a joint lifestyle editorial team that brings together digital services in the areas of housing,
health, cars, and travel. the company completed statutory personnel negotiations in the third quarter, which resulted in
the combination of the photo and layout departments of il-media into a single visual design department to adopt an
increasingly multi-channel approach and reduce overlapping work.

the content marketing solutions offering was expanded in 2014. similarly to kauppalehti, il-media launched new turn
key concepts for content and native marketing to help advertisers utilise earned media.

regional media
the decline in print media had an influence on the result of the regional media segment in 2014. the
segment’s revenue declined 1.3 per cent to meur 145.2 (147.1).
also content revenue and advertising sales for print media declined in 2014. the regional media segment’s advertising
revenue totalled meur 62.5 (66.5), which represents a decrease from the previous year of 6.1 per cent. print media
advertising revenue declined by 6.7 per cent, but the segment’s online advertising revenue grew by 10.8 per cent to
meur 2.1 (1.9). the segment’s content revenue was meur 65.5 (67.6), down 3.1 per cent, mainly due to the decrease in
print media circulation.

the response to the decline in the profitability of print media involved cost savings, efficiency improvements and digital
development.

moving forward towards digitality
for regional media, 2014 was characterised by efforts to improve efficiency and strengthen digitality in both working
methods and services.

several developments were made to serve advertisers and consumers as they shift to digital channels. alma regional
media recruited the unit’s first director of digital business in the third quarter. late in the year, the segment also
launched a special project to increase its digital competence. the development project covers alma regional media in
its entirety and is aimed at increasing digitality in business. personnel have a central role in this effort, as they are
challenged to take part in the planning of digital business. the needs of active media consumers are the basis for the
development of renewed business models, operating culture and expertise. the project will last for approximately 18
months and it has received funding from the liideri programme of tekes - the finnish funding agency for innovation.

the segment’s response to the digital transformation and changing consumer behaviour also included the development
of multi-channel content. aamulehti began a project for launching hetki (“moment”), a new paid digital afternoon
edition. the new digital edition was released in january 2015. hetki complements aamulehti’s digital product offering
by adding a new consumer product for the afternoon, the time of day when the news stories covered in the morning
paper are due for an update. alma regional media’s other regional and local papers also continued to develop their
paid online services. for example, pohjolan sanomat and aamulehti implemented a partial paywall at the beginning of
2014, and kainuun sanomat followed suit in march 2014. alma regional media’s video production took significant
leaps forward by organising video training and harmonising video platforms across the segment’s various papers.

renewal also continued on the print side, for example in the form of aamulehti’s switch from broadsheet to tabloid
format. the tabloid renewal involved changes in the newspaper's content, structure, supplements and design. the
renewal was carried out with extensive input from readers, and feedback was also collected after the renewed
aamulehti was launched. the first tabloid-format aamulehti was published on 1 april 2014. alma regional media’s
other regional papers had already previously adopted the tabloid format.

to improve the profitability of regional publishing operations and ensure the quality of content, alma media and five
other finnish newspaper publishers established lännen media. the newly established company improves journalistic
cooperation between newspapers in western and northern finland and enables shared content production for printed
papers as well as the digital, online and mobile channels. the founding newspapers of lännen media include the alma
media newspapers aamulehti (tampere), satakunnan kansa (pori), lapin kansa (rovaniemi), kainuun sanomat
(kajaani) and pohjolan sanomat (kemi), the ilkka-yhtymä newspapers ilkka (seinäjoki) and pohjalainen (vaasa),
hämeen sanomat (hämeenlinna) and its affiliate forssan lehti (forssa), turun sanomat (turku), kaleva (oulu) and
keskipohjanmaa (kokkola).

the printing and distribution company alma manu oy, which was previously reported under the other operations
segment, became part of the regional media segment in march 2014. the purpose of this rearrangement is to increase
collaboration between manu and its largest customer, alma regional media, as well as to improve the use of resources.

there were many changes in alma manu’s distribution operations during the year. itella (nowadays posti) discontinued
many of its early morning delivery agreements across finland, which led to the early morning delivery of newspapers
being transferred to new service providers. distribution in a small area in tornio was transferred to alma manu in the
summer. already before that, alma manu had handled the early morning delivery of some newspapers, including
aamulehti, pohjolan sanomat and lapin kansa. in order to improve the profitability of distribution operations and to
maintain its service level, alma manu applied for and received a postal licence from the finnish government for letter
deliveries in pirkanmaa and satakunta. the licence authorises alma manu oy to provide postal services to contract
customers in the geographic area covered by the licence. alma manu also reorganised its distribution and transport
network in the third quarter and joined forces with the major finnish newspaper publishers in the fourth quarter. in
october 2014, alma media started to investigate together with sanoma media finland, keskisuomalainen oyj, ts-
yhtymä, kaleva oy, mediatalo esa and länsi-savo group the possibility of establishing a joint venture with the aim of
developing the co-operation between early morning delivery service providers and their logistics as well as to manage
the nationwide sales of delivery services. the aim is to create a system for the early morning delivery network of
newspaper publishers so it could take on more material to deliver and to ensure high-quality and cost-efficient
operations.

due to weaker-than-expected performance, regional media reached an agreement in the second quarter on savings in
annual personnel costs of approximately meur 1.5 for 2014. the savings were achieved by temporary layoffs and by
exchanging bonus holiday pay for days off.

sustainable media
changes in media consumption and consumer behaviour create a need for renewal in the media
sector. alma media’s response to these challenges is sustainable media that cultivates traditional
journalistic values while integrating broader corporate responsibility in all operations.
over the past few years, alma media has actively developed the sustainable media perspective, both in its own
operations and by introducing the theme in public discussion. thanks to its active participation, alma media has
established a strong position as a pioneer of corporate responsibility in the media business in the nordic countries.



goals and achievements in 2014
in 2014, alma media continued its own activities and co-operation to mitigate the environmental
impacts of the media sector, develop the competence of its employees and reduce youth
unemployment. in addition, corporate responsibility activities in 2014 highlighted the effects of
journalism on society and the local social responsibility.
a media company’s most significant impact is created through the content it produces. each of alma media’s media
outlets is responsible for its journalistic content. alma media’s role is to promote discussion on the responsibility
associated with freedom of speech and to increase awareness of the brainprint media leaves on audiences and society.

in 2014, one of the focus areas was continuing the work related to the environmental impacts of media and continued
partnerships in this field. alma media participates in the annual carbon disclosure project (cdp) climate reporting
directed at investors, and was ranked as the top nordic media company in october 2014. in recognition of its
environmental efforts, alma media received leed environmental certifications in the end of 2013 for its new
premies, head office in töölönlahti and printing facility in tampere.

preventing youth unemployment was also an area of focus for us in 2014. for the fourth consecutive year, alma media
and its monster online service were involved as main partners in supporting and implementing the finnish children
and youth foundation’s responsible summer job project. the 2014 campaign attracted 176 responsible employers, who
offered a total of more than 33,000 summer and seasonal jobs. alma media and monster participate in the campaign
again in 2015. this time the campaign is led by the finnish economic information office tat.

in 2013–2014 alma media was actively involved in brainprint-related research and discussion, both in finland and
internationally. in addition to the impacts of journalism, the discussion extended to the impacts of advertising and how
advertising can promote not only consumption, but also sustainable development.

the sustainable media programme is implemented in alma media’s and its employees’ way of working and through the
choices employees make on a daily basis. various social responsibility projects of local communities are examples of
how each employee can influence matters and it is alma media's role to provide these opportunities for such activities.
alma media’s corporate responsibility objectives are thus incorporated in the daily work of each employee and business
unit. nevertheless, alma media has set certain specific corporate responsibility objectives to support responsible
actions in daily work. in addition to the objectives described below, goals related to corporate responsibility are also
described in the sections on the environment and employees.

the development areas and objectives of sustainability and corporate responsibility planned for year 2015 can be found
in at glance at 2015 section.

employees
collaboration and networking across organisational boundaries, the development of managerial
work and the enhancement of digital competencies characterised the work of alma media’s
employees in 2014.
the yammer conversation platform was widely implemented among employees in 2014. the platform improves
internal company communication and participation across the group. by implementing the yammer application, alma
media wants to enable and activate internal dialogue, facilitate internal collaboration across organisational boundaries,
promote ideas and innovation and create a stronger, uniform corporate culture and identity.

in 2014, the new office premises in helsinki and the new printing facility in tampere further improved the working
conditions and employee well-being for those working on these premises. the töölönlahti office building, which brings
helsinki-based alma media employees together under one roof, has particularly facilitated collaboration, the sharing of
expertise and networking between units. the employee co-operation networks established in 2013 continued to be
active; they included the young alma medians network for the young and young at heart, and a software developers’
network.

an employee survey, which is done every two years, was conducted in 2013. the respodents of the survey felt that
managerial work, in particular, has improved from previous surveys. in addition to managerial work, the survey
respondents appreciated the improved operating methods and greater flexibility. the responses from alma media
employees based in helsinki also highlighted the improvements in the working environment brought about by the new
office premises. the most significant areas of improvement revealed by the survey were related to the transformation of
the media sector. respondents felt that their work is more stressful than before, and the future of the industry is
perceived as uncertain. this was also reflected in ambiguity regarding common targets and objectives.

based on the results of the employee survey, improvement of the digital competence of alma media employees was
identified as an important area of focus across the organisation. the results of the survey were reviewed team by team
in spring 2014, led by their respective managers, and these discussions were used to prepare concrete development
plans with measurable targets and designated responsible persons. the next comprehensive employee survey will be
conducted in autumn 2015.

digital coaching, organisational restructuring, international acquisitions and recruitment for digital business operations
brought new competence to alma media and improved the group’s capacity for sharing know-how. both the proportion
of employees working on digital services and the share of employees stationed outside finland continued to increase in
2014, due to, for example, alma career expanding its business into new countries, namely poland and hungary.

in 2014, the company employed an average of 1,830 professionals, excluding deliverers. of them approximately one
quarter worked outside finland.

diverse competence development
the digititalization of the media field creates a need for new compentence. employee competence is developed
through coaching and new, dynamic organisational models. collaboration across organisational boundaries is seen as a
starting point for operations. in 2014, training activities focused on digital competence, change management and
enhancement of managerial performance.

alma regional media that publishes all of alma media’s regional, local and city newspapers started a new project called
etukeno for the development of digitality. employees play a central role in this development project, as they are
challenged to take part in the planning of digital business. the needs of active media consumers are the basis for the
development of renewed business models, operating culture and expertise. this development project of alma regional
media will run for several years, and it has received funding from the liideri programme of tekes - the finnish funding
agency for innovation.

digital competence has also expanded through specific training courses, recruitment of new employees by, amongst
others, the alma diverso unit and international acquisitions of companies in the field of digital recruitment services.
the shared premises and the yammer conversation platform that enables the internal engagement of employees
provide a natural setting for bringing different skills together and enabling effective teamwork.

the alma flow programme was continued through 2014. alma flow is a managerial work development programme
with the objective of supporting employee commitment and motivation through management by coaching. in 2014, the
programme focused on means and methods for the promotion of employee well-being, the early intervention model
and themes related to employees’ own time management at the workplace, which are also related to employee well-
being. in addition, the alma flow programme increased mentoring of managers and provided other development tools
to support managerial work. in 2015, the alma flow programme will be further developed to respond to new challenges
in the industry.

in total, alma media organised approximately 1,300 training days for its employees in 2014. this included internal and
external training and coaching. in addition to open training days organised by the company, employees complemented
their professional development through training provided by external partners. this training is included in the reported
figure for total training days. in 2015, the development of digitality and projects, such as alma regional media’s

promotion of equality and non-discrimination
alma media's unit-specific equality plans include practical and detailed objectives, actions, schedules, responsible
persons and metrics. equality plans are part of human resource and training planning, and they are updated annually.

although the differences in salaries between men and women at alma media have been in line with the average
finnish pay structure, improving gender equality in pay has been highlighted as an important area of monitoring and
development for the group. this development has been successful in almost all employee groups, partly by allocating
company-specific portions of salary increases in a manner that promotes gender equality in pay.

in 2014, due to the general economic situation, company-specific portions could not be allocated, however. thus,
equality in pay could not be promoted in this way. in 2015, close attention will be paid to the development of equality in
pay, and alma media will strive to improve it further.

in 2014 the share of women of all managers and the group's management team was in par with the numbers from the
previous year. at the end of december in 2014, 55 per cent of those working in supervisor positions were men and 45
per cent women. women comprised 39 per of the senior management and 22 per cent of the group's executive team. in
the board of directors, 13 per cent of the members were women.

in january 2015, alma media signed the diversity undertaking and has made a commitment to draft an action plan for
the development of diversity at alma media. alma media is committed to providing equal opportunities for employees,
identifying and using individual skills and needs and managing its employees and customers in a fair manner.



increasing multiculturalism at alma media
the diversity of employees is an asset for alma media when it is building the future of media. the significance of
employee diversity has increased in the ageing and increasingly international society. at alma media, distribution
operations in particular offer employment opportunities for qualified candidates who have moved to finland from
abroad. immigrants represent slightly over 17 per cent of all distribution employees; in the pirkanmaa region this figure
is as high as approximately 26 per cent. the group’s printing and distribution unit alma manu focused on the
challenges and opportunities presented by employee diversity in 2014: taking multiculturalism into account was
specified as one of the objectives of the action plan for 2015.

alma media has adopted the average retirement age as a metric for monitoring employee well-being and diversity as
well as social responsibility. in 2014, the average retirement age was 63 years, unchanged from the previous year (2013:
63).

as in the previous year, diversity also increased in 2014 due to international acquisitions. alma career oy, which
manages alma media’s digital recruitment services, continued to expand its business to poland and hungary through a
collaboration with monster worldwide 2014. while increasing internationality will present new management
challenges in the coming years, it will also provide significant opportunities in the form of diverse expertise, new
working practices and fresh perspectives.

new business premises boost occupational health
alma media employees in helsinki moved under one roof at the turn of the year 2012–2013 as the group’s new office
building was completed in töölönlahti. employees were involved in the design of the new building from the start. in
addition to participating in unit-specific working groups, employees had the opportunity to influence their new working
environment through an idea team, the helmi system for employee suggestions and initiatives, pilot projects and voting
on various issues. the shared office building has contributed to progress on a variety of matters that are central to the
development of corporate responsibility and operations, such as the sharing of know-how, employee well-being and
collaboration across organisational boundaries.

alma media paid particular attention to occupational health in the design of the new office building in töölönlahti. the
many health-related aspects of the working environment that were taken into consideration include indoor air quality,
ergonomic workstations and lighting. employees are encouraged to stay physically active by means such as providing
loan bicycles and supporting leisure-time physical exercise. the menu of the office building’s cafeteria promotes healthy
eating. occupational health was also a prominent element at other alma media offices during the year.

a total of 131 occupational accidents were reported in 2014 (2013: 117). on the other hand, the number of days absent
due to occupational accidents dropped to half in 2014, totalling 670 days (2013: 1,301 days). the majority of
occupational accidents and accidents during work-related travel at alma media occur in distribution operations, as
they are affected by weather conditions. the occupational safety of delivery personnel has been highlighted as a key
area of focus in distribution operations. it was specified as a particular target in the unit’s action plan for 2014. the
objective of providing a foundation for continuous improvement of occupational safety was achieved in 2014.

responsibility and occupational safety issues, such as appropriate clothing, anti-slip solutions and safe walking,
continued to be integral aspects of the training provided for delivery personnel. the structure of alma manu’s
occupational safety and health organisation was modernised in 2014. the focus is now on the identification of
hazardous situations and operational prevention of accidents by improving the analysis of accidents and hazardous
situations. occupational safety and employee well-being were given a great deal of consideration in the design of alma
media’s new printing facility in tampere, which began operations in 2013. the aim is to minimise accidents during
printing and distribution.

brainprint and communities
it is essential for a responsible media company to observe how the content it produces affects society
and to bear responsibility for those effects.
at alma media, such responsible content production is called brainprint. the term was launched by the wwf in 2005.
in recent years, alma media has worked to introduce the finnish equivalent of the term (‘ajatusjälki’) in the finnish
language and in the debate on the responsibility of the media industry.

therefore, in june 2014, for the second consecutive year, alma media participated in the mirrors or movers seminar
held in london. the main themes of the seminar were questions related to measuring the brainprint of media; equality
issues and the way women are portrayed in media; media’s ability to influence people’s environmental attitudes; and the
data security of users of media content.



alma media as a responsible influencer in society
taking the brainprint of media into account in content production and journalism each day constitutes an important
part of alma media’s responsible business. one way to evaluate the success of alma media’s papers in this is to
monitore changes in the number of council for mass media (cmm) decisions concerning alma media. council for
mass media (cmm) decisions, reader feedback, reader panels and requests for corrections are all metrics for reliability
and responsible journalism.

alma media papers discuss cmm decisions at newspaper level, led by the editor-in-chief, and develop their operations
accordingly.

in 2014, the council for mass media issued a total of 96 decisions on matters such as corrections and surreptitious
advertising. of these decisions, 17 pertained to alma media’s various media. of the decisions pertaining to alma media,
35 per cent were condemnatory, which was a lower percentage than the overall rate of condemnatory cmm decisions in
2014. the overall rate for condemnatory decisionsby the council last year was 40 per cent.

after the peak experienced in 2013, however, the total number of cmm decisions in finland dropped in 2014 closer to
the level of the previous years. however, the number of cases dealt with by the cmm remained higher than in the first
years of the 2010s.

communities and alma media
alma media has various direct and indirect cultural, economic and social impacts on the communities in which it
operates. communities range from small municipalities in which alma media publishes a local paper to online
communities formed around alma media’s services.

driver of change at the grass-root level
as a strong regional and local finnish media company, alma media also has the unique opportunity to participate in
many local grass root-level projects that implement alma media’s objectives of responsible journalism and social
development and highlight regionally important themes.

in 2014, a few of these larger projects were the tampere car boot fair, arranged twice a year jointly by aamulehti’s moro
supplement and the local parish, and broad regional campaigns by kainuun sanomat and pohjolan sanomat, aiming to
increase the vitality of their respective regions. both the kannata kainuuta ('support kainuu') campaign launched by
kainuun sanomat in summer 2014, and the merilappilainen jalanjälki ('footprint of sea lapland') campaign lauched
soon thereafter were designed and carried out in co-operation with local entrepreneurs and other actors. their
objective is to help locals to understand that they can influence the employment rate and availability of services in their
region through very small changes to their consuming habits: by buying just a little more local products and services.
both newspapers have a visible role in the projects, having developed an entire product and event family around the
campaigns. the campaigns continue and expand in both regions at least throughout 2015. in kainuu, the local centre
for economic development, transport and the environment joined the campaign at the beginning of 2015. yle
perämeri, a local radio station of the finnish broadcasting company, is involved in the collaboration in the kemi and
tornio region.

another example of social projects is the popular car boot fair in tampere, which promotes recycling. the event also
supports local charity work: the pitch fees and income from the boot fair café are all directed to the soup kitchen that is
run by the parishes of tampere. each year, the car boot fair produces approximately eur 25,000 for the soup kitchen. in
addition, external partners are often involved in the boot fair project, and additional aid projects are carried out with
them. in the car boot sale arranged in spring 2014, a partner to the project was a company specialising in efficient
recycling. with this partner, we carried out a campaign for the collection of used spectacles and sunglasses. a total of
10,000 pairs of spectacles and 2,000 pairs of sunglasses were collected during the car boot fair. the glasses were then
delivered to tanzania by an international eye specialists’ humanitarian organisation.



alma media and the future stars
in addition to the direct and indirect impacts of its business operations, alma media supports economically and socially
sustainable development through partnerships. one example of this is the youth employment (permanent and summer
jobs) campaign organised in partnership with the finnish children and youth foundation (fcyf), carried out for the
fourth time in 2014. the responsible summer job 2014 campaign challenged companies to create good summer jobs
for young people. the goal of the campaign is to take an action-oriented approach to youth employment. in 2014, a total
of 161 employers joined the campaign to offer over 33,000 responsible summer jobs. the campaign continues in 2015,
now with the finnish economic information office tat at the helm instead of the fcyf. the objective is to have more
employers participate.

for the second consecutive year, aamulehti is involved in systematic co-operation with the pirkanmaa me & mycity. a
miniature enterprise that carries the name of the partner will be designed and built in the me & mycity learning
environment. each day, three to five sixth graders work there in jobs that simulate real-life professions. each school

environment
in spring 2012, the global reporting initiative (gri) published a media sector supplement as
guidance for the media industry. in 2013, alma media was the first finnish media company to start
publishing an annual corporate responsibility report in compliance with the gri media sector
supplement guidelines.
alma media’s environmental study, completed in 2013 and conducted in co-operation with vtt technical research
centre in finland and the swedish center for sustainable communications, has played an important role in the
development of alma media’s environmental responsibility. the environmental study focused on the effects of printed
and digital media.

in 2014, alma media continued its participation in the carbon disclosure project (cdp), a global initiative on climate
impacts, and was ranked as the top nordic media company. alma media has been a signatory of the un global compact
initiative since 2011.



environmental responsibility is the strength of new buildings
the most significant environmental impacts of the operations of alma media and its business units are related to
printing and distribution, buildings, purchasing and travel. alma media’s new helsinki office in töölönlahti, completed
in december 2012, and the new printing facility in tampere that started production in spring 2013 reduce the highest
direct environmental impacts. environmental impacts during construction and use were minimised in both projects.
both of the buildings received leed environmental certification in 2013. the töölönlahti office building achieved leed
gold certification in recognition of excellent consideration of environmental matters. as far as is known, the tampere
printing facility is the world’s first leed-certified printing facility.

during the design process of the töölönlahti building, including the choice of location, environmental aspects were
taken into account as follows:

     - energy-efficient building technology
     - underground parking with charging stations for electric cars
     - waste management during construction and use, with extensive recycling
     - excellent public transport links.



focus on material and energy efficiency in printing
alma media develops its environmental responsibility by improving its material and energy efficiency. the
environmental study carried out in 2012 provided information on potential opportunities for improving efficiency. the
new printing facility and office building significantly improve the energy efficiency of alma media’s properties. for
instance, the printing facility in tampere has a heat recovery system that captures over 80 per cent of exhaust air. the
production efficiency of the new printing press is higher than before, and the use of solvent-based detergents and water
has decreased.

the amount of materials wasted has considerably decreased in the new printing facility; the amount of maculature
decreased by 11 per cent compared with the previous year. in 2013, the first year of the new printing facility, the
maculature percentage* did not decrease, as test runs and problems in the breaking-in phase produced more waste
material than normal.

another key aspect of material efficiency is the recovery of waste: almost all waste created by the printing facility is
used as a raw material by other businesses. in 2014, all waste generated at the printing facility was recovered for
recycling or reuse, and no waste ended up at landfill sites.

harmful voc emissions (volatile organic compounds) from printing operations were kept very low in 2014. however,
emissions increased slightly from the previous year, amounting to 4,488 kg in 2014 (in 2013: 4,200 kg). the slight
growth resulted from more detailed reporting by raw material producers relating to potential raw material component
residues. the chemicals used for cleaning the printing machine have been voc-free for some time, and since 2012 the
company has also minimised the voc content of the dampening solution used in the printing process. alma media’s
printing facility in tampere was one of the first printing facilities internationally to begin using a dampening solution
that is almost entirely free of voc emissions.

development of environmentally sustainable operating methods
and purchasing
alma media can influence its environmental impact through its purchasing policy in particular. environmental
considerations are now particularly taken into account in newsprint purchases. paper manufacture has wide-ranging
impacts on climate change and resource depletion, as well as biodiversity. in 2014, 75 per cent of the newsprint used by
alma media contained recycled fibre. the share of recycled fibre in all newsprint pulp used by alma media was 38 per
cent. environmental issues are also a key factor in purchasing chemicals and printing plates.

in addition, alma media can efficiently decrease its ecological footprint by changing its own operating methods. over
the past five years, the company has implemented new videoconference systems and other tools to facilitate remote
work. this has reduced travelling and, consequently, the environmental footprint.

alma media units had a total of 23 installed videoconference systems in 2014. furthermore, the lync communication
tool was frequently used for alma media’s internal video conferences and telephone conferences. according to statistics,
600 internal meetings were arranged last year using the videoconference system or lync, which equate to
approximately 7,000 hours of meetings during the year. the actual figure was considerably higher, because not all
meetings were included in the statistics, such as smaller lync meetings with only two participants.

in recent years, alma media has also significantly reduced the number of pages printed. this, too, resulted from
changed operating methods: the number of printing devices in the different units was reduced from slightly under 500
printers to 140 devices currently. at the same time, alma media employees have increasingly switched to documents
provided in digital format only. therefore, the number of pages printed has decreased by 40 per cent to 3.2 million
pages per year currently.

the sustainable media corporate responsibility programme aims to increasingly integrate ecological considerations
into ict purchases. the environmental study indicated that ict equipment and infrastructure have significant
environmental impacts. careful analysis and mitigation of these impacts is of great importance as digital media
consumption increases.

the average carbon dioxide emissions of the group’s leased car fleet are also monitored on a regular basis. the target is
to reduce average emissions by eight per cent from 2013 to 2016. in 2014, the average co2 emissions of the group’s
motor vehicles were 135g of co2 equivalent per kilometre (2013: 141g).



increased awareness through open communication about
environmental responsibility
in 2014, the ratkaisun paikka (the leading cr event in finland) corporate responsibility event was arranged for the
third time, with alma media as the main media partner. alma media’s role in the event was to provide greater
exposure, arrange presenters and deliver a talk. the objective of alma media’s participation in the event was to promote
corporate responsibility thinking in finland. this goal was reached: the event, with some 700 visitors and highly
positive feedback, exceeded all expectations.

alma media is actively involved in industry-wide environmental initiatives, such as the shape study of the federation
of the finnish media industry and vtt technical research centre, which investigates media consumption from the
perspective of its environmental impacts. on the international stage, alma media promoted the handling of
environmental matters related to print and digital media by commissioning research activities and communicating
about them.

since 2012, alma media has participated in the city of helsinki climate partners network aimed at promoting co-
operation to reduce climate emissions and boost the competitiveness of the participating companies. in 2014, alma
media continued its active participation in the network by arranging an event with the climate partnership network in
january 2014.

business operations
in the sustainable media programme, responsible business operations refer to ethical choices in
operations, as well as responsibility as part of alma media’s products and services.
in 2014, the significance of privacy protection was highlighted as a key issue in business operations. alma media also
continued its work to develop responsible marketing and advertising, both in its own organisation and in the industry
as a whole.



code of conduct as a guideline for operations
the ethical principles that govern alma media’s operations are described in the code of conduct, which contains the
company’s key policies and principles for responsible management. alma media is a signatory of the un global
compact initiative, and its code of conduct is in line with the ten global compact principles. the code of conduct
describes how responsibility is reflected in the day-to-day activity of everyone at alma media. alma media’s annual
review 2014 also serves as the company’s global compact communication on progress report.



privacy protection developed as part of responsible thinking
the importance of reliability will grow as commerce moves to the online realm and fraud becomes increasingly
frequent. reliability is a common feature for alma media's various digital online services. the significance of privacy
protection has increased in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. regulation of the media
sector is also expected to increase due to the currently pending eu regulation on privacy protection.

alma media group is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its services, and it strives to provide a safe and
secure user experience to all visitors to its online services. the use of customer registers specific to particular
newspapers and services is governed by, among other regulations, the personal data act and the data protection act.
transparency is a high priority in operations: the group’s privacy protection process is described in detail on the
privacy protection page. in 2013, alma media carried out a review of privacy protection, and in 2014 it developed
certain key areas identified during the course of that review.



demand for sustainably produced media space
alma media’s advertisers are increasingly interested in how alma media supports their sustainable development
measures or messages through its own responsibility. alma media has taken an active approach to responsibility in
advertising. in 2013, it collaborated with an international media company to study the environmental effects of the
advertising value chain as a whole. particular focus was placed on new ways of integrating corporate responsibility into
media sales. in 2014, this theme was developed further in internal dialogue within alma media. the work continues in
2015 with the assessment of the environmental impacts of the advertisement value chain.

the goal was to not only provide new information on the ecological footprint of advertising, but also to evoke discussion
on responsible business and advertising. in 2014, alma media arranged a seminar on the development of responsible
marketing and business for its largest advertiser and media agency customers and evoked active discussion on the
subject on various forums. the main theme in responsible advertising in 2013–2014 was goodvertising, which refers to
advertising and business operations that contain messages on sustainable development. goodvertising is aimed at
promoting sustainable development via the brainprint of advertising.



responsibility is an integral part of product and service
development
strengthening the sustainable media perspective is a key consideration in business development and the creation of
new business. journalism in itself already supports this objective, but there are also interesting perspectives in the
context of the development of digital services. the sustainable media perspective is also part of the monitoring of the
operating environment, which is a key aspect of research and development.

alma media’s digital online services in finland and elsewhere in europe have already integrated responsibility into
their services. one example of this is the monster.fi guide designed to support young people in seeking employment.
lmc, a recruitment service provider under alma career oy, has a dedicated recruitment service for people who are
offering and searching for volunteer work opportunities. monster was also active in promoting youth employment
through the vamos and responsible summer job projects in 2014. in december 2014, monster challenged employers
and job seekers to join a campaign to promote employment of disabled young people. the campaign supported the
vamlas foundation, an organisation for children and youth with disabilities. the foundation will use the support to
arrange events in which employers have the opportunity to meet disabled and partially fit-for-work young people
looking for jobs.



reliable and safe services are the cornerstone of our operations
at the moment, there are ongoing projects in the eu regarding a reform in information security and privacy protection
regulations. the topic is current as, for instance, e-commerce is growing quickly and the number of online scam and
abuse attempts is increasing steadily. therefore, privacy protection and safe online services are becoming more and
more important.

alma media, too, works continuously in order to ensure safe and reliable services for its users, customers and partners.
customer data is protected through various measures. the server rooms for all of alma media’s services and related
connections and other systems have been protected against physical and digital attacks. etuovi.com, vuokraovi.com
and autotalli.com, for instance, had nearly 100% availability in 2014*. on the other hand, we take care of the
information security of our services with continuous monitoring and by keeping information security and software
updates up-to-date.

as a group, alma media has also committed to protect the privacy of the users of its services. for instance, privacy
protection legislation and alma media’s own information security policy, which was updated in 2014 to respond to the
current operational methods and environment, guide the use of all of our newspaper and service-specific registers.
alma media also aims to promote the development of the self-regulation of the industry itself. the group participates
as a publisher in the self-regulation programme of iab finland, an organisation promoting digital advertising. the
programme develops the industry’s internal rules regarding the targeting of online advertising based on consumers’
browser behaviour.

transparency is a high priority in alma media’s operations. the group’s privacy protection process is described in detail
on the privacy protection site.

*service availability expresses the percentage of time a service is available to customers. service availability is
influenced by factors such as technical problems and system downtime due to maintenance operations.

awards and recognition in 2014
alma media received several awards and recognition in 2014. raahen seutu was chosen as the best local newspaper in
2014 in its category in a local newspaper competition organised by the finnish newspapers association, with nokian
uutiset finishing third in the same category. nokian uutiset also won the award for best online service in the category.

magazines and online services produced by alma media’s content agency, alma 360, again won awards in 2014 in folio
magazine’s eddie&ozzie magazine competition. yrittäjä magazine and the yhteishyvä live online service designed and
produced by alma 360 won first prizes in their respective categories. ekonomilehti.fi, etiketti and alma media’s own
annual publication living information also received an honorable mention at the gala. yhteishyvä has also received
other recognition in recent times, as the magazine was rated the most valued family and general-interest magazine by
finns in the brändien arvostus 2014 (“brand valuation 2014”) survey.

alma media’s printing and distribution company alma manu oy was awarded an extension of its membership in the
wan-ifran color quality club for the period 2014–2016. the tampere printing press was awarded an extension of its
membership based on the satakunnan kansa newspaper. previous memberships were achieved with aamulehti (2012)
and kauppalehti (2010). membership of the wan-ifra quality club is the internationally most prestigious
acknowledgment of a newspaper printer's production quality.

alma media’s corporate responsibility efforts were recognised in slovakia when via bona awards selected the alma
media’s profesia.sk’s social responsibility online service and development project focusing on supporting slovakian
schools and high-quality recruitment of teachers as the best csr project in 2014.

a glance at 2015
in 2015, alma media will continue on the path outlined by its four strategic themes and continue to
grow its digital business further. the improvement in the company’s financial position in 2014 opens
up opportunities for expediting growth through targeted acquisitions.
since 2008, alma media has implemented a significant structural transformation that has led to the digital business
growing to account for a third of revenue. at the same time, the company has become more international by acquiring
recruitment businesses in eastern central europe. the profitability of the new businesses is at an excellent level. at the
same time, the domestic operating environment is likely to remain difficult.



market outlook
in the turn of the year 2014–2015, there are hardly any signs of the economy turning to sustainable growth, even in the
long term in alma media's main market, finland. the long-term outlook is weakened by structural problems in the
economy and a decline in productivity.

the predicted extended period of slow growth is likely to affect consumer demand and investments in marketing
communications in finland.

in eastern central european countries, economic growth is expected to continue in the coming years. brisk economic
activity supports the growth and profitability of the recruitment business.

digitisation has resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of content and services available to consumers, while
also permanently changing consumers’ media behaviour. the fragmentation of media consumption is continuing with
regard to media, services, the use of time, and devices. competition for content and service provision is growing and
loyalty to media brands is diminishing.

the rapid growth in the use of smartphones and tablets will continue, promoting growth in the mobile consumption of
media content. online video consumption will continue to see strong growth.

the consumer threshold for paying for digital content will remain high. paid services must provide clear added value to
the consumer compared to free and advertising-funded content.

in marketing, new forms of advertising, such as content marketing and native advertising, are growing in significance
by complementing the services provided to consumers. in the digital advertising market, strong growth trends include
the development of programmatic buying and self-service solutions, as well as mobile and video advertising. the role of
behavioural data and analytics in business development will grow with regard to both content and advertising.



strategic themes
in 2015, alma media will continue to implement its strategy under four themes - while following our values.

- multichannel content
- marketing solutions
- digital services
- resources and expertise




annual review 2014                                          47                                   alma media corporation

a major goal announced by alma media in late 2013 is to increase the share of digital revenue to 50% by 2020. in 2014,
the share of digital revenue was 32 per cent. the goal will be achieved provided that the long-term financial target of 15
per cent annual growth in digital revenue is realised.

alma media is also examining opportunities to implement its strategy through acquisitions. the acquisition
opportunities being examined are related particularly to growing the recruitment business in europe, digital business
services in finland, and various digital consumer services in finland.



dividend proposal
alma media’s long-term financial targets take into account the investments required for growth, repayment of debt
taken to support growth, and the distribution of profit to shareholders.

on 31 december 2014, the group’s parent company had distributable funds totalling eur 179,932,379 (23,905,611). no
essential changes in the company’s financial standing have taken place after the end of the financial year. alma media’s
board of directors proposes to the annual general meeting that a capital repayment of eur 0.12 (2013: eur 0.10) per
share be paid from the reserve for invested non-restricted equity for the financial year 2014. based on the number of
shares on the closing date 31 december 2014, the capital repayment totals eur 9,058,422 (2013: eur 7,548,685).



outlook for 2015
low interest rates, a weaker euro and lower oil price improve the chances for growth in the long run. however, in 2015,
economic growth is still expected to remain weak in europe and, in particular, in finland. the weak overall economic
growth has an impact on advertising volume, which is not expected to increase in finland in 2015.

in the first half of 2015, alma media expects its revenue and operating profit excluding non-recurring items to decrease
from the 2014 level. the revenue for the first half of 2014 was meur 148.4, and operating profit excluding non-
recurring items meur 8.8.
