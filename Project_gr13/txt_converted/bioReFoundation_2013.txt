    editorial
    i believe it is beyond doubt that all of us wish to live in a world in which all human beings are
    capable of leading independent and good lives in social happiness. a world with an economy
    that develops positively without consuming more resources than the planet produces spon-
    taneously. the question is: “what is our planet going to look like by 2050?” by then the
    world’s population will have reached the nine-billion threshold; consumption in china, india,
    brazil and eastern europe will dramatically increase; demand for raw materials will be very high
    and the battle for resources fierce; farming surfaces will have become smaller; rationalisation
    of labour will have increased further; and there will be fewer and fewer people to perform
    ever more work. surely ’business as usual’ is no option if we want to get closer to realizing our
    dreams! sustainability has the potential of becoming a growth engine for the economy without
    us continuing to exploit the planet. new technologies, lifestyle changes, new management of
    resources, expansion of renewable resources, recycling schemes and sustainable farming will
    be important drivers in the process.

    thus organic farming is very significant today, and will be in the future. it makes important
    contributions to mankind, the environment and economic development. unfortunately our
    business in india has shown that co-existence of gmos and organic farming is not possible
    in agriculture, which is something that gmo-friendly circles keep denying. in 2013 it was
    impossible for us to harvest pure organic cotton in india. the share of gmo cotton in india
    is no less than around 95% today! there are hardly any gmo-free seeds available from fresh
    stocks. this is a tremendous challenge that has caused new requirements along the entire
    process of management. we have been forced to restructure our leadership organisation in
    india, appointing new people and defining new processes, responsibilities and priorities. the
    highest degree of priority must now be given to short-term supply of seeds as well as research
    of new seeds of our own. another main priority is to push for more ownership by farmer as
    they are the foundation of organic farming and the social community. fortunately we are
    also doing business in tanzania where we are expecting a large crop owing to good weather
    conditions. our social projects in the fields of health, education and training, water extraction
    and improvement of livelihoods are doing very well in both india and tanzania. the difficulties
    mentioned above are only making us stronger and more alert in our continued efforts to create
    a future worth living in for the generations following us on this unique planet. i would like to
    cordially thank everyone supporting us on this fascinating journey.

    organic
    participation
    of farmers
    farmer training on ecological farming methods are key to improving farming results. training
    on sustainable farming practices are conducted in india and tanzania, reaching all farmers invol-
    ved with biore organic cotton projects. focusing on participatory technology development &
    experimental learning methodology, the farmer trainings are integrating community participa-
    tion at its core, be it on farmer field schools or at biore training centers in india or tanzania.
    registered farmers with biore are organised in producer representative body prb. the farmer
    representation system has proven to be a successful initiative. there are frequent meetings of
    producer representatives where they share their views with management. farmers are elected
    from the prb and form part of the board of the biore organizations.


    sustainable farming
    practices for future
    generations
    at biore in india extensive research activities are being carried out under the guidance of the
    research institute of organic agriculture (fibl), switzerland. since 2007, a long-term sys-
    tems comparison trial and on-farm validation of its findings (since 2009) have been conducted.
    the objectives are to (i) gather information about the agronomic and economic performance of
    different agricultural production systems under organic and conventional management in sub-
    tropical regions, besides investigating other aspects such as soil fertility development and pest
    and diseases dynamics, and (ii) to develop locally adapted technologies for specific constraints in
    local organic production systems. the first publication from the trial is expected to be published
    in 2013. this study assessed agronomic and economic data from four crop rotations compri-
    sing cotton-soybean-wheat under biodynamic, organic and conventional management between
    2007 and 2010, including one conventional system with and one without transgenic bt cotton.
    results showed slightly lower yields in organic compared to conventional systems, but similar
    gross margins in all systems due to lower production costs of organic systems. these results sug-
    gest that organic farming is a promising alternative to conventional farming in cotton-based far-
    ming systems in central india.




    cotton seed
    research
    new components in research are introduced, such as the large cotton cultivar evaluation
    project in collaboration with fibl and the university of agricultural sciences, dharward.
    the importance of this cotton seed research is high, because genetically modified (gm)
    cotton hybrids are dominating the indian market. last year, more than 50 varieties were
    evaluated in the cotton cultivar evaluation project, with the aim to select the best non-gm
    cultivars suitable for organic farmers’ conditions which are still in line with quality standards
    of the industry. finding the best cultivars which can be multiplied by farmers themselves is
    an important factor to sustainability. in early 2013, biore and fibl organized a workshop
    on breeding and supply of non-gm cotton seed at the biore training center. the objective
    of the workshop was to exchange on present breeding and propagation activities, and to dis-
    cuss future perspectives. numerous leading cotton scientists and breeders as well as other
    related organizations participated in the workshop.

    capital
    creation
    livelihood project on
    organic sericulture
    successful pilot project on organic sericulture was promoted on indian demo farm and with 4 or-
    ganic farmers growing mulberry plants on 1 acre each. the basis of the project is that a self-help
    group of farmers manages the organic sericulture project on self-sustained basis, creating and
    diversifying income to farmer families and producing cocoons and silk in collaboration with the
    state silk federation of central india. 20 farmers and the project team of biore association visi-
    ted their farm to get exposed to farmers who are involved in mulberry cultivation and cocoon rea-
    ring since many years. the biore organic sericulture project will expand to 25 farmers in 2013.



    income generating activities
    for women groups
    in tanzania three women groups follow livelihood activities. two women groups (bulyashi 16
    ladies and mwamishali 12 ladies) are trained to sew different garments such as school uni-
    forms like shirts and shorts, trousers for boys, skirts and dresses for girls and also hand bags
    for women. they also stitch and repair cotton bags for biore. like this, the women earn some
    income for themselves and their families. a third group was initiated last year (minyanda 9
    ladies) and stitching machines were handed over. a workshop was constructed in minyanda
    village for the ladies to gather, stitch, sell products, and also as a platform for the community
    meetings.



    aavran handloom society
    t his project started as livelihood initiative with 4 self-help groups in 2007. today aavran
    handlooms is a fully registered organisation; it is managed by hand spinners, weavers and
    its founding members from the initiating youth club. organic cotton from biore india ltd
    is delivered to women groups who produce the hand spun yarn with the help of ambar
    charkhas (hand spinning machines) at their home. the hand spun yarn is transported to the
    aavran handloom workshop where processes from winding to finished products are being
    carried out. 24 handlooms are available. aavran has received handloom mark certification
    from the state. it is working with several buyers which include coop naturaline, remei ag,
    panoco trading co. ltd. japan, and others.

           social infra
           education, vocational
           skills and community
           development in one concept
           more than 1’050 children enjoy their right to education in 22 biore animation schools. ani-
           mation is the concept to bring life into an inactive issue of a community. this project is to bring
           life into education of rural communities, where children previously were deprived of education.
           parents are active community members, the carriers of the schools. vocations are part of the
           curriculum for children. for example, all animation schools with classes above 4th grade are
           introduced to basics of hand spinning. 3 new big school campuses for grade 1 to 10 are planned.
           each of them consists of basic education with an approved graduation, locally relevant vocatio-
           nal skills development (textile, organic farming, dairy production, and mechanic) and communi-
           ty development. children from animation schools will continue secondary school in the new
           biore school campus. the land of the first school campus is diverted and registered, and the
           layout with organic farm at the center of the school is finalized.

    water projects
    last year the community in meatu tanzania formed water user groups and was involved in
    construction of 13 water wells, reaching total of 60 wells since the start of the water pro-
    ject. these wells supply safe drinking water to 19’200 people. also the construction of tanks
    for rain water harvesting at primary schools and dispensaries are a practical and safe way to
    provide drinking water to people, especially during dry periods where usually water sources
    are long distances from schools. 3’523 school children and many patients at dispensaries
    benefited from 10 new tanks constructed in the last year, in total there are 20 tanks now. the
    community and school committee support the construction with labour and local material.



    artemisia, malaria project
    the 2nd year of planting artemisia on the demo farm of biore in tanzania is completed, to
    test performance and content of the plant for preventive or curative purpose against malaria.
    an external survey was conducted on integrated vector management ivm together with the
    international centre of insect physiology and ecology (icipe).the objective of the survey was
    to evaluate the applicability of ivm within the operational area of biore tanzania. the survey
    proposes various preventive activities to reduce breeding sites of malaria transmitting mosqui-
    toes, and it revealed numerous possibilities of combining organic farming and malaria control in
    meatu tanzania.
