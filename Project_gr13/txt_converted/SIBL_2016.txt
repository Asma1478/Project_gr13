                          the broad objective of sibl is somewhat different          economic growth for 2015 was projected 3.1 percent,
                          from other islamic and contemporary banks. the             slightly lower than the actual 3.4 percent growth in
social islami bank ltd.




                          operation of sibl has been defined under a unique          2014 and in 2016, it is expected to increase to 3.6
                          theme of three-sector banking model: (i) formal            percent in light of the modest recovery in advanced
                          sector, commensurate with islamic commercial               economies and higher growth prospects for emerging
                          banking using modern technology; (ii) non-formal           markets and developing economies. in the advanced
                          sector, based on a concept of empowering family            economies, growth was expected to 2.0 percent
                          through micro credit & micro enterprise program;           in 2015 and 2.2 percent in 2016. however, growth

                          society. our vision is to minimize the poverty level       to 4.5 percent in 2016. growth in china is expected
                          in bangladesh. in this regard, the inherent concept        to slow to 6.3 percent in 2016 and 6.0 percent
                          and credence of “working together for a caring             in 2017. india and the rest of emerging asia are
                          society” is always held high. to carry forward this        generally projected to continue growing at a robust
                          commitment, the employees of sibl are imbued with          pace, although with some countries facing strong
                          the highest degree of enthusiasm, zeal and vigor to        headwinds from china’s economic rebalancing and

                             management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the group and also separate financial
                             statements of the bank that give a true and fair view in accordance with bangladesh financial reporting standards as explained
                             in note 2 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
                             statements of the group and also separate financial statements of the bank that are free from material misstatement, whether due
                             to fraud or error. the bank companies act, 1991 and the bangladesh bank regulations require the management to ensure effective
                             internal audit, internal control and risk management functions of the bank. the management is also required to make a self-
                             assessment on the effectiveness of anti-fraud internal controls and report to bangladesh bank on instances of fraud and forgeries.

                             auditor’s responsibility
                             our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements of the group and the separate financial
                             statements of the bank based on our audit. we conducted our audit in accordance with bangladesh standards on auditing.
                             those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
                             about whether the consolidated financial statements of the group and separate financial statements of the bank are free from
                             material misstatement.

                             an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
                             financial statements of the group and separate financial statements of the bank. the procedures selected depend on the
                             auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
                             of the group and separate financial statements of the bank, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments,
                             we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements of the group and separate
                             financial statements of the bank that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
                             circumstances. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness
                             of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
                             statements of the group and also separate financial statements of the bank.

                             we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

       the financial statements, namely, balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash flow statements, statement of changes
       in equity, statement of liquidity analysis and relevant notes to the financial statements and disclosures thereto, of the bank
       are prepared under historical cost convention on a going concern basis. management of the bank has made an estimation
       that there are no possibility to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

2.1.1 statement of compliance

       the financial statements of the bank have been prepared in accordance with bangladesh financial reporting standards
       (bfrs), and the requirements of bank companies act 1991(as ammended upto year 2014), brpd circular no: 15 dated
       09.11.2009 along with other rules and regulations issued by bangladesh bank, the companies act 1994, the securities
       and exchange rules 1987. in case any requirement of the bank companies act 1991, and provisions and circulars issued
       by bangladesh bank differ with those of bfrs, the requirement of the bank companies act 1991, and provisions and
       circulars issued by bangladesh bank shall prevail. material and partial departures from the requirements of bfrs as well
       as the compliance with the bangladesh bank circulars are as follows:

i)     investment in shares and securities

       the bank investment in different securities has been valued on 31.12.2015 as under:

       quoted bond & shares                         at cost or market value whichever is lower
       unquoted shares                              at cost
       bangladesh govt. islamic bond                at cost
       cdbl share & preference share                at cost

       all investment in securities are initially recognized at cost, including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
       premiums are amortised and discounts are accredited.

       as per brpd circular no. 15 (09 november 2009), investments in quoted shares and unquoted shares are revalued at
       the year end at market price and as per book value of last audited balance sheet respectively. provision should be made
       for any loss arising from diminution in value of investment. as such the company measures and recognizes investment in
       quoted and unquoted shares at cost if the year–end market value (for quoted shares) and book value (for unquoted shares)
       are higher than the cost. however as per requirements of bangladesh accounting standard (bas)- 39, investment in
       shares falls either under “at fair value through profit and loss account” or under “available for sale” where any change
       in the fair value at the year-end is taken to profit and loss account or revaluation reserve respectively. sibl recognises its
       ‘investment in shares and securities’ as per bas-39 and accounted for the required profit/(loss) after adjustment of the
       value of shares and securities through profit and loss account.

       derivatives

       typical examples of derivatives are futures and forward, swap and option contracts. as a shariah based islami bank, sibl
       can not take part in issuing or purchasing any derivatives.

ii)    revaluation gains/losses on government securities

       sibl is a bank running on islamic shariah principle. hence, we do not participate in buying interest bearing government securities.
                                                                                                                                                 financial statements



iii)   investments and provisions

       as per bas-39 impairmrnt assessment should be done by considering whether any objective evidence of impairment exists
       for financial assets that are individually significant. for financial assets thet are not individually significant, the assessment
       can be performed on an individual or collective (portfolio) basis.

       however, provision for classified and unclassified investment is made on the basis of year end review by the management
       and of instructions contained in bangladesh bank bcd circular no.34 dated 16 november 1989, bcd circular no.20 (27
       december 1994), bcd circular no. 12 (04 september 1995), brpd circular no. 16 (06 december 1998), brpd circular
       no. 9 (14 may 2001), brpd circular letter no. 10 (20 august 2005), brpd circular letter no. 10 (18 september 2007),

       2012), brpd circular no:19 (27 december 2012), and brpd circular no: 05 (29 may 2013) at the following rates:

                                                                                                                                             245

                                    general provision on special mention account                                                        5%
                                    specific provision on substandard investment                                                       20%

                                    specific provision on bad / loss investment                                                        100%

                                    as per brpd circular no: 14 (23 september 2012), brpd circular no: 19 (27 december 2012), and brpd circular no: 05
                                    (29 may 2013) a general provision at 0.25% to 5% under different categories of unclassified investments (good/standard
                                    investments) has to be maintained regardless of objective evidence of impairment.

                                    as per same circulars mentioned above sibl has to maintain provision @ 20%, 50% and 100% for investments classified
                                    as sub-standard, doubtful and bad & loss category respectively depending on the duration of overdue.

                                    as per brpd circular no. 10 (18 september 2007) and brpd circular no: 14 (23 september 2012), a general provision at
                                    1% is required to be provided for all off-balance sheet risk exposures.

                                    however, such general provision on general investment & off-balance sheet exposures and specific provisions on classified
                                    investments cannot satisfy the conditions of provision as per bangladesh accounting standard (bas)-39.

                             iv)    recognition of profit in suspense

                                    profit / rent / compensation suspense account and doubtful income

                                    profit / rent / compensation accrued on classified investments are suspended and accounted for as per brpd circular
                                    no: 15 (09 november 2009) issued by the bangladesh bank. moreover, incomes that are irregular (doubtful) as per shariah
                                    are also not included in the distributable income of the bank.

                                    income on unclassified overdue investment of murabaha and bai-muazzal is charged under compensation account instead
                                    of showing as income of the bank.

                                    interest received from nostro accounts are not credited to the income as per islamic shariah.

                             v)     other comprehensive income

                                    as per bas-1 (presentation of financial statements), other comprehnsive income (oci) or components of oci, as a part
                                    of financial statements are to be included in a single other comprehensive income statement.

                                    however, as per brpd circular no. 15 (09 november 2009), there are no statement of oci and we follow the template for
                                    reporting as per the circular. if there is any component of oci, it is shown in statement of changes in equity.

                             vi)    financial instruments-presentation and disclosure
financial statements




                                    financial instruments-presentation and disclosures are made in several cases as per guidelines and instructions of
                                    bangladesh bank in particular and respective cases. requirements of bas-32 and bfrs-7 can not be followed due to the
                                    presentation and disclosure obligations of bangladesh bank.

                             vii)   financial guarantees

                                    financial guarantees such as letter of credit, letter of guarantee etc. are treated as off-balance sheet items as per relevant
                                    bangladesh bank circular, brpd 15 (09 november 2009) whereas as per bas 39, these should be treated as ‘other
                                    liability’. no liability is recognised for the guarantee except the cash margin.




                    246

        sibl accounts for the financial guarantees as per brpd 15 (09 november 2009) and liability for financial guarantees are
        not recognised initially at their fair value and the fair value amortisation of the same liability is not done either as per bas
        39. so that the financial guarantees are not also carried at the higher of this amortised amount and the present value of any
        expected payment when a payment under the guarantee has become probable.




                                                                                                                                            annual report 2015
viii)   cash and cash equivalent

        as per brpd circular no 15 (09 november 2009), cash and cash equivalents include notes and coins in hand, balances
        lying with atm, unrestricted balances held with bangladesh bank and its agent bank, balance with other banks and
        financial institutions, placement with banks and other financial institutions.

        as per bas 7, cash and cash and cash equivalents should be reported as cash item and reconciliation of the amounts of
        the items in its cash flow statement should be presented also. however, presentation and reconciliation is done in line with
        brpd circular 15 and bas 7.

ix)     non-banking asset

        in accordance with brpd 15, non-banking asset should be presented in the face of balance sheet if there is any. but, no
        bfrs indicates for accounting of non-banking assets. however, there is no non-banking assets of sibl.

x)      cash flow statement

        bangladesh accounting standard (bas)-7 “ cash flow statement” requires sibl to prepare cash flow statement under
        direct method. however, cash flow statement has been prepared under a adopted method of direct and indirect in
        accordance with the brpd circular no. 15, (09 november 2009) issued by the banking regulation and policy department
        of bangladesh bank.

xi)     balance with bangladesh bank (cash reserve requirement, crr)

        bas 7 requires balance with bangladesh bank to be treated as other assets. however, as per brpd circular 15, sibl
        treats balance with bangladesh bank as cash and cash equivalent though the amount is restricted for crr purpose and
        can not be used in our day to day operation requirement.

xii)    presentation of intangible asset

        as per bas 38, intangible assets are accounted for and amortized. related necessary disclosures for the intangible asset;
        i.e computer software is given in note 8.1.

        there is no restriction or recommendation for accounting for the intangible assets as per any bangladesh bank circular.

xiii) off-balance sheet items

        contingent liabilities

        any possible obligation that arises form past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence
        or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the bank; or

        any present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

        * it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
        * the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
                                                                                                                                               financial statements



        contingent liabilities are not recognised but disclosed in the financial statements unless the possibility of an outflow
        of resources embodying economic benefits is reliably estimated. contingent assets are not recognised in the financial
        statements as this may results in the recognition of income which may never be realised. however, the amount of cash
        margin is recognised as liability.

        as per brpd circular 15, contingent liabilities are recognised as off balance sheet items in absence of any recommendation
        in bfrs.

xiv) investments net off provisions

        investments are presented at its actual value without netting off as per brpd circular 15 though it is to be presented at net
        off value as per related bfrs.

                                                       to the shareholders of sibl securities limited
   social islami bank ltd.




                             we have audited the accompanying financial statements of sibl securities limited, which comprises the statement of financial
                             position as of 31 december, 2015 and the related statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
                             statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

                             management ‘s responsibility for the financial statements
                             management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with bangladesh
                             accounting standards (bass) and bangladesh financial reporting standards (bfrss), the companies act, 1994, the securities
                             of exchange rules, 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations. the responsibility includes designing, implementing and
                             maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material
                             misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
                             estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

                             auditors’ responsibility
                             our responsibility is to express an independent opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our
                             audit in accordance with bangladesh standards on auditing (bsa). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
                             to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

                             an audit involves from performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
                             statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
                             misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud and error. in making those risk assessments, we consider internal
                             control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
                             are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
                             control. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the management, as
                             well as evaluating the overall financial statements presentation. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
                             and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

                             opinion
                             in our opinion, the financial statements, prepared in accordance with bangladesh accounting standards (bass) and bangladesh
                             financial reporting standards (bfrss), give a true and fair view of the state of company’s affairs as of 31 december, 2015 and of
                             the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended and comply with the companies act, 1994, he securities
                             of exchange rules, 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations.

                             further to our opinion in the above paragraph, we state that:
                             a)   we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the
                                  purpose of our audit and made due verification thereof;
                             b)   in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by sibl securities limited, so far as it appeared
                                  from our examination of those books;

sibl investment ltd.
(a wholly owned subsidiary of sibl)
for the year ended 31 december 2015

                                                                     auditors’ report
                                                      to the shareholders of sibl investment limited
   social islami bank ltd.




                             we have audited the accompanying financial statements of sibl investment limited, which comprises the statement of financial
                             position as of 31 december, 2015 and the related statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and
                             statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.

                             management’s responsibility for the financial statements
                             management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with bangladesh
                             accounting standards (bass) and bangladesh financial reporting standards (bfrss), the companies act, 1994, the securities
                             & exchange rules, 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations. the responsibility includes designing, implementing and
                             maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material
                             misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
                             estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

                             auditors’ responsibility
                             our responsibility is to express an independent opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our
                             audit in accordance with bangladesh standards on auditing (bsa). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
                             to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

                             an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
                             the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
                             the financial statements, whether due to fraud and error. in making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant
                             to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
                             the circumstances, but not for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. an audit
                             also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating
                             the overall financial statements presentation. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate
                             to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

                             opinion
                             in our opinion, the financial statements, prepared in accordance with bangladesh accounting standards (bass) and bangladesh
                             financial reporting standards (bfrss), give a true and fair view of the state of company’s affairs as of 31 december, 2015 and of
                             the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year than ended and comply with the companies act, 1994 the securities
                             & exchange rules, 1987 and other applicable laws and regulations.

                             further to our opinion in the above paragraph, we state that:
                             a) we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the
                                 purpose of our audit and made due verification thereof;
                             b)   in our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by sibl investment limited, so far as it
                                  appeared from our examination of those books;
                             c)   the company’s statement of financial position and statement of comprehensive income dealt with by the report are in
                                  agreement with the books of account; and
                             d)   the expenditure incurred was for the purposes of the company’s business.
