    the group’s manufacturing is not very energy-intensive but
energy consumption is an environmental aspect measured by
the group. the majority of the energy is consumed in the form of
electricity, natural gas and district heat. fuel oil is used in some
units for reserve and additional energy. in 2012, the group’s
total energy consumption was 70 tj (68 tj). the majority of this
is electricity. this amount does not include the fuels used in
transportation and vehicles.
