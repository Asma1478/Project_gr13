annual report

                                                                         we believe that cba has an

                                                                         to set the benchmark for

in fact, we care so deeply about making a positive impact – not just in the way our beers taste but in the way we brew
them – that every year we commit to sharing our sustainability goals and progress.

for our 3rd annual sustainability report, we’ve outlined some of our biggest highlights and achievements over the last
year (it was a busy one!), as well as identified some top priorities for 2016 because there’s always room to improve.

in 2015, we set out to continue building on our sustainability track record, which includes keeping our portland water
usage well below industry average, increasing renewable energy usage, and diverting more than 98% of our waste from
landfills through innovative recycling programs. last year, we also increased our investment in our local communities
with a new program designed to encourage our employees to get involved and support the local causes that matter most
to them.

each of our breweries in hawaii, new hampshire, oregon, and washington contributes to our overall sustainability
program in unique ways that align with their local communities and environments – from our widmer brothers brewery
in portland partnering with oregon wild to preserve our natural water ways, to our kona brewery in kailua-kona setting
out to build hawaii’s first craft brewery with a resource recovery center.

we hope you enjoy our latest annual sustainability report. please reach out to us if you have any questions or would like
to learn more.
