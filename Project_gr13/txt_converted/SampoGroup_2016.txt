     case: why if – the movie
     to reinforce customer focus, if p&c decided to bring the theme closer to the personnel. even though
     some employees do not talk directly to customers, all employees should be immersed in a company
     culture that emphasizes the customer.

     the idea of the movie was to give a better understanding of why if p&c is here: to ensure that
     customers are correctly insured and to help them when something happens.

     to illustrate if p&c’s purpose, the people behind insurances and their stories were brought to the
     limelight.

     the feedback from employees was very positive, making people feel pride of working at if p&c. the film
     is a powerful illustration of how important a role the company plays in customers’ lives, and in the
     society as a whole.

case: ml plus 58
mandatum life holds its experienced employees and their skills and competences in high regard. to
highlight this, we set up the ml plus 58 group in early 2015. it is intended for all employees who have
turned 58.

ml plus 58 focuses on three areas: fitness (guidance and instruction in maintaining one’s physical
condition); wisdom (skills development and sharing); and good feeling (catering for enjoyment in
work, as well as motivation and wellness).

the annual development discussions include ‘senior talks’ that address issues such as flexibilities at
work, retirement, the sharing of skills and knowledge, wellness-at-work and working ability. the
activities are carried out in collaboration with the ml seniors group, the hr department, mehiläinen
medical centre and varma insurance company.

participants have been able to influence the program and propose ideas. for example, the participants
have received social media trainings and retirement info. it’s ultimately a win-win: the young learn from
the more experienced employees who in turn learn new skills from the young.

the changes in the fair value reserve are disclosed in the statement of changes in equity. other income and expenses comprise
rental income, maintenance expenses and depreciation of investment property. all the income and expenses arising from
investments are included in net income from investments. gains/losses include realised gains/losses on sales, unrealised and
realised changes in fair values and exchange differences. unrealised fair value changes for financial assets available-for-sale are
recorded in other comprehensive income and presented in the fair value reserve in equity. the effect of discounting annuities in
p&c insurance is disclosed separately. the provision for annuities is calculated in accordance with actuarial principles taking
anticipated inflation and mortality into consideration, and discounted to take the anticipated future return on investments into
account. to cover the costs for upward adjustment of annuity provisions required for the gradual reversal of such discounting, an
anticipated return on investments is added to annuity results.

the provision for annuities is valued in accordance with normal actuarial principles taking anticipated inflation and mortality into
consideration, and discounted to take the anticipated future investment return into account. to cover costs for the costs for the
upward adjustment of annuity provisions required for the gradual reversal of such discounting, an anticipated return is added to
the annuity results. provisions for incurred but not reported losses pertaining to annuities in finland are discounted. the
provisions in 2015 amounted to eurm 261 (257). the non-discounted value was eurm 351 (388). the exchange effect on the
discounted provisions was a decrease of eurm 6. the real increase was eurm 8, explained by the decrease in the discount rate
from 2.0 percent to 1.5 percent.

fair values for the group's investment property are entirely determined by the group based on the market evidence. the
determination and hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities at fair value is disclosed in note 17. based on the principles of this
determination, the investment property falls under level 2.


the premises in investment property for different segments are leased on market-based, irrevocable contracts. the lengths of
the contracts vary from those for the time being to those for several years.

 esting
tes                 or impairment
    ting goodwill ffor

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets. no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests.


for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units, to
which goodwill has been allocated, on the basis of value in use. sampo has defined these cash-generating units as if group and
mandatum life.


the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model. the model is based on sampo’s
management’s best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumes,interest rates, margins,
capital structure and income and cost development. the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long-
term development of insurance liabilities, affecting e.g. the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount. that is
why the forecast period is longer for mandatum life, 10 years. the derived cash flows were discounted at the pre-tax rates of the
weighted average cost of capital which for if was 7.8% and for mandatum life 8.4%. these are somewhat lower than last year due
to the decrease in interest rates.


forecasts for if, approved by the management, cover years 2015 – 2016. the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated
using a 2% growth rate. a 2% growth rate for years beyond 2024 has been used for the for mandatum life as well, as it is believed
to be close to the anticipated inflation.


in mandatum life, the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 780. with the calculation method used,
e.g. an increase of about 4.7% in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable amount of
the entity would equal its carrying amount.


as for the if group, the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount.

in the table above are presented fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities. the detailed measurement
bases of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in group accounting policies.


the fair value of investment securities is assessed using quoted prices in active markets. if published price quotations are not
available, the fair value is assessed using discounting method. values for the discount rates are taken from the market’s yield
curve.


the fair value of the derivative instruments is assessed using quoted market prices in active markets, discounting method or
option pricing models.


the fair value of loans and other financial instruments which have no quoted price in active markets is based on discounted cash
flows, using quoted market rates. the market’s yield curve is adjusted by other components of the instrument, e.g. by credit risk.


the fair value for short-term non-interest-bearing receivables and payables is their carrying amount.


disclosed fair values are "clean" fair values, i.e. less interest accruals.




                                                                    220

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo group's financial assets are valued at fair value. the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs, where available. for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques. the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three
hierarchy levels in the notes, depending on e.g. if the market for the instrument is active, or if the inputs used in the valuation
technique are observable.

on level 1, the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

on level 2, inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques.

on level 3, the measurement is based on other inputs rather than observable market data.

the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilites to changes in exchange rates is assessed on business area level due to differenct
base currencies. in p&c insurance, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against sek would result in an
increase recognised in profit/loss of eurm 9 (30) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 3 (13). in life
insurance, 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against eur would result in an increase recognised in profit/
loss of eurm 23 (35) and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 79 (94). in holding, 10 percentage point
depreciation of all other currencies against eur would have no impact in profit/loss, but a decrease recognised in equity of
eurm 68 (71).


the sensitivity analysis of the group's fair values of financial assets and liabilities in differenct market risk scenarios is presented
below. the effects represent the instantaneous effects of a one-off change in the underlying market variable on the fair values on
31 dec. 2015.


the sensitivity analysis includes the effects of derivative positions. all sensitivities are calculated before taxes.


the debt issued by sampo plc is not included.

the value of financial assets regarding the debt security instruments has been tested by assuming a rise of 1 per cent unit in
interest rate level in all maturities. for other financial assets, the prices were assumed to go down by 20%. the sampo group
bears no investment risks relatted to unit-linked insurance, so a change in assumptions regarding these assets does not affect
profit or loss. on the basis of the these alternative assumptions, a possible change in interest levels would cause descend of
eurm 2 (4) for the debt instruments, and eurm 169 (166) valuation loss for other instruments in the group's other
comprehensive income. the reasonably possible effect, proportionate to the group's equity, would thus be 1.5% (1.6).

as the p&c insurance is exposed to various exchange rates, comparing the balance sheet data from year to year can be
misleading.




                                                                233

claims cost trend of p&c insurance

the tables below show the cost trend for the claims for different years. the upper part of the tables shows how an estimate of
the total claims costs per claims year evolves annually. the lower section shows how large a share of this is presented in the
balance sheet. more information on p&c insurance's insurance liabilities in the risk management section of the annual accounts.

since january 1, 2008, the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1, 2006 regardless of age. in may 2015,
if decided that all employees born in 1958 or later that are covered by the norwegian defined-benefit pension plan would be
switched to a defined-contribution plan as of january 1, 2016. as of the same date, it was also decided that existing retirees
would no longer be covered by the plan, and that future retirees would cease being covered by the plan when they are no longer
employed by if. accordingly, as of year-end 2015, the norwegian pension plan consists solely of active people employed prior to
2006 and born no later than 1957.


the pension benefits referred to are old-age pension and survivors’ pension in sweden and old-age pension, survivors’ pension
and disability pension in norway. a common feature of all of the pension plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed
by the plans are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the employees’ service period and pensionable salary at the
time of retirement. the dominating benefit is the old-age pension, which refers in part to temporary pension before the
anticipated retirement age and in part to a life-long pension after the anticipated retirement age.


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway. in sweden,
premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65% percent of the
pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sector’s collective
bargaining agreement of 2006. in norway, premature old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70% percent of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were
employed by if in 2013.


the anticipated retirement age in connection with life-long pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway. in sweden,
life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10% of the pensionable salary
between 0 and 7.5 income base amounts, 65% of salary between 7.5 and 20 income base amounts and 32.5% between 20 and 30
income base amounts. in norway, life-long old-age pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70% of the pensionable salary up to 12 national insurance base amounts, together with the estimated statutory
old-age pension. paid-up policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an amount
corresponding to the change in the consumer price index. however, there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and future
supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall. pension payments from the norwegian plans
are were earlier indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to 80 - 100% of the change in the consumer price index. instead, as
of january 1, 2016, a paid-up policy is issued on retirement, whereby if is no longer responsible for and has no obligation in
respect of future indexation of the insured plans.


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits. if’s
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums. should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits, if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way. in addition to insured pension plans, there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment.


to cover the insured pension benefits, the related capital is managed as part of the insurers’ management portfolios. in such
management, the characteristics of the investment assets are analyzed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations, in a
process known as asset liability management. new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimizing the anticipated risk-adjusted return. any surplus that arises from management of
the assets normally accrues to if and/or the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective.


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans, including investment decisions and contributions.
the pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits, the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements.


when applying ias 19, the pension obligations are calculated, as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period, using
actuarial methods. pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period. the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality, employee
turnover and salary growth. the nominally calculated debt is discounted to the present value using an interest rate based on
current market interest rates adjusted to take into account the duration of the company’s pension obligations. as a basis for
determining the discount interest rate for the swedish obligation, if uses liquid covered mortgage bonds issued by a mortgage
institution. covered mortgage bonds are also used for the norwegian obligation. after a deduction for the plan assets, a net
asset or net liability is recognised in the balance sheet.


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions, specifications of pension costs, assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of
the fiscal year. as apparent from the tables, the said amendments to the insured plan in norway have been taken into account
when preparing the annual accounts for 2015 and had a material impact on both recognized costs and assets and obligations.


the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden (24.26%) and a corresponding fee in norway
(14.1%).

36 incentive schemes

               entive

the board of directors of sampo plc has decided on the long-term incentive schemes 2011 i - 2014 i for the management and
key employees of sampo group. the board has authorised the ceo to decide who will be included in the scheme, as well as the
number of calculated incentive units granted for each individual used in determining the amount of the incentive reward. in the
schemes, the number of calculated incentive units granted for the members of the group executive committee is decided by the
board of directors. some 130 persons were included in the schemes at the end of year 2015.


the amount of the performance-related bonus is based on the value performance of sampo's a share and on the insurance
margin (im) and on sampo's return on the risk adjusted capital (rorac). the value of one calculated incentive unit is the trade-
weighted average price of sampo's a-share at the time period specified in the terms of the scheme, and reduced by the starting
price adjusted with the dividends per share distributed up to the payment date. the pre-dividend starting prices vary between
eur 18.37 - 43.38. the maximum value of one incentive unit varies between eur 33.37 - 62.38, reduced by the dividend-adjusted
starting price. in all the schemes, the incentive reward depends on two benchmarks. if the im is 6 per cent or more, the im-based
reward is paid in full. if the im is between 4 - 5.99 per cent, half of the incentive reward is paid. no im-related reward will be paid
out, if the im stays below these. in addition, the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account. if the return is at least
risk free return + 4 per cent, the rorac-based incentive reward is paid out in full. if the return is risk free return + 2 percent, but
less than risk free return + 4 percent, the payout is 50 per cent. if the return stays below these benchmarks, no rorac-based
reward will be paid out.


each plan has three performance periods and incentive rewards are settled in cash in three installments. the employee shall
authorise sampo plc to buy sampo's a-shares with 60 per cent of the amount of the reward after taxes and other comparable
charges. the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout. a premature payment of the
reward may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on specifically
determined bases. the fair value of the incentive schemes is estimated by using the black-scholes pricing model.
