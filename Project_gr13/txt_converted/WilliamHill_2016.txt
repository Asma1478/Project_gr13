                             gambling can get out of hand.

                             if a customer wants to take a break from gambling, we
                             offer self-exclusion and signpost them to advice and
                             treatment services where necessary.

                             in 2015 we piloted our cross-operator self-exclusion
                             programme in glasgow and london and in 2016 we will
