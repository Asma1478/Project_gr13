message from chairman of the board and chief executive officer

     kasikornbank public company limited (kbank) embraces sustainable development (sd) as an integral part
of our business operations. it is our firm belief that our corporate strength and sustainability will be achieved through our
responsibility to the economy, society, and environment. during 2014, our operations were based on a “green at heart”
resolution, where we sought to instill a spirit of sustainable development within our own corporate culture. to materialize
this aim, the board of directors has drawn up a sustainable development policy. the corporate governance committee
has been assigned the task of ensuring that all concrete actions are incorporated throughout the bank’s business process.
the corporate governance committee is also responsible for providing recommendations on kbank’s sustainable
development plan and reporting to the board of directors. in 2014, notable achievements included:

economic aspect
    kbank’s goals and operational directions have been devised to be consistent with thailand’s economic trends and growth
performance, thus contributing to healthy and balanced economic fundamentals. we are continually developing a diverse
array of financial products, responding to the financial needs and lifestyles of each customer segment. our international
expansion precedes the upcoming aec, to include financial services for continued business expansion for both domestic
and international investors. we are broadening our services to offer useful knowledge in the areas of personal financial
planning and business operations to benefit our customers and the general public; we aspire to enhance their stability
and contribute to the development of a firm foundation for national economy. important projects include k-expert, k sme
care, kfam club, sme tee tak, and a broader access to digital banking service through k-mobile banking that facilitates
convenient and rapid financial transactions for customers nationwide.

social aspect
     realizing that human resources are a key component in meeting these objectives, kbank has accorded great importance
to taking care of our employees and maximizing their potential. significant action has been undertaken via training courses to
increase staff skills, knowledge, and capabilities to prepare them for career advancement. leadership training and succession
planning are also important; management of labor relations is a must, as are other operations involving staff remuneration,
welfare, and career opportunities. we believe that the creation of a pleasant work environment is good for occupational
health and safety. beyond those factors, kbank aims to empower our society and local communities, especially with regard
to our youth, because the development of our nation is dependent upon our young people developing into competent
and capable adults. kbank is cooperating with the thailand research fund (trf) in the cultivation of wisdom project to
develop systematic and rational thinking skills in secondary school students and engender a sense of responsibility towards
their communities. this concept is also fostered with our own employees’ children at our cultivation of wisdom camp, or
the “pho phan panya kamp,” in order to create knowledge, understanding, and participation within an organization. our
commitment has expanded to include the afterklass website, an online community for secondary school students to
refine the skill of their dreams, e.g., music, sports, the arts, and academic pursuits, to become high quality and ethical
people. in addition, our efforts have broadened to assist customers affected by political protests, rising household debt,
and earthquakes in seven provinces of thailand.

environmental aspect
     kbank has defined a clear environmental policy, including credit product development and risk management tools that
are environmentally and community-friendly, taking into account the national and global setting. credit facilities have been
extended to renewable energy projects, e.g., solar, wind, and biomass power generation; as well as to electric power-saving
programs, e.g., our k-top up loan for energy saving (lighting solutions) and k-energy saving guarantee program, to
encourage more responsible use of energy. as for our premises management, guidelines have been set for construction
and renovation of buildings to fulfill our long-term energy-saving plans. this concept encompasses the entire process of
construction, material selection, environmental conservation, and energy management as we create a healthier community
ecosystem. various campaigns have been carried out to encourage staff participation in energy-saving actions, reduction
of paper use, and in many environmental rehabilitation programs with community residents. during 2014, kbank’s board
of directors mapped out a sustainable development policy and assigned the corporate governance committee the task
of providing advice, supervision over related operations, and a commitment to concrete actions, including the participation
of all stakeholders. the sustainable development policy must be followed through in all kbank business processes,
including product and service development, risk management, fair and equitable treatment of employees, development of
youth potential, promotion of educational personnel, enhanced environmentally-friendly business operations, awareness
of environmental impacts, natural resource conservation, and minimization of waste.

   by 2017, kbank aspires to have achieved sustainability in all our business processes, supported by well-defined
management procedures and operational structures. staff skills will be enhanced via internal campaigns and efficient
monitoring, boosting kbank towards becoming a “sustainability organization.”

     this sustainability development report has been prepared in conformity with the global report initiative (gri). indicators
per g4 guidelines have also been used for the first time to identify operational framework to guide us towards long-term
sustainability in economic, social, and environmental aspects. on behalf of kasikornbank, i am pleased to witness our
participation in promoting sustainable development, and i encourage all employees, customers, communities, and our
society, as well as other stakeholders, to acknowledge their own social responsibility and join in these beneficial activities
for sustainable development.

environmental and social risk management


              business lending varies with each industry’s structure and its intrinsic risk
              factors, wherein we strive to maintain credit quality and prevent unjustifiable
              credit extension. in addition to our general criteria, pre-screening criteria
              have been devised for each industry, taking into account each industry’s key
              success factors, statistical average values and historical case studies of such
              customers, to be used as a common framework for all operations concerned.

		 society. any lending made must comply with relevant laws, and does not violate the moral of society.
     • the bank set up environmental and social screening process for project financing, before entering credit
		 underwriting process, to ensure that key environmental and social issues are addressed and managed beforehand.

             of the procurement management department. in addition, the department has
             duties to ensure that kbank’s procurement process is transparent and assess

             on environmental conservation. striving towards achieving sustainable
             procurement process, kbank has taken into account such social factors as fair
             trade, human rights and labor issues, and has set these factors as key criteria
             for the selection of our suppliers and drafting of relevant contracts (refer to
             the procurement handbook for suppliers dated september 3, 2014).

managing our direct environmental impact


       kbank is being committed to environmental awareness and to developing
       procedures, products and services that satisfy the customer needs while
       contributing to environmental preservation. our commitment is made concrete
       in many ways, we encourage staff to use resources wholly, in order to maximize
       benefits from scarce resources, which will help reduce ghg emission.
       in addition, kbank has adopted the concept of green buildings for the
       environment under the “leadership in energy and environmental design
       (leed standards)”, taking into consideration our employees’ and customers’
       health and safety. our office buildings and branches have been designed
       based on the “universal design” concept. for example, special paths
       for those who use wheelchair are available at branches located in hospitals,
       while elevators for disabled persons are installed in kbank’s new offices.

instead of buying a new and is renovating it as our chaeng watthana building 2. the renovation that is ongoing during
2014 - 2015 is based on the sufficiency principle, energy saving and use of recycled materials, along with a focus on the
“quality of life”. also, the leed-ci (leed for commercial interiors) concept has been used, while domestic consultants and
materials/equipment have been engaged, as well as the adoption of “local wisdom”.
     the chaeng watthana building 2 is currently under construction, with 360-kilowatt solar panels to be installed at its rooftop.
part of electricity will be generated by the rooftop pv system to reduce energy costs, in conformity with the government’s
promotion of renewable energy. led bulbs will be installed for lighting which could save at least 20 percent of electricity
cost compared to that of normal t5 bulbs.
     fully recognizing that a safe, clean, and plesant environment promotes employee effectivesness and facilitates contact
with customers and the general public, kbank has implemented occupational safety, health and environmental measures
in comformaty with standards issued by ministry of labor and consistent with recognized international standards.
