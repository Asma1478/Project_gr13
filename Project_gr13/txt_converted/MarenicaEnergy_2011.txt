during the year, two areas of uranium
mineralisation were identified within
the southern palaeochannel, which
lies approximately 7km south-east of
the marenica deposit. this south-west
trending palaeo-drainage system is
over 10km long and varies in width
between 2km and 4km.
two programmes of drilling were
completed totalling 155 holes for
4,505m. the reverse circulation
drilling at target ma7 was completed
over an area previously drilled at 600m
line spacings, which has now been in-
filled to 300m by 200m (see figure 3).
the overall tenor of the mineralisation

      australian stock exchange, the namibia stock exchange and various german exchanges.
      separate financial statements for marenica energy limited as an individual entity are no longer presented as the consequence of a
      change to the corporations act 2001, however, required financial information for the company as an individual entity is included in
      note 25.
      the nature of operations and principal activities of the consolidated entity, comprising marenica energy limited and its
      subsidiaries, are described in the directors’ report.


2.    statement of significant accounting policies
      the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. these policies have
      been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a)   basis of preparation
      these general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with australian equivalents to international
      financial reporting standards (aifrss), other authoritative pronouncements of the australian accounting standards board,
      urgent issues consolidated entity interpretations and the corporations act 2001.
      australian accounting standards as issued by the australian accounting standards board and international financial reporting
      standards (ifrs) as issued by the international accounting standards board.
      new accounting standards for application in future periods
      the aasb has issued new and amended accounting standards and interpretations that have mandatory application dates
      for future reporting periods. the group has decided against early adoption of these standards. a discussion of those future
      requirements and their impact on the group follows:
•     aasb 9: financial instruments and aasb 2009-11; amendments to australian accounting standards arising from aasb 9 (aasb
      1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 101, 102, 108, 112, 118, 121, 127, 128, 131, 132, 138, 139, 1023 & 1038 and interpretations 10 & 121 (applicable
      for annual reporting periods commencing on or alter 1 january 2013).
      these standards are applicable retrospectively and amend the classification and measurement of financial assets. the group has
      not yet determined the potential impact on the financial statements.
      the changes made to accounting requirements include:
      − simplifying the classifications of financial assets into those carried at amortised cost and those carried at fair value;
      −   simplifying the requirements for embedded derivatives;
      −   removing the tainting rules associated with held-to-maturity assets;
      −   removing the requirements to separate and fair value embedded derivatives for financial assets carried at amortised cost;
      −   allowing an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity instruments that are
          not held for trading in other comprehensive income. dividends in respect of these investments that are a return on investment
          can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or recycling on disposal of the instrument; and
      −   reclassifying financial assets where there is a change in an entity’s business model as they are initially classified based on;
           a.        the objective of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets; and
           b.        the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.




                                                                                                                                              21

•    aasb 124: related party disclosures (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2011).
     this standard removes the requirement for government related entities to disclose details of all transactions with the government
     and other government related entities and clarifies the definition of a related party to remove inconsistencies and simplify the
     structure of the standard. these amendments are not expected to impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-5: further amendments to australian accounting standards arising from the annual improvements project [aasb 5,
     8, 101, 107, 117, 118, 136 & 139] (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing from 1 january 2010).
     these standards detail numerous non-urgent but necessary changes to accounting standards arising from the iasb’s annual
     improvements project. no changes are expected to materially affect the group.
•    aasb 2009-8: amendments to australian accounting standards - group cash-settled share-based payment transactions
     [aasb 2] (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2010).
     these amendments clarify the accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the separate or individual
     financial statements of the entity receiving the goods or services when the entity has no obligation to settle the share-based
     payment transaction. the amendments incorporate the requirements previously included in interpretation 8 and interpretation 11
     and as a consequence, these two interpretations are superseded by the amendments. these amendments are not expected to
     impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-9: amendments to australian accounting standards - additional exemptions for first-time adopters [aasb 1]
     (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2010).
     these amendments specify requirements for entities using the full cost method in place of the retrospective application of
     australian accounting standards for oil and gas assets, and exempt entities with existing leasing contracts from reassessing the
     classification of those contracts in accordance with interpretation 4 when the application of their previous accounting policies
     would have given the same outcome. these amendments are not expected to impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-10: amendments to australian accounting standards - classification of rights issues [aasb 132] applicable for
     annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 february 2010).
     these amendments clarify that rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed number of an entity’s own equity instruments for a
     fixed amount in any currency are equity instruments if the entity offers the rights, options or warrants pro-rata to all existing owners
     of the same class of its own non-derivative equity instruments. these amendments are not expected to impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-12: amendments to australian accounting standards [aasbs 5, 8, 108, 110, 112, 119, 133, 137, 139, 1023 & 1031
     and interpretations 2, 4, 16, 1039 & 1052] (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2011).
     this standard makes a number of editorial amendments to a range of australian accounting standards and interpretations,
     including amendments to reflect changes made to the text of international financial reporting standards by the iasb. the
     standard also amends aasb 8 to require entities to exercise judgment in assessing whether a government and entities known
     to be under the control of that government are considered a single customer for the purposes of certain operating segment
     disclosures. these amendments are not expected to impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-13: amendments to australian accounting standards arising from interpretation 19 [aasb 1] (applicable for annual
     reporting periods commencing on or after 1 july 2010).
     this standard makes amendments to aasb 1 arising from the issue of interpretation 19. the amendments allow a first-time
     adopter to apply the transitional provisions in interpretation 19. this standard is not expected to impact the group.
•    aasb 2009-14: amendments to australian interpretation - prepayments of a minimum funding requirement [aasb interpretation
     14] (applicable for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 january 2011).
     this standard amends interpretation 14 to address unintended consequences that can arise from the previous accounting
     requirements when an entity prepays future contributions into a defined benefit pension plan. this standard will not impact the
     group.

•     aasb interpretation 19 extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments (applicable for annual reporting periods
      commencing on or after 1 july 2010).
      this interpretation deals with how a debtor would account for the extinguishment of a liability through the issue of equity
      instruments. the interpretation states that the issue of equity should be treated as the consideration paid to extinguish the liability,
      and the equity instruments issued should be recognised at their fair value unless fair value cannot be measured reliably in which
      case they shall be measured at the fair value of the liability extinguished. the interpretation deals with situations where either partial
      or full settlement of the liability has occurred. this interpretation is not expected to impact the group.
      the group does not anticipate the early adoption of any of the above australian accounting standards.
      historical cost convention
      these financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-
      for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss, certain
      classes of property, plant and equipment and investment property.
      critical accounting estimates
      the preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. it also requires management
      to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies. the areas involving a higher degree of
      judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in
      note 3.
      functional and presentation currency
      these consolidated financial statements are presented in australian dollars, which is the company’s functional currency and the
      functional currency of the majority of the consolidated entity’s current financial transactions.
      going concern
      the consolidated entity incurred losses of $5,300,603 (2010: $9,651,377) and net operating cash outflows of $4,214,733 (2010:
      $8,070,346). these were offset by net cash inflows from financing activities of $4,853,152 (2010: $380,114) for the year ended 30
      june 2011 and, as at that date, had a working capital surplus of $2,858,619 (2010: $2,135,204).
      the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due is dependent on the
      following:
      •    active management of the current level of discretionary expenditure in line with the funds available to the consolidated
           entity; and
      •    the ability to raise additional funding through either debt facilities or capital raising, if required.
      based on the existing cash resources, the ability to reduce operational, administration and exploration expenditure and the ability
      to raise additional funding either by way of debt or capital raisings if required, the directors are satisfied that the going concern
      basis of preparation is appropriate.
(b)   principles of consolidation
      the consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of marenica energy limited
      (“company” or “parent entity”) as at 30 june 2011 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. marenica energy
      limited and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the group or the consolidated entity.
      subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally
      accompanying a shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights. the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are
      currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the group controls another entity.
      subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. they are de-consolidated from the
      date that control ceases.
      the financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent
      accounting policies. the effects of all intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities
      in the group are eliminated in full.


                                                                                                                                                     23

2.    statement of significant accounting policies (continued)
(c)   change of accounting policy
      there have been no changes in accounting policies in the year ended 30 june 2011.
(d)   exploration expenses
      exploration and evaluation costs represent intangible assets. exploration and evaluation costs (including costs incurred as a result
      of the introduction agreement referred to in note 26 but excluding other acquisition costs) are expensed as incurred. acquisition
      costs related to an area of interest are capitalised and carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recouped through
      the successful development of the area or where activities in the area have not yet reached a stage which permits reasonable
      assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the
      areas of interest are continuing.
      accumulated acquisition costs in relation to an abandoned area are written off in full against profit and loss account in the year in
      which the decision to abandon the area is made.
      costs of site restoration are provided over the life of the facility from when exploration commences and are included in the costs
      of that stage. site restoration costs include the dismantling and removal of mining plant, equipment and building structures, waste
      removal, and rehabilitation of the site in accordance with clauses of the mining permits. such costs have been determined using
      estimates of future costs, current legal requirements and technology on an undiscounted basis.
      any changes in the estimates for the costs are accounted on a prospective basis. in determining the costs of site restoration, there
      is uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of the restoration due to community expectations and future legislation. accordingly
      the costs have been determined on the basis that the restoration will be completed.
(e)   cash and cash equivalents
      cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid
      investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are
      subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(f)   plant and equipment
      plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write
      off the net cost of each asset during their expected useful life of 3 to 5 years.
      the carrying amount of plant and equipment is reviewed annually by directors to ensure it is not shown in the accounts at a value
      in excess of the recoverable amount from assets.
(g)   investments and other financial assets
      classification
      the company classifies its investments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and
      receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets. the classification depends on the purpose for
      which the investments were acquired. management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and, in the
      case of assets classified as held-to-maturity, re-evaluates this designation at each reporting date.
      financial assets at fair value through profit and loss
      financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are financial assets held for trading. a financial asset is classified in this
      category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. assets in this category are classified as current assets.
      loans and receivables
      loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
      market. they are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after 30 june 2011 which
      are classified as non-current assets. loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the statement of
      financial position.




m arenica energ y ann u al report 2 0 1 1

      held-to-maturity investments
      held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that
      the company’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. held-to-maturity investments are included
      in non-current assets, except for those with maturities less than 12 months from the reporting date, which are classified as
      current assets.
      available-for-sale financial assets
      available-for-sale financial assets, principally comprising marketable equity securities, are non-derivatives that are either designated
      in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. they are included in non-current assets unless management
      intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of 30 june 2011
      recognition and derecognition
      regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date – the date on which the company commits to
      purchase or sell the asset. investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried
      at fair value through profit or loss. financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and
      transaction costs are expensed to the income statement. financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows
      from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the company has transferred substantially all the risks and
      rewards of ownership.
      when securities are classified as available-for-sale are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments recognised in equity are
      included in the income statement as gains and losses from investment securities.
      subsequent measurement
      loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
      available-for-sale financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. gains or losses arising
      from changes in the fair value of the “financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” category are presented in the income
      statement within other income or other expenses in the period in which they arise. dividend income from financial assets at
      fair value through profit and loss is recognised in the income statement as part of income from continuing operations when the
      company’s right to receive payment is established.
      fair value
      the fair values of quoted investments are based on last trade prices. if the market for financial assets is not active (and for unlisted
      securities), the company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
      impairment
      the company assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired. in the case
      of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of a security below its cost is
      considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. if any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the
      cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on
      that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
(h)   provisions and employee benefits
      provisions and employee benefits
      provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is
      probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate
      can be made of the amount of the obligation.
      provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
      obligation at 30 june 2011 using a discounted cash flow methodology. the risks specific to the provision are factored into the
      cash flows and as such a risk-free government bond rate relative to the expected life of the provision is used as a discount rate.
      the increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.




                                                                                                                                                       25

n o t e s t o t h e f i n a n c i a l s tat e m e n t s

for the year ended 30 june 2011




      employee leave benefits
      liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be
      settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect of employees’ services up to the reporting date. they
      are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. expenses for non-accumulating sick leave are
      recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
(i)   share based payments
      the company provides benefits to directors, employees, consultants and other advisors of the company in the form of share-
      based payments, whereby the directors, employees, consultants and other advisors render services in exchange for shares or
      rights over shares (equity-settled transactions).
      the cost of these equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at
      which they are granted. the fair value is determined by an external valuer using a black-scholes model.
      in valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the
      market price of the shares of the company if applicable.
      the cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the
      performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant recipient becomes fully entitled to the
      award (the vesting period).
      the cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects:
      (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and
      (ii) the company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
      no adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included
      in the determination of fair value at grant date. the income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in
      cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
      no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is only conditional upon a
      market condition.
      if the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
      modified. in addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment
      arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the recipient, as measured at the date of modification.
      if an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet
      recognised for the award is recognised immediately. however, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and
      designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new award are treated as if they were a
      modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
(j)   earnings per share
      basic earnings per share is determined by dividing the profit (loss) after income tax attributable to equity holders of the company
      by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
(k)   fair value estimation
      the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure
      purposes.
      the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as shares in listed companies) is based on quoted market
      prices at 30 june 2011.
      the nominal value, less any estimated credit adjustments, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their
      fair value.




m arenica energ y ann u al report 2 0 1 1

(l)   impairment of assets
      at each reporting date, the consolidated entity reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is
      any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. if any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
      asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any).
(m) payables
      trade payables and other accounts payable are recognised when the consolidated entity becomes obliged to make future
      payments resulting from the purchase of goods and services.
(n)   revenue recognition
      interest income is recognised on a time proportionate basis that takes into account the effective yield on the financial assets.
(o)   foreign currency
      transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. monetary assets
      and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 june 2011 are translated to australian dollars at the foreign exchange rate
      ruling at that date. foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. non-monetary
      assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at
      the date of the transaction. non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are
      translated to australian dollars at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(p)   segment reporting
      the group uses an ‘management approach’, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for
      internal reporting purposes. operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the
      chief operating decision maker. the chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing
      performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors.
(q)   income tax
      the income tax expense or revenue for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income based on the notional
      income tax rate, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between tax bases
      of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.
      a deferred tax asset for unused tax losses is recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise
      losses.
      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and
      when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the entity
      has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liability
      simultaneously.


3.    significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
      the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
      the reported amounts in the financial statements. management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to
      assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. management bases its judgements and estimates on historical
      experience and on other various factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
      of the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these
      estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
      management has identified the following critical accounting policies for which significant judgements, estimates and assumptions
      are made. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and may materially affect
      financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
      further details of the nature of these assumptions and conditions may be found in the relevant notes to the financial statements.




                                                                                                                                                  27

3.   significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
     significant accounting judgements
     determination of mineral resources
     the determination of mineral resources impacts the accounting for asset carrying values. the group estimates its mineral
     resources in accordance with the australian code for reporting of exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves 2004
     (the ‘jorc’ code). the information on mineral resources was prepared by or under the supervision of competent persons as
     defined in the jorc code. the amounts presented are based on the mineral resources determined under the jorc code.
     there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation
     may change significantly when new information becomes available.
     changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic
     status of reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being restated.
     significant accounting estimates and assumptions
     share based payment transactions
     the group measures the cost of equity-settled share based payment transactions with employees by reference to the fair value
     of the equity instruments at the grant date. the fair value is determined by using a recognised option valuation model, with the
     assumptions detailed in note 24. the accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share based payments
     would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact
     expenses and equity.
                                                                                                              2011           2010

     no income tax expense has been provided in the accounts because the company has an operating loss for the year. no future
     tax benefit attributable to tax losses has been brought to account as recovery is not certain or assured.
     the benefit will only be obtained if the company derives future assessable income of a nature and of an amount sufficient to enable
     the benefit to be realised, continues to comply with the conditions for deductibility imposed by taxation legislation and there are no
     changes in tax legislation adversely affecting the consolidated entity in realising the benefit.

28. financial instruments
   overview – risk management
   this note presents information about the consolidated entity’s exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks, its objectives, policies
   and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of capital.
   the consolidated entity does not use any form of derivatives as it is not at a level of exposure that requires the use of derivatives to
   hedge its exposure. exposure limits are reviewed by management on a continuous basis. the consolidated entity does not enter
   into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
   the board of directors of the company has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management
   framework. management monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the company and the consolidated
   entity through regular reviews of the risks.
   credit risk
   credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the consolidated entity if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
   meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the consolidated entity’s receivables from customers and investment
   securities. at 30 june 2011 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
   cash and cash equivalents
   the consolidated entity limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have
   an acceptable credit rating.
   trade and other receivables
   as the consolidated entity operates primarily in exploration activities, it does not have trade receivables and therefore is not
   exposed to credit risk in relation to trade receivables.
   the consolidated entity where necessary establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in
   respect of other receivables and investments. management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
   exposure to credit risk
   the carrying amount of the group’s financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. the consolidated entity’s maximum
   exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
			

                                                                                          note               2011               2010
                                                                                                               $                  $
   receivables                                                                             6               162,944              47,467
   other current assets                                                                    8                  7,612              5,741

   impairment losses
   none of the consolidated entity’s other receivables are past due (2010: $nil).
   liquidity risk
   liquidity risk is the risk that the consolidated entity will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the
   consolidated entity’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
   meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage
   to the consolidated entity’s reputation.
   the consolidated entity manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves from funds raised in the market and by
   continuously monitoring forecast and actual flows. the consolidated entity does not have any external borrowings.

the consolidated entity will need to raise additional capital in the next 12 months to meet forecast operational and exploration
activities. the decision on when and how the consolidated entity will raise future capital will depend on market conditions existing
at that time.
the following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of
netting agreements:

market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the
consolidated entity’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. the objective of market risk management is to
manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.
currency risk
the consolidated entity’s exposure to currency risk at 30 june 2011 on financial assets denominated in namibian dollars was
$113,181 (2010: $14,043) which amounts are not hedged. the effect of future movements in the exchange rate for namibian
dollars on the consolidated entity’s financial position and results of fully expensed exploration and evaluation activities is likely to be
negligible.
the parent entity’s exposure to currency risk at 30 june 2011 on financial assets denominated in namibian dollars (being loans
made to controlled entities to fund exploration activities in namibia) was $8,981,860 (2010: $6,506,202) which amounts are not
hedged. the effect of future movements in the exchange rate for namibian dollars on the parent entity’s financial position and
results of fully expensed exploration and evaluation activities is likely to be negligible.
interest rate risk
the consolidated entity is exposed to interest rate risk (primarily on its cash and cash equivalents), which is the risk that a financial
instrument’s value will fluctuate as a result of changes in the market interest rates on interest-bearing financial instruments. the
consolidated entity does not use derivatives to mitigate these exposures.
the company adopts a policy of ensuring that as far as possible it maintains excess cash and cash equivalents on short term
deposit at interest rates maturing over 90 day rolling periods.

   at the reporting date the interest rate profile of the consolidated entity’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

   fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments
   the company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or through equity,
   therefore a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity.
   cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
   a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) equity and profit or loss by
   the amounts shown below. this analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant. the analysis is performed on the same
   basis for 2010.

introduction
marenica energy limited (the company) has adopted systems of control and accountability as the basis for the administration
of corporate governance.
the company, during the financial year ended 30 june 2011 (the reporting period), has continued to follow the asx corporate
governance council principles of good corporate governance and best practice recommendations (asx principles and
recommendations) as set out below:

principle 1: lay solid foundations for management and oversight
the company has adopted a board charter which describes the purpose and role of the board, its responsibilities and powers
and the way in which the board functions.
the board has sole responsibility for the following:
• protection and enhancement of shareholder value.
• formulation, review and approval of the objectives and strategic direction of the company.
• monitoring the financial performance of the company by reviewing and approving budgets and monitoring results.
• approving all significant business transactions including acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure.
• ensuring that adequate internal control systems and procedures exist and that compliance with these systems and
  procedures is maintained.
• the identification of significant business risks and ensuring that such risks are adequately managed.
• the review of performance and remuneration of executive directors and key staff.
• the establishment and maintenance of appropriate ethical standards.
• evaluating and, where appropriate, adopting with or without modification the asx corporate governance council’s
  principles of good corporate governance and best practice recommendations.
the ceo has responsibility for the management of the company.
arrangements are in place by the board to monitor the performance of the company’s executives including a review by the
board of the company’s financial performance and annual performance appraisal meetings incorporating analysis of key
performance indicators with each individual.
the performance of senior executives is also evaluated on an on-going basis using a peer reviewing procedure. the board
considers adjustments to remuneration of senior executives and employees annually after considering performance
evaluations.

principle 2: structure the board to add value
during the year ended 30 june 2011 the company had a majority of directors who were considered to be independent the
chairman was an independent non-executive director and did not perform the role of either managing director or chief
executive officer. refer to the directors’ report for board changes throughout the reporting period. the independence of
directors is reviewed on an ongoing basis. directors are entitled to obtain independent external advice on matters relating to
accounting law or other relevant professional matters.
the board charter provides that the board will constantly review and monitor its performance. as part of this process, the
board may seek to appoint persons who, in the opinion of the board, will provide specialist expertise required for the board to
adequately perform its role. additionally, the board will also review its composition and advise board members where it is felt
that a director’s skills are different from those required by the company.
the board considers that the company is not currently of a size, nor are its affairs of such complexity to justify the formation of
separate or special committees at this time including audit, remuneration or nomination committees preferring at this stage to
manage the company through the full board of directors.




                                                                                                                                      47

c o r p o r at e g o v e r n a n c e s tat e m e n t




the board as a whole is able to address the governance aspects of the full scope of the company’s activities and to ensure
that it adheres to appropriate ethical standards.
the full board currently holds meetings at such times as may be necessary to address any general or specific matters as
required.
if the group’s activities increase in size, scope and nature, the appointment of separate or special committees will be reviewed
by the board and implemented if appropriate.
the board has adopted an informal, self-evaluation process to measure its own performance during each financial year. also,
an annual review is undertaken in relation to the composition and skills mix of the directors of the company.

principle 3: promote ethical and responsible decision-making
the board has adopted a series of policies comprising a code of conduct for the board, management and employees.
the code of conduct addresses expectations for conduct in the following areas;
• responsibilities to clients, employees, suppliers, creditors, customers and consumers
• employment practices
• responsibility to the community
• responsibility to the individual
• obligations relative to fair trading and dealing
• business courtesies, bribes, facilitation payments, inducements and commissions
• conflicts of interest
all directors, executives and employees are required to comply with that code.
failure to comply will result in disciplinary action and may include reprimand, formal warning, demotion or, in extreme cases,
termination of employment.
in accordance with the corporations act 2001 and the company’s constitution, directors must keep the board advised, on
an ongoing basis, of any interest that could potentially conflict with those of the company. where the board believes that a
significant conflict exists, the director concerned does not receive the relevant board papers and is not present at the meeting
whilst the item is considered.
the company has established a policy for trading in the company’s securities that is provided to all directors and employees on
commencement.
the constitution permits directors to acquire shares or options in the company. the company’s policy prohibits directors from
dealing in shares or options whilst in possession of price sensitive information. directors must notify the company secretary
once they have bought or sold shares or options in the company or exercised options over ordinary shares. in accordance
with the provisions of the corporations act 2001 and the listing rules of the australian securities exchange, the company on
behalf of the directors must advise the australian securities exchange of any transactions conducted by them in shares and /
or options in the company.

principle 4: safeguard integrity in financial reporting
the board considers that the company is not currently of a size, nor its affairs of such complexity, to justify the formation
of a separate audit committee, preferring at this stage to manage the company through the full board of directors to verify
and safeguard the integrity of the company’s financial reporting and to ensure the independence and competence of the
company’s external auditor.
the board requires the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (or equivalent) to state in writing on an annual basis that
the company’s financial reports contain a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the financial condition and operating
performance of the company.
the company’s auditor is required to attend the company’s agm and be available to answer shareholder questions

principle 5: make timely and balanced disclosure
the company has established a disclosure policy which requires that the chairman, chief executive officer (or equivalent) or
company secretary be advised as soon as possible (and prior to disclosure to anyone else) of matters which they believe may
be required to be disclosed.
the company’s communication strategy requires communication with shareholders and other stakeholders in an open, regular
and timely manner so that the market has sufficient information to make informed investment decisions on the operations and
results of the company. the strategy provides for the use of systems that ensure a regular and timely release of information
about the company is provided to shareholders. mechanisms employed include:
• announcements lodged with asx;
• asx quarterly cash flow reports;
• half yearly report;
• presentations at the annual general meeting/general meetings; and
• annual report.

principle 6: respect the rights of shareholders
the company lists all of the company’s announcements to the market on its website. shareholders and market participants
registering their email addresses with the company are provided with a link to each announcement.
the company’s auditor is required to attend the company’s agm and be available to answer shareholder questions.
the board encourages full participation of shareholders at the annual general meeting to ensure a high level of accountability
and understanding of the company’s strategy and goals.

principle 7: recognise and manage risk
the company is not currently considered to be of a size, nor is its affairs of such complexity to justify the establishment
of a separate risk management committee. instead, the board, as part of its usual role and through direct involvement in
the management of the company’s operations ensures risks are identified, assessed and appropriately managed. where
necessary, the board draws on the expertise of appropriate external consultants to assist in dealing with or mitigating risk.
the board requires the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (or equivalent) to state in writing on an annual basis that
the company’s financial reports contain a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the financial condition and operating
performance of the company and comply with relevant accounting standards and, furthermore, that the company has a sound
system of risk management, that internal compliance and control systems are in place to ensure the implementation of board
policies and that those systems are operating efficiently and effectively in all material respects.
the board acknowledges that it is responsible for the overall internal control framework, but recognises that no cost effective
internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities.

principle 8: remunerate fairly and responsibly
the company has not established a nominations and remuneration committee however the full board:
1. reviews the remuneration guidelines for senior management, including base salary, bonuses, share options, salary
   packaging and final contractual agreements.
2. reviews non-executive fees and costs by seeking external benchmarks.
3. reviewing the chief executive officer’s remuneration, allowances and incentives and final package.
equity components of remuneration, including the issue of options, for directors are required to be approved by shareholders
prior to award.

report, and is also included in the 2011 financial statements.



                                                                                                                                         49
