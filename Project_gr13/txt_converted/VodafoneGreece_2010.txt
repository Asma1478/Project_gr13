at vodafone greece we believe that an integrated corporate responsibility program relates to how a company is managed, operates
and behaves towards society, stakeholders and the environment. in our definition a company is responsible when at the same time
as achieving its commercial objectives it also takes into account the impact of its operations on society as a whole and takes suitable
steps in that regard with measurable results. consequently, depending on the extent of its activities and without this necessarily
translating into financial outlays, the company is obliged to reduce its potential negative impact and bolster its positive impact on
the world around it.

principles and into the corporate governance manual and policies
we implement. we believe that corporate responsibility should be
an integral part of our day-to-day operations and it is critical that we
constantly make improvements based on solid conclusions.
for this reason, we have established a system to measure
and evaluate our performance.

 environment



vodafone greece’s environmental strategy focuses on two areas, on
the one hand reducing the company’s operational impact on the
environment, through systematic program that we have been
implementing since the beginning of our operation and on the other
hand in the mobile telecommunications sector by contributing to a
reduction of greece’s carbon footprint. these programs are managed
as part of the environmental management system which is iso 14001
and emas certified for all the company activities and facilities.

objective of maintaining this percentage. according to
these new calculations, the savings in energy being con-
sumed by the network for 2008-2009, was 23%, resulting
in a re-adjustment in the objective for 2009-2010.

    the rapid growth of mobile telecommunications has familiarised us
    with the mobile phones usage, but not with the technology required for
    their operation. as a result, while most people demand to be able to use
    their mobile phones everywhere and at anytime, others are concerned
    about the mobile telecommunications network operation. at vodafone
    greece, we deploy our network of base stations in line with the
    guidelines issued by international scientific organisations and strictly
    comply with the standards adopted in relation to public exposure limits
    to electromagnetic fields.
