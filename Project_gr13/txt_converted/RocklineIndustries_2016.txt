we have also excluded soshio (hk) industrial co. ltd., our

control over their operations.

scope
the greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions data in this report are
comprised primarily of scope 1 and scope 2 data from our
manufacturing facilities and offices. this report also contains a
limited amount of scope 3 data (ghg emissions from outbound
shipping of our finished goods to customers).

methodology
unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all data, figures and charts
cover the period of our fiscal year ending in 2016, which runs
from july 1, 2015 to june 30, 2016. the data in this report has
been collected from invoices and statements of account sent to
rockline by our utility providers and other vendors.
     we have calculated our carbon footprint using the green-
house gas protocol corporate standard, as well as emission
coefficients from the united states environmental protection
agency (u.s. epa) and the united kingdom department of
farm, environment, and rural affairs (uk defra).
     in 2014, the u.s. epa updated the emissions factors, and
our data were adjusted to reflect these updates.

•   use materials that come from natural sources and recycled
    inputs.
•   incorporate chemicals that are safe for human health and the
    environment.
•   eliminate packaging and choose packaging materials that are
    more recyclable by consumers.
