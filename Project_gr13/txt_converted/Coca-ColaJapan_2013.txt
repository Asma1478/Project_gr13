    coca-cola system's
    sustainability framework
    beginning from the year 2010, the coca-cola company has established the “2020 vision,” a long-term growth strategy
    under which we are aiming to double the scale of our global business by the year 2020. we believe that addressing
    sustainability is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.
    together with a wide range of stakeholders, including consumers, local communities, and entities representing the
    global environment, we will work in close cooperation with our bottling partners and affiliates to promote initiatives in
    core areas shared around the world and achieve sustainability in both society and our business activities.

       2020 vision
        beginning from the year 2010, the coca-cola company has established the “2020 vision,” a long-term growth
        strategy under which we are aiming to double the scale of our global business by the year 2020. we have set
        targets related to each priority item required to achieve this vision—including the workplace, customers, profit,
        products, the environment, and operational efficiency. we are also working together with our bottling partners
        and affiliates in japan to realize the “2020 vision.”

     sustainable
     packaging
     our mission
     the coca-cola system maintains a “zero waste” vision for packaging, which is a valuable resource, and advances initiatives
     in line with a global strategy. as well as promoting the 3rs (reduce, reuse, recycle) throughout the lifecycle of products—from
     ingredient procurement to collection and recycling—we strive to develop product packaging that fulfills the basic
     requirements of ease of use and safety for consumers and representation of the brand’s underlying philosophy. we call this
     approach “sustainable packaging.”

     stewardship
     our mission
     the coca-cola system worldwide has a common goal of becoming the global leader in sustainable water resource
     management by 2020. to achieve that goal, we are advancing water stewardship projects comprising three elements:
     “reduce” the amount of water used in production processes; “recycle” water used in production by returning it to the natural
     environment after proper treatment; and “replenish” water resources through watershed cultivation.
