1 overview
1.1 message from the ceo

by any measure, sbm offshore finished 2013 in much better shape than we began. the legacy projects
are now largely behind us and the balance sheet is secured. as a result, we have the focus and financial
flexibility to pursue the projects we wish to win. and we are winning them: cidade de maricá and cidade
de saquarema for petrobras, together with stones for shell, represent our future. culturally, we are
making critical transitions. we are becoming a more client focused organisation.

the company’s competitive advantage, for several decades, has been its technological edge, especially at the
ever advancing deepwater frontier. above all, we sell reliability. so while maintaining our investment in innovation
was critical in 2013, so was flawless execution and operation. our consistent uptime across the fleet of over 99%
demonstrates this to be without exception.

across the company, we expect our teams to start by listening to the client, identifying the problem to be solved
and directing their intellectual and engineering efforts to that purpose. these behaviours will be critical in the era
our industry is entering.

the oilfield services sector faces a structural shift. big oil companies and independents alike are under pressure
to reduce expenditure: costs are rising while free cash flow is in decline. clients are asking service providers to be
more cost effective. at the same time, national oil companies are increasingly taking the lead responsibility for
ambitious projects and scrutiny of costs. despite these trends, the attraction of an fpso as a life-of-field solution
has not diminished; the economics remain compelling at around us$5 per barrel produced.

so, what exactly do clients seek in this new era? simply put, they require reduced capex spend through better
design, shorter build or fit-out times and reduced operating costs. they must, of course, have a dependable
provider for the entire life of the field – a partnership of between 15 and 25 years. this plays to our strengths:
great engineering is the key to simpler, cheaper, better designs. we can deliver an fpso and assure our client
that we will be there long term. but re-design and reliability do not mean cutting corners. we will never bid a price
dependent on upfront cost savings that risk causing problems down the line. we will never compromise on built-in
redundancy, or systems resilience, which ensure uninterrupted production and the strongest safety regime.

additionally, being equally comfortable with the sale or lease of fpsos, the company offers a financing choice.
oil companies looking to minimise pre-production costs can opt for lease & operate. this is a commercial
advantage for the company, both in securing projects and appealing to investors through the down-cycle. the
company's lease portfolio represents consistent long term cash flow with an average fleet duration of 14.5 years,
providing unrivalled long-term visibility in the oil services sector.

the transformational programme begun two years ago made great strides in 2013. i have already referred to our
renewed focus on listening to our customers. as a business with an ethical code of conduct, we are highly
conscious of our own guidelines in two vital respects; the ways we work with clients and the importance of
working within rules. this is not merely my impression: clients are providing evidence they support our
transparent ways of working. also, assessment surveys show that our people understand what is required, and
why. this is a critical element in boosting the pride of those working for sbm offshore.

let me address safety. our performance has shown a slight, yet undeniable, deterioration in 2013. this direction
must be reversed. but it must also be understood. we have pushed rapidly into new geographies and significantly
more complex processes. it is essential for us to adapt to these new conditions and learn swiftly, which we are
doing.

so what is our agenda for 2014? our industry faces different conditions from twelve months ago. we can only
take advantage of these circumstances through consistency. 2013’s standards of quality and delivery need to be
made permanent while we relentlessly drive our productivity forward. it will be equally vital to extend our
leadership in technology. in the main, this will come from our own r&d, but we may identify opportunities in the
market. above all, in a changing environment, we must keep listening to our clients to propose adapted solutions.
we have achieved much and created encouraging momentum. i thank all sbm staff for their contribution and
dedication. but there is a great deal more to play for.



1.2 company profile
sbm offshore’s business is the provision of floating production solutions to the offshore energy industry, over the
full product life-cycle.

the company’s main activity is the design, supply, installation and operation of floating production, storage and
offloading (fpso) vessels.

these are either owned and operated by the company and leased to its clients, in which case the project is
financed by the company and in some cases joint venture partners. alternatively, the company undertakes fpso
projects for clients on a turnkey sale basis, where these vessels can either be operated by the client, or operated
by the company under a separate service contract. in this case, financing is provided by the client.

with 16 units currently in operation worldwide, over 195 years of cumulative fpso operational experience and an
unrivalled reputation within the industry, the company is the market leader in providing leased production floating
systems.

headquartered in schiedam in the netherlands, the company employs over 9,900 people worldwide, spread
over five main execution centres, 10 operational shore bases, several construction yards and the fleet of vessels.

1.5 corporate strategy
1.5.1 introduction
underlying global demand for oil, gas and energy will continue to support the company’s business model for
decades to come. despite the emergence of alternative fuels, hydrocarbons are expected to remain the main
energy source through 2040, driven by population growth particularly in regions with increasing standards of living
and urbanisation. the expectation that the world population will increase by approximately 2 billion to a total of
around 9 billion individuals by 2040 helps support the notion of strengthened energy demand.

the fact that existing producing fields are depleting rapidly while demand is increasing, will also contribute to the
company’s success. oil companies are facing strong pressure to replace reserves and develop proven fields,
inducing them to explore opportunities increasingly further offshore in deeper water, under more complex
conditions. almost 70% of the oil discovered over the past three years have been in deep water. these
opportunities most often require high-end floating production solutions, where the company’s main competitive
advantage lies. the fact that fpsos are cost competitive solutions including low abandonment costs, also adds
to their appeal.

however, despite strong demand for energy, current market developments continue to challenge oil companies
and the company must remain alert. with an increasing number deepwater fields to be developed as well as
more complex reservoirs also comes increased technical challenge, which has contributed to increasing lead
times between project award and first oil delivery. this enhanced technical challenge, together with growing
material and human capital input costs, have contributed to rising breakeven oil prices and delayed orders for the
fpso industry. these market conditions are expected to persist, and will thus continue to drive the company’s
strategy formulation and execution. strong attention is being focused on improving productivity, decreasing unit
cost and enhancing risk-adjusted returns.



1.5.2 medium-term strategic plan (3-year plan)
the group’s updated 3-year strategic plan, adopted as of december 31, 2013, addressed the period from 2014 to
2016. in line with previous years, the plan draws on thorough external analysis of the market, customers,
competitors and technological developments, coupled with extensive internal analysis across the company’s
activities. the management board and the supervisory board have reviewed and approved the plan.

the company remains dedicated to its restated focus on core products with good margins. these include floating
production and mooring systems, production operations as well as terminals and services. over the long term, the
company continues to see strong potential at the high-end of the converted fpso sector, supported by a strong
macro-economic outlook and favourable industry-specific trends. medium-term strategy will therefore be focused
on penetrating the current market more profitably by deploying best practice in terms of reliability, talent
management, customer value and technology leadership.

reliability – consistently doing the right thing at the right time
it is the company’s ambition to operate and deliver in a safe and reliable manner, in terms of hsse, quality,
compliance and project execution, despite increasingly complex dynamics. reliability also encapsulates sufficient
financial security to install a sense of trust and confidence amongst our stakeholders in the resilience of our
business model, as well as being best placed to exploit growth opportunities.



operational excellence
several internal initiatives, focusing on improved hsse and compliance in recent years, have already started to
deliver results across the organisation, even if 2013 hsse statistics themselves have fallen short of internal
expectations. the company expects progress to translate into actual shareholder value as new processes and
standards are fully adopted.

the execution of the company's transformation programme is expected to contribute significantly to operational
and financial reliability by improving ways of working, project control and competencies. the programme is
extensive and will be given careful attention across the organisation in the coming years. read more about the
transformation programme

in order to facilitate strategic decision-making and deliver further management efficiency, the company has
simplified its governance structure from three layers, comprising the supervisory board, management board and
board of management to two, by removing the board of management. a new position of ‘group executive
managing director’ has been created, reporting to the ceo. bernard van leggelo, formerly managing director of
the sbm houston execution centre, has been appointed to this new role. he will focus on the execution of the
company’s operational strategy and long-term planning. additionally, a broad portfolio of responsibilities has been
assigned to the managing directors responsible for the performance of their execution centre. all managing
directors will thus report directly to the ceo and have functional reporting lines to the new group executive
managing director.

it is the company’s intention that these efforts, together with previous reorganisational pursuits, will continue to
streamline the organisation and enhance transparency, ensuring successful delivery and execution of large
complex fpso projects in the future.



striving for a balanced portfolio
the company continues to engage both in the lease & operation segment as well as the turnkey sale segment.
leasing provides long-term visibility of cash flows and earnings; however, it is capital intensive and requires tight
management of complex financial, operational and contractual risks. turnkey sales contracts generate revenues
and profits as the project (during the construction phase) progresses, minimizing capital requirements from the
company. balancing both types of activity allows the company continually to improve its track record, while
managing its balance sheet exposure and the cyclicality of the industry.

an important advantage of the company’s business model revolves around the full life-cycle aspects of the
business. by leasing and operating its assets, the company can feed back its operational knowledge into its
engineering process, which allows for continuous improvement and innovation. this loop results in further
business opportunities such as relocations, vessel refurbishments and other brown-field projects, but it also
contributes to an in-depth understanding of the effects of age on components, better life-cycle costing and asset
integrity management.



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                   13

the fact that the company's activity spans both the lease and turnkey sale segments is an important competitive
advantage. for floating production systems, it is essentially the client’s choice whether to opt for lease or
purchase, which decision is often taken relatively late in the contracting process. however, it is the overall risk
profile of each project, which determines the risk/reward balance for the company and influences the appetite for
exposing its balance sheet.

the company aims to grow primarily through the organic growth of its lease fleet of fpsos, but may consider
acquisition opportunities that match its financial, operation and strategic criteria. the company aims to maintain
its leadership in brazil and angola, but simultaneously aims to secure new, suitable projects in geographical
areas such as the far east, australia, north sea, mexico, and west africa to diversify its geographic spread,
while also keeping its high-end positioning.



better risk / reward balance
with increasing complexity and technical risk characterising the market, recent risk-adjusted returns in the fpso
sector have proved unsustainable and a call for a more appropriate risk/reward profile. it therefore remains a main
objective for the company to grow selectively, and lead the industry in improving the risk and reward balance.
the fact that the company remains the largest and most experienced player in a niche market with high barriers
to entry should allow the company to become increasingly selective in its bidding policy. additionally, the
company has initiated a review of country-specific risk exposure and set its risk appetite.

more specifically, the company intends to achieve a better risk/reward balance by continuing its dialogue with
clients on risk-sharing and only tendering for fpso projects that meet its stringent risk-return profile. ultimately,
the company’s risk appetite and risk management will be inextricably linked with its strategy.



partnerships
entering into partnerships will contribute to the company’s ability to finance continued growth of its lease fleet as
well as in developing the local content component of fpso projects.

current key commercial partners include sonangol, misc, qgog and gepetrol; key financial partners include
mitsubishi corporation, nyk and itochu; key technical partners include dsme and synergy. key technology
partners include linde, ivanhoe energy and compactgtl. long-term equity alliances are becoming particularly
important as the scale and capital requirements of future projects increase.

the company will continue to enter into partnerships in order to improve its chances of securing new business
and add value to its performance in the long run.



divestment of non-core activities
in line with the focused strategy around fpsos, the company has continued its divestment of non-core assets
throughout the year.

the sale and leaseback of a part of the company's monaco office portfolio has progressed, with sale and lease
back transactions completed for two of three buildings. the remaining building is now expected to be sold in
2014. sales proceeds thus far exceed us$100 million, resulting in a book profit of us$27 million.

the sale of the dscv sbm installer, a new build diving support and construction vessel will be pursued during

2014.



talent management – growing talent in order to grow our company
the company operates in a market where competition for increasingly scarce talent is fierce. it therefore remains
a significant priority for the company to focus on talent development, in order to secure the necessary skills and
capabilities for the future and maintain its technology leadership. consequently, numerous internal initiatives
have been progressed and continue to be initiated in order to fulfill the company’s ambition to become an
excellent training ground for newly educated engineers and other graduates, as well as for more senior people
within the organisation. for example, the company implemented a customised leadership and management
development (lmd) programme and a middle management development programme (mdp). additionally, efforts
have been, and continue to be targeted at improving succession planning and mobility schemes. read more
about talent management



customer centricity – valuing customers to build value
throughout the year, efforts have been targeted at improving organisational structures and procedures guiding
how the company engages with clients in order to establish best possible collaboration and value creation for
everyone involved. amongst others, a new client management process system has been formalised with
assigned gates and responsibilities to ensure the most effective interaction. furthermore, the company has
organised client technology days, a forum for client alignment and discussion on technology trends and
opportunities. the purpose of these is to focus on value creation and improve commerciality and competitive
advantage.

as implementation proceeds, the company expects considerable benefits to be reaped from these initiatives,
particularly in terms of project execution, operational excellence and technology insight. additionally, it remains
the company’s belief that improved client interaction will contribute to greater alignment of views on the
appropriate risk/reward balance, in a manner beneficial to the company and its stakeholders.



technology leadership – defining the market instead of being
defined
the company has an outstanding reputation as a technology leader for large and complex fpsos, as well as
turrets and mooring systems, on which the company continues to build. to maintain this leading position, the
strong focus on talent management and the customer is coupled with continued emphasis on p&td (product and
technology development). in addition, investment has been targeted at formalising p&td processes, to ensure
the best possible investment allocation and commerciality of initiatives. the company believes that these efforts,
further enhanced by improved feedback, are likely to result in improved customer collaboration and will start
to translate into shareholder value over the medium term.

1.5.3 corporate sustainability strategy

introduction
in 2013, the company strengthened its commitment to sustainability through the creation of the sustainability
group function reporting to the chief governance and compliance officer. the function has been created to help
the company meet its business objectives while ensuring that the stakeholder communities see benefits today
and in the future.

the company strives to achieve this by developing its business based on the shared value of economic, social
and environmental performance. the company believes in being an employer of choice for employees who are
committed to assisting in the implementation of sustainable objectives.

the company is committed to the triple p concept;          people, planet, and profit:

people- this means improving people’s lives today while also taking into account future generations with an
emphasis on safety, education and well-being of sbm employees and partners;

planet- this means developing technical, innovative solutions to reduce the environmental impact throughout the
supply chain and by optimising on-going operations;

profit- this means that activities need to be economically sustainable as well as being conducted in an ethical
manner.

the company will continue to engage with its stakeholders to develop sustainable business solutions with these
factors in mind.

the rules and guidelines set out in the group’s code of conduct dictate policy and objectives for sustainable
development within the company.

specific focus will be directed to the following objectives as per the company’s strategic plan:


  • be an employer of choice for employees committed to sustainability objectives through integration of the core values:
     working as one, performing, and shaping the future
  • create a strong sustainability culture throughout the company
  • reinforce adherence to the code of conduct with clients, partners and suppliers
  • focus on the supply chain to minimise environmental impact
  • reduce environmental impact through innovative eco technology solutions, through optimisation and lifecycle solutions for
     fleet operations
  • develop local initiatives and local content in a sustainable manner
  • create social opportunities in local communities where the company operates
  • initiate and/or support sustainable social development programs for local communities.

the company will also focus on expanding its sustainability reporting scope with a high level of transparency. it
will identify material key performance indicators (kpis) and measure their performance against set targets of the
sustainability business drivers.

objectives
the company has identified additional areas in which it can have an impact on sustainable business
development with appropriate objectives. these objectives will provide a clear focus for future sustainability
initiatives and sustainability reporting. these objectives are as follows: reporting, external assurance, strategic
analysis and disclosure.

reporting

the company publishes an annual sustainability report which is incorporated into the annual report.

the report contains data and kpis calculated using existing reporting systems. the information is compiled and
consolidated using an automated web-based system and considers the implications of results reported and
provides updates on active sustainability initiatives throughout the company.

the company reports at global reporting initiative (gri) level c in accordance with gri guidelines.

external assurance

an external auditor verifies the company’s sustainability data providing external limited assurance including:


  • atmospheric emissions
  • lost time injury frequency rate
  • energy consumption
  • waste generation

the third party verification report will be available in may 2014 in the sustainability section of the company’s
website.

strategic analysis

to benchmark its practices, the company participates in the annual dow jones sustainability index (djsi)
assessment. for the fourth consecutive year, the company has been selected to feature in the index. read more

1.6 assurances
the discussion of risk management in chapter 3.5 and the discussion of compliance in chapter 2.5 reflect a
greater focus within the company on the so-called three lines of defence:


  • the first line of defence consists of the various policies, codes, company standards and other rules and procedures as
     captured in the company’s general management system (gms) and the manner in which the line managers incorporate
     these in the performance of their duties and responsibilities;


  • the second line of defence is formed by the functions that have as their primary task to assist in the roll-out and
     observation of all that is contained in gms and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. functions such as hsse and
     quality control but also group financial control, risk and compliance play an important role in ensuring best practice in
     each of their respective disciplines;


  • internal audit is the group function that is mostly engaged in the third line of defence activities. through the audits that are
     part of the annual audit plan and any specific audit undertaken as circumstances require, internal audit investigates
     whether activities performed have been carried out in compliance with the relevant external and internal applicable
     standards.


internal audit’s regular reports to the audit committee ensure that the highest levels of management in the
company are made aware of the general condition of assurance.

1.7 group management systems and compliance table
the group management systems for project execution and for fpso operations are based on the following
internationally recognised standards and regulations:


     • iso 9001: 2008 quality management system.
     • iso 14001: 2004 environmental management systems.
     • ohsas 18001: 2007 occupational health and management systems.
     • sbm offshore social accountability manual (compatible with sa8000 social accountability).
     • marpol regulations: 2002.
     • ism/isps codes (international safety management / international ship and port facility security).

within the odyssey 24 transformation programme, the two currently applicable management systems will be
integrated into one system, which will be applicable for all sbm offshore operations. read more about odyssey
24

the integrated management system gems (global enterprise management system) will follow the above
international codes and standards, and will in addition follow process safety management standards.



1.7.1 quality management
the group management system and its related procedures are consistently applied in all execution centres.
these entities are audited twice a year by the american bureau of shipping quality evaluation (abs qe). all are
iso 9001:2008 certified through one group iso certificate.

the company aims to ensure that sbm offshore do brasil and sbm operations, also become iso 9001:2008
certified, respectively in 2014 and 2016 following the implementation of the revised framework of procedures.



1.7.2 environment
the company implements iso 14001 and seeks accreditation voluntarily. implementation started in brazil in
2009 and continued in 2013 with the recently installed units in operation, fpso cidade de anchieta and fpso
being accredited against iso14001.



1.7.3 health, safety and security
the group’s fleet management system complies with the international safety management (ism) standard and
the international ship and port facility security (isps) code, which is a mandatory requirement.

the company voluntarily aims to ensure that its operations comply with the occupational health and safety
standard (ohsas) 18001, which requires all shore bases and operating units to verify occupational health and
safety practices.

deep panuke and the shore base supporting its operations are expected to receive ohsas 18001 and iso
14001 certification in 2014.

the more recent installed units in operation, fpso cidade de anchieta and fpso cidade de paraty were
accredited against ohsas 18001 in 2013.

for cidade de paraty ism and isps accreditation was achieved in 2013.



1.7.4 employment standards
the company endeavours to match the highest level of employment standards for all its employees in-line with
the group’s code of conduct and social accountability manual. these standards meet and most often exceed
international human rights and international labour guidelines.

the company does not tolerate child or forced labour, and does not support or work with companies that sustain
forced or compulsory labour, in compliance with the un universal declaration of human rights, the ilo
conventions, the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises and its own code of conduct.



1.7.5 social accountability
the company is presently taking steps to ensure all operations offices comply with the group’s social
accountability manual standard, which is based on sa8000 standards. the standard was implemented in brazil
in 2009, equatorial guinea and malaysia in 2011, and angola in 2012.

when the company implemented sa8000 in 2006, social accountability international (sai) informed the sa8000
advisory board that verification of the standard would not be allowed in myanmar, until the international labour
organisation (ilo) lifted its sanctions. consequently, a decision was taken to continue the implementation using
an in-house social accountability manual, based on the sa8000 framework, which also requires regular,
transparent auditing of the company’s suppliers and subcontractors in myanmar.

following an independent audit by bureau veritas, the social accountability certificate for myanmar was issued
in february 2010.

2.2 report of the supervisory board
2.2.1 message from the chairman of the supervisory board
dear shareholders,

as chairman of the supervisory board of sbm offshore n.v., i am pleased to present you this report of the
supervisory board for 2013.

key areas of attention of the supervisory board in its supervision of the management board were the resolution of
the legacy projects, the potentially improper sales practices and the strengthening of the company’s balance
sheet.

yme project

the supervisory board, directly and through its audit committee and technical and commercial committee was
kept fully up to date by the management board throughout the different stages of the negotiations with the client
of the yme project and received regular reports on the financial consequences of the transaction being negotiated
and the terms of the settlement agreement which the management board was able to reach as announced on 12
march 2013.

strengthening the company's vwdwhphqwriilqdqfldosrvlwlrq

on 20 december 2012 the company achieved a successful private placement of 9.95% of newly issued shares to
hal investments b.v.. reaching a settlement agreement with talisman energy norge as was a condition
precedent for a 10% rights offering fully underwritten by hal which received the approval at the agm of 2 april
2013 and which was successfully launched on 3 april 2013.

the divestment program of non-core business assets continued and will further strengthen the company’s
statement of financial position.

potentially improper sales practices

the internal investigation into potentially improper sales practices is ongoing and the company is in active
dialogue with the relevant authorities. the supervisory board monitored the implementation of the new
compliance structure which has been put in place by the management board.

new orders

the supervisory board was pleased to see that the company secured important orders, notably two fpso’s for
petrobras and one for shell.

speaking on behalf of my colleagues in the supervisory board, i am pleased to see that the turnaround which
was started in 2012 has manifested itself in the year under review and the actions taken by the management
board, under the supervisory board’s close supervision, have started bearing fruit enabling the company to close
the year with a profit and to move to 2014 on a stronger footing.

2.2.2 activities of the supervisory board
during the course of the year under review, the supervisory board held six meetings according to a pre-set
schedule. the first meeting of the year was for reasons of efficiency, a combined meeting of the supervisory
board and of the audit committee. the management board prepares detailed supporting documents and attends
the formal meetings of the supervisory board. the regular meetings last about five hours. pre-set meetings are
usually spread over two days, starting on the first day with the meetings of the audit committee, the technical
and commercial committee and the appointment and remuneration committee (a&rc). the company
secretary is the secretary of the supervisory board and its sub-committees. each of the regular supervisory
board meetings is preceded by a pre-meeting to which the ceo and, as the case may be, other members of the
management board are invited. the pre-meeting is meant to enhance the effectiveness of the formal supervisory
board meeting of the next day, taking into account the outcome of the sub-committee meetings which took place
during the first day.

with the exception of mr. r. van gelder who was prevented from attending two supervisory board meetings and
meetings of the technical & commercial committee for health reasons, and mr f.g.h. deckers for one of the
supervisory board meetings, the supervisory directors attended all of the regular supervisory board meetings
and the sub-committee meetings, physically or in exceptional cases by phone.

subjects reviewed at the sub-committee meetings cover the list of standard items set out in the regulations of the
respective committees. these regulations are published on the company website. standard items on the agenda
of the supervisory board are:


  • a review of the health, safety, security and environment performance in the period under review;
  • an update of the management board on
       • the operational and financial performance
       • the commercial prospects
       • corporate governance and compliance including risk management

     sub-committee meetings.
  • approval of the minutes of the preceding meeting or the record note of conference calls and various housekeeping
     matters.

2.2.3 the supervisory board committees
audit committee
the audit committee convened for five regular meetings in 2013 of which one was combined with a meeting of
the supervisory board. the regular audit committee meetings are held the day prior to the supervisory board
meeting, where the audit committee chairman reports on the principal issues discussed, on actions arising and
the follow-up on such actions and makes recommendations on those matters requiring a decision by the
supervisory board. meetings last three to four hours. the management board, the group internal audit manager,
the group controller and the external auditor attend the meetings. there were regular private meetings of the
audit committee with the external auditor without management being present.

the main items discussed during the year under review were, besides the standard topics:


  • the introduction of directional reporting of financials next to the ifrs reporting
  • the yme settlement negotiations and settlement agreement and its impact on the company’s financials

the audit committee pays specific attention to risk management. at each meeting a risk and opportunity report
is presented and discussed and the audit committee liaises with the technical and commercial committee
where the technical and project execution risks are discussed. overall the standard of the audit team, the audit
process and fees, and the interaction with the company’s personnel were all found satisfactory given the size,
complexity and risk profile of the company.

in compliance with the new dutch audit profession act (wab) the management board has initiated a selection
process with the aim to submit a proposal for appointment of a new external audit firm at the agm of 2014. the

numerous conference calls and additional meetings to discuss progress on the development of remuneration
policy for 2015 and beyond (rp2015) and succession matters. the meetings of the appointment and
remuneration committee are held prior to the supervisory board meetings. the respective chairmen report on
the selection and appointment matters and on the remuneration matters reviewed by the committee, on actions
arising and the follow-up of such actions. they make recommendations on those matters requiring a decision of
the supervisory board. the meetings are attended by the management board and the group hr director, except
where the committee chooses to discuss matters in private. meetings last approximately three hours. in addition,
several conference calls were held on remuneration of the management board under the existing rp2011 as

2.3 remuneration report
dear shareholders,

 as chairman of the appointment and remuneration committee (“a&rc”), dealing with remuneration matters, i
am pleased to present you this remuneration report.



2.3.1 remuneration of the management board
in 2010, the a&rc conducted a detailed review of the remuneration policy 2008 to ensure continued alignment
with the company’s strategic priorities, remuneration principles, external market developments and best
practices. based on the outcome of this evaluation, a new remuneration policy (‘rp2011’) was designed. at the
annual general meeting (‘agm’) of shareholders dated 5 may 2011, rp 2011 was adopted. for a detailed
description of rp2011, reference is made to the 2011 annual report, pages 35-41.

rp2011 was then amended at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (egm) held on 27 june 2012,
by the adoption of rp2011aa (“aa” connoting “as amended”). the amendments in rp2011aa were specifically
designed to overcome the rigidity of the variable remuneration parameters of rp2011, which was an impediment
to the appropriate remuneration of a new management board, all of who were appointed in the course of 2012,
and who faced the challenging task of achieving a turnaround of the company. for a detailed description of
rp2011aa, reference is made to the 2012 annual report, pages 34-36.

rp2011aa applies to the board of management which consisted of the management board, being the ceo, the
cfo and the cgco as statutory directors, plus the coo (until his dismissal on 7 november 2013) and the cto
(until the revision of the senior management structure on 3 december 2013) as non-statutory directors. disclosure
of the remuneration was and will remain limited to the remuneration of the management board members. going
forward and with the discontinuation of the board of management committee on 3 december 2013, rp2011aa for
the remainder of its term and rp2015 will apply to the management board members only, being the statutory
directors of the company.

the a&rc has recognised that it would be inappropriate to retain certain of the measures that were introduced in
rp2011aa, such as the special incentive, after the end of the turnaround period as those were designed to
govern the turnaround years of 2012, 2013 and 2014. following the positive resolution of a number of the
company’s legacy project issues and the successful strengthening of the company’s statement of financial
position (through a private placement of 9.95% new shares to hal investments b.v. on 20 december 2012, and
the 10% rights offering of new ordinary shares of 3 april 2013), it is expected that the turnaround will be largely
completed by the start of 2015. accordingly, the a&rc decided that it will be necessary to revise rp2011aa with
the aim to develop a robust, sustainable remuneration policy for 2015 and beyond (to be called rp2015).
shareholders’ approval of the rp 2015 will be sought at the agm of 17 april 2014.

2.3.2 remuneration policy rp2011aa and remuneration
components
base salary

base salaries for the management board are determined by the supervisory board upon the recommendation of
the a&rc and after consideration of various factors as explained in detail in the annual report 2011. during the
course of 2013, the a&rc reviewed the implementation of rp2011aa and engaged a specialist remuneration
consultant to carry out a remuneration benchmarking study. this study showed that the base salary of the ceo
was not compliant with the rp2011aa principle of remunerating at the median of the peer group and required an
increase.the a&rc recommended raising the ceo’s base salary from €677,200 p.a. to €800,000 p.a. effective 1
july 2013 and the supervisory board endorsed this recommendation.

peer group

each year, the a&rc evaluates the peer group based on market circumstances (mergers, acquisitions,
de-listings, etc.) and recommends adjustments to the supervisory board for approval.in 2013, the peer group
remained the same as in 2012 and consisted of the following 18 companies:

short term incentive (sti)

the sti is designed to reward management board members for the previous year’s company performance and



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                             34

for their individual performance against pre-set performance targets. a minimum 1/3 of the sti opportunity is
based on company performance, and a maximum 2/3 of the sti opportunity is based on individual performance.
the appropriate split between the percentage attributable to company and individual performance is set by the
supervisory board upon recommendation of the a&rc at the beginning of each financial year for each director
based on his specific responsibilities, and in particular during these turnaround years taking into account the
extent to which each is responsible for legacy projects and compliance enhancement.

the table below shows the percentages of base salary that can be earned depending on the score achieved by
each individual director compared to targets.

80% of the sti pay-out is paid in cash and 20% is mandatorily paid in company shares. these sti shares are
restricted for a period of three years. at the end of the restriction period and subject to continued employment, the
company awards an additional unrestricted matching share for every sti share held (1:1 match).

sti pay-out in 2013 on account of performance in 2012

in the annual report 2012, disclosure was made of the company performance element which given the negative
results shown in the annual accounts 2012 were not met and therefore it was determined by the supervisory
board upon recommendation of the a&rc that no sti payment would be made related to company performance
in 2012. the individual performance of each member of the management board was scored against the pre-set
personal objectives. these objectives were based on the following pillars: (i) work as one, (ii) perform and (iii)
shape the future and can be summarized as specific goals related to the following critical activities:


   • effectively implementing the new organisation structure and change programme
   • strengthening the company’s balance sheet
   • managing the legacy projects
   • embedding compliance throughout the company
   • improving the company’s safety performance

the a&rc evaluated each management board member’s individual performance and recommended a score
which was endorsed by the supervisory board. this resulted in a pay-out of the sti as indicated in the table
below.

    sti payable in 2014 on account of performance in 2013

the sti relating to the performance year 2013 is based on the economic profit (ep) of the year 2013, i.e. return
on average capital employed (roace) exceeding an assumed weighted average cost of capital (wacc),
adjusted as appropriate for exceptional items and extraordinary circumstances. the company performance
criteria which have a weight of 1/3 of the 2013 sti opportunity, have been scored at 160% for the ceo and 130%
for the cfo and cgco, resulting in a company performance share in the sti of 52.8% for the ceo and 42.9%
for the cfo and the cgco. the individual objectives for management board members in 2013 were similar to
those set for 2012, recognizing that 2013 is the second of what is expected to be a three year turnaround period
for the company. individual performance had a weight of 2/3 of the 2013 sti opportunity and the supervisory
board, acting on the advice of the a&rc, resolved to score the individual performance for each one of the
management board members at maximum, thus rewarding the teamwork approach taken by the management
board in delivering on each member’s individual objectives which resulted in tangible results for the company and
its shareholders. pay-out of the sti in 2014 on account of performance in the year 2013 is therefore as follows:

csr multiplier

in its business plan and performance objectives, the management board has specific operational health, safety,
security and environment (“hsse”) objectives. as mentioned at the egm of 27 june 2012, however, due to the
urgency and priority of achieving the operational and financial business objectives of the company, no other
specific csr objectives were set for the purpose of the csr multiplier in 2012. since the csr multiplier is
calculated as a multiple of the company performance element that, in 2012, was nil, the csr multiplier outcome
was equally nil, despite a marked improvement in hsse performance.

hsse performance in the year 2013 was assessed and the supervisory board, on advice of the a&rc, scored
the csr multiplier at 100%. consequently, this score does not modify the sti payable in 2014 on account of
performance in 2013.

long term incentive (lti)

the lti is designed to reward superior long-term corporate financial performance and shareholder returns and to
enhance management retention and commitment.

threshold, target and maximum lti opportunities expressed as a percentage of base salary are as follows:

at the start of each year performance shares are conditionally awarded at the target level of base salary. the
target number of performance shares conditionally awarded is determined by dividing the lti target opportunity
outlined in the table above by the average closing price of the company shares over the five trading days
following the date of publication of the final results for the previous financial year. at the end of the three-year
performance period performance against agreed targets is assessed and scored by the supervisory board acting
upon the recommendation of the a&rc, and the target number of performance shares is adjusted upwards or
downwards based on that assessment to arrive at the final number of shares awarded.

in 2013, following the successful rights issue in april, in accordance with the lti performance share regulations
which are posted on the company website, the a&rc recommended and the supervisory board endorsed
increasing the number of conditionally awarded shares by 1.9187%, being the theoretical ex rights price
correction factor as applied by euronext amsterdam for the adjustment of derivatives pursuant to the nyse
euronext corporate actions policy for the euronext derivatives markets.

   • 50% of the lti award vests based on eps growth adjusted for exceptional items if so determined by the supervisory
      board, acting on the advice of the a&r committee, and
   • 50% of the lti award vests based on tsr relative to the peer group. the company uses the same peer group for
      benchmarking remuneration as well as for comparing the tsr performance

   • special incentive (si): the supervisory board was given the power to award si’s to individual directors based on the
      achievement of predefined goals set by the supervisory board. the si, introduced in 2012, only allows for vesting of lti
      shares up to but not exceeding the maximum lti opportunity as set out in the table above. the si performance metrics
      which were predefined before the beginning of the performance period 2012 – 2014, and 2013 – 2015 will be disclosed in

      conditional awards made in 2013


when assessing, early in 2016, the vesting conditions of the lti shares conditionally awarded in 2013, the
supervisory board intends to fully take into account the achievements so far of the management board, both
collectively and individually, having:


   • taken control of the legacy projects generally and having, in particular, reached a full and final settlement with the client of
      the yme project
   • strengthened the company’s balance sheet with record levels of project financing, the introduction of a well-respected
      corner stone investor (hal investments b.v.) and a successful rights offering of 10% new shares; and
   • refocused the business on fpsos and achieved a very strong order intake with three new vessels so far, leading to a
      record order book

the average closing price of the company share over the five trading days following the date of publication of the
final results for the financial year 2013 was € 11.874. the number of conditional shares awarded to the

the total remuneration of the members of the supervisory board amounted to € 567,000 (2012: € 615,000). for
the individual remuneration, please refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements (reported in us$).
these amounts are gross (i.e. before tax) amounts per year.

the supervisory board and sub-committee fee levels are to be reviewed every second year. a review was due to
be carried out in 2012 but the supervisory board, on the advice of the a&rc, concluded that it would not be
appropriate to revise supervisory board remuneration at that time. in 2014 the a&rc has, with the assistance of
its own remuneration consultant and other advisors, reviewed the existing fee levels led by the consideration that
the supervisory board will only be in a position to fulfill the demands of its tasks if its approach to supervisory
board work is commensurate with today’s broad and global requirements, for which it needs to attract
internationally oriented, qualified and expert persons. this review recognized that the level of remuneration on
offer must be such that the company remains competitive in recruiting in the relevant international market. the
existing fees, which have remained unchanged since the egm of 2010, were benchmarked against supervisory
board and committee fees at aex companies and at relevant international companies, and were compared with
the current market trends. based on this work, it was concluded that certain changes are required and a
proposal to that effect will be submitted at the agm of 2015.

i am looking forward to answering any questions which may arise from this report at the agm of 17 april 2014.

yours faithfully,

francis r. gugen

financial objectives designed to implement the strategy. the company’s strategy plan 2014 – 2016 which

at the meeting of 18 december 2013. the 2014 budget was formally adopted at the february 2014 meeting of the
supervisory board.

appointment of a member of the management board (managing director)

managing directors are appointed by the general meeting of shareholders (gm). a managing director is
appointed for a maximum period of four years, and unless a managing director resigns earlier, his/her
appointment period shall end on the day of the first annual general meeting (agm) that will be held four years
after the appointment. a managing director may be reappointed for further consecutive terms of up to four years
each.

in case of an appointment of one or more managing directors, the supervisory board may make a binding or a

supervisory board to make a proposal for at least one alternative candidate within sixty days so that for each
appointment a choice can be made between at least two candidates. the supervisory board has resolved not to
use the option of making a binding proposal for the appointment of managing directors unless in situations of
threatened or actual unsolicited takeover.

the gm may at all times overrule the binding nature of a proposal by a resolution adopted by an absolute majority
of the votes cast, provided such majority represents at least one-third of the issued share capital. if one-third of
the capital is not represented at the meeting, but an absolute majority of the votes cast is in favour of a resolution
to cancel the binding nature of a nomination, a new meeting may be convened at which the resolution may be
passed by an absolute majority of the votes cast, regardless of the proportion of the capital represented at the
meeting. if a binding nomination has not been made, the gm may appoint a managing director at its discretion.

maintain the suspension, failing which the suspension shall cease. a resolution to maintain the suspension may
be adopted only once and the suspension may be maintained for a period not exceeding three months as from
the day on which the gm has passed the resolution to maintain the suspension. if the gm has not resolved within
the period set for maintaining the suspension, either to remove the managing director or to set aside the

code and the supervisory board rules which are published on the company’s website. in the performance of its
duties the supervisory board is guided by the interests of the stakeholders of the company, and the enterprises

to be appointed, the supervisory board may make a binding or a non-binding proposal, as referred to in the
articles of association. as far as a binding nomination is concerned, the proposal should offer the choice between
at least two candidates.

in case a binding proposal is made, the gm may at all times overrule the binding nature thereof by a resolution
adopted by an absolute majority of the votes cast, provided such majority represents at least one-third of the
issued share capital. if this proportion of the capital of at least one-third is not represented at the meeting, but an
absolute majority of the votes cast is in favour of a resolution to cancel the binding nature of a nomination, a new
meeting may be convened. at that meeting, the resolution may be passed by an absolute majority of the votes

board compliance
regulations concerning ownership of and transactions in shares
the supervisory board and management board rules contain a provision with regard to the ownership of and
transactions in shares in the company and in shares of dutch listed companies other than sbm offshore n.v..
this provision prohibits trading in shares other than those of the company on the basis of share price sensitive
information obtained in the course of managing or supervising the company’s businesses. for information about
the shares (or other financial instruments) held in sbm offshore n.v. by members of the management board,
refer to note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.



conflicts of interest
management board
the members of the management board have a services contract with sbm offshore n.v.. in these contracts it is
stipulated that members of the management board may not compete with the company. in addition, the
management board rules and the code of conduct of the company regulate conflict of interest matters and are
applicable to members of the management board and other employees.

the company’s code of conduct does not permit employees and directors to accept gifts of value for themselves
or their relatives, to provide advantages to third parties to the detriment of the company or to take advantage of
business opportunities to which sbm offshore is entitled.

a recently enacted law further enhances the prevention of conflicts of interests and these provisions apply to the
supervisory board and the management board of the company.

the members of the management board did not report any conflict of interest during the year 2013.

supervisory board
all supervisory board members are independent from the company within the meaning of best practice provision
iii.2.2 of the code. none of the members are on the management board of a dutch listed company in which a
member of the management board of the company is a supervisory board member. there are no interlocking
directorships. none of the members represent directly or indirectly a shareholder of the company or a supplier or
customer of the company. none of the members of the supervisory board provides any services to or has any
direct or indirect ties with the company outside his/her supervisory board membership. mr f. deckers is
chairman of the supervisory board of deloitte nederland b.v. and therefore the audit committee recommended,
and the supervisory board resolved not to invite deloitte to participate in the tender to become the new external
auditor of the company, the appointment of which was submitted to the agm of 2014.



mandates with third parties
the company is fully compliant with best practice ii.1.8 of the dutch corporate governance code, acceptance
by the members of the management board of no more than two mandates as a supervisory board member of a
listed company requires the prior approval of the supervisory board to prevent conflicts of interest and
reputational risks. other appointments of material importance need to be notified to the supervisory board.
members of the management board are also appointed to the statutory board of the company’s operational
entities.



loans or guarantees
no loans or guarantees have been provided to members of the management board.



code of conduct and reporting of alleged irregularities
the company has a code of conduct which was updated in january 2010 and is posted on the company’s
website. the company also has a procedure allowing employees to report alleged irregularities with respect to
the code without jeopardising their employment position. the management board decided to create a freephone
or web-based reporting facility (the sbm offshore integrity line) which employees can use - anonymously if they
wish - in their own language. the facility is operated by an external provider, people intouch.

the company continues to enhance a number of its anti-corruption initiatives, including:


  • code of conduct containing a section on the use of agents and commercial relations with public officials
  • anti-corruption policy and compliance guide
  • due diligence and third party vetting procedures
  • rules of conduct to report suspected irregularities, including a hotline “sbm offshore integrity line”
  • internal audit anti-corruption modules for third party audits and sbm companies
  • internal training sessions and e-learning courses

company and its stakeholders. the foundation will perform its role, and take all actions required, at its sole
discretion. in the exercise of its functions it will however be guided by the interests of the company and the
business enterprises connected with it, and all other stakeholders, including shareholders and employees.

the foundation is managed by a board, the composition of which is intended to ensure that an independent
judgment may be made as to the interests of the company. the board consists of a number of experienced and
reputable former senior executives of multinational companies. to be kept informed about the business and
interest of the company, the ceo and/or the cgco is invited to attend the foundation meetings to address this

to one half of the voting rights carried by the ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the

desirable.

the option was granted on 30 march 1989. in accordance with the by-laws of the company, shareholders were
advised of the reasons for granting this option in the extraordinary gm of 28 april 1989.

in the same option agreement the foundation granted a put option to the company and the company has
decided on 3 march 2011 to definitively waive its rights under the put option. in the course of 2011, the option
agreement was amended and restated to reflect the waiver by the company of its put option and the change of
the nominal value of the protective preference shares from eur 1 to eur 0.25 and the related increase in the
number of protective preference shares as per the amended articles of association of the company.

in the joint opinion of the supervisory board, the management board and the foundation board members, the

2.5 compliance
2.5.1 compliance objectives
the company is committed to conducting its business activities in an honest, ethical, respectful, and professional
manner. its ability to achieve sustainable business success is reliant on the company’s commitment to
maintaining the highest standards of professional and ethical behaviour, and compliance with laws.

in april 2012, in order to enhance compliance as part of the corporate culture, a chief governance and
compliance officer (cgco) position was created. the cgco is member of the management board (mb) and
regularly reports in the management board and to the supervisory board on the current status of the company’s
compliance activities.



2.5.2 compliance programme and organisation
the company has further enhanced its compliance programme to protect the company and its employees from
wrong decisions and to promote a culture of transparency and ownership. in the following paragraphs the
activities will be described per category, i.e. anti-corruption initiatives, third party integrity management and
competition law compliance.

a compliance department has been established to drive the implementation and execution of the group’s
compliance programme, and to ensure the systematic integration of compliance aspects into the company’s
business processes. the compliance department consists of five permanent members of staff. to further
develop the compliance organisation, local compliance champions have been appointed in all execution centres.
these champions are the point of contact for compliance issues, within their execution centre, and act as the
interface between the execution centre and the group compliance department. they also support local
management in adhering to the group’s policies and its compliance programme.



2.5.3 anti-corruption initiatives
the company continues to progress on its anti-corruption initiatives, such as:


  • in the code of conduct: a section on the use of agents and commercial relations with public officials (an anti-corruption
     policy and a compliance guide), the promulgation of rules of conduct to report suspected irregularities, including use of
     the “sbm offshore integrity line”
  • internal audit anti-corruption modules for third party audits
  • internal training sessions and e-learning courses
  • the use of standard contracts and anti-corruption and conflict of interest clauses in contracts
  • increase of internal controls, following icofr principles




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                         52

2.5.4 third party integrity management
in 2012, the company fundamentally revised and improved its procedure for identifying and mitigating integrity
risks with regard to sales intermediaries. the procedure includes intensive due diligence on existing and new
sales intermediaries as well as tightened internal controls around transactions involving sales intermediaries. the
due diligence on sales intermediaries is approved by a newly established validation committee consisting of
members of the management board and the sales director and the group controller. this procedure is a key
element of the group’s third party integrity management.

in 2014, the company expects to start risk-based due diligence on supply chain vendors within the framework of
its supplier qualification process.



2.5.5 competition law
in the course of 2013 competition law compliance guidelines were developed and discussed in face-to-face
training sessions with higher management levels, including senior members of the sales department. to reinforce
these guidelines, a module for the e-learning course will be developed. this is meant to increase awareness of
proper practice in the context of competitive bidding and other relevant settings.



2.5.6 communications and training
employees of the company are continually informed about the importance of ethical behaviour and compliance.
senior management regularly issue statements promoting compliance at events, as well as in internal
communications and online media.

in addition, the company provides a comprehensive programme of compliance training. in 2013 employees
received web-based training on the prevention of corruption, and employees received in-depth classroom training
provided in 23 sessions on corruption prevention. it is the intention during 2014 to start compliance training in the
company’s major joint ventures in angola and brazil.



2.5.7 point of contact
employees of the company are encouraged to contact the compliance department to seek clarification or to
report any concerns regarding compliance. in addition, employees can raise concerns anonymously by calling the
sbm offshore integrity line. the integrity line is a hotline operated by an external provider and available in all
relevant languages for employees wishing to bring to the attention of management any perceived breaches of the
company's code of conduct and other procedures. since its inception, a number of incidents were reported
which were investigated.

2.5.8 internal controls
the company is committed to ensuring that its anti-corruption related polices and guidelines are properly applied
and monitored throughout the company. the company has supplemented its current internal control framework
by additional anti-corruption specific controls. recommendations for improvements to the controls from an
international accountants firm were implemented in the course of 2013. the proper execution of these controls
will be tested by the group’s internal audit function.



2.5.9 regulatory compliance
the regulatory compliance function has created a process to ensure that the offshore facilities of all company
projects comply with all applicable conditions of project regulatory approval, host government regulations,
statutes, and permitting requirements. once established, all applicable regulatory requirements are shared with
relevant functions such as engineering, construction, supply chain and hsse. regulatory compliance also
coordinates the activities of the functions involved to safeguard that projects conform to all regulatory
requirements throughout their lifecycle.

the regulatory compliance function also has responsibility for coordinating the classification process.
compliance with the classification society rules in accordance with respective assigned class notations is
defined and achieved according to respective project terms and conditions.

the regulatory compliance team is divided between the group function and the company’s various execution
centres and this discipline is acknowledged throughout the cycle of the company’s activities.



2.5.10 investigation
in april 2012 the company reported that it had become aware of certain sales practices involving third parties
which may have been improper. as reported in the company's press release published on 28 march 2013,
outside counsel and forensic accountants were engaged to investigate these practices thoroughly and the
company also took the necessary steps designed to terminate any such practices. the company is in active
dialogue with the relevant authorities. the investigation is still ongoing. consequently, at this point it is not
possible to provide an estimate of the financial effect or information on possible cash outflows such as fines and
penalties, if any. on 7 february 2014, the company issued a press release anticipating questions that might be
raised as a result of a wikipedia posting by a disgruntled former employee. on 10 february 2014, the company
published on its website a facts summary on the investigation.

3 report of the management board
3.1 report of the management board – introduction
2013 was a year of significant achievements for the company. during the early months, the company
successfully resolved challenging legacy issues and significantly strengthened its financial position. within the
operations, the reconfiguration of resources around an exclusively fpso-led strategy has renewed the
company's sense of purpose. these gains taken together have paved the way for securing an increasing share of
high-end, technologically complex projects.

in a decisive move to remedy outstanding legacy issues, the company reached final agreement with talisman
                                              tm
energy to decommission the yme mopustor platform for a settlement by the company of us$470 million in
march. this contribution covered the termination of existing agreements and arbitration procedures and the
decommissioning of the platform. as the company had already taken a provision of us$200 million for
decommissioning costs in december 2012, the balance of us$270 million was recognised in the first half of 2013,
with the total cash settlement of us$470 million paid to talisman during the first quarter.

responsibility for decommissioning and barge-loading the platform now falls to talisman, to be completed no
later than 2016. the company will take charge of transporting the platform to a yard for scrapping.

following several months of installation works to safely bring the platform to full production capacity, the deep
panuke platform was commissioned in december, prompting production acceptance and the start of the lease
contract.

meanwhile, the internal investigation into potentially improper sales practices, announced in the second quarter
2012, is on-going. the company is in active dialogue with the relevant authorities.

the company’s financial position was significantly strengthened in april, following a successful 1 for 10 rights
offering, of which 97.7% was taken up by existing shareholders, and the remainder subscribed and paid for by
hal investments b.v., raising us$247 million in total.

the company had also received an additional payment of us$27 million from hal as a result of the announced
settlement with talisman. this was paid in cash as a share premium contribution on the shares hal acquired
through a private placement in december 2012, according to a pre-agreed formula.

raising capital in this manner was complemented by the non-core asset disposal programme, which continued
during 2013, in line with group strategy. in december 2013, the company reported a sale and lease back
transaction and a sale and purchase agreement for two of three office buildings it owns in monaco. the remaining
building is now expected to be sold in 2014. sales proceeds thus far exceed us$100 million, resulting in a book
profit of us$27 million. this process followed the sale and licence of the “cool™ hose” technology assets.

the company continued to make progress in the strategic pursuit of the larger, more complex production
facilities, which clients are increasingly demanding. in july, the company announced the finalisation of two twenty
year charter and operation contracts for new fpsos, cidade de maricá and cidade de saquarema for petrobras.
both fpsos are destined for the lula field in the pre-salt province, offshore brazil, and will follow the blueprint
provided by fpso cidade de ilhabela scheduled for launch next year.

in addition, maricá and saquarema will benefit from the technological expertise and experience acquired during



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                55

the completion of fpso cidade de paraty – the first of sbm offshore’s state-of-the-art, pre-salt fpsos to start
production offshore brazil. planned delivery for the two fpsos is expected by end of 2015 and early 2016,
respectively.

also in july, a contract was announced with shell to supply and lease an fpso for its stones development
project in the gulf of mexico, the deepest oil and gas development in the world. delivery is expected in first half of
2016. the contract envisages an initial ten year lease with extension options up to twenty years.

in june the company reported the successful delivery of fpso cidade de paraty to client petrobras under a 20
year lease and operate contract. in september the company successfully delivered the osx2 fpso to client
osx under a turnkey sale contract.

 sbm offshore finished 2013 with a strong underlying financial performance, ahead of expectations. the
company has now put most of its legacy projects to rest, secured the balance sheet and refocused its activity

3.1.1 risk/reward balance
during 2013, the company has taken steps to improve the risk/reward balance in the provision of fpsos.
historically this has been a challenge for the entire industry, but with the escalation of value and complexity in
fpsos in recent years, tackling this issue has become imperative. naturally, improving this balance must be
achieved while preserving and protecting value for the client and the company has consulted extensively with its
customers.

an important first step in this respect has been to focus attention across the industry on improving and
regularising standard terms for fpso contracts. within the company there has been a close focus on disciplined
tendering procedures, and identifying the niche opportunities where the company brings to bear its leading edge
expertise and avoids competing as a commodity provider. for clients, the company has focused on service
excellence, in particular, on maximising uptime at levels above 99%.



3.1.2 focus on high end segment of the converted fpso market
over the course of 2013 the company continued to reshape its project management capabilities and invest in
operational development to accommodate the increasingly complex large-scale fpso projects. this resulted in
the successful execution of a number of significant conversion project awards:


     • the twenty-year charter and operation of the two fpsos cidade de maricá and cidade de saquarema for petrobras.
       jointly this was the largest project award in company's history. read more about maricá and saquarema
     • the ten-year charter of a fpso for the stones development project in the gulf of mexico, the company’s first project in this
       region. the fpso stones is one of the most challenging designs, customized for conditions in the gulf of mexico, where
       hurricanes pose a real threat. when installed, the project will cement the company’s leading position in deep water
       operations. read more about fpso stones

3.1.3 directional reporting
in june 2013, the company introduced the "directional reporting" methodology in addition to ifrs, to provide
greater transparency of the underlying business performance. the new reporting method enabled a non-ifrs
operating lease presentation of company results, more in line with operating cash flows, and was included
alongside accounts presented under international financial reporting standards (ifrs).

this change was driven by two factors. firstly, the ifrs concept of finance lease accounting causes significant
disparity between cash flow and revenue recognition. secondly, the company's business model, which combines
turnkey sales, construction and lease and operate projects, means that the company builds fpsos that it puts in
its own lease and operate portfolio, adding a layer of complexity in respect of the ifrs concept of finance lease
accounting. ifrs rules applied to the company's business model result in an accelerated recognition of
revenues, profit and equity, in advance of any rents paid by client.

2013 has been an important year in demonstrating and promoting the understanding of directional reporting as
the primary indicator for company performance and analysis. directional reporting will continue to be a regular
disclosure feature, complementing ifrs reporting. for 2014, the company's guidance will be based on
directional results. the management believes that these disclosures allow for a level playing field when investors
compare the company with other services companies in the oil and gas sector.

introduction on ifrs 10 & 11 standards and directional reporting

ifrs 10 & 11 standards will be introduced in 2014.

it implies, for the company, discontinuation of proportional accounting of joint ventures (jvs), to be replaced by:


  • full consolidation of controlled jvs, mainly brazilian ventures
  • equity accounting of jointly controlled jvs, mainly african ventures

these changes will chiefly impact the balance sheet, where the relatively young brazilian fleet increases the size
of the asset base and loan portfolio, only partially offset by the de-consolidation of the african assets and loans.

the changes in ifrs will not affect the calculation method under the company's loan covenants, as the loan
agreements stipulate the correction back to the old standards in case of changes.

also applying new ifrs 10 & 11 under directional reporting to the project portfolio removes the revenue the
company generates during the project phase from its jvs partners from the income statement. the effect is to
grossly understate the operating cash flow, and thereby invalidate the concepts of directional reporting, which is
cash based.

consequently, directional reporting from 2014 onwards will:


  • classify all leases as operating leases as before
  • treat all production facilities on a proportional accounting basis

as a consequence, directional revenue and results will only be marginally impacted by the ifrs 10 & 11
introduction.

3.1.4 company transformation programme
in 2013 the company identified the need for improved efficiency and ways of working across multiple disciplines
and the group. the increasing complexity and size of the fpso projects, the need to manage and deliver
projects from multiple execution centres, and the increasing integration of the ‘innovate’, ‘win’, ‘execute’ and
‘operate’ activities are demanding a new mind-set to ensure reliable and consistent project delivery and operation
on behalf of the clients.

the focus of the transformation programme, which is a 24 month journey, named odyssey 24, is:


  • on harmonisation and simplification
  • on a common language and seamless processes which span all disciplines
  • on quality, control and compliance and how we drive continuous improvement
  • on ‘purchase to pay’ and finance processes
  • and finally on the human resources needed to run the company as an integrated multinational organisation.

odyssey 24 is not an entreprise resource planning (erp) implementation programme or a new fpso prototype
model; it is about establishing the foundation to consistently deliver outstanding performance and to secure a
stronger future.

during 2014 and 2015, the programme will deliver various improvements. the company is using several external
advisors, each for their own area of expertise, while the programme is led by sbm senior staff members,
dedicated for the project duration.



3.1.5 hsse
over the course of 2013 the company delivered a stable safety performance on a range of its business activities.
the company has managed to achieve a similar safety performance in comparison to 2012 with a total
recordable injury frequency rate (trifr) of 0.40 in 2013 compared to 0.38 in 2012, despite a number of
challenges in safe working practices on one specific project. however the lost time injury frequency rate
(ltifr) has deteriorated for both construction activities and offshore operations. a number of corrective actions
have been taken to help raise the standards, especially on the above mentioned project. read more about our
hss performance

over the year, sbm offshore has significantly improved its environmental performance reporting. the company
now reports its environmental performance in accordance with best practice ogp (oil & gas producers)
guidelines. read more about our environmental performance



3.1.6 sustainability
csr and sustainability are increasingly important elements of the company’s business performance. the
implementation of a group wide csr and sustainability policy will support performance and focus on ethical,
environmental, health and safety indicators.

as part of the company’s continued endeavor for improvement of the reporting scope and implementation of
sustainable initiatives, the company created a new position, the corporate social responsibility director,
reporting to the cgco in june 2013.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                            58

the csr director is responsible for managing the company’s csr and sustainability policy, implementation of
strategy, internal and external stakeholder engagement and csr reporting to third parties. a number of initiatives
will be developed in 2014 around the impact the company has on its employees and other stakeholders in the
course of the business.



3.1.7 local content
the company continued to strengthen its position and operational capabilities in latin america and west africa,
in line with increasingly stringent local content requirements. importantly, the company’s continued enthusiasm
and commitment continued to help create sustainable value and operational infrastructure in countries where it
generates revenues and profits. the company has been present in angola and brazil since 1968 and continues
to be one of the community strongholds in its areas of operation.

in 2013, both territories saw the successful development and installation of state of-the-art lift cranes, providing
infrastructure and capacity to facilitate large scale fpso projects in angola and enhancing the company’s
competitive advantage in the brazilian fpso integration market.

brazil

work continued at the company’s joint venture brasa construction yard in rio de janeiro on ten of the eighteen
topsides modules for the fpso cidade de ilhabela.

further to the full refurbishment of the yard premises in 2012, and with a skilled workforce of over 2700
employees, brasa remains a key strategic asset for the company in latin america, and a strong base of support
for the fpsos cidade de maricá and cidade de saquarema projects for petrobras. [family programmes in
brasa- text to be added].

in 2013 the company successfully installed bsl’s pelicano 1 crane, the highest capacity barge crane in latin
america. the crane completed its first lift at the atlantico sul shipyard, in the state of pernambuco, brazil in early
october 2013.

angola

during 2013, the company completed the infrastructure changes at the paenal yard in angola, enabling full
fpso module integration, hook up and commissioning activities as well as fabrication of process modules to be
carried out to world class standards. with 490 metres of quay side and 10 metres water-depth, paenal is the only
yard on the west african coast able to accommodate vlcc tankers. fpso clov, the first ever fpso to berth in
africa arrived at the paenal quayside in early november 2013.

the paenal joint venture installed a 2,500 tonnes heavy lift crane, enabling greater operational flexibility. in
november 2013 the first ever topside module integration in africa was performed by jamba - the heavy lift crane
(hlc) on board of the fpso clov.

additionally, in consortium with dsme, paenal has been awarded the fabrication of two well head platforms for
the mafumeira sul field, with completion due in december 2014.

3.1.8 operations
deep panuke

in the early part of 2013, the company focused on ensuring that the platform’s path to production continued on
track. the deep panuke project now produces and processes natural gas from the deep panuke field,
approximately 250 kilometres (155 miles) southeast of halifax, nova scotia on the scotian shelf. the platform is
designed to produce up to 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcf/d) of natural gas.

the platform had been producing sales gas since early august. through the autumn, the operational team of
deep panuke continued commissioning activities leading up to production acceptance and the start of the lease
contract. these activities involved achieving a steady state of production and taking the time required to safely
start the gas platform. production acceptance notification was obtained in december. the facility is now on hire.

the terms of the lease and operate contract are for a minimum period of eight years with annual extension
provisions of up to a maximum of twelve additional years. a charge of us$ 35 million related to the delayed
start-up and associated cost was taken in 2013.

fpso cidade de paraty

fpso cidade de paraty was formally on hire from june 7, 2013, following full system acceptance by the client,
petrobras. the facility was constructed in 34 months from letter of intent in june 2010, and met the local content
requirements for brazilian fpsos. the fpso will operate under twenty year charter and operate contract on the
lula nordeste development in the pre-salt area, offshore brazil. it is a first of its kind third generation fpso,
which carries topside loads of about 18,000 tonnes to 23,000 tonnes to meet the advanced processing
requirements of brazil’s pre-salt projects. the vessel is designed to produce 120,000 barrels per day and is
equipped to deal with high volumes of associated gas.

fpso osx-2

the company announced the successful turnkey sale delivery to the client, osx 2 leasing b.v., on time and in
line with the contract, in early september 2013. with a total topside weight of over 10,000 tonnes and a
production capacity of 100,000 barrels of oil per day, the facility had been constructed in 27 months from contract
award to delivery. the company has no further financial exposure to the client.

fpso n'goma

by mid-2013, the first phase of fpso n’goma, consisting of construction and refurbishment work at the keppel
shipyard in singapore had reached the required level of completion to enable the lifting of process modules. this
was followed by the completion of a successful lifting of nine modules, which work commenced in mid-july and
concluded at the end of august 2013.

the addition of these nine modules triggered the next phase – the start of integration, mechanical completion and
commissioning activities on these modules. this will take place alongside on-going refurbishment works on 12
existing modules that were kept on board the fpso, as well as the turret integration, before moving into the final
phase of commissioning activities.

the fpso will subsequently sail to paenal in angola, where the next stage will see the two final modules

integrated onto the fpso.

the schedule foresees the start of production in 2014 at a design capacity of 100,000 barrels per day. in autumn
2013, a project loan of us$600 million was secured from a consortium of international banks at a weighted
average cost of debt of 4.7%.

shell prelude flng turret mooring system

this large and complex turret, which is progressing on schedule, represents a substantial part of the turnkey
segment. as with other large turret projects currently being undertaken, prelude required advanced technology
solutions for high mooring loads and will have a total weight of 11,000 tonnes with a height of 100 meters.

design work on the turret started towards the end of 2008, when shell selected the company to handle the
design, procurement and construction of the turret mooring systems (tms) for their flng facilities. the project
moved into the construction phase in may 2012 with the first module delivered in september 2013. the four
remaining turret modules are scheduled for delivery progressively over 2014 to the shi shipyard in south korea,
where they will be integrated with the flng substructure. the prelude flng, which will be the world’s largest
floating facility, is expected to sail towards its final destination off western australia in 2016.

quad 204 turret

in june 2010, bp awarded the company the contract to supply the quad 204 fpso turret, which will be one of
the largest in the world with a mooring force of 2,250 tonnes. delivery of the turret was phased during the year to
facilitate the fpso construction sequence with the final phase of delivery to the hhi shipyard in korea taking
place towards the end of november 2013. the mechanical completion activities of the integrated turret are
planned to commence in mid-2014. as per the project agreement, this phase will be managed by the customer,
with the assistance of the company.

fpso cidade de ilhabela

cidade de ilhabela remains the largest and most complex fpso the company has ever undertaken. the topside
process modules will weigh close to 20,000 tonnes, including large and complex gas processing facilities. during
2013, construction of fpso cidade de ilhabela made satisfactory progress, with the completion of refurbishment
and conversion at the chinese shipyard in guangzhou. the vessel set sail for brazil in early november and
construction of the process modules at the brasa yard continued in anticipation of the arrival of the fpso.
start-up of the facility is expected in the second half of 2014.

ichthys turret

in 2012, the company was awarded a contract for the engineering, procurement, fabrication and supply of a turret
and mooring system for the ichthys fpso. the turret and mooring system will be integrated by the client into the
ichthys fpso and installed offshore nw australia. the contract also includes assistance during the integration of
the turret into the fpso as well as during installation on the field offshore.

the turret will have a diameter of 19 meters, a height of 85 meters, and a weight of over 7,000 tonnes. it will
accommodate up to 15 risers and will be designed for 40 years of operation without the need for disconnection.

fabrication of the turret, in singapore, has commenced and is scheduled for completion in the second half of
2014. installation of the turret and mooring system in the field is anticipated in 2015.

fso yetagun

the company has a lease and operate contract for the fso yetagunwhich runs until 2015, with extension options
for up to 5 years. this contract was awarded prior to an international campaign to impose sanctions against
myanmar. in 2003, the company stated in a press release that it had decided not to seek any new contract in
myanmar but confirmed its commitment to complete its existing contract.

the company is still committed not to extend its existing contract past the expiry date as long as international
sanctions against myanmar continue to apply. should the international sanctions be suspended or lifted, the
company may want to reassess its position with regard to operating in myanmar.

the company has ensured that all operations comply with the highest social accountability standards. the
company commissioned bureau veritas to conduct an independent audit of the operators. this audit confirmed
full compliance with the group's social accountability policy.



3.1.9 simplification of senior management structure
in order to facilitate strategic decision-making and enhance management efficiency the company has reduced the
top of its governance structure from three layers, comprising of the supervisory board, management board and
board of management, to two by removing the board of management. the management board (comprised of the
ceo, cfo and cgco) and the company business model remain unchanged. senior management is aligned
with the management board through the executive committee. read more about it

3.3 technology development
3.3.1 introduction
during 2013 the company focused on enhancing its market-leading position in complex floating production
systems, and their associated mooring systems. sbm offshore continued to identify key technology trends in the
offshore oil & gas market, prioritising development work to address gaps in key areas of demand and offer cost
effective field development solutions to clients. total technology expenditure reached us$ 23 million in 2013.

the company’s technology development is guided by a three strand strategy:


  • our product development plan will be driven by market demand, and will reflect the current and future challenges faced by
     our clients in the offshore industry.
  • we will benefit from our technology developments to improve safety and increase our overall rate of return on investment
     through reduced costs, increased efficiency and improved performance.
  • we will continuously strive to build our competitive advantage by retaining our technology leadership position in the
     market.




3.3.2 fpso technology
sbm offshore positions itself at the premium end of the leased fpso market, focusing on the largest and most
complex projects. over the years, the complexity of the company’s fpso fleet has grown significantly and
‘generation 3’ fpsos now represent the core of new business activity.

the company has developed an optimised and cost effective design for the generation 3 fpsos which are
needed to produce the pre-salt fields in brazil, in ultra-deep water conditions. these units require extensive gas
                                                                2
conditioning systems, including gas phase membranes for co removal, together with large gas and carbon
dioxide compression plants for gas re-injection at very high pressure.

the company is building a series of four of these complex fpsos for charter to petrobras. the first unit
successfully entered service during 2013, with three more under construction. when complete, these vessels will
                                                                          3
be able to produce 570,000 bpd in aggregate, and compress 22 million nm /d (775mmscfd) of gas.



3.3.3 mooring system & riser technology
the company is recognised as the world leader in complex mooring systems. throughout 2013, the company
has continued to develop its mooring technology to retain and strengthen this position.

the company’s largest ever internal turret mooring system, for the shell prelude flng, is currently under
construction. two further complex turrets are also underway for the ichthys fpso and the quad 204 fpso. all of
these projects have very high mooring loads, and benefit from the company’s proprietary technology for turret
bearing systems and fluid swivels.

the fpso stones project for shell in the gulf of mexico represents a significant step change in terms of
disconnectable mooring systems. this project will achieve a number of industry firsts: the first disconnectable
fpso with steel risers; the deepest production facility in the world at 2900m water depth; and the largest ever
disconnectable mooring buoy.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                        64

this highly complex turret mooring system has been made possible by extensive development work in recent
years. in particular, two components have recently completed qualification testing: a high capacity locking
mechanism for use with disconnectable turret moorings and an in-line mooring connector (ilmc), improving
offshore safety by avoiding the need for divers.

the company’s laboratory, located in france, is dedicated to the rigorous testing and qualification of advanced
fluid swivels, swivel sealing systems and mooring components. many of these represent significant advances in
the industry, by expanding the allowable operating envelope of turret mooring systems.

a new fluid swivel design for ultra-high pressure applications, designed to allow re-injection of gas and water into
high pressure ultra-deep reservoirs (such as the lower tertiary of the gulf of mexico), has completed a rigorous
qualification test programme in the company's laboratory and is now market-ready.

the growing trends for production operations in ultra-deep water fields and high pressure/high temperature
fields has increased the industry focus on steel riser systems as an alternative to unbonded flexible risers or
hybrid riser towers. the company’s fpso espirito santo is the world’s first turret moored fpso to be equipped
with steel risers, and has now successfully completed over four years of service. the company continues to
develop an enhanced version of this turret design, with capacity for a greater number of steel risers in ultra-deep
water conditions.



3.3.4 other floating production units
                                                                                                            tm
the company continued to develop its ‘dry tree’ configuration of the proven deep draft semisubmersible hull, in
order to allow the use of surface-mounted christmas trees in ultra-deep water fields in brazil and the gulf of
mexico. development work is progressing well, with further model basin testing performed during 2013 to refine
the conceptual design.

this new product has the potential to overcome the inherent water depth limitation of tlp platforms which are
limited by tendon cost, and consequently offers great potential for ultra-deep water fields, especially for high
pressure/high temperature reservoirs, where dry trees may be preferred.

as part of the continued development of this dry tree semi, the company has identified and has a patent
                                                                                                   tm
pending for an innovative way to optimise drilling operations, called the drilling riser trip saver , which won a
coveted ‘spotlight on new technology’ award at the offshore technology conference (otc) held in houston in
may 2013.



3.3.5 gas processing units
the company has long promoted the development of lng fpsos. this new technology is now gaining wide
acceptance and the first new-build flng project sanctioned, the prelude flng for which the company is
providing the turret, is well into construction. with further flng projects being sanctioned, this solution for
offshore gas monetisation is gaining momentum.

the company has developed, and patented, an innovative midscale flng concept, which draws on our expertise
                                                        tm
of tanker conversion. this concept, called the twin hull , is based on the conversion of two lng tankers, in
order to provide simultaneously adequate storage volume and deck space for topsides, and has been further
developed during 2013. with a design capacity of 1.5 to 2.0 million tonnes per annum, this new concept enables a
highly economical approach for exploiting small and medium sized offshore gas fields, with faster delivery and



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                65

lower investment than required for other concepts currently on the market.

the company has a commercial development agreement with uk based compactgtl ltd, the pioneer of
modular gas-to-liquid solutions, to work exclusively together on offshore projects. the use of gtl technology
significantly reduces gas flaring, by transforming associated gas into synthetic crude oil which can be blended in
to the produced crude oil. this product continues to be developed jointly with compactgtl, and is being actively
marketed to clients.



3.3.6 intellectual property
the company maintains a significant intellectual property (ip) portfolio including patents, trademarks, and
copyrights. the company’s extensive patent portfolio of over 200 patent families covers a wide range of items
including fpso mooring and turret systems, hydrocarbon transfer and processing systems including lng and
gas processing, drilling and riser technologies, and offshore installation. during 2013, the company was granted
60 new patents in different countries. the company also filed over 20 applications for new patents.



3.3.7 technical standards
in 2003 the company introduced a set of proprietary technical standards, which defined design, procurement,
construction, commission and installation processes for fpso products. these have continued to evolve over the
past decade, adopting the accumulated learnings from project execution and fleet operation. today, the
standards are unique in being the only set of fpso-specific technical specifications in the offshore industry.
capturing the accumulated experience from over 200 years of fpso operations, they provide a valuable
foundation for the company’s leased fpso projects.

the company has now put in place a system of technical authorities to continue the development of these
standards, and to ensure that they are correctly applied on our projects.

the pyramid below represents the different levels of the company (operational, management and supervisory
board) demonstrating how risk management is enforced across the company, with clear accountability.

all individuals within the company are fully accountable for the management of risks & opportunities (r&o)
within their respective areas of responsibility. at project, department, business area and group level, r&o is
tracked and managed by the respective authority.

this process has been made applicable across every level of the business.

developments during 2013

structure
the reporting structure that was put in place in 2012 remains unchanged, with the group risk officer reporting to
the chief governance and compliance officer (cgco).

risk team
in 2013, the group risk team focused on training and developing the methodologies that were previously put in
place, to ensure uniform understanding and adoption across the business, with the objective of propagating the
appropriate culture.

risk network
at execution centre level, risk management responsibilities have been assigned to the finance manager. he will
support each managing director in their relevant execution centre in in the management of r&o. however, for the
fleet operation execution centre (sbm operations), a dedicated risk manager supports the r&o processes
across the whole fleet. in addition, on some major projects, a full time dedicated risk delegate has been
assigned to assist the project manager.

engineering and construction risk institute
the company is now a recognised member of the engineering and construction risk institute (ecri). this gives
the company access to industry best practice, training, and peer networking in relation to risk management. this



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                           68

allows the company continuously to improve its approach to risk, through a combination of presentations of the
sbm risk framework, regular attendance to ecri sponsor meetings, risk maturity surveys or other activities
facilitated by the institute; all contribute to continuous improvement. training sessions organised by ecri are
regularly attended by company personnel across all execution centres to reinforce the culture and knowledge of
risk management.

procedures
the processes developed to ensure consistent and systematic application of risk and opportunity management
activities across the company have now been tested, formalised and progressively implemented within the
framework of the group management system. some outstanding procedures and work instructions are under
finalisation and will be issued by the end of the first quarter of 2014.

group risk matrix
a standardised risk matrix has been developed and is now enforced within the company across all disciplines
and activities.




the purpose is to ensure a consistent and systematic approach to any risk assessment that is performed in the
company.

the matrix is divided into 3 different areas: green, orange and dark orange areas to translate the risk tolerance
level onto the matrix:
- green: continuous improvement. can require the implementation of risk response.



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                69

- orange: reduce risk. should require the implementation of risk response.
- dark orange: intolerable. must require the implementation of risk response immediately.

severity and likelihood thresholds have been defined for different activities (e.g. health & safety, environment,
security, reputation, information technology, capex, schedule, opex) and constitute general guidelines to
allow a qualitative assessment rather than firm a prescriptive limit.

risk appetite
in order to ensure maximum effectiveness, the group’s risk appetite framework has been defined in line with sbm
offshore’s three-year strategic plan. the group’s risk appetite and associated thresholds are revised once a year.
the management board defines the risk appetite of the company i.e. the level of risk that the company should
take to achieve its objectives and reviews regularly the group risk profile as reported.




execution centre and group function risk review
reviews of individual execution centre and group function reviews are now performed on a quarterly basis by the
group risk management team, together with the management teams.

they aim to identify, assess, address and monitor risks and opportunities (r&o) and their associated response
strategies within each execution centre or group function. the output of such review is a detailed risk register and
matrix illustrating the top risks and opportunities.

quantitative and qualitative risk analysis
the group risk management team has developed and implemented a methodology to quantify the impact of risks
which shall be included in an estimate (at tender stage) and managed throughout a project execution. this is



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                70

based on the statistical monte carlo method. the forecasts produced from these simulations help to quantify
exposure to risk, reducing uncertainties, and establishing, with the proposal and project control team, the
appropriate contingency levels to be maintained during project execution.

risk aggregation
all risks identified throughout the group’s activities are aggregated and classified in terms of impact and
probability in order to maintain a global overview of the group risk profile.

risk registers are updated on a regular basis for each proposal and project, and major risks and opportunities are
reported through the weekly and monthly reports and dashboard to the management team. similar reports are
generated for each of the fleet units.

for all risk reporting, specific key performance indicators as well as key risks indicators are being progressively
developed and implemented.

reporting

the outcome is a quarterly r&o report which covers proposal, projects and fleet individual risks, as well as group
functions and execution centres and is made available to the management board and supervisory board. the
r&o report provides an overview of the top 10 risks and top 10 opportunities as well as the latest risk profile
versus the defined risk appetite status to the management board and supervisory board.

developments for 2014

risk appetite
the risk appetite will be revisited on an annual basis to align with the group strategy but the actual status of the
group risk profile versus its appetite will continue to be reported on a quarterly basis.

business continuity
a plan to review, update, test and maintain the existing business continuity plans in a more comprehensive and
integrated manner will be proposed to the management board and is to be implemented in 2014.

finalise risk processes within group management system
any outstanding work instructions will be finalised and issued and, where necessary, previous procedures will be
updated to reflect continuous improvements changes and feedback.

governance, risk and compliance (grc)
the group risk team is actively involved and aligned with odyssey 24, sbm offshore’s transformation
programme, particularly in relation to the governance risk and compliance work stream and will participate in the
development of the associated framework and tools.

communication
a regular series of risk road shows will continue to inform managers and leaders in the main construction sites,
shore bases and selected units of the fleet.

training
risk related training of staff across the company will continue in various forms, including through the group’s
membership of the ecri, external training sessions in specialist areas such as schedule risk analysis and
quantitative tools, and internal training.

ecri review / audit
it is foreseen to use the services of ecri to conduct an external audit of sbm risk management framework in
order to identify areas of improvements.

risk profile

the risks inherent in the company’s core business activities did not change substantially during 2013, although a
number of new risks were identified and ranked as shown in qualitative assessment matrix below. these include:

  1 the potential costs of environmental pollution following events in the gulf of mexico have resulted in a tendency for the
    company’s clients to try to allocate more potential liabilities for pollution to the company. in general, the trend towards
    tougher contractual requirements has continued during 2013.
  2 the ongoing compliance investigation into potentially improper sales practices may expose the company to the risk of
    penalties or fines.
  3 the company is exposed to the industry wide risk overall shortage of competencies in the total range of skills required in
    the company’s activities.
  4 a strong focus on asset integrity aims at improving long term overall fleet safety and performance.
  5 transforming the company may create uncertainty for some employees and may lead to detract their attention from
    assisting in delivery of the company’s objectives.




the general nature of the risk categories confronting the company and the way in which these are managed are
explained below.

3.5 hsse
3.5.1 introduction
sbm offshore is committed to protecting people, preventing pollution and safeguarding the environment. the
company strives to offer an incident free workplace and minimize the risks to the health and safety of all its
personnel.

during 2013 the company delivered a stable safety performance on a range of its business activities. the
company has managed to achieve a similar safety performance in comparison to 2012 with a total recordable
injury frequency rate (trifr) of 0.40 in 2013 compared to 0.38 in 2012, despite a number of challenges in safe
working practices on one specific project. however, the lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) has
deteriorated for both construction activities and offshore operations. a number of corrective actions have been
taken to help raise the standards, especially on the above mentioned project, and are detailed further below.

detailed safety performance data is provided in the occupational health and safety management section.

over the year, the company has significantly improved its environmental performance reporting. the company
now reports its environmental performance in accordance with best practice ogp (oil & gas producers)
guidelines (1). as outlined in the section 5 on performance indicators, a solid environmental performance has
been achieved from the offshore units, compared to the oil and gas industry average. further details on the
company environmental performance can be found in the environmental management section.

the company has endorsed a new process safety management framework and continues to deliver a sound
performance in security. the summary of actions taken during 2013 to proactively improve security and process
safety management across the company is provided below.

of oil & gas producers.



3.5.2 occupational health and safety management
general

during 2013, the company continued to improve its occupational health and safety initiatives by enhancing
existing programmes and development of new ones.

the main improvements introduced in 2013 across the company included:


  • introduction of leadership objectives for management and hsse principles for all sbm personnel as part of the annual
     appraisal system
  • strengthening of the hsse capability and resources in the new yards
  • introduction and monitoring of leading indicators in order to measure and benchmark safety performance and pro-actively
     take corrective actions, providing a clear picture of senior management engagement visits, training delivery and safety
     observation programs
  • development of a group risk matrix to ensure a consistent and systematic approach to any hsse risk assessment
     performed throughout the company
  • enhancement of the training delivery on onshore operations with development of e-learning modules and increased
     training capacity



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                           76

  • issue of 4,141 certificates to onshore personnel on basic and supervisory safety training
  • introduction of life-saving rules in all execution centres as part of the induction programme for new staff
  • continued integration of hsse in the lifecycle of the company's products
  • internal incident management system upgrades


safety results

sbm offshore operations

the fleet of fpsos recorded an increase in its trifr in 2013 (0.81 compared to 0.71 in 2012) and its lost time
incident frequency rate (ltifr) (0.17 in 2013, compared to 0.08 in 2012).

during 2013, a series of new initiatives has been put in place to emphasise management system compliance and
enhance dynamic risk awareness and behaviours.

the length of operating time achieved without recordable incidents provides a good indicator of safety
performance throughout the industry. in 2013, the offshore fleet was awarded eight safety milestone certificates
for recordable incident-free periods, with one offshore unit, the fpso saxi batuque in angola, achieving four
years recordable incident-free.

as part of its drive for continuous improvement, sbm offshore operations has attained compliance recognition by
abs on a voluntary basis for occupational health and safety assessment series (ohsas) 18001. following a
successful implementation of the standard in brazilian shore bases in 2009 and on-board fpsos managed from
brazil in 2010, the process continued in angola and for the rest of the world fleet in 2011 and 2012.

for further information, see the compliance table in part 1.7 group management systems and compliance table.
compliance to the mandatory international safety management (ism) standard and the international ship and
port facility security (isps) code remains the cornerstone for effective fleet management across the company.

onshore projects

all construction yards undertaking work for the company provide the company with details of their safety records
to support its reporting requirements in this area.

in 2013, the onshore operations recorded a stable performance in its total recordable incident frequency rate
(trifr) (0.31 compared to 0.32 in 2012), while the lost time incident frequency rate (ltifr) has increased to
0.12, compared to 0.06 in 2012.

despite solid performance on a number of yards and projects, the company's overall safety performance has
been impacted in 2013 by the challenges in safe working practices on one of its projects.

following the deteriorating performance on this project, sbm launched several initiatives aimed at improving
safety onsite including:


  • increased number of safety resources
  • improvement and strengthening of the permit to work system used



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                              77

  • improved scaffolding
  • reinforcement of the safety observations programme in place
  • implementation of positive incentive schemes
  • extension of the existing basic safety training and safety training for supervisors
  • improved communication around hsse on the yard : tool box talks, weekly newsletter, safety stand downs...
  • review of the yard management system by two external consultancy companies
  • improvement of the start-up process starting from the tendering phase.



3.5.3 process safety management
following the launch in 2012 of a structured programme to address the improvement areas in process safety
management (psm), the company has further developed a framework and associated tools for implementation of
a comprehensive psm programme based on a well-established industry standard “guidelines for risk based
process safety” by the center for chemical process safety (ccps), part of the american institute for chemical
engineers (aiche).

when applied throughout the lifecycle of sbm products, the twenty framework elements have the potential to
reduce the risk of catastrophic events, with the ultimate aim of minimising these risks on any of its facilities
worldwide.

the implementation of the psm framework will be through the group management system to ensure that the
process safety management controls are fully integrated in the sbm business activities and processes.



3.5.4 security management
ensuring the security of employees wherever they work is a key priority for managers and supervisors throughout
the company. the group’s security policy, procedures and controls are intended to protect its employees
wherever they operate in the world.

in those areas of the world identified as ‘high risk’, risk assessments are always completed before construction
contracts for offshore units managed by the company commence. in addition, the group’s security manager
monitors global security issues for onshore and offshore operations. daily security reports are issued throughout
the year to all sbm sites and operations as well as daily threat analysis for personnel operating in high risk
locations. security alerts are issued when applicable.

the company recognises its ‘duty of care’ to employees and contractors on security matters. relevant security
information is being compiled and distributed from security information suppliers, as well as through network of
security contacts. this is particularly important when the company vessels are operating in areas assessed as a
‘high risk’ location.

to support the above, face-to-face security briefings, as well as security awareness training, were delivered in
2013 to project personnel traveling to locations with specific security threats.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                               78

offshore operations

across the lease fleet, the isps (international ship & port facility security code) is used as the basis of a system
that safeguards personnel onboard, and provides overall protection for all company facilities. during 2013,
security drills, exercises and audits were carried out to ensure that the procedures in place to deal with offshore
incidents were comprehensive, fit for purpose and regularly tested. these exercises were particularly relevant for
an offshore project in nigeria, where the company completed the brass buoy change-out. the company has
operated in high risk areas of nigeria for a period of more than six years without security incidents involving sbm
personnel or assets.

transit risk assessments were carried out for the company offshore units transiting the indian ocean, either
going to their operating field or returning from the field to a construction yard in china. security training was also
carried out onboard an fpso in china prior to sail-away.

company security officers provide advice on security to the operating fleet, focusing their efforts on three main
operating areas: angola, brazil and the rest of the world.




onshore projects

certain countries in which the company operates are designated as ‘high risk’ with respect to personnel security.

throughout 2013, the company maintained a particular focus on the security aspects of travel between all
locations in which it operates. it continued to deploy isos/control risks for ‘travel security services’ to monitor
all employee business travel security and to establish appropriate procedures for evacuation (including medevac


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                 79

support) if necessary and give the appropriate briefings.

country evacuation plans have been developed for various countries. the programme has been extended to
equatorial guinea and china for 2013.




3.5.5 environmental management
the company endeavours to operate on its own behalf and on behalf of its clients in an environmentally
sustainable way, in order to minimise damage to local ecosystems.

the company pays particular attention to three key environmental challenges:


  • avoiding oil spills
  • preventing unnecessary flaring or emissions to sea or air
  • minimising the use of energy and waste outputs by encouraging reduced consumption and re-use.

the ambitious plan of the company to bring its entire fleet into compliance with iso 14001 was achieved in early
2013 with the accreditation of the fpso cidade de anchieta. all the fpso units are now compliant with the iso
14001 standards.

during 2013, the company has aligned its environmental performance reporting with the reporting guidelines
from the international association of oil & gas producers (2). as a consequence the company reports additional
environmental related performance data and has decided to group fleet data by region. the 2012 data have been
reported accordingly, by region as well, for comparison purposes.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                           80

emissions to air

the primary emissions from the offshore fleet are greenhouse gases (ghg) caused by energy generation and
flaring.

during production of oil and natural gas, the most significant components of produced ghg are carbon dioxide
(co2) and methane (ch4).

emissions reported in the company’s emissions records include:


  • ghg emissions for the production of energy. records ghg emissions from steam boilers, gas turbines and diesel
     engines used by the operating units.
  • ghg emissions from gas flared. records of the volume of gas flared attributable to sbm account and/or attributable to the
     client account


the records of gas flared include the volume of emissions below the limit defined by the client, and the volume of
emissions above the limit attributable to sbm account, or at the request of the client to optimise production.

emissions reported do not take into account any fugitive emissions nor emissions from cargo tank venting.

in general, the overall ghg emissions from energy generation and gas flared increased by 9 % in comparison to
2012, but still remain 9% below the ogp average (159 tonnes of ghg per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbon
produced (3)).

the total gas flared in 2013 was 18.4 tonnes of gas flared per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbons produced, 17%
above the ogp average (15.7 tonnes of gas flared per thousand tonnes of hydrocarbon produced (4)) with 37%
of the gas flared recorded on sbm account and 63% on client account for production optimisation or not
exceeding the client allowance.

the high level of gas flared in 2013 is mainly due to start-up of two new oil production units in canada (deep
panuke) and brazil (fpso cidade de paraty), which typically flare a substantial amount of gas during this phase
as systems are being tested and commissioned with hydrocarbons. once production is stabilised emissions levels
will drop as these systems have been designed to produce without flaring gas, unless for safety reasons.

energy consumption

the energy used to produce oil and gas covers a range of activities, including:


  • driving pumps producing the hydrocarbons or re-injecting produced water
  • heating produced oil for separation
  • producing steam
  • powering compressors to re-inject produced gas
  • driving turbines to generate electricity needed for operational activities.

the main source of energy consumption of offshore units is fuel gas and marine gas oil.

energy consumption of the company units was 33 % better in 2013 than the ogp average (1.57 gigajoules of
energy per tonnes of hydrocarbon produced in 2012(5)).




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                      81

oil in produced water discharges

produced water is a high volume liquid discharge generated during the production of oil and gas. after extraction,
produced water is separated and treated (de-oiled) before discharge to surface water.

the quality of produced water is most widely expressed in terms of its oil content. limits are imposed on the
concentration of oil in the effluent discharge stream (generally expressed in the range of 15-30 ppm) or discharge
is limited where re-injection is permitted back into the reservoir. the overall efficiency of the oil in water treatment
and as applicable reinjection can be expressed as tonnes of oil discharged per million tonnes of hydrocarbon
produced.

the company's result has been stable as compared to 2012. in 2013, the average volume of oil discharged was
3.98 tonnes of oil discharged to sea per million tonnes of hydrocarbon production, which represents less than half
of the ogp average (8.8 tonnes of oil discharged per million tonnes of hydrocarbon production in 2012(6)).

environmental releases

in 2013, the offshore operations fleet reported 37 environmental incidents, 33 of which were contained within the
offshore unit, with no release to the sea, while the remaining 4 resulted in releases to the sea.

total volume of these releases to the sea is estimated to 0.019 cubic meters for 2013 compared to 0.076 cubic
meters in 2012.

for offshore operations, there were no spills recorded in the category of reportable spills in accordance with the
ogp guidelines (i.e. above 1 barrel / 159 litres).

waste

in 2013, the company has improved its environmental reporting with the consolidation of the volume of waste
produced on all its offshore units.

total volume of waste generated by the operating units was 2,340 tonnes in 2013, of which 46 % was
non-restricted waste.

have been implemented, based on autonomy and coherence, accountability and responsibility.



3.6.2 employees performance appraisal
the annual performance appraisals have proven to be a valuable source of information for the talent
management and succession planning processes. the process has been reviewed in order to anchor the
company's new set of values into day-to-day practices and ensure that the strategy of the company is cascaded
down the organisation at all levels.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                           83

this review has led to a number of new features with a view to promoting higher value interaction between
managers and their employees:




  • competencies: a simplified and integrated competency framework founded upon the leadership and management
     development & middle management development programme competencies as well as an internal competency matrix
     and external best practice
  • performance rating: a new overall performance 5-level rating scale, taking into account both tangible achievements and
     targeted behaviours, i.e. the what (expected results & priorities) and the how (a simplified 8 competencies model)
  • objectives: a framework which promotes the setting of smart objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and
     time-bound), aligned with corporate priorities
  • development: a new section highlighting employees’ career expectations


this review has led to a number of new features with a view to promoting more effective interaction between
managers and their employees.

in addition, there is now a direct impact of individual performance on the short-term incentive.

this new process was piloted by a group of senior managers in 2012 and rolled out across the company in 2013.

3.6.3 training & development
the company encourages an environment of development and empowerment, enabling each staff member to
contribute his/her skills and talents towards sustaining high performance and achieving rewards and recognition.

in these times of increasingly complex projects and technical challenges, when the competition for the best
energy industry talent is more intense than ever, it is the company's aim to develop from within and retain the
in-house and technical know-how for which the company is renowned and which remains a key asset.

over recent years, a series of programmes have been implemented within the framework of the talent
management and succession planning process, thereby building the foundations for the company's continued
success.

the global and local people reviews take place on a yearly basis and help tthe company ensure that it has the
necessary successors ready for key positions.

in 2011, the company implemented a customised leadership and management development (lmd) programme
with the objective of building a common leadership and management culture and reinforcing these skills
throughout the company. 153 participants have attended the lmd since 2011.

in parallel, 2012 saw the launching of a middle management development programme (mdp) that embodies the
company's ambitions and is inspired by the lmd. scheduled over a total of 6 days, it focuses on the following key
skills: open communication and organisational buy-in, driving results, building and leading teams, decision-making
and problem-solving and cross-border collaboration. a total of 215 participants have attended the mdp since
september 2012.

a mentoring process has also been developed within the framework of these programmes, with the objective of
solidly anchoring the company management competencies and behaviours across the company. this personal
learning contract includes a 360° survey for the participant (the mentee) generating 3 strong points and 3 points
for improvement. the mentor and the mentee then jointly define development objectives and implement actions
derived from the programme, culminating in a final individual development plan discussion. following their active
participation, attendees become mentors for future participants in order to guide and challenge them throughout
the process as well as provide continued support beyond the end of the training.

two new programmes have been designed over the course of 2013, including one dedicated to the discipline
lead engineers and a project/unit management programme.

both programmes are scheduled for a company-wide rollout in 2014.

in addition, the company continues to offer international career opportunities to a significant number of
employees to enhance their experience within the company and contribute to the “work as one” strategic goal.

finally a company induction path has been developed for all newcomers. it is available on the company’s
intranet system.

additionally, the company provides a wide range of training and development opportunities to enhance the skills
of its employees in all locations worldwide. a total of 7,350 permanent employees took part in 22,054 courses,
which amounted to a total of 306,555 training hours over the course of 2013.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                              85

onshore staff

training policy is closely aligned with the company's objectives and strategy. in addition to group programmes
that are provided, the need for training and development is also discussed during the annual performance
appraisal sessions between employees and managers, resulting in individual training plans.

training provided by the company covers both in-house training sessions, which are performed by the
company's staff or consultants, and external training, which is performed outside the company by specialised
training providers.

the majority of training courses are around technical and hsse topics, including technical and scientific software
use. over the last few years, focus has been given to managerial and leadership training, with the development of
the group's programmes in addition to individual training courses.

offshore staff

given the significant technical and safety requirements of the operations onboard, the company considers
on-the-job training, distance learning and external courses to be of utmost importance for all its offshore
personnel, whether employed on a permanent or contract basis.

hsse topics and safety in particular represent the vast majority of training courses that are provided to
company’s offshore staff.

in addition to the above, specific programmes have been rolled-out in 2012, such as management and
communications training for oims (offshore installation managers) and superintendents and supervisory skills
training for supervisors and people moving to a supervisory position.the company has an obvious and extensive
commitment to industry best practice, and has embedded opito training and competence standards, where
possible, throughout the training plan and competence assurance system. proof of the extent of this approach
was recognized by winning, in november 2013, opito’s ‘employer of the year award’ in abu dhabi.

the importance given to training and development applies not only to long-standing crew and technicians but also
to the additional workforce available locally, that needs to familiarise itself with the specifics of the company's
activities. to meet this need, the company supports nationalisation programmes, specifically in brazil, angola,
equatorial guinea and malaysia. these programmes include enrolment of personnel into higher education,
technical colleges and professional institutions either in their country of origin or even abroad (e.g. scotland),
special leadership and management courses and personal development courses. the company has also
established process simulators (replicating the central control rooms of the fpsos) located in brazil and angola
in order to support our training and development activities; these play a key role in our nationalisation
programmes.

                                                        .




3.6.4 compensation and benefits
the company’s compensation and benefits policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain the high calibre
talent within the organisation and deliver company strategy, in line with the core business principles “ work as
one – perform – shape the future “.

to enhance the policy and add significant value to the business results, a new dedicated team has been created
within the corporate hr organisation. the efficiency of this policy will be measured and monitored via the
employee engagement survey.

attraction

the company strives to attract the best talent in the oil and gas industry. to attain high calibre candidates, the
company offers competitive total reward packages in all operating locations.

annual benchmarking surveys are performed to ensure competitiveness of all available packages (base salary,
variable pay, long-term incentives and benefits packages).

the company offers attractive pension plans to all employees: various pension schemes are in place depending
on geographic location.

motivation

the wellbeing of all employees is paramount for attaining their best possible performance and output. as a
company, sbm offshore offers a non-cash benefits package which is among the best in the industry.

incentive programmes have been designed to cascade company objectives down to individual levels and reward
every employee for individual achievements, as well as for their collective contribution. the company has also
developed numerous non-financial recognition programmes to celebrate key project milestones and reward
significant individual achievements.

a new bonus plan has been implemented in 2013 for all onshore employees worldwide to achieve this objective.
to optimise employee engagement and to achieve performance levels, incentive plans, including kpis and
targets are now communicated to all employees with full transparency.

the same philosophy for performance incentive plans will be initiated within the offshore population throughout
2014.

retention

retaining key talent is essential to delivering the corporate strategy and achieving defined goals. this is of
paramount importance given the increasing shortage of skills faced by the industry as a whole. primarily the
company aims to retain talent through career development opportunities and by offering its employees the
possibility to work on the best fpso projects in the industry. the company’s compensation & benefits policy
supports this goal through the implementation of several long-term incentive schemes to reward long-term
commitment to the company. although those plans may be difficult to implement consistently in all locations, the
company is making every effort to bring those plans to fruition.

the core principle of long-term initiatives are outlined below:




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                 87

  • a restricted stock unit plan is offered to senior managers, high potential and key talents on a yearly basis. the rsus
                                       rd
     vest over a 3-year period with 1/3 vesting upon each annual anniversary of the grant date


  • the employee share ownership plan (esop) encourages every employee, depending on local regulations, to invest in
     company shares, offering a significant contribution from the company to the plan.




3.6.5 employee wellbeing
the company, conscious of the need to protect its most important asset, is focused on the wellbeing of its
personnel and the need to provide a pleasant work environment. in this respect, several initiatives have been
implemented over the past few years across its execution centres, such as:


  • implementation of international sos/control risks medical evacuation, repatriation and travel security coverage
     worldwide
  • stress management and healthy living presentations to managers (monaco, houston and schiedam)
  • employee care officer consultations available to employees (schiedam and monaco).
  • stop smoking campaigns in monaco
  • fitness rooms in houston and monaco
  • organisation of social events at all locations to encourage interaction
  • bicycle plan in schiedam
  • sbm nursery: the monaco-based professionally-run nursery and pre-school structure welcomes 34 children from 3
     months to school age.


the company’s focus on employee wellbeing complements the emphasis on ensuring a safe working
environment, which the company considers as a priority.

in november 2013, the company launched their initial global employee engagement survey with the aim of
gauging workplace perceptions and awareness of the company's objectives and programmes. the survey
approached issues including strategy, transformation, and compensationto name a few. the survey provider
began analysing responses in mid-december 2013. results will have direct impact on 2014 action plans and will
be shared broadly with employees following a presentation to management.



3.6.6 equal opportunities
the company's employment policy follows the principles of equal opportunity, thereby preventing any
discrimination on the basis of sex, age, race, religion, political or trade union affiliations, nationality or disability.
salary scales are in line with a competency matrix and take into account qualifications and professional
experience. the company considers this as an attractive element of the recruitment strategy.

the offshore engineering business has long been male-dominated; however, the company has adopted a
recruitment strategy to increase the percentage of female employees, including in managerial positions, in the
onshore segment over the past 15 years. this initiative has been successful but only to a degree, as the number
of graduates coming out of engineering schools and universities is still predominantly male, which limits the
gender ratio in engineering positions. moreover, the operating crew onboard production units remain
overwhelmingly male as is the case for all operators in the offshore industry. the total percentage of female/male
permanent employees from both onshore operations and offshore production was 24%/76% in 2013; a similar
ratio to the previous year. however, it is to be noted that in the onshore-based population, the total percentage of
permanent female employees reached 30% and in terms of management positions, the female population



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                         88

represented 22%.



3.6.7 social responsibility
the company works hard to integrate social balance and equal opportunities whilst preserving cultural diversity.
the company is committed to being globally aware, promoting local development and operating with integrity.
the company also believes that social responsibility means investing in the wellbeing of its staff and maximising
employee opportunities for success by providing stimulating challenges, customised training and high levels of
work satisfaction, all within a safe working environment.



3.6.8 global workforce information
headcount

the total headcount is based on all the company's personnel (permanent staff and contractors) registered as at
31 december 2013 for onshore projects and offshore operations.

the company's headcount totalled 9,936 (compared with 7,493 in 2012) which represents an increase of 33%.
this includes the yard joint ventures brasa-bsl in brazil rj (2,666 employees) and paenal angola (1,044
employees). read more about headcount

the 2013 main increase in the global headcount is explained by the increase in activities in brasa-bsl with
associated growth in personnel +2,191 permanent and contractors.

at year-end 2013, the headcount of a permanent employees totalled 8,358, representing 84% of the company's
workforce. the headcount of contractor staff totalled 1,578 employees, representing 16% of the workforce.

workforce diversity

over the decades, with its business spreading over six continents, the company has embraced the challenges
offered by different environments and adapted to this cultural mosaic. the need for in-country adaptation and
development has created greater flexibility and diversity at all levels of the workforce. indeed, the company has
managed to turn diversity into a strength, building stronger links and and synergies amongst its personnel.

the company's policy to recruit local-based employees whilst at the same time maintaining competency
requirements through training, has led to the employment of just over 90 different nationalities.

in 2013, the company employed seven main nationalities: brazilian 42%, french 13%, angolan 12%, malaysian
7%, dutch 5%, american 4% and british 4%.

this is explained by the geographical position of the execution centers, construction sites and offshore operations
units and shore bases.

absenteeism and turnover

the average rate of absenteeism related to standard illness has decreased in 2013 to 2.69% .

the net turnover rate (excluding retirement and non work related deaths) for 2013 was 13.1% and comprise firstly

of resignations followed by dismissals; the highest turnover being in rio de janeiro office, sbm operations,
followed by houston and schiedam ec's due to the buoyant markets and a shortage of skilled resources in these
locations.

3.7 sustainable initiatives
3.7.1 supply chain in focus
the company currently operates in 18 countries around the world and works directly with suppliers from 62
countries. suppliers are mainly located in europe, the us, singapore and brazil. in 2013, the company procured
                                                                 (1)
19.9 % of all deliverables and services from developing countries .

vendors who wish to bid for contracts with the company are assessed using a web-based vendor relationship
management (vrm) tool. the second version of the tool, vrm 2.0 was launched in 2013 with improved system
performance and enhanced graphical interface. the tool is now more user friendly for both the company’s
employees and vendors which will help to improve long term relationships.

in addition the company ensures that its policies and standards regarding business ethics, insurance, health and
safety and other key matters, are covered in the special terms & conditions set for all contracts. these are
always shared with potential suppliers at the bidding stage of every project.

compliance with the company’s code of conduct is mandatory for all suppliers and for their subcontractors and
agents. employees working for the supply chain function receive annual training on group’s ethics and
compliance, to prepare them to recognize the risks of corruption. in 2013, 76% of all eligible personnel working
within the supply chain attended the specialised training session. during 2013, the company completed 146
audits of its suppliers using a product classification system, which ranks suppliers from a (main suppliers, such as
construction yards) to d (suppliers of less critical equipment or services). all vendors supplying a to c products
are subjected to a quality assessment process; those categorized as a or b, are audited every 3 years. 176
corrective action reports were issued in 2013 following these audits.

vendor relationship management

supplier selection is dependent on compliance with the company’s standards, rules and regulations. the
company’s vrm portal publically lists the documents required to enter the pre-qualification process and hence
needed to evaluate compliance of the supplier and proposed equipment:


  • completed standard vendor qualification questionnaire
  • iso certifications
  • quality manual
  • hse manual
  • reference lists
  • organisation charts (company and group)
  • brochures, company profile, product descriptions and other relevant marketing materials
  • all qa documentation

the company only purchases products or services from suppliers who satisfy the full requirements for vrm
pre-qualification. those who meet the requirements are registered in the sbm offshore supply chain system tool
as approved suppliers.

3.7.2 neptune building
the company's monaco execution centre is looking forward to relocating into its newly refurbished neptune
building during 2014: office accommodation which has been retrofited to internationally recognised
environmental standards.

in line with the company’s sustainability values, the building was refurbished to deliver environmental
performance in accordance with breeam (1) international environmental standards. the company has
implemented many improvements and has ensured that the construction work adheres to standards of best
practice in sustainable design to achieve breeam’s prestigious ‘very good’ rating.

the objective of the refurbishment was to dramatically transform the space and upgrade the energy performance
of the building. as part of this endeavour, the project team conducted employee stakeholder assessment to
establish which features the company’s employees wanted to see in their new offices. the project team
integrated this feedback into the building design, where possible.

prior to the refurbishment, the building’s energy costs were high for an office building of its size. thanks to this
investment it is expected that the new building will consume only 80 kwh/m2/year. this significant improvement in
energy saving is almost equivalent to the energy costs of constructing a new environmentally sustainable building,
which today typically consumes 50 kwh/m2/year.

to achieve this cost reduction, the company will take advantage of monaco’s sunny climate through the use of
650 sq. meters of solar panels. the solar panels will produce 10 to 15% of the electricity required. in addition to
the solar panels, a solar hot water heating system will supply 70% of the building’s hot water needs.

the overall energy consumption for the building has been greatly reduced due to several innovative features such
as lifts equipped with an energy recovery system, and low consumption lighting with motion and luminosity
sensors. in addition, a special solar treated triple-skin façade with special curtains will help regulate the building’s
temperature, thus reducing heating and cooling costs.

the company’s environmental footprint will be further reduced through the building’s connection to monaco’s
urban heating and cooling system. today, monaco’s central cooling system uses seawater heat pumps which
draw cold seawater for cooling buildings throughout the principality. after use, the water is discharged back into
the sea at a temperature which does not harm the mediterranean marine ecosystem.

the company plans to move 850 employees to the new premises by the second quarter of 2014. the new facility
will assist the promotion of the company’s “work as one” initiative, by locating the majority of its employees in the
same building.

(1) building research establishment environmental assessment method (breeam). breeam addresses
wide-ranging environmental and sustainability issues and enables developers,designers and building managers to
demonstrate the environmental credentials of their buildings to clients, planners and other initial parties.

3.7.3 brasa fabrication yard
estaleiro brasa is a joint venture company with naval ventures corp (part of the synergy group) established to:


  • develop and operate the brasa fabrication yard and a fpso integration quayside at niterói / brazil for the construction
     and pre-commissioning of topside modules and other systems and equipment.
  • upgrade and operate the pelicano 1 floating crane to provide heavy lift solutions and services.

the estaleiro brasa module construction yard is located next to the rio-niteroi bridge in guanabara bay in the
southeast state of rio de janeiro. the joint venture is geared toward meeting stringent local content
requirements set by the brazilian authorities and the yard’s location provides both comprehensive support
infrastructure and access to a large skilled workforce.

the yard has been transformed since the beginning of 2011, from a barren site to a fully operational module
construction area. by the end of 2013, over 2,600,000 man-hours had been completed and a combined workforce
of over 3,000 were working on site to deliver the first modules for load-out, scheduled for the first half of january
2014.

ten topside modules, destined for the company´s fpso cidade de ilhabela, were nearing the end of
construction phase, and the units were being prepared for lifting using the company’s pelicano 1 floating crane,
at the year end. the floating crane had been upgraded to meet the heavy lifting (> 500t) requirements for placing
modules and equipment onto an fpso deck. these heavy lifting capabilities are unique to brasa in south
america.

the fpso arrived in the rio de janeiro bay at the end of 2013, where lifting, integration and commissioning is to
be conducted by brasa over the following seven months.

brasa is fully dedicated to the construction, integration and commissioning of the fpso which is on track to
produce first oil in the third quarter of 2014.


  • despite being in its early stages, estaleiro brasa was able to meet local content construction requirements set in brazil
     and in line with the company’s objectives to maximise positive impact for the local communities in which it operates.
  • initiatives to engage and benefit the local community have included: donations of provisions to families affected by flash
     flooding in xerem (rj),
        • a winter clothes collection,
        • sponsoring under privileged youth on children’s day (brazil),
        • a monthly food distribution for a nursing home in são gonçalo.


brasa was also a sponsor of the 68th navy school regatta, the biggest nautical event in latin america.

3.8 company tax policy
the company operates in a global context, with global competitors, global clients, global suppliers and a global
workforce. some three quarters of the company’s activities, measured by revenue, consist of large project
developments, each project costing typically between us$0.5 and us$2.0 billion. a typical fpso project sees a
hull conversion in asia, topsides construction in asia, africa and south america, engineering in europe, asia or
the usa and large scale procurement from dozens of companies in as many countries across the globe. in each
of these countries the company complies with local regulations, and pays direct and indirect taxes on local value
added, labour and profits, and in some cases pays a revenue based tax. to coordinate the international nature of
its operations and its value flows and to consolidate its global activities, the company created in 1969 ‘single
buoy moorings inc’, which continues to perform this function today from our offices in marly, switzerland.

the company’s tax policy is summarised as follows:


  • the company aims to minimise its overall tax burden to be cost competitive, while fully complying with local and
     international tax laws;
  • the company aims to be a good corporate citizen in the countries it operates in, by complying with the law, and by
     contributing to the country’s progress and prosperity through employment, training and development, local spending, and
     through payment of the various taxes it is subject to, including wage tax, personal income tax, withholding tax, sales tax
     and other state and national taxes as appropriate.


the company takes its guidance from the oecd transfer pricing guidelines, and has re-tested and refined its
internal rules in 2013. the company makes use of the availability of international tax treaties to avoid double
taxation. the company does not use intellectual property as a means to shift profits, nor does it use digital sales.
furthermore, the company does not apply aggressive intra-company financing structures such as hybrids. the
company treats tax as a cost, which needs to be managed and optimised in order to compete effectively in the
global competitive arena.

in 2013, the company had a corporate income tax liability of us$ 30.8 million (us$ 54.8 million in 2012). due to
the large losses incurred on the legacy projects, significant tax loss carry forward positions exist at the global
contracting company which are limiting the current tax payments in switzerland.

well as planned improvements for 2014, has been shared with the audit committee and the supervisory board
and has been discussed with the company’s external auditors.

the company tested compliance with its key controls in the fields of proposals, financial reporting, information
systems, hsse, quality assurance, tax, technical assurance and legal due diligence with satisfactory overall
results.

in respect of financial reporting, the management board considers that:


  • risk management systems and internal control measures provide reasonable assurance that financial reports do not
     contain any material inaccuracies
  • there are no indications that risk management systems and internal control measures did not work properly in 2013

the statements above do not imply that the company's can provide certainty concerning the realisation of
business and financial strategic objectives or that its approach to internal control over financial reporting be
expected to prevent or detect all misstatements, errors, fraud or violation of law or regulations. in respect of the
impairment charges incurred in 2012 and 2013, financial reporting was based upon the best operational
information available throughout the year and was promptly communicated. in respect of the investigation into
potentially improper sales practices, investigations are ongoing and no conclusions or updates are available as of
the date of this report.

in view of the above, the management board believes that it is in compliance with the requirements of section
ii.1.4 of the dutch corporate governance code taking into account the recommendations of the corporate
governance monitoring committee and the recent best practice provisions of the amended code.

4 financial report 2013
4.1 2013 overview
4.1.1 2013 company overview
introduction
the company began its transformation in 2012, re-focusing its strategy around fpsos and related products and
services, followed by far reaching changes to the organisational structure emphasising accountability,
transparency and compliance. the results, strong revenue growth, good core performance and record backlog
clearly began to emerge in 2013. the transformation continues as the company focuses on strengthening project
controls, support functions and operational disciplines across the business. this is being achieved through a
programme to improve ways of working for people, and through processes and systems designed to increase
effectiveness, deliver control and allow the company to “work as one.”

apart from the on-going internal investigation into potentially improper sales practices, the company has largely
consigned its legacy issues to the past. the yme settlement was signed in march and the deep panuke platform
achieved production acceptance in december 2013. asset values have been adjusted where required. through
the corporate and project financing activities completed in the year, the financial position of the company is
markedly strengthened enabling it to competitively address the increasing demand for larger and more complex
projects from our clients.

the project award delays encountered in 2012, combined with a strong commercial effort, resulted in record order
                               1                                               1
levels in 2013 with directional order intake of us$10.0 billion and directional backlog of us$23.0 billion.

consistent with the company’s strategy to focus on its core business and to further strengthen the financial
position, a number of non-core asset divestments were made during the period, which include the sale and lease
back transactions of two out of three office properties in monaco and the sale of its non-core “cool™ hose”
technology.

in the first half of the year, the company strengthened its financial position through a 1 for 10 rights offering of
new ordinary shares raising us$247 million and, as a result of the settlement with talisman, an additional us$27
million top-up from hal investments b.v. (hal) as a share premium contribution on the new ordinary shares it
acquired through a private placement in december 2012.

the company secured a project loan facility for fpso n’goma for us$600 million and bilateral credit facilities
for fpso cidade de maricáand cidade de saquarema for us$600 million. the additional liquidity and greater
financial flexibility have further improved the company’s risk profile for securing funding for future projects.

directional reporting
in 2013, in order to provide its shareholders with clarity on business performance above and beyond the regular
                                                                1                     1
ifrs-based disclosures, the company introduced directional reporting. directional reporting addresses the
complexity in the group’s business model whereby turnkey sales are combined with construction projects for its
own lease & operate portfolio. furthermore, the company’s fpso lease & operate contracts are increasingly
classified as ‘finance leases’, which adds further complexity by accelerating revenue and profit recognition into the
                                                                                               1
construction phase, well before rents are invoiced to, and paid by, the client. the directional view extends
reporting with non-ifrs disclosures showing revenues and results more in line with operating cash flows to
simplify some of these complexities. this is designed to increase transparency and understanding of performance
                                                                                  1
and provide disclosures of backlog and income statement based on directional principles.

             1
directional reporting principles are:

                 1
  • directional reportingis an additional disclosure to ifrs reporting
                 1
  • directional reporting assumes all lease contracts are classified as operating lease
                 1
  • directional reporting is limited to restating revenue and operating income; no balance sheet restatements are made
                 1
  • directional reportingis included in the financial review
                                       1
in order to introduce directional reporting, the company achieved the following steps:

                              1
  • disclosure of directional income statement and backlog for h1 2013 and the h1 2012 comparison was made in august
     with the half-year results
                                                  1
  • 2013 transition period to promote directional reporting as the main indicator for company performance and variance
     analysis
                                  1
  • full year 2013 directional income statement disclosed with 2012 comparison
                                       1
  • 2014 guidance for directional revenue
                                              1
the need for the introduction of directional reporting is acute and significant: revenue reported under ifrs rules
                        1
exceeds the directional view by some us$1.4 billion in 2013. this represents the present value of future income
to be invoiced and realised over the next 20 years. under ifrs the company reports a us$111 million positive
                                                                        1
net income attributable to shareholders for 2013, while the directional view shows a loss of us$58 million. the
management board highlights these fundamental and significant differences to allow investors a balanced
understanding of the results, giving insight in both rules and reality.

hsse
over the course of 2013 the company achieved a stable safety performance in a range of its business activities,
and similar to that of 2012 with a total recordable injury frequency rate (trifr) of 0.40 in 2013 compared to
0.38 in 2012. however, the lost time injury frequency rate (ltifr) deteriorated to 0.15 in 2013 from 0.06 from
2012. a number of corrective actions have been taken to help raise our standards.



compliance
in 2012, the company announced it had initiated an internal investigation, conducted by outside counsel and
forensic accountants, into potentially improper sales practices. the company has disclosed the results of the
internal investigation to the appropriate authorities and remains in active dialogue. as the investigation is still in
progress it is not possible to provide further information or an estimate of the outcome, financial or otherwise. the
company has continued and expanded its efforts, started in 2012, to enhance its compliance programme.



yme
                                                                                                    stor
in march 2013, the company reached an agreement with talisman to terminate the yme mopu contract for a
settlement of us$470 million. the settlement included the termination of the existing agreements and arbitration
procedures and the decommissioning of the mopu. as the company had already made a provision of us$200
million in 2012, the difference of us$270 million was recognised in the 2013 results.



deep panuke
the company completed the debottlenecking process, and brought the deep panuke platform to full production
capacity safely and received a production acceptance notice (pan) from the client in december 2013. the
platform is currently on hire and generating full day rate.



strategy
last year the company re-focused its strategy on its core business of fpsos and associated products and
services. since the beginning of 2013, new award announcements for two fpsos for petrobras in brazil and one
fpso for shell in the gulf of mexico demonstrate progress is well underway. as the industry leader, the
company continues to strive for an improved risk/reward balance for its fpso products and services and has
identified an encouraging pipeline of projects in the medium term.



investing in our future
over the course of 2013, the management board focused its attention on three core strands of activity to develop
and improve sbm offshore’s future performance. during 2014, these programmes will carry incremental costs
                                    1
equivalent to 2.5%-3% of directional revenue.

with the lengthening life spans of fpsos, there is an emerging need for a defined fleet maintenance programme,
over and above the standard operational expenditure on individual vessels. this will be a focused two year
investment programme with clear operational and financial benefits.

despite recent progress, there is a distinct need to permanently embed improved efficiency and ways of working

across multiple disciplines. a two year transformation programme, named odyssey 24, will create the foundation
to deliver consistently outstanding performance. the programme is led by sbm senior staff members, dedicated
for the project duration, and using external advisors.

maintaining its technological lead position in complex floating production systems, and associated mooring
systems, is critical for sbm offshore. the company will continue to identify technology trends in the offshore oil &
gas market, prioritising development work to address key areas of demand.

outlook and guidance 2014
2013 has been a strong year for sbm offshore. revenue growth and underlying ebit margins were excellent as
the company successfully progressed its epc and lease & operate portfolio.

                                                                      1                   1
the company is providing 2014 guidance on the basis of directional results. directional revenue is expected to
come in at similar levels as in 2013, approximately us$3.4 billion, which is based on conservative award
assumptions. turnkey and lease & operate revenues are also expected to be approximately in line with 2013
levels.

the company expects a level of capital investments higher than 2013 levels. furthermore, the company will
continue to attract necessary project financing for the funding of new, or recently awarded, leased fpsos under

dividend
the management board reiterates that the company will not pay a dividend over 2013, in view of the losses
incurred in 2011 and 2012 and the need to strengthen the balance sheet. the management board intends to
discuss at the annual general meeting (agm) in 2015 a change of dividend policy, making dividends dependent
on available free cash flow as opposed to the existing policy of paying out 50% of ifrs net income. given the
on-going execution of the group’s record project backlog, the management board does not expect positive free
cash flow for 2014 or 2015. following the 2015 annual general management meeting the management board
                                                                          1
intends to propose a payout ratio of between 25% and 35% of directional net income subject to the availability of
free cash flow.

profitability
the primary business segments of the company are lease & operate and turnkey plus “other” non-allocated
corporate income and expense items. ebitda and ebit are analysed per segment but it should be recognised
that business activities are closely related, and certain costs are not specifically related to either one segment or
another. for example, when sales costs are incurred (including significant sums for preparing the bid), it is often
uncertain whether the project will be leased or contracted on a turnkey lump sum basis.

in recent years, new lease contracts are showing longer duration and are increasingly classified as finance leases
for accounting purposes, whereby the fair value of the leased asset is recorded as a turnkey “sale” during
construction. this has the effect of recognising, in the turnkey segment during construction, part of the lease
profits which would, in the case of an operating lease, be reported through the lease & operate segment during
the lease.

the directional operating profit in 2013 amounted to us$98 million (ebit loss in 2012 us$79 million) with the

  • high contribution from the turnkey segment, with a strong ebit margin of 12.5% (14.9% in 2012 and 8.8% excluding
     gustomsc and sbm dynamic installer divestments), driven by good projects execution and positive settlements on

construction, ifrs ebit in 2013 amounted to us$293 million (ebit profit in 2012 us$38 million).

non-allocated “other” income and expenses showed a net cost of us$21 million in 2013, compared with us$49
million in 2012, and includes us$27 million of book profit relating to divesting activities in 2013.

net financing costs increased to us$100 million compared to 2012 (us$78 million) mainly as a result of interest
paid on the us private placement set up for fpsos cidade de anchieta and fpso cidade de paraty project
loan. the average cost of debt came to 5.3% in 2013 (5.3% in 2012).

more generally, once production units are brought into service the financing costs are expensed to the income
statement whereas during construction interest is capitalised. it should be emphasised that the net profit
contribution of newly operating leased units is limited by the relatively high interest burden during the first years of
operation, although dedication of lease revenues to debt servicing leads to fast redemption of the loan balances
and hence reduced interest charges going forward.

interest income on the company’s cash balances was again very low in 2013 due to the low level of short-term
us interest rates. main interest income of the company is derived from interest bearing loans to joint ventures
and associates.

the reported share of profit in associates was minimal in 2013 (us$1 million) as it was in 2012 (us$4 million). in
the future the company’s share of net results in any non-controlled joint ventures (as defined by ifrs 11 joint
arrangements) will appear in this line item, but at present the company’s accounting policy for joint ventures
continues to be the proportionate consolidation method whereby the company’s share of each income statement
or statement of financial position line item is included in the consolidated financial statements.

                              1
the underlying directional effective tax rate in 2013 was stable at 13.6% compared to 14.0% in 2012.

* restated for comparison purposes

ifrs non-controlling interests in the 2013 net result amounted to income of us$3 million compared to the 2012
minority share of us$5 million due to reported results from fully consolidated joint ventures where the company
has a minority partner (principally concerns fpsos asengand capixaba).

ifrs net result attributable to shareholders accordingly amounts to income of us$111 million (us$79 million loss
in 2012).

as previously advised, the company will not pay a dividend over 2013.

statement of financial position
total assets were us$7.1 billion as of 31 december 2013 (31 december 2012: us$6.3 billion). the increase is
largely a result of the growing investments and activities recorded in 2013, and the proceeds from divestment of
non-core assets and the rights offering.

shareholders’ equity increased from us$1,458.6 million to us$2,064.2 million due to2013 net income of us$111
million, the 1 for 10 rights offering of new ordinary shares raising us$247 million and the us$27 million top-up to
the december 2012 private placement with hal and the us$201 million income in other comprehensive income
resulting from the variation of hedging reserve related to financial instruments.

capital employed (equity + provisions + deferred tax liability + net debt) at year-end 2013 amounted to
us$4,946.8 million and increased by 45% compared to last year’s level (us$3,419.9 million). this was due to the
positive contribution to equity of the rights offering, increase to the private placement realised at the end of
december 2012 and the increase of net debt.




at 31 december 2013, the company has undrawn committed long-term bank facilities totalling us$1,234 million
(revolving credit facility, fpso n’goma, fpso cidade de ilhabela - sbm 62.25% share and bilateral credit
facilities for fpso cidade de maricá and saquarema) available for financing capital investment in 2014 onwards.

net debt at the year-end amounted to us$2,691 million (us$1,816 million at 31 december 2012) with net gearing
at 126.0% which is slightly higher than last year despite the rights offering andhal private placement top-up, due
to the increase of the net debt driven by the us$470 million settlement with talisman. the relevant banking
covenants (main solvency, net debt/adjusted ebitda, interest cover) were all met.

as in previous years, the company has no off-balance sheet financing.

in 2012, the company announced a plan to sell and lease back its premises owned in monaco. the company
completed sale and lease back transactions for two of three office buildings. the remaining building is now
expected to be sold in 2014. as a consequence, the company’s related property, plant and equipment continues
to be classified as assets held for sale for their carrying value in the company statement of financial position as of
31 december 2013, together with three non-core vessels, the dscv sbm installer, the fpso falcon, and the
vlcc alba.

the current ratio defined as “current assets/current liabilities” increased to 1.67 mainly due to the increasing
construction activities on finance lease contracts, and the reduction of the current portion of loans and borrowings.

capital structure
following the successful private placement of the company’s shares with hal in december 2012, the
subsequent top-up of the private placement of the company’s shares with hal and the 1 for 10 rights offering of
new ordinary shares in early 2013, the financial position of the company is secure. the anticipated future
proceeds from the non-core asset disposals and frozen dividend payments, will provide further equity support.
the company’s medium-term objective remains to strengthen the balance sheet to a point that it will be able to
obtain an investment grade credit rating in order to access the corporate bond market.



investments and capital expenditures
total investments made in 2013 increased to us$1,423 million compared to us$1,217 million in 2012 and were
recorded as:


   • capital expenditures of us$201 million (us$655 million in 2012).

   • investments in finance leases for us$1,222 million (us$563 million in 2012).

total capital expenditures for 2013 (comprised of additions to property, plant & equipment plus capitalised
development expenditure) amounted to us$201 million (2012: us$655 million). the majority of this total is related
to new investments in the lease fleet (operating leases only) and other ongoing investments for which the major
elements are:


   • final expenditure on the commissioning for the mopu gas platform for encana’s deep panuke field in canada.

   • ongoing investment in the brasa integration yard in brazil.

   • refurbishment of a newly leased office “le neptune” in monaco.

expenditures in 2013 on the fpsos cidade de paraty, cidade de ilhabela, cidade de maricáand cidade de
saquaremafor petrobras, fpso stonesfor shell, and on fpso n’gomafor eni are excluded from the total
amounts above. due to the classification of the contracts as finance leases, investment in the units were recorded
through construction contracts, with the investments in finance lease to be ultimately recorded in non-current
financial assets. the net investment in these finance lease contracts amounted to us$1,222 million in 2013




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                 118

(us$563 million in 2012) and are reported as investing activities in the consolidated cash flow statement.

the decrease in property, plant and equipment in 2013 to us$2,023 million (31 december 2012: us$2,414
million) resulted from capital expenditure in 2013 less depreciation, impairment and amortisation, the
reclassification as asset held for sale of the sbm installer(diving support and construction vessel), the fpso
falconand the vlcc alba.

the company’s investments comprise the external costs (shipyards, subcontractors, and suppliers), internal costs
(man-hours and expenses in respect of design, engineering, construction supervision, etc.), third party financial
costs including interest, and such overhead allocation as allowed under ifrs. the total of the above costs (or a
proportionate share in the case of joint ventures) is capitalised in the company’s consolidated statement of
financial position as the value of the respective facility. no profit is taken on completion/delivery of such a system
for a lease & operate contract which is classified as an operating lease, apart from the profit realised by sbm
offshore with external partners on the construction contract with a joint venture proportionally consolidated.



return on average capital employed (roace)
roace (return on average capital employed) increased to 7.0% and return on average shareholders’ equity
(roe) also increased to 6.3%, both resulting from the increased activity and improved results in 2013 and the
increase in equity and capital employed due to the top-up of the private placement of the company’s shares with
hal and the 1 for 10 rights offering of new ordinary shares.

cash flow/liquidities
ifrs ebitda increased from the previous year mainly due to increased activity and improved results.

net cash and undrawn facilities decreased slightly to us$1,434 million, of which us$854 million can be
considered as being dedicated to specific project debt servicing or otherwise restricted in its utilisation.

the enterprise value to ebitda ratio at year-end 2013 stood at 9.9; higher than the previous year due mainly to
increased market capitalisation.

the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for

a. accounting framework
the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with international
financial reporting standards (ifrs) and interpretations adopted by the eu where effective for financial years
beginning 1 january 2013.

effective standards, that apply to the company

the company has adopted the following new standards with a date of initial application of 1 january 2013:


  •    ias 19 “employee benefits”:


the company has changed its accounting policy with respect to the treatment of actuarial gains and losses on
post-employment defined benefit plans. under the revised standard, the company recognises actuarial gains and
losses directly in other comprehensive income.

the former “corridor” method applied by the company has therefore been discontinued effective 1 january 2013.
the accumulated actuarial losses recognised in other comprehensive income under the revised standard
amounts to us$ 0.04 million as of 31 december 2013 and us$ 9.9 million as of 31 december 2012. the impact
on the income statement of the company is immaterial (additional pension cost of us$ 0.7 million accounted for
in the 2013 results).


  •    ifrs 13 “fair value measurement”:


establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value measurements.
the change had no impact on the measurement of the company’s assets and liabilities, however the company
has included additional disclosures in this regard in note 30. financial instruments - fair values and risk

  • amendments to ias 1 "presentation of items of other comprehensive income":

the amendments to ias 1 change the grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income. items that
could be reclassified (or ‘recycled’) to the income statement at a future point in time (for example, exchange
differences on translation of foreign operations and net movement on cash flow hedges) will be presented
separately from items that will never be reclassified (for example, actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit
plans). the amendment affects presentation only and hence had no impact on the company’s financial position or
performance.


  • disclosure amendments to ifrs 7 “offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities" and ias 36 “recoverable
     amount disclosures for non-financial assets":


as a result of the amendments to ifrs 7 and ias 36, there is no impact to the company’s disclosures.

standards effective after 31 december 2013, that apply to the company

contrary to the company's original intention, the company’s financial statements as of 31 december 2013 do not
include the impact of standards published as of 31 december 2013, but which application is mandatory as per
european union as from financial years subsequent to the current year.

ifrs 10 “consolidated financial statements”, ifrs 11 “joint arrangements” and ifrs 12 “ disclosure of
interests in other entities”:

ifrs 10 introduces a new control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated. this new
model focuses on whether a group has power over an investee, exposure or rights to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and its ability to use its power to affect those returns.

ifrs 11 changes the accounting treatment for interests in joint arrangements by distinguishing two types of joint
arrangements:


  • a company’s interest in a joint operation, which is an arrangement in which a company has rights to the assets, and
     obligations for the liabilities, will be accounted for on the basis of the company’s interest in those assets and liabilities; and


  • a company’s interest in a joint venture, which is an arrangement in which a company has rights only to the net assets, will
     be equity-accounted.


when making this assessment, ifrs 11 requires consideration of the structure of joint arrangements, the legal
form of any separate vehicles, the contractual terms of the arrangements and other facts and circumstances.
previously, the structure of the arrangement was the sole focus of classification.

in accordance with these new standards, the company has reviewed the treatment of its jointly controlled entities.
as a consequence, the company expects the following changes in accounting treatment of its interests in joint
arrangements as from 1 january 2014:

based on the company’s assessment, in 2014 the new standards will have a limited impact on the company’s
revenue and profit attributable to shareholders, while the company’s value of total assets will significantly
increase, mainly as an effect of the full consolidation of brazilian investees.

ifrs 12 brings together into a single standard all of the disclosure requirements about the nature, risks and
financial effects of an entity's interests in subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated
structured entities.

these standards will be applicable as of 1 january 2014 in the european union.

restatements of comparative period

the company reassessed its control over the joint ventures sbm ship yard ltd (company ownership 33.33%)
and paenal (company ownership 30%) and decided to change the accounting treatment for both entities from
proportionate consolidation to equity method starting 1 january 2013.

the change had no impact on equity and profit but led to a different presentation of the company’s financial
position, comprehensive income and cash flow statement. the 2012 comparative figures have been restated
accordingly for comparison purposes.

b. consolidation principles
all the companies which are controlled exclusively by the company are consolidated using the global integration
method. this includes special purpose entities, for which the company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies.

proportionate consolidation is used for joint ventures for which the activities are executed by jointly controlled
entities. the list of the company’s proportionally consolidated joint controlled entities is provided in note 34.
interest in joint ventures and associates.

the equity method is used for investments over which the company has significant influence, but not control, over
operational and financial policies.

the main affiliates of the company close their accounts as of 31 december and all consolidated companies apply
company accounting standards.

all intercompany balances and transactions, as well as internal income and expenses, are fully eliminated.

subsidiaries are consolidated as of the date of acquisition, being the date on which the company obtains control,
and continue to be consolidated until the date control ceases.



c. critical accounting policies
the distinction between current assets and liabilities, and non-current assets and liabilities is based on their
maturity. assets and liabilities are classified as “current” if their maturity is less than twelve months or
“non-current” if their maturity exceeds twelve months.

the preparation of financial statements in compliance with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are material, are disclosed in the paragraphs below.

(a) use of estimates

in the preparation of the financial statements, it is necessary for management of the company to make estimates
and certain assumptions that can affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities and the outcome of the income
statement. the actual outcome may differ from these estimates and assumptions. estimates and judgments are
continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable.

in particular, significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements are:


  • the anticipated useful life and residual value of the leased facilities;
  • the lease classification;
  • the revenue and margin recognition on construction contracts based on the stage of completion method;
  • the impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
  • the impact of variation orders, incentives and claims from clients where negotiations or discussions are at a sufficiently


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                             131

     advanced stage;
  • the future costs to complete for construction projects and required contingencies;
  • the timing and estimated cost of demobilisation;
  • the company's taxation; and
  • the company’s exposure to litigation with third parties and non-compliance.

(b) leases: accounting by lessor

a lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments,
the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time.

leases in which a significant portion of the risk and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified
as operating leases. the asset is included in the statement of financial position as property, plant and equipment.
lease income is recognised over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. this implies the recognition of
deferred income when the contractual day rates are not constant during the initial term of the lease contract.

when assets are leased under a finance lease, the present value of the lease payments is recognised as a
financial asset. the difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised
as revenue. lease income is, as of the commencement date of the lease contract, recognised over the term of
the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return. during the
construction period of the facility, the contract is treated as a construction contract, whereby the stage of
completion method is applied.

(c) impairment of non-financial assets

assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested
annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. an impairment
loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. the
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. for the purpose of
assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash
flows (cash-generating units). non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for
possible reversal of the impairment at each statement of financial position date. recoverable amounts are
determined based on value-in-use calculations that require the use of estimates.

(d) impairment of financial assets

the company assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets
(together referred to as “financial asset”) is impaired at the end of each reporting date. a financial asset is
impaired and impairment losses are recognised only if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events)
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably estimated. the criteria
that the company uses to determine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment loss include:


  • significant financial difficulty of the obligor;
  • a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;
  • the company, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty, grant to the borrower a
     concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                      132

  • it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation;
  • national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the financial assets.

the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value
of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the
financial asset’s original effective interest rate. the asset’s carrying amount is reduced and the amount of the loss
is recognised in the income statement. if the financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the reversal of the previously recognised
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.

impairment on trade and other receivables is described later in section d. significant accounting policies.

(e) revenue

revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the
group.


  • construction contracts:

construction contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method. revenue and gross margin
are recognised each period based upon the advancement of the work-in-progress.

the percentage-of-completion is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs.
provisions for anticipated losses are made in full in the period in which they become known.

complex projects that present a high risk profile due to technical novelty, complexity or pricing arrangements
agreed with the client are subject to gate reviews at advanced degrees of completion in engineering prior to
recognition of margin, typically around 25% complete. until this point, no margin is recognised, with revenue
recognised to the extent of cost incurred.

due to the nature of the services performed, variation orders and claims are commonly billed to clients in the
normal course of business. additional contract revenue arising from variation orders is recognised when it is more
than probable that the client will approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can be
reliably measured. revenue resulting from claims is recognised in contract revenue only when negotiations have
reached an advanced stage such that it is more than probable that the client will accept the claim and that the
amount can be measured reliably.


  • lease and operate contracts:

revenue from long-term operating lease contracts is reported on a straight-line basis over the period of the
contract once the system has been brought into service. the difference between straight-line revenue and the
contractual day-rates, which may not be constant throughout the charter, is included as deferred income.
revenue from finance lease contracts is, as of the commencement date of the lease contract, recognised over
the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                              133

(f) construction work in progress

construction work in progress is stated at cost plus profit recognised to date less any provisions for foreseeable
losses and less invoiced instalments. cost includes all expenditures related directly to specific projects and
attributable overhead. where instalments exceed the value of the related costs, the excess is included in current
liabilities. advances received from customers are also included in current liabilities.

(g) cash flow statement

to improve visibility to stakeholders, the company applies the following presentation. whereas the structure of
cash outflows and inflows for finance leases is similar to operating leases because no cash is received from the
client during the construction period (except any advance payments) and the investment is repaid during the
lease period through the bareboat charter, the company has therefore aligned its finance lease presentation with
operating leases as follows:


  • during the construction period cash outflows are treated as investing activities and not as operating activities;
  • during the lease period cash inflows are treated as operating activities and not as investing activities.

given the nature of the commitments, inflows and outflows from interest-bearing loans to joint ventures and
associates are treated as investing activities.




d. significant accounting policies
(a) financial assets

the company classifies its financial assets into finance lease receivables and other financial assets.

finance leases are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments that are not quoted in an
active market. they are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the end
of the reporting period, which are classified as non-current assets.

other financial assets relates primarily to interest-bearing loans to joint ventures that have a remaining term of
more than one year.

(b) borrowings (bank and other loans)

borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, measured at amortised cost and classified as current liabilities
unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after
the statement of financial position date.

(c) segment information

as per ifrs 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity:


  • that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses;
  • whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker; and
  • for which distinct financial information is available.


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                    134

effective as from 1 january 2013, the turnkey services segment has been merged with the turnkey systems
segment to form a new turnkey segment.

the three business segments as reported to the chief operating decision maker, the management board, are
therefore organised as follows:


  • the lease and operate segment includes all earned day-rates on long-term operating lease and operate contracts. in the
     case of a finance lease, revenue is recognised during the construction and installation period within the turnkey segment.
     as of the commencement date of a finance lease contract, interest income is shown in this segment;
  • the turnkey segment includes monaco, houston, schiedam and kuala lumpur execution centres that derive revenues
     from turnkey supply contracts and after-sales services, which consist mainly of large production systems, large mooring
     systems, deep water export systems, fluid transfer systems, tanker loading and discharge terminals, design services and
     supply of special components and proprietary designs and equipment;
  • other, which consists of corporate overhead functions and other units.

(d) foreign currency transactions and financial instruments

foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, the us dollar, at the exchange rate
applicable on the transaction date. at the closing date, monetary assets and liabilities stated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on that date. resulting exchange gains
or losses are directly recorded in the income statement, except exchange gains or losses on cash accounts
eligible for future cash flow hedging on net foreign currency investments.

translation of foreign currency income statements of subsidiaries into us dollars are converted at the average
exchange rate prevailing during the year. statements of financial position are translated at the exchange rate at
the closing date. differences arising in the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded
in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve. on consolidation, exchange differences
arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings of such investments, are
taken to company equity.

derivative financial instruments held by the company are aimed at hedging risks associated with foreign
currency and interest rate fluctuations. a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting (cash flow hedge or
net investment hedge) when there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, and of the
effectiveness of the hedge throughout the life of the contract. a cash flow hedge aims to reduce risks incurred by
variations in the value of future cash flows that may impact net income. a net investment hedge aims to reduce
risks incurred by variations in the value of the net investment in a foreign operation.

in order for a derivative to be eligible for hedge accounting treatment, the following conditions must be met:


  • its hedging role must be clearly defined and documented at the date of inception; and
  • its efficiency should be proven at the date of inception and as long as it remains highly effective in offsetting exposure to
     changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.


all derivative instruments are recorded and disclosed in the statement of financial position at fair value. where a
portion of a financial derivative is expected to be realised within twelve months of the reporting date, that portion
should be presented as current; the remainder of the financial derivative should be shown as non-current.

changes in fair value of derivatives designated in cash flow or net investment hedge relationships are recognised
as follows:



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                           135

  • the effective portion of the gain or loss of the hedging instrument is recorded directly in other comprehensive income, and
     the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in the income statement. the exchange
     gain or loss which is deferred in equity, is reclassified to the net income in the period(s) in which the specified hedged
     transaction affects the income statement; and
  • the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify as hedging in accounting standards are
     directly recorded in the income statement.


when measuring the fair value of a financial instrument, the company uses market observable data as far as
possible. fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the
valuation techniques. further information about the fair value measurement of financial derivatives is included in
the note 30. financial instruments - fair values and risk management.

(e) offsetting financial instruments

financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(f) provisions

provisions are recognised if and only if the following criteria are simultaneously met:


  • the company has an ongoing obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;
  • the settlement of the obligation will likely require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits; and
  • the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated; provisions are measured according to the risk assessment or the
     exposed charge, based upon best-known elements.


demobilisation obligations relate to estimated costs for demobilisation of leased facilities at the end of the
respective lease period. for operating leases, the net present value of the future obligations is included in
property, plant and equipment with a corresponding amount included in the provision for demobilisation. as the
remaining duration of each lease reduces, and the discounting effect on the provision unwinds, accrued interest is
recognised as part of financial expenses and added to the provision. for finance lease contracts, demobilisation
obligations are analysed as a component of the sale recognized under ias 17 - leases , and accrued for as
deferred income until demobilisation occurs.

warranties, where the company makes good, by repair or replacement, defective items that become apparent
within an agreed period starting from final acceptance of the delivered system are provided to customers on most
turnkey sales. this provision is classified as current by nature as it coincides with the production cycle of the
company.

(g) property, plant and equipment

property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses.

historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of such items. the capital value
of a facility to be leased and operated for a client is the sum of external costs (such as shipyards, subcontractors,
suppliers), internal costs (design, engineering, construction supervision, etc.), third party financial costs including
interest paid during construction and attributable overheads.


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                              136

subsequent costs are included in the assets’ carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the company and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. the costs of assets include the initial estimate of costs of
demobilisation of the asset. all other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the
financial period in which they are incurred.

when significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, those components
are accounted for as separate line items of property, plant and equipment. with the exception of the
thunderhawk facility, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis as follows:


  • converted tankers 10-20 years (including in vessels and floating equipment)
  • floating equipment 3-15 years (including in vessels and floating equipment)
  • buildings 30-50 years
  • other assets 2-20 years
  • land is not depreciated

the depreciation charge for the thunderhawk facility is calculated based on its future anticipated economic
benefits. this results in a depreciation charge partly based on the units of production method and for the other
part based on the straight-line method.

residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at least annually, and adjusted if
appropriate.

the assets’ residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each statement of financial position date.
an asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is
higher than its estimated recoverable amount.

gains and losses arising on disposals or retirement of assets are determined by comparing any sales proceeds
and the carrying amount of the asset. these are reflected in the income statement in the period that the asset is
disposed of or retired.

(h) intangible assets

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the company’s share of the net
identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of the acquisition.

goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (cgus) for the purpose of the annual impairment testing.

patents are amortised over their useful life on a straight-line basis over fifteen years.

research costs are expensed when incurred. in compliance with ias 38, development costs are capitalised and
amortised over its useful life if all of the following criteria are met:


  • the projects are clearly defined;
  • the company is able to reliably measure expenditures incurred by each project during its development;
  • the company is able to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the project;
  • the company has the financial and technical resources available to achieve the project;
  • the company can demonstrate its intention to complete, to use or to commercialise products resulting from the project;
     and



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                         137

  • the company is able to demonstrate the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset, or, if it is used
     internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset.


the development costs capitalised in 2013 are contained in note 11. intangible assets.

the carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever internal or external events indicate
that there may be impairment, in which case, an impairment loss is recognised.

(i) assets (or disposal groups) held for sale

the company classifies assets or disposal groups as being held for sale when the following criteria are met:


  • management has committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group;
  • the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;
  • an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the asset or disposal group
     have been initiated;
  • the sale of the asset or disposal group is highly probable;
  • transfer of the asset or disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale, within one year;
  • the asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair
     value; and
  • actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the
     plan will be withdrawn.


assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying value or fair value
less costs of disposal. non-current assets are not depreciated once they meet the criteria to be held for sale and
are shown separately on the face of the consolidated statement of financial position.

(j) inventories

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. cost is determined using the first-in first-out
method. net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated
cost of completion and selling expenses. inventories comprise semi-finished and finished products valued at cost
including attributable overheads and spare parts stated at the lower of purchase price or market value.

(k) trade and other receivables

at each balance sheet date, the company assesses whether any indications exist that a financial asset or group
of financial assets is impaired.

in relation to trade receivables, a provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence that the
company may not be able to collect all of the amounts due. impaired trade receivables are derecognised when
they are determined to be uncollectible.

other receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. interest income, together
with gains and losses when the receivables are derecognised or impaired, is recognised in the income statement.

(l) cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in bank and in hand fulfilling the following criteria: a maturity of usually


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                                138

less than three months, highly liquid, a fixed exchange value and an extremely low risk of loss of value.

(m) share capital

ordinary shares and protective preference shares are classified as equity. incremental costs directly attributable
to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

(n) income tax

the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. tax is recognised in the income statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. in this
case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

the company is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. significant judgment is required in determining
the worldwide provision for income taxes. there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. the company recognises liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. where the final tax
outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will influence
the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

income tax expenses comprise corporate income tax due in countries of incorporation of the company's main
subsidiaries and levied on actual profits. income tax expense also includes the corporate income taxes which are
levied on a deemed profit basis and revenue basis (withholding taxes). this presentation adequately reflects sbm
offshore's global tax burden.

(o) deferred income tax

deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. deferred tax is determined
using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is
settled.

deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. deferred tax is provided for on temporary differences
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary
difference is controlled by the company and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

(p) employee benefits

pension obligations: the company operates various pension schemes that are generally funded through
payments determined by periodic actuarial calculations to insurance companies or are defined as multi-employer
plans. the company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans:


  • a defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
     retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation;
  • a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the company pays fixed contributions to public or private
     pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. the company has no legal or constructive



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                      139

     obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating
     to employee service in the current and prior periods. the contributions to defined contribution plans and multi-employer
     plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.


the liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the
present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date less the fair value of the
plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains and losses and past service costs. the
defined benefit obligation is calculated periodically by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. the present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future
cash outflows using interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the
terms of the company’s obligations.

cumulative actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions
are recognised immediately in comprehensive income.

past-service costs are recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement.

share based payments: within the company there are three types of share based payment plans that qualify as
equity settled:


  • rsu/psu;
  • performance shares;
  • matching bonus shares.

the estimated total amount to be expensed over the vesting period related to share based payments is
determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments determined at the grant date, excluding the impact of
any non-market vesting conditions. non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number
of shares that the employee will ultimately receive. main assumptions for estimates are revised at statement of
financial position date. total cost for the period is charged or credited to the income statement, with a
corresponding adjustment to equity.

when equity instruments are exercised, the company issues new shares.

note 1. segment information
business information
as a result from an internal reorganisation effective 1 january 2013, the 'turnkey services' segment was merged
with the 'turnkey systems' segment into a new 'turnkey' segment. comparative data for 2012 has been restated
accordingly. thus, the company's reportable segments are identified as follows:


   • lease and operate;
   • turnkey;
   • other (this category consists of corporate overhead functions and other units).

sales between segments are carried out at arm’s length. the revenue to third parties and non-current assets
reported to the chief operating decision maker, the management board, are measured in a manner consistent
with that in the income statement and statement of financial position. these assets are allocated based on the
operations of the segment.

the year was marked by the following financial highlights:

divestment programme for non-core assets

as part of the disposal program of non-core assets announced in 2012, the company completed sale of its
non-core “cool™ hose” technology, and the sale and lease back transactions of two out of three office
properties in monaco. sales proceeds thus far exceed us$ 100 million, resulting in a book profit of approximately
us$ 27 million reported as “other operating income” in 2013.

yme project

in march 2013, the company reached an agreement with talisman to terminate the yme mopustor contract
for a settlement of us$ 470 million. the settlement includes the termination of the existing agreements and
arbitration procedures and the decommissioning of the mopu. as the company had already made a provision of
us$ 200 million for estimated decommissioning costs in 2012, the difference of us$ 270 million was recognised
in the 2013 results as cost of sales.

the company is currently investigating the possibility to recover losses incurred in connection with the yme
development project from insurers. under the terms of the settlement agreement with talisman, all pending and

future claim recoveries (after expenses and legal costs) relating to the yme development project under the
relevant construction all risks insurance shall be shared 50/50 between the company and talisman.

during 2013, the company has started with the preparation for the future demobilisation works of the platform,
and as such, it has incurred related costs. a call for tender for the transportation from the 500 meters zone and
the scrapping of the platform was issued and responses were being evaluated at year-end 2013. on this basis,
the company has reviewed and updated the necessary accruals for these future works, which are currently
anticipated to occur during summer 2015.

deep panuke project

the company completed the debottlenecking process, and brought the platform to full production capacity safely
and received a production acceptance notice (pan) from the client on 11 december 2013. the platform is
currently on hire and generating the full day rate as per contract terms. additional costs associated with the delay
and debottlenecking lead to an additional impairment charge of us$ 27 million accounted for in the 2013 results.

thunderhawk

the thunderhawk semisubmersible production facility in the us gulf of mexico, is the only facility in the
company lease fleet portfolio which bears exposure to reservoir risk.

during the second half of 2013, there have been two new triggering events for impairment:

• production has declined more quickly than originally projected due to a lack of reservoir drive compounded by a
higher than anticipated water cut;

• the company has engaged in commercial discussions around potential tie-backs to the facility.

the revised estimates of future deliverable volumes (derived from production trends from current reserves and
projections from planned new fields) including a potential tie-back in 2015, and the expected rates (derived from
recent commercial discussions) will be insufficient to sustain the asset’s current book value.

as a result, an impairment charge of us$ 65 million has been accounted for in the 2013 results.

decommissioning review

with the upcoming expiration of contracts for fpso kuito and fpso brasil, the company has undertaken the
reassessment of decommissioning costs. as a consequence, a company-wide review was conducted in the last
quarter of 2013 to reassess decommissioning expenses of all other vessels. this review was conducted while
taking into consideration various contractual obligations resulting from the contracts with customers, and revised
decommissioning costs estimates derived from the quotes received for imminent decommissioning of certain
vessels resulting in a charge of us$ 40 million accounted for in the 2013 results.

residual value of laid-up vessels

the fpso falcon and vlcc alba laid up since 2009 and 2011, respectively, have been classified as assets held
for sale, and were subsequently written down to their estimated market value, resulting in an impairment of us$
53 million.

performance shares
performance shares introduced in 2005, and subsequently amended in 2008 and 2011 under renewed
remuneration policies form part of the lti for the members of the former board of management and current
management board, and are subject to performance conditions. from 2011, this was based on 50% on eps
growth, and 50% on relative total shareholder return (tsr) in comparison with the peer group defined in the
2011 remuneration policy. performance shares vest three years after the provisional award date, and must be
retained for two years from the vesting date.

as from 2008, under the remuneration policy 2008, the number of conditional performance shares awarded was
such that their value is equivalent to 100% of the managing directors' base annual salary of the previous year,
assuming "at target" eps growth performance over the three year period following the period of reference. for
the performance period 2010-2012, the eps growth threshold of 5% was not achieved and consequently no
performance shares have been issued to the members of the former board of management and current
management board who were part of the lti scheme in 2010.

as from 2011, under the remuneration policy 2011, the number of conditional performance shares awarded is
such that their value is equivalent to 125% of the managing directors' base annual salary of the previous year,
assuming "at target" eps growth/tsr performance over the three year period following the period of reference.
in 2013, the conditional awards were 88,913 shares for mr. b. chabas, 71,024 for mr. s. hepkema, and 59,287
shares for mr. p. van rossum. if the threshold average eps growth/tsr over 2012 to 2014 is not achieved,
these shares will not vest. the maximum possible award (including special incentive at the discretion of the
supervisory board, which amendment of the remuneration policy was approved in the egm of 27 june 2012) is
250% of the conditional award for the ceo, and 187.5% for other managing directors.



psu and rsu plans
in 2009, new plans were approved by the supervisory board and implemented, replacing the previous share
option plan for senior employees. under these plans, shares in the company are awarded annually to eligible
employees. the number of shares granted under the rsu plan in 2013 is 845,380 (2012: 702,500). furthermore,
in 2013 a number of 206,400 additional rsu shares were granted (2012: 720,000). no shares were granted
under the psu plan since 2011.

the annual award is based on individual performance. the rsu plan has no performance condition, only a
service condition, and will vest over a three year period, with 1/3 vesting on each anniversary date of the original
grant date. the so-called additional rsu shares also has a service condition only, and vests at the end of three
year continuing service; upon vesting these shares are subject to a further two year lock-up period.

main assumptions included in the calculation for the psu and rsu plans are:

fair value at grant date (excluding entitlement to dividends during                                  € 12.48 / € 12.00 / € 11.55
vesting period), 1 july 2013




for the additional rsu grants, departures and fair value equal those of the 3rd tranche, as these vest on the
same date.



matching shares
under the sti plans for the board of management, management and senior staff of group companies, 20% of the
sti is or can be paid in shares. for board of management members, this share based element is compulsory but
for other senior staff the scheme is optional. subject to a vesting period of three years, an identical number of
shares (matching shares) will be issued to participants. assumed probability of vesting amounts to 100% for the
members of the former board of management and current management board and 95% for other senior staff.

the amounts recognised in ebit for all share-based payment transactions is summarised as follows, taking into
account both the provisional awards for the current year and the additional awards related to prior years:

note 7. income tax
the relationship between the company's income tax expense and profit before income tax (referred to as
'effective tax rate') can vary significantly from period to period considering, among other factors, (a) changes in
the blend of income that is taxed based on gross revenues versus profit before taxes and (b) the location of the
company's operations. generally, annual marginal tax rate is lower than annual effective tax rate. consequently,
income tax expense does not change proportionally with income before income taxes. significant decreases in
profit before income tax typically lead to a higher effective tax rate, while significant increases in profit before
income taxes can lead to a lower effective tax rate, subject to the other factors impacting income tax expense
noted above.

the components of the company's (provision) benefit for income taxes were as follows:

tax returns and tax contingencies

the company files federal and local tax returns in several jurisdictions throughout the world. tax returns in the
major jurisdictions in which the company operates are generally subject to examination for periods ranging from
three to six years. tax authorities in certain jurisdictions are examining tax returns and in some cases have issued
assessments. the company is defending its tax positions in those jurisdictions. the company provides taxes for
the amounts of taxes that it considers probable of being payable as a result of these audits and for which a
reasonable estimate may be made. while the company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the final
outcome of these proceedings, the company does not expect the ultimate liability to have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated statement of financial position or results of operations, although it may have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated cash flows.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                         156

each year management completes a detailed review of uncertain tax positions across the company and makes
provisions based on the probability of the liability arising. the principal risks that arise for the company are in
respect of permanent establishment, transfer pricing and other similar international tax issues. in common with
other international groups, the conflict between the company’s global operating model and the jurisdictional
approach of tax authorities often leads to uncertainty on tax positions.

as a result of the above, in the period, the company recorded a net tax decrease of us$ 3 million in respect of
ongoing tax audits and in respect of the company’s review of its uncertain tax positions. the decrease arises
from both adjustments that the company has agreed with the relevant tax authorities and re-estimates that it has
made. it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters could result in tax charges that are materially
higher or lower than the amount provided.

the company conducts operations through its various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world.
each country has its own tax regimes with varying nominal rates, deductions and tax attributes. from time to time,
the company may identify changes to previously evaluated tax positions that could result in adjustments to its
recorded assets and liabilities. although the company is unable to predict the outcome of these changes, it does
not expect the effect, if any, resulting from these adjustments to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
statement of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



note 8. earnings/loss per share
the basic earnings per share for the year amounts to us$ 0.55 (2012: loss per share of us$ (0.45)); the fully
diluted earnings per share amounts to us$ 0.54 (2012: loss per share of us$ (0.45)). basic earnings / loss per
share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit / loss for the year attributable to shareholders of the company
by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings / loss per share amounts
are calculated by dividing the net profit / loss attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of shares that would be
issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential shares into ordinary shares. the following reflects the share
data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

during the 2013 period the following main events occurred:

• main addition to property, plant and equipment during 2013 concerns the finalisation of the deep panuke
platform, the completion of the dsvc sbm installer and the ongoing refurbishment of the neptune office building
in monaco.

• following termination of the contract, no further economic benefits were expected to flow from the yme
mopustor asset. the asset has therefore been derecognised as of 11 march 2013 in accordance with ias 16 -
property, plant and equipment. the derecognition did not impact 2013 results as the gross value of the asset was
fully impaired in december 2012.

• an aggregate of us$ 145 million impairment charges has been recorded for the deep panuke platform, the
thunderhawk semisubmersible production facility, the fpso falcon and the vlcc alba (please refer to note 1.
segment information).

• an additional us$ 43 million impairment charges has been recorded following reassessment of
decommissioning costs (please refer to note 1. segment information).

in 2013, the line 'other movements/deconsolidation' mainly relates to the classification of the dscv sbm
installer, fpso falcon and the vlcc alba as asset held for sale (please refer to note 20. assets held for sale),
the transfer of the deep panuke platform from assets under construction to vessels and floating equipment
following first gas and the transfer of the lea vessel to the fpso cidade de maricá project.

in 2012, the company recorded an aggregate of us$ 427 million impairment charges, which consisted of:

• yme platform for us$ 398 million; and

• deep panuke platform for us$ 29 million.

in 2012, the line 'other movements/deconsolidation' was mainly related to the classification of the office buildings
in monaco as asset held for sale (please refer to note 20. assets held for sale), the transfer of the fpso cidade
de anchieta from assets under construction to vessels and floating equipment following first oil and the
deconsolidation of gustomsc following disposal of the subsidiaries.

property, plant and equipment at year-end include:


   • eight (2012: nine) integrated floating production, storage and offloading systems (fpsos), each consisting of a converted
       tanker, a processing plant and one mooring system;
   • two (2012: two) floating storage and offloading systems (fsos), consisting of a converted or newbuild tanker and mooring
       system including the fluid transfer system;
   • two second-hand tankers (2012: two) and no barge (2012: nil);
   • one semi-submersible production platform (2012: one); and
   • one mopu facility (2012: two under construction).

an amount of us$ 16.3 million (2012: us$ 29.6 million) third party interest has been capitalised during the
financial year under review as part of the additions to property, plant and equipment.

the fair value of most of the properties, plants and equipments cannot be estimated precisely but is expected to
be in excess of carrying values. fair value information is therefore not included in the notes to the financial
statements.

amortisation of development costs is included in ‘cost of sales’ in the income statement and amounts to us$ 1
million (2012: us$ 4 million).

goodwill relates to the acquisition of the houston based subsidiaries. the recoverable amount is determined
based on value-in-use calculations. these calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial
budgets approved by management covering a three-year period. cash flows beyond the three-year period are
extrapolated using estimated growth rates (2%). management determined budgeted gross margin based on past
performance and its expectations of market development. the discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific
risks (8%).

in 2012, the line 'other movements/deconsolidation' was mainly related to the deconsolidation of gustomsc
intangible assets following the disposal of this subsidiary, and the classification of the "cool™ hose" system
development costs as assets held for sale (please refer to note 20. assets held for sale).

the allowance for impairment represents the company’s estimate of losses in respect of trade debtors. the
allowance is built on specific expected loss components that relate to individual exposures. the allowance is not
discounted when created. the creation and release for impaired trade debtors have been included in gross
margin in the income statement. amounts charged to the allowance account are generally written off when there
is no expectation of recovery. the other classes within the trade and other receivables do not contain allowances
for impairment.

the deferred income on operating lease contracts is mainly related to the revenue for one of the operating lease
units, which reflects a degressive day-rate schedule. as income is shown in the income statement on a
straight-line basis with reference to ias 17 - leases, the difference between the yearly straight-line revenue and
the contractual day rates is included as deferred income. the deferral will increase then stabilise until 2019 when
the release of the deferral will commence.

demobilisation
the provision for demobilisation relates to the costs for demobilisation of the f(p)so fleet at the end of the
respective operating lease periods. the obligations are valued at net present value, and on a yearly basis interest
is added to this provision. the recognised interest is included in financial expenses (see note 5. net financing
costs). the net present value is calculated at the inception date of the lease, at a rate of 5%. the increase of the
provision in 2013 results from the company-wide review conducted in the last quarter of 2013 to reassess
decommissioning expenses of all vessels (please refer to note 1. segment information).

expected outflow of amounts is within one year: us$ 23 million (2012: us$ 4 million), between one and five years

contingent liabilities
the company reported with a press release on 10 april 2012 that it had become aware of certain sales practices
involving third parties which may have been improper. an investigation was commenced in 2012 at the request of
the company into alleged payments involving sales intermediaries in certain african countries in the period 2007
through 2011, in order to determine whether these alleged payments violated anti-corruption laws. in the course
of the investigation, allegations were made of improper payments in countries outside africa but to date no
conclusive proof of such allegations has been established. the investigation is being carried out by outside legal
counsel and forensic accountants, with the support of the chief governance and compliance officer and under
the oversight of the audit committee.

as the investigation is not yet concluded, the company cannot make any definitive statements regarding the
findings of the investigation. the initial feedback received to date is that there are indications that substantial
payments were made, mostly through intermediaries, which appear to have been intended for government
officials.

the company's new management board, appointed in the course of 2012, has introduced new policies,
processes and systems, established an independent compliance function, enhanced its internal controls and
monitoring systems and continues to emphasise awareness of proper compliance throughout the company up to
the highest management levels.

the company voluntarily disclosed the investigation to the dutch public prosecution service (openbaar
ministerie; om) and the united states department of justice (doj) in 2012 and has remained in active dialogue
with these authorities. the company disclosed the initial feedback from the investigation to the authorities,
actively cooperates with them and continues to give follow-up on specific questions.
at this stage it is not possible to state anything on the outcome of the investigation, financial or otherwise,
but failure to comply with anti-corruption laws, once established, could give rise to criminal prosecution
by the om, the doj or any local authorities, civil claims or administrative proceedings against the company. this
could result in the company paying damages or significant fines or penalties imposed by the om, the doj or any
local authorities, as well as disgorgements, debarment or other remedies, which could have a material financial
impact on the company; however a reasonable estimate cannot be made at this stage.

note 30. financial instruments - fair values and risk management
this note presents information about the company's exposure to risk resulting from its use of financial
instruments, the company's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the
company's management of capital. further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated
financial statements.



accounting classifications and fair values
the company uses the following fair value hierarchy for financial instruments that are measured at fair value in
the statement of financial position, which require disclosure of fair value measurements by level:

• quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1);

• inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
(that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2);

• inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is unobservable inputs) (level
3).

the following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,
including their levels in the fair value hierarchy. it does not include fair value information for financial assets and
financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

interest rate swaps

gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in equity on interest rate swap contracts will be continuously
released to the income statement until the final repayment of the bank borrowings (see note 21. equity
attributable to shareholders).

forward currency contracts

gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward currency contracts are recognised in the income
statement in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the income statement. this is
mainly within twelve months from the statement of financial position date unless the gain or loss is included in the
initial amount recognised in the carrying amount of fixed assets, in which case recognition is over the lifetime of
the asset, or the gain or loss is included in the initial amount recognised in the carrying amount of the cost
incurred on construction contracts in which case recognition is based on the ‘percentage-of-completion method’.

financial risk management
the company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, market risk (including currency risk, interest rate
risk, commodity risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. the company’s overall risk management
programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects
on the company’s financial performance. the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk
exposures. the company buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial
liabilities, in order to manage market risks. all such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set in the
group policy. generally the company seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in the profit
and loss account. the purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risk arising from the company’s
operations and its sources of finance. derivatives are only used to hedge closely correlated underlying business
transactions.

the company’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise trade debtors and creditors, bank
loans and overdraft, cash and cash equivalents (including short term deposits) and financial guarantees. the
main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the company’s operations and/or result directly from the
operations.

financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the
management board. treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the
subsidiaries and the chief financial officer (cfo). the management board provides written principles for overall
risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of
excess liquidity. it is, and has been throughout the year under review, the company’s policy that no speculative in
financial instruments shall be undertaken. the main risks arising from the company’s financial instruments are
market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.

market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect
the company’s income or the value of its holding of financial instruments. the objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the
return on risk.

foreign exchange risk
the company operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from transactional currency
exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, singapore dollar, and brazilian real. the exposure arises from
sales or purchases in currencies other than the company’s functional currency. the company uses forward
currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposure once the company enteres into a firm commitment of a
project contract. the forward currency contracts must be in the same currency as the hedged item.

the company has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency
translation risk.

the main company’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows based on notional amounts:

in 2012, the increase of net exposure in eur resulted from the disposal of the gustomsc entities. the cash from
this disposal has been converted to usd in 2013.

estimated forecast purchases have significantly increased in 2013 following the awards of three fpso projects
(cidade de marica, cidade de saquarema and shell stones).

the estimated forecast purchases relate to project expenditures for up to three years.

the main currency exposures of overhead expenses are 100% hedged for the coming year, 66% hedged for the
year thereafter, and 33% for the subsequent year. included in the statement above are the overhead expenses for
one year and the corresponding forward exchange contracts. the following significant exchange rates applied

interest rate risk
the company’s exposure to risk for changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the company’s long-term
debt obligations with a floating interest rate. in respect of controlling interest rate risk, the floating interest rates of
long-term loans are hedged by fixed rate swaps for the entire maturity period. the revolving credit facility is
intended for fluctuating needs of construction financing of facilities and bears interest at floating rates, which is
also swapped for fixed rates when exposure is significant.

at the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the company’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

at 31 december 2013, it is estimated that a general increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would increase
the company’s profit before tax for the year by approximately us$ 2.9 million (2012: increase of us$ 5.3 million)
since 95.8% (2012: 105.5%) of the debt relating to the lease and operate is hedged by fixed interest rate swaps.

credit risk

credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails
to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the company’s other financial assets, trade and
other receivables (including committed transactions), derivative financial instruments and cash and cash
equivalents.

the company has amended its policy on cash investment in 2012 and limits per counterparty were set to: a- and
a rating us$ 25 million, a+ rating us$ 50 million, aa- and aa rating us$ 80 million and aa+ and above rating
us$ 100 million. cash held in bbb rating is held in one of the largest banks in brazil and cash held in
'non-investment grade' is mainly held in primary banks in angola and nigeria.

for trade debtors the credit quality of each customer is assessed, taking into account its financial position, past
experience and other factors. individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with
limits set by the management board. at the statement of financial position date there is no customer that has an
outstanding balance with a percentage over 10% of the total of trade and other receivables. reference is made to
note 15. trade and other receivables for information on the distribution of the receivables by country and an
analysis of the ageing of the receivables.

as set out above, (by managing interest rate and currency risks) the company aims to reduce the impact of
short-term fluctuations on the company’s earnings. over the longer-term however, permanent changes in foreign
exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.

liquidity risk

liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. the
company’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                   190

liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and abnormal conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the company’s reputation.

liquidity is monitored using rolling forecasts of the company’s liquidity reserves on the basis of expected cash
flows. flexibility is secured by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.

the table below analyses the company’s non-derivative financial liabilities, derivative financial liabilities and
derivative financial assets into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of
financial position date to the contractual maturity date. the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
undiscounted cash flows. the future interest cash flows for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are
based on the libor rates as at the reporting date.

capital risk management

the company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the company’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

consistent with others in the industry, the company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. this ratio is
calculated as net debt divided by total capital. net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including the short term
part of the long term debt and bank overdrafts as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position) less
cash and cash equivalents. total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of
financial position, plus net debt.

the company’s strategy which has not changed from 2012, is to target a gearing ratio between 50% and 60%.
this target is subject to maintaining headroom of 20% of all banking covenants. the gearing ratios at 31
december 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

other risks

in respect of controlling political and credit risk, the company has a policy of thoroughly reviewing risks
associated with contracts, whether turnkey or long-term leases. where political risk cover is deemed necessary
and available in the market, insurance is obtained. in respect of credit risk, bank or parent company guarantees
are negotiated with customers. furthermore, limited recourse project financing removes a large part of the risk on
long term-leases.

report on the audit of the financial statements
opinion with respect to the consolidated financial statements

offshore n.v. as at 31 december 2013, and of its result and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union (eu-ifrs) and with part 9 of
book 2 of the dutch civil code.

opinion with respect to the company financial statements

in our opinion, the company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of sbm
offshore n.v. as at 31 december 2013 and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with part 9 of book
2 of the dutch civil code.

our engagement

we have audited the financial statements 2013 of sbm offshore n.v., rotterdam (the company), as set out in
section 4.2 of the annual report. the financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the
company financial statements. the consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 december 2013, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow
statement for the year then ended and the notes to the financial statements, comprising a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory information. the company financial statements comprise the company
balance sheet as at 31 december 2013, the company income statement for the year then ended and the notes,
comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.

the basis for our opinion

we conducted our audit in accordance with dutch law, including the dutch standards on auditing. our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section our responsibility for the audit of the
financial statements of our report. we are independent of sbm offshore n.v. within the meaning of the relevant
dutch ethical requirements as included in the ‘verordening op de gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’
(vgba) and the ‘verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants’ (vio) and have fulfilled our other
responsibilities under those ethical requirements. we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

the key audit matters from our audit

key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements. key audit matters are selected from the matters communicated with the management
board and the supervisory board, but are not intended to represent all matters that were discussed with them.



sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                              201

our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole. our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the key audit
matters described below, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.

revenue recognition on construction contracts involves significant judgement

the engineering and construction of floating production storage and offloading systems (fpsos) is complex
and exposes the company to various business and financial reporting risks. revenue arising from construction
contracts, in its turnkey segment, represents more than 75% of the group’s total revenue. the recognition of
revenue and the estimation of the outcome of construction contracts requires significant management judgement,
in particular with respect to estimating the cost to complete and the amounts of variation orders to be recognised.
in addition, significant management judgement is required to assess the consequences of various legal
proceedings in respect of construction contracts. reference is made to 4.2.6 notes to the consolidated financial
statements, accounting principles, c. critical accounting policies, (e) revenue: construction contracts.

we identified revenue from construction contracts as a significant risk, requiring special audit consideration. our
audit procedures included an evaluation of the significant judgements made by management, among others
based on an examination of the associated project documentation and discussion on the status of projects under
construction with finance and technical staff of the company. we also tested the controls that the company has
put in place over its process to record contract costs and contract revenues and the calculation of the stage of
completion. in addition we visited two projects under construction. furthermore, we discussed the status of legal
proceedings in respect of construction contracts, examined various documents in this respect and obtained
lawyers’ letters.

lease classification is complex and requires significant judgement

the company’s primary business is to enter into lease agreements for fpsos with its clients. this concerns both
finance leases, in which the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the client and operating leases, in
which the company retains significant risks of ownership of the fpso. the classification of a lease agreement,
either as a finance lease or an operating lease, is complex and requires significant management judgement.
furthermore, the classification determines the timing of revenue recognition and the presentation in the statement
of financial position. reference is made to 4.2.6 notes to the consolidated financial statements, accounting
principles, c critical accounting policies, (b) leases: accounting by lessor.

our audit procedures included an examination of new lease agreements and modifications thereof, an evaluation
of the significant management’s judgements with respect to the classification, based on the criteria for finance
lease or operating lease, as described in ias 17 leases. furthermore, we assessed the proper recognition of
revenues and the presentation in the statement of financial position in respect of the lease agreements.

contingent liability following internal investigation into alleged improper sales practices

the company announced with a press release on 10 april 2012 that it had become aware of certain sales
practices involving third parties which may have been improper. reference is made to 4.2.6 notes to the
consolidated financial statements, note 29 commitments and contingencies. the investigation identified that
there are indications that substantial payments were made, mostly through intermediaries, which appear to have
been intended for government officials. this matter required special audit consideration due to its nature.

we have assessed the progress and the findings from the investigation and examined various documents in this
respect. our procedures included regular discussions with the management board and lawyers responsible for


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                             202

the investigation, an assessment of the remediation measures taken by the company, verification of agents' fees
paid during the year and obtaining lawyers’ letters with respect to their activities. furthermore we assessed the
adequacy of the disclosure in this respect in note 29, which describes that the outcome of the investigation may
lead to significant penalties, fines or other consequences, which may have a material financial impact on the
company, however a reliable estimate can not be made at this stage. therefore, in accordance with ias 37
provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, a provision has not been recognised in the statement of
financial position as at 31 december 2013.

going concern

the company’s financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting. the use of
this basis of accounting is appropriate unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. as part of our audit of the financial statements, we concur
with management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the company’s financial
statements.

management has not identified a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to
continue as a going concern, and accordingly none is disclosed in the financial statements.

based on our audit of the financial statements, we also have not identified such a material uncertainty. however,
neither management nor the auditor can guarantee the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

responsibilities of the management board and the supervisory board for the financial statements

the management board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with eu-ifrs and with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code, and for the preparation of the report
of the management board in accordance with part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code. furthermore, the
management board is responsible for such internal control as the management board determines is necessary to
enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error. the supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process.

our responsibility for the audit of the financial statements

the objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes
our opinion. reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with the dutch standards on auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

as part of an audit in accordance with dutch standards on auditing, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional skepticism throughout the planning and performance of the audit. we also:

• identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.


sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                             203

• obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control.

• evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by management.

• evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.

• obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the company and business
activities within the company to express an opinion on the financial statements.

we are required to communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that
we identified during our audit.

we are also required to provide supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that

sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                                205

5 performance indicators
5.1 reporting scope
 the main financial, social, health, safety, security and environmental indicators are listed in the following
pages of the report. financial and hsse data is presented for both 2012 and 2013 to allow comparison. human
resources data is presented for 2013 exclusively.

this year the company has completed the new organisation structure and these changes have been reflected in
the reporting scope with the inclusion of new entities based on location and type of activities. as part of the
reorganization sbm offshore has identified a new category of workforce, construction yards. construction yard
employees are non-traditional type of sbm offshore workforce who work on construction yards, which sbm
offshore owns and/or operates in joint venture, and are allocated to non-sbm offshore projects.

the change in reporting structure has resulted in some entities not being comparable to last year. details of the
reporting scope for the specific performance indicators can be found below under their corresponding heading.



5.1.1 health, safety and security reporting
performance indicators are applied to the company and take into account all permanent employees, part-time
employees, locally employed agency staff (contractors and subcontractors) in the fabrication sites, offices, and
offshore workers, i.e. all people working for the company.

reporting of indicators for health, safety and security (hss) are divided into four main sections: onshore
projects, offshore operations, offshore contracting and construction yards. onshore projects consists of sbm
offshore employees and contractors in all offices, yards and sbm operations employees based in the monaco
office. offshore operations includes all vessels operated and owned by sbm offshore and their respective
supporting shorebases. offshore contracting specifically refers to the normand installer crew and onshore
support staff. construction yards employees for hss reporting consist of employees from the brazil based yards
which sbm offshore owns and/or operates in joint venture.

hsse incident reporting is registered and managed through the company’s single incident reporting system
(sirs) database. sirs is a reporting system that is used to collect data on all incidents on all units operated by
the company. sirs is a web based application which allows data entry from anywhere in the world.

the sirs system will also record an incident that is classed as environmental, i.e. any unwanted release of
pollutants to the environment.

incidents are reported based on the incident classifications as defined by oil and gas producers (ogp). the
company also reports incident data from subcontractor’s construction facilities if the incident is related to a sbm
offshore project.

the company uses manhours records and sirs data to calculate health and safety performance indicators set
by sbm offshore.

in addition to the sirs monitoring application; the monthly hsse report issued by the group hsse department
consolidates hsse records and events for the company, covering onshore and offshore.




sbm offshore n.v. 2013 annual report                                                                               206

5.1.2 environmental reporting
the environmental performance of the company’s twelve offshore units is reported after taking into account the
following reporting boundaries:


  • units in the company's fleet producing and/or storing hydrocarbons under lease and operate contracts during 2013
  • units in which the company exercises full operational management control
  • units in which the company has full ownership or participates in a joint venture (jv) partnership, where the company
     controls 50% or more of the shares


offshore operations environmental performance results are chosen according to the performance indicators
relative to gri and ogp guidelines[1]. this includes:


  • greenhouse gases, referred to as ghg which are n o (nitrous oxide), ch (methane) and co (carbon dioxide)
                                                        2                     4                   2

  • ghg emissions per hydrocarbon production from flaring
  • ghg emissions per hydrocarbon production from energy generation
  • gas flared per hydrocarbon production
  • energy consumption per hydrocarbon production
  • oil in produced water per hydrocarbon production

the environmental performance of the company is reported by region: brazil, angola and rest of the world.
based on the criteria stated above sbm offshore reports on the environmental performance for following vessels:
  • brazil - fpso brasil, fpso marlim sul, fpso espirito santo, fpso capixaba, fpso cidade de anchieta and fpso
     cidade de party
  • angola – fpso kuito, fpso mondo and fpso saxi batuque
  • rest of world – fpso aseng, fso yetagun and pfc deep panuke

the segmental reporting for 2013 has changed from last year and the reporting of some 2012 performance
indicators have been revised to allow for year-to-year comparison.

the average for sbm offshore at the bottom of each table is a weighted average, calculated pro rata the volume
of hydrocarbon production per region.

the calculation of air emissions from offshore operations units is by the method recommended by oil & gas uk
(oguk).

the company uses the world resources institute greenhouse gas protocol (ghg protocol) method to calculate
co2 equivalents. co2 equivalency is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse
gas, the amount of co2 that would have the same global warming potential (gwp), when measured over a
specified timescale (generally, 100 years). for further information on the ghg protocol and country specific
calculation methods, please refer to their website: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools.

environmental spills to air (except gas leaks which are not quantifiable), water or land from the offshore
operations units are reported using the data recorded in the single incident reporting system (sirs) database.

environmental waste include restricted, non-restricted and naturally occurring radioactive material(norm)
waste. generated waste is reported every month by offshore operations units on a specific form.

environmental waste is reported for twelve vessels following the reporting boundaries described at the beginning

of oil & gas producers.



5.1.3 human resources reporting
the company’s human resource data covers the global workforce and is broken down into parts which are;
operating units, employment type, gender, and age. the performance indicators report the workforce status at
year ending 31 december 2013. it includes all staff who were assigned on permanent and fixed-term contracts,
employee hires and departures, total number of locally-employed staff from agencies, and all crew working
onboard the offshore operations units.

for reporting purposes certain performance indicators report on construction yard employees separately as they
represent a non-traditional sbm offshore employee working on yards on non-sbm offshore projects.
construction yards employees for human resources reporting purposes consist of employees for yards located
in brazil and angola.

for some performance indicators the company makes a split between onshore and offshore activities. onshore
includes all sbm offshore employees and contractors in onshore offices, yards and sbm operations employees
based in monaco. offshore includes all fleet and their respective supporting shore base. this breakdown does not
include construction yard employees.

performance reviews / skills management / training

in order to ensure people development and optimal distribution of resources within the company, the company
conducts annual performance reviews for all employees. globally, the company uses the hay competency
system to grade and evaluate all permanent staff.

as a complementary parallel to this long-established annual performance review, the talent management and
succession planning programmes have been launched in 2009. a process called “people review” is in place to
discuss the strengths, development needs and potential future career paths of sbm offshore employees, taking
into account certain criteria, and identify those who have the potential to take on greater leadership roles today
and tomorrow.
