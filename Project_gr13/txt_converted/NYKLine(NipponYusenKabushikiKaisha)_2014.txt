japan’s first car carrier with
capacity for 7,000 vehicles,
aries leader was completed in may 2014.




car carriers incorporate a variety of energy-saving
technology. given recent bunker oil price hikes, im-
proved fuel efficiency not only reduces co2 emissions
but also contributes to earnings by enabling significant
cost reductions. accordingly, our new medium-term
management plan calls for a 15% improvement in fuel
efficiency versus the fiscal 2010 level.

how are we stepping up?

we are pursuing
innovation.
mobilising all divisions’ technological capabilities and
professional skills, seeking differentiation tirelessly




underpinned by an innovative corporate culture that
has been evolving and strengthening since our founda-
tion, we have accumulated and honed a broad array of
technological capabilities and professional skills. these
capabilities and skills enable us to reduce costs by
almost ¥20 billion a year. although the offshore and
lng transport businesses are challenging to enter, we
have established a presence in both businesses thanks
to our reliable ship-handling technologies and skills.
going forward, we will mobilise the technological
capabilities and professional skills of all divisions
to differentiate ourselves even further.

              strategy—stage 2
              in april 2014, the nyk group launched a new medium-term management plan, ‘more than shipping 2018—stage 2,
              leveraged by creative solutions—’. as the plan’s main title suggests, the group will continue advancing the basic
              strategy set out in its previous medium-term management plan, ‘more than shipping 2013’. at the same time, the
              group will differentiate itself even more by exploiting ‘creative solutions’ based on advanced technological capabili-
              ties and professional skills. through overviews of our previous plan and new plan, i will demonstrate the approach to
              enhancing corporate value that we have mapped out and followed since i became president.

 shuttle tanker             a shuttle tanker, often called a ‘floating pipeline’, loads crude oil from floating production, storage, and offloading (fpso) units in
                            deepwater fields and then transports the oil to crude oil storage units or petroleum storage stations on land.
 bow-loading system         a system for loading at the bow of a shuttle tanker—rather than the typical approach alongside the ship—to facilitate safer loading
                            in harsh sea conditions. another noteworthy feature of this system is that cargo hoses can be connected or disconnected from
                            offloading units more easily than with typical tanker-loading systems, thereby allowing quick release from the shuttle tanker in the

                         while ‘offensive’ csr means realising the group’s strengths fully through mainstay operations
                                           that service the logistics needs of customers in value chains.

  in fiscal 2014, we expect to complete our plan to introduce eight new
  b747-8f aircraft into our fleet. by replacing aged aircraft, the segment will
  be able to make maximum use of the outstanding cargo capacity of the
  new aircraft and develop operations so that the segment can fully benefit
  from the introduction of these aircraft.

management’s report on internal control
over financial reporting


1. matters relating to the basic framework of internal control over financial reporting
yasumi kudo, president, president corporate officer, and kenji mizushima, representative director, senior managing corporate
officer, are responsible for designing and operating effective internal control over financial reporting of the company and have
designed and operated internal control over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
basic framework for internal control set forth in “on the setting of the standards and practice standards for management
assessment and audit concerning internal control over financial reporting (council opinions)” published by the business
accounting council.
   the internal control is designed to achieve its objectives to the extent reasonable through the effective function and combination
of its basic elements. therefore, there is a possibility that material misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by
internal control over financial reporting.


2. matters relating to the scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and the assessment procedures
the assessment of internal control over financial reporting was performed as of march 31, 2014, which is the end of this fiscal year.
the assessment was performed in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally
accepted in japan.
   in conducting this assessment, we evaluated internal controls which may have a material effect on our entire financial reporting
on a consolidated basis (“company-level controls”) and, based on the results of this assessment, we selected business processes
to be tested. we analyzed these selected business processes, identified key controls that may have a material impact on the
reliability of the company’s financial reporting, and assessed the design and operation of these key controls. these procedures
have allowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls of the company.
   we determined the required scope of assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the company, as well as its
consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliated companies, from the perspective of the materiality that may affect the reli-
ability of their financial reporting. the materiality that may affect the reliability of the financial reporting is determined taking into
account the materiality of quantitative and qualitative impacts on financial reporting. in light of the results of assessment of compa-
ny-level controls conducted for the company and consolidated subsidiaries, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of
process-level controls. regarding the consolidated subsidiaries and the equity-method affiliated companies that do not have a
material effect on financial reporting, we did not include them in the scope of assessment of company-level controls.
   regarding the scope of assessment of process-level controls, we selected locations and business units to be tested in de-
scending order of revenues, and the companies whose combined revenues reaches two thirds of revenues on a consolidated basis
were selected as “significant locations and/or business units”. we included in the scope of assessment, at the selected significant
locations and/or business units, business processes leading to revenues, costs and expenses, accounts receivable–trade, and




                                                                                                                                                   performance information
fixed assets as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the company. further, in addition
to selected significant locations and/or business units, we also selected for testing the business processes having greater material-
ity, taking into account their impact on the financial reporting.


3. matters relating to the results of the assessment
as a result of the assessment described above, as of the end of this fiscal year, we concluded that the company’s internal control
over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements was effectively maintained.

                          independent auditor’s report

                          to the board of directors of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha:

                          report on the consolidated financial statements
                          we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and its consolidated subsidiaries
                          as of march 31, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows
                          for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, all expressed in
                          japanese yen.
                          management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
                          management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with
                          accounting principles generally accepted in japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
                          the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
                          auditor’s responsibility
                          our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. we conducted our audit in
                          accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in japan. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
                          reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
                          an audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
                          statements. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstate-
                          ment of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. in making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
                          internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit
                          procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
                          entity’s internal control. an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
                          accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
                          we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
                          opinion
                          in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
                          position of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha and its consolidated subsidiaries as of march 31, 2014, and the consolidated results of
                          their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in japan.
                          convenience translation
                          our audit also comprehended the translation of japanese yen amounts into u.s. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation
                          has been made in accordance with the basis stated in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. such u.s. dollar amounts are
                          presented solely for the convenience of readers outside japan.
                          report on internal control
                          we have audited management’s report on internal control over financial reporting of the consolidated financial statements of nippon
                          yusen kabushiki kaisha as of march 31, 2014.
                          management’s responsibility for report on internal control
                          management is responsible for designing and operating effective internal control over financial reporting and for the preparation and
                          fair presentation of its report on internal control in accordance with assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting
                          generally accepted in japan. there is a possibility that misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by internal control

                          our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s report on internal control based on our audit. we conducted our internal
                          control audit in accordance with auditing standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in japan. those
                          standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s report on internal
                          control is free from material misstatement.
                          an internal control audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the results of the assessment of internal control
                          over financial reporting in management’s report on internal control. the procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment,
                          including the significance of effects on reliability of financial reporting. an internal control audit includes examining representations on
                          the scope, procedures and results of the assessment of internal control over financial reporting made by management, as well as
                          evaluating the overall presentation of management’s report on internal control.
                          we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
                          opinion
                          in our opinion, management’s report on internal control referred to above, which represents that the internal control over financial
                          reporting of the consolidated financial statements of nippon yusen kabushiki kaisha as of march 31, 2014 is effectively maintained,
                          presents fairly, in all material respects, the results of the assessment of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with
                          assessment standards for internal control over financial reporting generally accepted in japan.

environmental accounting


the basic concept behind our environmental accounting is to correctly capture the expenses required for
the protection of the environment and repeatedly review our findings so that we can engage in appropriate
environmental conservation as a part of our business activities.

    fiscal 2013 overview
in fiscal 2013, we continued to concentrate on efforts to preserve the global environment, including the development of innovative technolo-
gies. these efforts resulted in a year-on-year increase in environmental protection cost related to environmental technology initiatives, such
as the increased installation of electronically controlled engines. further, the value for the reduction of accidents through safety promotion
activities increased year on year.
