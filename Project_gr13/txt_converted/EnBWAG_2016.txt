enbw employees
are shaping the
energiewende »
almost 20,000 people work at enbw. they are specialists
in many different fields and know, for example, how to
­operate power plants and grids, build solar power plants or
 plan wind farms. and they develop new products for our
 customers and ensure there is a reliable supply of energy.

it is the knowledge they have accumulated over decades
and their approach to the energiewende that are helping
the company to push forward the transformation of enbw.
we are shaping the energiewende – and now we are also
talking about it! this will be the theme behind our image
campaign starting in april.




                                                                we’re

enbw has already been implementing its 2020 strategy for
three years. this has included erecting offshore wind farms
and ­designing new products. now it’s time to talk about it and
to show off those who have made it happen – our employees.




enbw is charting a new course.
we are leaving nuclear energy behind, investing in mod-
ern grids, expanding renewable energies and develop-
ing new business models. this has been, and still will
be, a challenge for us. the restructuring of enbw is not
yet complete. we are right in the middle of it.            websites, in daily newspapers, on the radio and at

innovation

modern streetlights don’t only provide light. we are
making them the foundations for a networked city.
digitalisation stopped being a vision of the future long
ago and has already become a reality. an important
factor for local authorities is thus providing a good
information technology infrastructure. enbw has not
only responded to this requirement but is actively
pushing forward developments in this area. one ex­­
ample is the sm!ght project. intelligent, networked and
multifunctional street lighting is an important compo-
nent in the urban traffic and it infrastructure. energy-­
saving led lamps provide light, while the masts can
be fitted with public wi-fi, emergency call buttons and
charging technology for electric cars. sm!ght is a
project developed at the enbw innovation campus – a
unit that develops new business ideas away from the
constraints of a large corporation. another example is
energybase, an intelligent energy management sys-
tem for the home. in another area of the group, a dozen
researchers from enbw are working on the foundations
for the energy world of tomorrow. in collaboration with
scientific institutes, they are working on fuel cells,
micro gas turbines and new ways to store electricity.

     campaign. they then looked for candidates for the next
     stage – the photo shoots. and they selected locations
     for the shoots together with those employees selected
     to appear in the campaign. one of those employees is
     alois kessler.

     the enbw engineer is carrying out research in a project
     with the german aerospace center (dlr) in ­stuttgart into
     micro gas turbines that very efficiently generate elec­
     tricity. “when i read the request for volunteers, i imme­
     diately wanted to get involved,” said the 50-year-old.

     things got serious on a tuesday in february. spotlights­
     and cameras were set up in the dlr laboratory. the
     make-up artist removed small threads from his pull-
     over and the photo shoot began. he was required to
     change his clothes time and again during the shoot.
     kessler is impressed. “the photographer took a total
     of 200 shots of me.” he is excited to find out whether
     they will also show photos of him where he lives.

     there is lots of work involved in preparing for the shoots,
     and dozens of appointments need to be organised. there
     are strict safety regulations in force at many locations
     – such as at nuclear, hydropower and coal power plants.
     “it was necessary to change the appointments for the
     photo shoots a number of times in order to find more
     time for them,” says producer andreas hofmann.

                                                               13

up to twelve people are busy behind the camera. their
task is to show the person in front of the camera in their
true light. another employee who found himself in front
of the camera was hellmuth frey. the deputy head of
department for research and development is standing
near to the bismarck tower in stuttgart. the glow from
the streetlights is already glistering in the valley. a city
full of energy. the panorama symbolises the theme of
safety that is particularly important to the 51-year-old.
although it has turned cold, he remains highly motiv­
ated. “ the campaign is a fantastic idea.” one thing is
certain: he would gladly participate again.

enbw decided at an early stage: we want to play a ­reliable
and influential role in reshaping the energy system.
­“energiewende. safe. hands on.” is our guiding principle.

we already realigned our business model three years ago
and have rigorously implemented our strategy since then.
we are countering the foreseeable fall in earnings from
conventional generation and trading by expanding genera-
tion from renewable sources of energy, expanding the
stable grids business and engaging in an innovation and
service-based campaign to promote business in the area
                                                 ­ n­ergy
of “customer proximity”. enbw views itself as an e
company that is active along the entire value chain. in the
process, we are supported by our regional roots in baden-­
württemberg and by a stable group of shareholders, who,
like us, are pursuing long-term goals.

as one of the largest energy supply companies in ​germany,
we supply electricity, gas, water and energy-related pro­d­
ucts and services to approximately 5.5 million customers.

    letter to shareholders




    dr. frank mastiaux
    chairman of the board of management




    the developments over the past year have given the energiewende an even greater impetus. the expansion of
    renewable energies in germany is continuing with undiminished vigour. global investment also reached record
    levels of over 300 billion euros. at the same time, pressure on conventional generation is increasing: firstly, due
    to the co2 targets agreed at the climate change conference that are endorsed by enbw, and secondly, due to the
    reaction of the capital market – with an increasing number of investors withdrawing from fossil fuels. the low
    wholesale prices on the german electricity exchanges, which have fallen even more significantly recently, have
    made it almost impossible to operate power plants economically. current discussions demonstrate that the
    energy policy conditions for energy companies will not improve.

    these facts emphasise that we will only be able to position our company to face up to the energiewende, with its
    great challenges but also great opportunities, under our own steam. neither the market nor the political
    environment will help us do it.

    it was with this attitude that we developed our 2020 strategy in the middle of 2013, which we have rigorously
    implemented since then and can honestly say today: we believe that all of the developments on the market and
    amongst the competition have so far proved that this is the right strategy. from the very beginning, we expected

enbw integrated report 2015                                                                      for our stakeholders » letter to shareholders   7




                   a radical fall in earnings from conventional generation of 80 per cent by 2020. we aim to fully compensate for
                   this decline in earnings through the expansion of renewable energies, the grid business and our sales business
                   by 2020. and we want to achieve this as one company and one team, which will successfully achieve this
                   transformation together.



                   important steps achieved in the implementation of the strategy
                   in the 2015 financial year, we came a great deal closer to achieving the goals of our enbw 2020 strategy. although
                   we were not able to acquire the wind energy company prokon, we have successfully pushed forward the
                   expansion of renewable energies under our own steam: our second offshore wind farm enbw baltic 2 was fully
                   connected to the grid in september. the onshore wind farm harthäuser wald has also been placed into
                   operation and is the largest wind farm in baden-württemberg to date.

                   a very important strategic step in the restructuring of the company and the largest transaction in the history of
                   enbw is the exchange of our minority shareholding in ewe for a majority shareholding in the gas company
                   vng-verbundnetz gas aktiengesellschaft (vng). this means we will double our gas business and become the
                   third largest gas supplier on the german market. at the same time, we will be strengthened our regulated grid
                   business because vng generates more than 50 per cent of its earnings from gas transport and gas distribution.

                   we were able to significantly improve our operating result, above all in the area of renewable energies. as a
                   result, we were able to maintain the operating result of the enbw group at an almost stable level at 2.1 billion
                   euros, despite an extremely difficult economic environment. we owe this stability to the success of our growth
                   initiatives and our improvements in efficiency. the positive developments in our non-financial goals that are
                   supporting us during our transformation have also been pleasing: the satisfaction of our customers improved
                   markedly in 2015 and we were also able to record a significant improvement in our employee commitment.

                   in the near and distant future, we do not anticipate any improvement in conditions despite historically low
                   electricity prices. therefore, we also had to recognise high impairment losses on our power plants in 2015 and
                   were forced to increase provisions for onerous contracts for electricity procurement agreements. these items
                   had a negative impact of 950 million euros on our result. in contrast to the previous year, we were nevertheless
                   able to report a group net profit attributable to the shareholders of enbw ag of 125 million euros.



                   we’re making it happen
                   we will push forward with the restructuring of our company with even greater commitment in 2016 and further
                   develop our projects in the areas of onshore and offshore wind power. alongside the expansion of renewable
                   energies, we will define measures to significantly improve our competitiveness in our sales business. in the grids
                   sector, the focus will be on extensive investment in the distribution grids for the expansion and upgrading of
                   our existing grids. the acquisition of vng means that the further development of our gas business will become
                   another key area of focus. in view of the renewed deterioration of the framework conditions, we will of course
                   resolutely pursue our measures for improving efficiency. due to the wholesale prices for electricity, which are
                   not only consistently low but also continuing to fall, our operating result in 2016 will once again be below that
                   achieved in the previous year.

                   the board of management, management personnel and employees are one enbw team that will continue the
                   restructuring of the company in 2016 with undiminished energy and by taking courageous steps. based on a
                   stable economic and political environment, we have resolved to set the wheels in motion to improve our
                   earnings performance and thus achieve our goals for 2020. we will fulfil our promise.

                   yours sincerely,

     audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements
     following thorough examinations by the audit committee, the supervisory board undertook detailed reviews of
     the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as of 31 december 2015 that were audited
     and issued with an unqualified audit opinion in each case by kpmg ag wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, the
     combined management report for the 2015 financial year and the board of management’s proposals for the
     appropriation of retained earnings for the 2015 financial year. the final results of its own reviews did not lead to
     any reservations on behalf of the supervisory board. it approved the audit results of the independent auditor,
     endorsed the annual financial statements prepared by the board of management as of 31 december 2015 – which
     have thus been ratified – and the consolidated financial statements as of 31 december 2015, as well as the
     combined management report for the 2015 financial year, and agreed with the board of management’s proposal
     for the appropriation of retained earnings for the 2015 financial year.
