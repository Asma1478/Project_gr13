trade and other receivables are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore measured at amortised cost.
the average age of the receivables is 14 days (2014: 21 days). no interest is charged on the receivables. there are no trade receivables
past due and impaired at the reporting date, and thus no allowance for doubtful debts has been recognised. of the trade receivables
balance, the gold sales debtor is all receivable from johnson matthey of canada. the amount due has been received in full subsequent
to year end.
other receivables represent gst and vat amounts owing from the various jurisdictions that the group operates in inventory returns to
vendors where refunds are expected to occur.
the directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables is approximately equal to their fair value.
