the following co₂ emissions coefficients have been used when calculating the emissions for these forms of energy:
light fuel oil 267 g/kwh; heavy fuel oil 284 g/kwh; natural gas 198 g/kwh, diesel 265 g/kwh and petroleum 265g/kwh (source: motiva)
* electricity, purchased 203 g/kwh (source: iea 5-year average 2007-2011).
the coefficient for purchased electricity is obtained annually from data published by the iea.
we have defined co₂ as the most significant greenhouse gas. these emissions are generated by both transportation and energy consumption in our own
operations.
scope 1 emissions cover the entire group’s energy consumption and all the vehicles and fuel cards that we own.
scope 2 covers the emissions generated during the production of electricity and district heating at our production facilities.
our scope 3 coverage is currently being defined.
in addition to co₂, we also cause environmental loading through, for example, noise, dust, vibration and odour pollution, and sox, nox and small particle
emissions.

practitioner’s responsibility

our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the responsibility reporting based on our work performed. our assurance report
has been made in accordance with the terms of our engagement. we do not accept, or assume responsibility to anyone else,
except to lemminkäinen corporation for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions that we have reached.

we conducted our work in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements (isae) 3000 “assurance
engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information”. this standard requires that we comply with
ethical requirements and plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters come to
our attention that cause us to believe that the responsibility reporting has not been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the reporting criteria.

in a limited assurance engagement the evidence-gathering procedures are more limited than for a reasonable assurance
engagement, and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. an assurance engagement
involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other disclosures in the responsibility reporting. the
procedures selected depend on the practitioner’s judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the responsibility reporting. our work consisted of, amongst others, the following procedures:

   interviewing senior management of lemminkäinen corporation

   visiting the head office of lemminkäinen corporation as well as four sites in finland
   interviewing employees responsible for collection and reporting of the information presented in the responsibility
   reporting at the lemminkäinen group level and at the different sites where our visits took place
   assessing how lemminkäinen group employees apply the lemminkäinen corporation reporting instructions and
   procedures
   testing the accuracy and completeness of the information from original documents and systems on a sample basis
   testing the consolidation of information and performing recalculations on a sample basis.




                                                                                                      79

conclusion

based on our work described in this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the responsibility
reporting has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria. when reading our assurance
report, the inherent limitations to the accuracy and completeness of sustainability information should be taken into
consideration.

in addition to the performance-based reward, the above-

conditional reward based on share ownership and a
continuation of their employment or service contract. in order
to receive the conditional reward, a key person must already
own or acquire a specified number of company shares, or a
percentage thereof, by a specified date. the number and date
are set by the board of directors. if they do so, key personnel
will then be granted one share for each share acquired, as
long as their employment or service contract remains valid
and they retain ownership of these shares until the
conditional reward is paid. the earning period for the
conditional reward is the calendar years 2013–2015. the
conditional reward will be paid by the end of april 2016,
partly in shares and partly in cash.

5 discontinued operations
2013

at the end of 2013 the company did not have any discontinued operations or assets classified as held-for-sale.
2012

on 28 september 2012, lemminkäinen sold all its shares in lemminkäinen rakennustuotteet oy. the company specialised in
concrete business. the transaction price was eur 54.3 million, from which the company recognised a gain on sale of eur 17.3
million before taxes in the second half of 2012. in addition, in april 2012, the group sold its sports construction business,
which was part of the infrastructure construction segment, as well as the technical building and property services business in
the uusikaupunki area, which was part of the technical building services segment.

the lemminkäinen rakennustuotteet oy transaction included a separate reacquisition agreement on an asset, which meant
that the ownership of the asset was not transferred and gains on sale were not recognised for the asset. the asset was
recognised at the original carrying amount, which was lower than the acquisition cost. the company recognised the difference
between the carrying amount of the asset and its value in taxation as a deferred tax asset in profit and loss.

the effect of discontinued operations in 2012 was as follows:

kuopio will serve as the contract agreement client for the sites it financed and as the representative of the financier. the
contracts are fixed-price and are tied to the cost of construction index and reference rate. the financier will pay the contract
prices in installments as set out in the contract agreements. the service provider shall not have the right to use any of the
properties or to organise supplementary use.

the city of kuopio shall have the right to terminate the agreement with a six-month period of notice, subject to certain

two first sites to be completed (martti ahtisaari school and puijonsarvi school) have already expired and the warranty period
guarantees have been returned. the warranty periods for rajala school and puijonlaakso day-care center will continue until
2014 and for pohjantie school until 2015. the investment phase of the project has proceeded according schedule, as well as

the city of oulu owns the current buildings and land. the service provider will construct the new buildings as set out in the
contract agreement made with the subscriber. the city of oulu will gain possession of the buildings after handover.
lemmikäinen ppp oy will manage the buildings for a period of around 25 years pursuant to the service agreement. the city of
oulu itself will serve as the contract subscriber for the sites it also finances. the contracts are fixed-price and are tied to the
cost of construction index and reference rate. the subscriber will pay the contract prices in installments as set out in the
contract agreements. the service provider has the right to arrange supplementary use of the properties according to terms pre-
agreed terms as well as the right to charge fees for the supplementary use. the company has not recognised an intangible asset
for the right for supplementary use because of the uncertainty related to its usability.

the city of oulu shall have the right to terminate the agreement with a six-month period of notice, subject to certain additional
terms and conditions. the service provider shall have the right to terminate the agreement with a six-month period of notice, if
the city of oulu neglect their payment obligations for 90 days

the construction phase of the kastelli community center began in the late spring of 2012. all construction work must be
completed by the autumn of 2014, when the service period begins. the project has mostly proceeded according to schedule, as
well as quality and cost objectives. however, the accumulated costs for the construction work have exceeded the target level
and the calculated profit margin for the investment phase must have been cut down.

* includes the changes in deferred tax of discountined operations booked to income taxes.

the company has recorded the deferred tax asset from tax losses to the amount it considers, based on its profit forecasts, to be
utilizable in the future. the amount of tax losses has increased especially due to non-recurring items, which are not expected to
reoccur in the future. in 2013, the amount of tax losses in finland was increased by the damages that the district court ordered
lemminkäinen to pay related to the asphalt cartel. at the end of 2013, tax losses in the group's finnish companies totaled eur
19.5 million (eur 5.5 mill) and they can be carried forward for 10 years. the amount of tax losses in the group's norwegian
companies at the end of 2013 stood at eur 14.6 million (eur 9.3 mill.), and they can be carried forward indefinitely.

no deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries because the funds are
permanently invested in operations abroad.

* the goodwill reported in the ”common to segment” column has arisen from the asphalt business acquisitions in denmark and norway. it is allocated to the
international operations' baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit. this goodwill has been tested for impairment at the level of the
whole international operations' baltic rim region paving and mineral aggregates cash generating unit. in addition, the goodwill allocated to each business area has
been tested separately for each country.
goodwill impairment tests

goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indications of possible impairment. the tests are carried out
as value-in-use calculations of individual businesses in accordance with the smallest cash-generating unit principle. in
impairment testing the discounted present value of the recoverable cash flows of each cash-generating unit is compared with
the carrying amount of the unit in question. if the present value is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is recognised
through profit or loss as an expense in the current year.

in 2013, the impairment tests were carried out during the third quarter of the year. the tests showed that the current values of
the future cash flows exceed the book values in all business units. therefore, there was no need for impairment of goodwill in
2013.
forecasts and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing

cash flow calculations of the cash generating units are prepared for a planning period covering the next 5 years in accordance
with the management’s estimates. these estimates are based on past experience. cash flow forecasts beyond that planning
period are based on the cautious assumption of 1 percent annual growth. this was lower than european central bank's inflation
rate forecast over the medium term, in effect at the time of impairment testing.

the weighted average cost of capital (wacc), calculated for each individual unit, is used as the discount factor. wacc takes
into account the risk-free interest rate, the liquidity premium, the expected market rate of return, the industry’s beta value,
country risk and the debt interest rate, including the interest rate margin. these components are weighted according to the
fixed, average target capital structure of the sector. pre-tax wacc is determined seperately for each tested unit.

* the figures should not be regarded as forecasts for the entire business segment since the averages are calculated only for the cash-generating unit to which the
goodwill has been allocated. when calculating the average, the differences in the size of the cash-generating units are taken into account by weighting the figures
according to the net sales of the units.
** the change in the international operation’s average growth rate of net sales is mainly due to building construction business in russia.
sensitivity analysis

in connection with the impairment tests, sensitivity analyses are made to determine how possible changes in key assumptions
of the unit-specific impairment tests would affect the results of those tests. the key assumptions affecting the present value
of cash flows are the development of market and competitive conditions, the scope and profitability of the tested business, and
the discount factor. in the sensitivity analyses the calculation variables affecting these assumptions are varied and the effects
of the changes on the margin between the carrying value and present value of the cash flows are examined.

sensitivity analysis showed that reasonable and ordinary variation to key counting assumptions common to lemminkäinen’s
business areas would not cause a need for a significant impairment. most of the group’s recognised goodwill belongs to the
international operations segment arising from the acquisitions of the nordic paving units and to the technical building services
segment. margins between the current values of cash flows and the book values are wide in the baltic sea area paving and
mineral affregates as well as the technical building services. of the tested cash generating units, most sensitive for changes is
the infrastructure segment’s mineral affregates unit. there is risk for an impairment of goodwill less than eur 0.9 million for
this unit. additional tests for impairment are carried out if the sensitivity tests or possible changes in the future expectations
merit them. long term predictability of the lemminkäinen’s business units is reasonably good and the risk for the impairment of
goodwill is small.

figures describing the goodwill impairment risk of units subject to impairment testing by business segment are presented
below.

available-for-sale financial assets include several unquoted shares. the value of one single investment is not significant in
relation to all other investments. the fair value of unquoted shares cannot be reliably determined, thus they are presented at
cost less impairment.

collateral notes for uncompleted properties included in inventories are used as collateral security for the debts of companies
included in inventories to the value of eur 119.3 million (eur 73.1 mill.).

in 2013, the company recognised inventory impairment losses of eur 19.3 million, of which eur 14.7 million was related to the
company’s building construction segment’s commercial buildings. the impairments of commercial buildings in the inventory
are a result of the slowdown in commercial markets outside the helsinki metropolitan area.

fair value measurement
other non-current receivables includes trade receivables and other interest-free receivables. fair values are based on future cash
flows discounted using risk free market yields plus appropriate credit spreads. the used discount rates vary between 0.6 and
4.8 per cent. the carrying amount of current trade and other receivables is equal to their fair value due to their short maturity.

the fair value of non-current liabilities is based on future cash flows discounted using a market yield plus appropriate credit
spread for the group at the reporting date. the used discount rates vary between 2.3 and 3.2 per cent (2.1–2.5%). the fair
value of the bond included in interest-bearing current liabilities is based on the market price, and the fair value of other current
liabilities is assumed to be close to their fair value due to their short maturity.

a fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value
the group has categorised financial instruments recognised at fair value by using a three-level fair value hierarchy. financial
instruments within level 1 of the hierarchy are traded in active markets hence prices are obtained directly from the efficient
markets. fair values of instruments within level 2 are based on observable market inputs and generally accepted valuation
methods. fair values within level 3 are not based on observable market data but on quotations provided by brokers and market
valuation reports.

financials › notes to the consolidated financial statements (ifrs) › 28 pension obligations

28 pension obligations
the company has in its operating countries several defined contribution pension plans which are subject to local regulation and
practices. the company’s one most significant pension plan is the finnish emplyees pensions act (tyel), in which the benefits
are determined directly on the basis of the level of the beneficiary’s earnings level. tyel pension plan is mainly arranged through
pension insurance companies and it is treated as a defined contribution plan.

at the end of 2013, the company had defined benefit pension plans in finland and norway. all plans at the year-end 2013 were
final salary defined benefit plans, and they supplement the statutory pensions or enable retirement before the statutory
retirement age. in norway, some of the company’s defined benefit plans were converted to defined contribution plans during
2013 and all of the plans’ obligations, eur 12.4 million, were settled. in addition, the company recognised a curtailment gain of

defined benefit plans’ assets consist entirely of qualifying insurance policies and are fair valued on the accounting date. these
assets do not include investments to lemminkäinen or to real estate or other assets used by the company. the expected return
on the plan assets is an estimate of a life insurance company's future long term total rebate.

the above analyses are based on a 0.5 percentage point change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
when calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit pension obligation the same method has been applied as when
measuring the defined benefit pension obligation recognized in the balance sheet.

performance-based reward
years 2010–2012

lemminkäinen had a share-based incentive plan comprising three one-year earning periods: the calendar years 2010, 2011 and
2012. the board of directors decided on the earning criteria for each period as well as on the targets to be established at the
beginning of each earning period. in 2012, the earning criteria for long-term incentives were the targets set for the group’s
equity ratio and return on investment. the reward was paid partly in company shares and partly in cash. the proportion paid in
cash covered the taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. the shares may not be transferred during the commitment
period which ends two years after the earning period ends.

years 2013–2015

at the end of 2012, the board of directors of lemminkäinen corporation decided on a new share-based incentive plan for the
group’s key personnel. the plan includes three one-year earning periods, calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the company’s
board of directors will decide on the earning criteria and the targets to be set at the beginning of each earning period. the
potential performance-based reward for an earning period will be paid out in company shares and cash. the proportion to be
paid in cash will cover the taxes and tax-related costs arising from the reward. the shares may not be transferred during the
commitment period of approximately two years. if a key person’s employment or service contract ends during the commitment
period, they will generally have to return any reward shares to the company without compensation.

conditional reward

as part of the plan the above mentioned key personnel has the opportunity to receive conditional reward, ie matching shares, on
the basis of their share ownership and continued employment or service contract. in order to receive the conditional reward, a
key person must already own or acquire a specified number of company shares, or a percentage thereof, by 30.6.2013. the
number and date are set by the board of directors. in this case, the key person will be granted, as a reward, one share for each
share acquired, as long as their employment or service contract remains valid and they retain ownership of these shares until the
conditional reward is paid. the earning period for the conditional reward is the calendar years 2013–2015. the conditional
reward will be paid by the end of april 2016, partly in shares and partly in cash.

* the fair value of share at grant date is the share’s grant date value less estimated dividend payments during the earning period.
** number of shares earned in 2013 is an estimate.

according to management estimates no shares were earned, and therefore no expenses were recognised in earning period 2013.
the accured expenses from the share based incentive plans recognised in the income statement in 2013 were a total of eur
1.0 million (eur 0.5 million). the liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of share-based incentive plan at the end of
2013 was eur 0.9 million (eur 0.8 mill.). the company estimates that expenses to be recognised in 2014 from incentive
plans realised before 2014 will be approximately eur 0.5 million. actual amount may differ from the estimated amount.

warranty provisions cover after completion repair costs arising from warranty obligations. provisions related to housing
construction are expected to be used within one year after the provision is made. warranty provisions related to other
construction projects are mainly used in 1-2 years after the provision is made.

10 year liability provision related to housing and commercial contruction is determined as a whole for all the projects including
such liabilities.

landscaping provisions are related to a site's landscaping obligations. the expected time for using landscaping provisions
depends on the use of the site, because in most cases the landscaping work starts after the use of the site ceases.

lease liability commitment arises, when the company has a contractual obligation to obtain tenants for premises not yet leased
in a commercial real estate under construction. provisions for lease commitments are expected to be used in 1–3 years after the
provision is made.

litigation provision is recognised for the asphalt cartel related claims for damages pending in the district court of helsinki, with
14 municipalities as plaintiffs. the court proceedings of these actions are expected to start in the district court during 2014 at
the earliest, and are expected to last 1–3 years. the amount of provision is estimated on the basis of the decisions given by
helsinki district court on 28th november 2013.

financials › notes to the consolidated financial statements (ifrs) › 32 financial risk management

32 financial risk management
in its business operations, lemminkäinen group is exposed to financial risks, mainly interest rate, foreign exchange rate,
funding, liquidity and credit risks. the aim of the group's financial risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the
possible impacts that changes in fair values on the financial markets could have on the group's result, cash flow and value. the
management of financial risks is based on principles approved by the board of directors. the treasury policy defines the
principles and division of responsibilities with regard to financial activities and the management of financial risk. the policy is
reviewed and if necessary updated at least annually.

execution of the treasury policy is the responsibility of the group treasury, which is mainly responsible for the management of
financial risks and handles the group's treasury activities on a centralised basis. the group's treasury policy defines the division
of responsibilities between the group treasury and business units in each subarea. the group companies are responsible for
providing the group treasury with up-to-date and accurate information on treasury-related matters concerning their business
operations. the group treasury serves as an internal bank and co-ordinates, directs and supports the group companies in
treasury matters such that the group's financial needs are met and its financial risks are managed effectively in line with the
treasury policy.

interest rate risk
the aim of lemminkäinen group's interest rate risk management is to minimise changes affecting the result, cash flows and
value of the group due to interest rate fluctuations. the group treasury manages and monitors the interest rate position. the
group's interest rate risk primarily comprises fixed-rate and variable-rate loan and leasing agreements, interest-bearing
financial receivables and interest rate derivatives. interest rate changes affect items in the income statement and balance sheet.

the interest rate risk is decreased by setting the group's average period of interest rate fixation to the same as the interest rate
sensitivity of its business. the interest rate sensitivity position of the group's business is estimated to be about 15 months. the
treasury policy thus defines the group's average period of interest rate fixation as 12–18 months. the group aims to keep 40–
65 per cent of its liabilities per currency hedged.

the group can have both variable- and fixed-rate long-term borrowings. the ratio of fixed- and variable-rate borrowings can be
changed by using interest rate derivatives. in 2013, the group has used interest rate swaps for managing interest rate risks. part
of the interest rate swaps are used for hedge accounting and a hedging result of those derivatives will have impact on interest
expenses until the year 2014. there was no ineffectiveness to be recorded from hedge accounting during the financial year.

interest rate fluctuations in 2013 did not have any unusual effect on the group's business, but a significant rise in the level of
interest rates may have a detrimental effect on the demand for housing.
sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk

the following assumptions are made when calculating the sensitivity caused by a change in the level of interest rates:
-the interest rate change is assumed to be 1 percentage point
-the position includes variable-rate financial liabilities, variable-rate financial receivables and interest rate derivatives
-all factors other than the change in interest rates remain constant
-taxes have not been taken into account when calculating sensitivity

foreign exchange rate risk
the aim of foreign exchange rate risk management is to reduce uncertainty concerning the possible impacts that changes in
exchange rates could have on the future values of cash flows, business receivables and liabilities, and other balance sheet
items. exchange rate risk mainly consists of transaction risk and translation risk.

translation risk consists of foreign exchange rate differences arising from the translation of the income statements and balance
sheets of foreign group companies into the group's functional currency. in practice, the group's reportable translation risk is
caused by equity investments in foreign entities and their retained earnings, the effects of which are recorded under translation
differences in shareholders' equity. lemminkäinen group has foreign net investments in several currencies. in accordance with
the treasury policy, lemminkäinen group protects itself from translation risks primarily by keeping equity investments in foreign
entities at an appropriately low level, and thus does not use financial instruments to hedge the translation risks.

transaction risk consists of cash flows in foreign currencies from operational and financial activities. the group seeks to hedge
business currency risks primarily by operative means. the remaining transaction risk is hedged by using instruments such as
foreign currency loans and foreign currency derivatives. the group companies are responsible for identifying, reporting,
forecasting and hedging their transaction risk positions internally. the group treasury is responsible for hedging the group's risk
positions as external transactions in accordance with the treasury policy. the general rule is that the major net positions
forecasted for the 12 months following the review date are hedged, with a hedging ratio ranging from 25–100 per cent and
emphasising the first six months.

the key currencies in which the group was exposed to transaction risk in 2013 were swedish krona and russian rouble (in
2012 us-dollar and russian rouble). these transaction risk positions were mainly due to sales, procurements, receivables and
liabilities. in 2013 the group did not apply hedge accounting to transaction risk hedging.

sensitivity analysis of transaction risk

the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity caused by changes in exchange rates:
- the exchange rate change is assumed to be +/–10%
- the position includes financial assets and liabilities denominated in roubles and kronas (in 2012 denominated in dollars and
roubles)
- the position does not include forecasted future cash flows
- taxes are excluded in sensitivity analysis

funding and liquidity risk
the group seeks to optimise the use of liquid assets in funding its business operations and to minimise interest and other
finance costs. the group treasury is responsible for managing the group's overall liquidity and ensuring that adequate credit
lines and a sufficient number of different funding sources are available. it also ensures that the maturity profile of the group's
loans and credit facilities is spread sufficiently evenly over coming years as set out in the treasury policy. at the end of the
accounting period, the maturity schedule of the group's interest-bearing liabilities was front-loaded. the primary reasons for
this are the eur 60 million bond that matures in october 2014, and the maturing pension loans with instalment plans. current
interest-bearing liabilities also include borrowings of housing companies under construction, totalling eur 73.1 million. these
borrowings will be transferred to the buyers of the co-op shares when the units are handed over. regarding unsold housing
units, the group will bear the liability by paying financial consideration for the units in question. the group's available financing
sources and liquid assets are sufficient to cover the obligations arising from current interest-bearing liabilities.

according to the treasury policy, the group's liquidity reserve shall at all times match the group's total liquidity requirement, and
it must be accessible within five banking days without any additional charges being incurred. the group's total liquidity
requirement consists of the liquidity requirement of day-to-day operations, risk premium needs and the strategic liquidity
requirement. the group's liquidity management is based on monthly forecasts of funding requirements and daily cash flow
forecasting. the group's excess liquidity is managed by means of internal transactions and cash pools.

due to the nature of the group's business operations, seasonal borrowing is of great importance. the effect of seasonal
variation on short-term liquidity is controlled by using a commercial paper programme, committed credit limits and bank
overdraft facilities. the total amount of the group's commercial paper programme is eur 300 million (eur 300 mill.), of
which eur 150.2 million (eur 86.8 mill.) was in use at 31 december 2013. in march 2013, lemminkäinen agreed on financial
arrangements totalling eur 255 million. arrangements comprised a eur 185 million, three-year syndicated revolving credit
facility and a eur 70 million, two year syndicated term facility. the credit facilities are binding and unsecured. arrangements
replaced eur 160 million bilateral credit facilities which were originally set to mature in december 2013. in december,
lemminkäinen terminated the eur 70 million credit facility mentioned above. at the end of the year, the group had unused
committed credit facilities amounting to eur 175.0 million (eur 139.6 mill.) and overdraft limits amounting to eur 44.0
million (54.1). the amount of liquid assets at 31 december 2013 was eur 81.1 million (eur 93.9 mill.).

credit risk
credit risks arise when a counterparty is unable to meet its contractual obligations, casusing the other party to suffer a financial
loss. lemminkäinen has defined a credit policy for customer receivables that aims to boost profitable sales by identifying credit
risks in advance and controlling them. most of the group's business is based on established and trustworthy customer
relationships and on contractual terms generally observed in the industry. the credit policy sets the minimum requirements
concerning trade credit and collections for lemminkäinen group. the group's credit control function defines credit risks and the
business units are responsible for managing them.

the group is exposed to credit risk through the group's trade receivables and receivables associated with deposits and
receivables. the maximum amount of credit risk is the combined total of the balance sheet values of the aforementioned items.
the amounts and due dates of the group's trade receivables are presented in the table below. the group does not have any
significant credit risk concentrations as trade receivables are distributed among many different customers in a number of
market areas. the business unit that made the contract actively monitors the receivables situation. if the business units
renegotiate the terms of the receivables, they must do so in accordance with the requirements of the group's credit policy. the
risk of credit losses can be reduced by means of guarantees, mainly bank guarantees and bank deposits. lemminkäinen's credit
losses have been minimal in relation to the scale of its operations. the main risks are associated with business in russia. as a
general rule, construction projects in russia are only undertaken against receipt of advance payments. if, in exceptional
situations, a credit risk is taken, the amount permitted is always proportional to the expected margin on the project in question.
receiveables transferred for legally enforceable collection are recognised as credit losses.

the group treasury is responsible for the management of the group's counterparty and credit risks related to cash, financial
investments and financial transactions. the group is exposed to counterparty risk when investing liquid assets and using
derivative instruments. liquid assets are invested in short-term bank deposits, certificates of deposit issued by solvent partner
banks, and commercial papers issued by corporations with a good credit rating. the treasury policy specifies the approved
counterparties and their criteria. at the end of 2013, the counterparty risk was considered to be low.

commodity price risk
the group's paving operations are exposed to bitumen price risk. the price of bitumen is determined by the world market price
of oil. the group protects itself against the bitumen price risk with fixed purchase prices, price clauses in sales agreements and
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied. by the closing date, the group companies had used bitumen derivatives
to hedge, in total, 58,933 mt (40,000 mt) of bitumen purchases.

management of capital and the capital structure
capital means the equity and interest-bearing liabilities shown on lemminkäinen's consolidated balance sheet. lemminkäinen
group's capital management ensures cost-effectively that all of the group's business sectors maintain their business viability
at a competitive level in all cyclical conditions, that risk-carrying capacity is adequate, for example, in construction contracts,
and that the company is able to pay a good dividend and service its borrowings.

the amount of the group's interest-bearing liabilities is affected by factors such as scale of operations, seasonal changes in
production, acquisitions, and investments in or the sale of production equipment, buildings and land. the company
continuously monitors especially the amount of debt, the ratio of net debt to ebitda, and the equity ratio.

some of the group's financial arrangements include two financial covenants, the ratio of net debt to ebitda and the equity
ratio, which are monitored quarterly and calculated as an average of four previous quarters. in march 2013, lemminkäinen and
the other contracting parties agreed that potential damages related to the claimed asphalt cartel will be ignored in the
calculation model of financial covenants. furthermore, before the end of the financial period, the company reached an
agreement with other parties on changes in the net debt to ebitda covenant terms for q4/2013 and q1/2014.

the group's equity includes a eur 70 million hybrid bond which was issued in 2012. the hybrid bond is classified as equity
instrument but the bond holders do not have any rights of a shareholders, and the bond does not dilute shareholders' ownership
in the company. the hybrid bond is unsecured and junior to all other borrowings of the company. the bond has no maturity date
but company has the right to redeem it at it's own discretion after four years of the issuance date.

the company also follows the development of equity by means of the return on investment. a long-term average in excess of 18
per cent is regarded as a good return. the return on investment in 2013 was -9.4 per cent (10.8%).

the fair value of derivative instruments is the gain or loss arising from the settlement of the contract at the market price
prevailing on the reporting date.

hedge accounting has not been applied to all derivative instruments. nevertheless, these derivative instruments have been
utilised for hedging purposes. the derivatives are used in order to reduce business risks and to hedge balance-sheet items
denominated in foreign currencies. changes in the fair value of non-hedge accounted derivatives are recognised through profit
or loss in accordance with their nature either in financial items or as other operating income and expenses.

financial derivatives are subject to master netting- or similar arrangements which are enforceable in some circumstances.
according to these arrangements above mentioned derivative assets and derivative liabilities could be settled on a net basis.
netting arrangements are enforceable according to typical negligence events or other events of default as the general terms for
derivative transactions applies. these items are recognised on gross basis in the balance sheet. net figures would have been
eur 0.8 million (eur 0.2 mill.) smaller than the figures presented in the table.

short-term employee benefits
a fixed basic salary refers to a person's monthly salary, which is determined by the requirements of the position as well as the
performance and experience of the person holding the position. in addition to the use of a company car and mobile phone and a
meal benefit, management personnel have extended insurance cover for accidents and travel in their leisure time. the total
salary covers fixed basic salary and fringe benefits.

the amount of the management's performance-related reward is earned by exceeding financial and operational profit targets
specified at the beginning of the year. the executive board is divided into four performance-related reward groups which define
the maximum performance-related reward percentage for each person. defining a person's reward group is based on
organization level as well as the requirements and operational influence of the position. in 2013 the level of performance-related
reward of the management was based on the profit before taxes and reaching other growth and development targets such as
efficiency improvement of working capital. the performance-related rewards of the presidents of business segments, who are
members of the group's executive board, are also based on the gross profits of each segment. achieving performance-related
reward targets were assessed semi-annually. the maximum performance-related reward payable to lemminkäinen's president
and ceo was 80 per cent of his annual cash salary. the corresponding percentage for the other members of the group's
executive board was 60 per cent of their annual cash salary.

lemminkäinen corporation’s general meeting elects each year the members to serve on the company’s board of directors and
decides their fees. the fees are paid fully in cash. the term of office of the board members lasts until the end of the first annual
general meeting held after their election. the members of lemminkäinen’s board of directors do not belong to the share-based
incentive plan, and they are not employees of lemminkäinen. the 2013 annual general meeting decided that the chairman
would be paid a fee of eur 10,000 per month (eur 10,000) and the board members would each receive a fee of eur 3,000
per month (eur 3,000). the board members also receive an attendance fee of eur 500 per meeting (eur 500). the
chairman of the audit committee is paid an attendance fee of eur 1,000 (eur 1,000) and the members of the audit
committee eur 500 (eur 500) for each meeting of the committee. board members living outside finland receive an extra
eur 1,000 to their attendance fees.

post-employment benefits
from the beginning of 2010 the additional pension plan of the president and ceo and the members of executive board is based
on cash basis and earning a paid-up policy. the amount of payment is defined as percentages of the annual salary. the
president and ceo is entitled to retire at the age of 60. other members of the executive board are, according to the old policy,
entitled to retire at the age of 60 or according to the policy valid since 15.9.2011 at the age of 63.

in 2013, the company incurred accrual based costs of eur 88 thousand (eur 99 thousand) from statutory pensions and eur
249 thousand (eur 196 thousand) from voluntary pensions of the ceo & president timo kohtamäki. the amount of the
president & ceo’s defined contribution pension benefit equals 40 per cent of his annual fixed salary. the company incurred no
statutory or voluntary pension costs from the board members during the accounting or comparison period.

other long term benefits
in 2013, eur 6 thousand was recognised as expense in other long term benefits. these expenses arose from service year
awards and anniversary gifts to related-party personnel. the awards and gifts comply with the group’s hr practices. in 2012,
no expenses were recognised in other long term benefits.

termination benefits
the term of notice for the lemminkäinen’s president and ceo agreement is six months. if the company dismissed the
agreement, the president and ceo is entitled to absolute severance pay eaqual to 18 months cash salary at the time of the
agreement's termination. in 2013 and 2012, no termination benefits were booked.

share-based payments
the share-based incentive plan for the group's key personnel comprises of performance-based and conditional rewards.



                                                                                                     168

performance based reward comprises of three earning periods, which are calendar years 2013, 2014 and 2015. the company's
board of directors decides on the earning criteria and the targets to be set at the beginning of each period. performance based
compensation targets for 2013 were not met, and therefore no reward is paid.

in addition to the performance-based reward, the key personnel also have the opportunity to receive a conditional reward based
on share ownership and a continuation of their employment or service contract. the conditional reward seeks to encourage the
group’s key personnel to increase their holding in the company. the earning period for the conditional reward is the calendar
years 2013–2015.

share-based payments are described in more detail in the note 29.
