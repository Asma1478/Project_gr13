it has been a challenging period for the mansour group over the past few years.  the volatile and unstable climate in egypt in the
period following the 25th of january revolution, 2011, and its follow up on the 30th of june 2013, has tested the mettle not only
of egypt’s business community, but also the very social fabric of the country itself.  as egypt has transitioned through this period
to one of greater stability, optimism, and national pride, so too has mansour group. we have reaffirmed our commitment to
continued growth at all levels.  if nothing else, the past few years have clearly demonstrated the critical relevance of sustainability.

as a family-owned business, we continue to adhere to the social, ethical and moral standards instituted by our founder over 60
years ago.  our core values are based on integrity, efficiency, profitability, innovation, shared value, and last, but definitely not least,
continued employee development.  for mansour group, a fundamental component of our sustainability is a sharp focus on our
greatest asset: our employees.  investing in our employees is not just about ensuring higher performance, or building an efficient
workforce.  it flows from our sense of responsibility to our stakeholders, and every person working at mansour group is just that - a
valued and vital stakeholder.  employee development is one way of empowering our staff, providing them with essential business
and social skills that they can leverage on their career journeys. moreover, mansour group has instituted a number of mechanisms
to ensure an ethical management process that respects staff at all levels.  following international best practices, standardized
policies and procedures are in place, ensuring fair compensation, equitable treatment, transparency, communication, recognition
of achievement, health, and safety to all that work at our offices and facilities.

another cornerstone of our sustainability is the recognition that we are part of a wider community, one which we believe ourselves
duty bound to support.  mansour group is actively engaged in a variety of social investment initiatives, whether implemented
through our own mansour foundation, or by supporting other programs nationwide, through social investments, event
sponsorships, and social awareness campaigns.  here, we focus mainly on poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, and capacity
building.  in terms of environmental sustainability, we continue to push forwards with efficient and ethical resource utilization,
responsible waste management, and energy conservation.

as mansour group continues to diversify, grow, and expand to ever more challenging markets - locally, regionally, and internationally
- our dedication to our core values ensures that we remain a visible example of what responsible business conduct can achieve.

we at mansour group remain committed to the implementation of the 10 principles of the global compact.

the seeds of the mansour group were planted by lotfy mansour in the early 1950s, when he established the mansour & sons
cotton trading company.  his entrepreneurial vision created a legacy that is carried on to this day by his sons. his eldest son,
ismail mansour, succeeded in steering the family business to its position as one of the leading companies in the region. ismail is
succeeded by his three brothers, who each have an influential role in managing the group and continuing its tradition of business
innovation and diversification.

divisions of mansour group

the mansour group’s continuing growth is a result of its ability to effectively identify new business opportunities by exploring new
areas of diversification and forging successful joint ventures with global brands - something it has been doing successfully since the
1970’s. mansour group is currently a key regional player in various industries including manufacturing, marketing, and distribution.
employing over 60,000 people, mansour group currently achieves a turnover of over 4 billion usd.

with a constant focus on geographic market diversification, mansour group has a presence in 120 countries and operates ventures
in 13 countries (egypt, iraq, saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, libya, chad, nigeria, ghana, sierra leone, tanzania, uganda,
kenya, angola, and russia) via our headquarters in cairo, and our main office in london. most activities, however, remain in egypt.

mansour group is comprised of six holding companies, each of which is responsible for a number of quasi-independent companies.
these holding companies are: mantrac group; manfoods; al mansour automotive; al mansour holding company for financial
investments (mhcfi); man capital llp (the mansour family global investment arm); and el mansour and el maghraby investment
and development (mmid). together, these companies cover the following diverse array of economic sectors: automotive; banking;
real estate; consumer goods; education; it and telecom; equipment and machinery; media and advertising; oil and gas; and
transportation and logistics.

al mansour holding company for financial investments (mhcfi) is the focus of this report.  

al mansour holding company for financial investments (mhcfi)

al mansour holding company for financial investments (mhcfi) – one of mansour group’s six main holding companies - comprises
eight large, semi-independent companies, most of which have have been created to manufacture and distribute local and
international brands in egypt.



                                                                                                                                         7

    our start

    mansour group (mg) initially created mhcfi in 1992
    to manage a license agreement with philip morris
    international (pmi) to produce and distribute pmi’s
    brands in egypt. the partnership with pmi lasted 23 years
    and ended in 2014. later in 2014, mhcfi partnered with
    imperial tobacco, producing brands including davidoff,
    gauloises and p&s.

    mhcfi was established as an autonomous company,
    semi-independent from mansour group. this allows
    mhcfi the freedom and authority to rapidly respond
    to new business opportunities, including the ability to
    establish new companies, without having to refer back to
    the group. nevertheless, despite its quasi-independent
    status, mhcfi is bound by mansour group’s corporate
    policies and strategies, and is committed to the fulfilment
    of the group’s strategic goals and key performance
    indicators (kpis).

    diversification

    as mentioned above, mhcfi was initially created to
    manage the pmi account. over time, mhcfi began to
    diversify, extending its activities to the food production
    sector with the purchase of the seclam dairy products
    processing factory. this was followed by the establishment
    of the hayat-siwa bottling plant, producing bottled
    drinking water.

    mhcfi entered the food retail business with the
    establishment of metro market for trading and
    distribution, successfully introducing the high-end
    supermarket chain metro market (mm) in the 1990s.
    leveraging the overwhelming success and continued
    growth of the metro supermarket chain, mhcfi opened
    the kheir zaman (kz) supermarket chain, catering to the
    lower income consumer market. together, the metro
    chain (catering to the a consumer segment) and the kheir
    zaman chain (catering to b and c consumer segments)
    constitute the largest food retail chain in egypt; covering
    12 governorates and serving more than 115,000
    customers daily.

    mansour for trading and distribution company (amtdc)
    is the company behind sunshine tuna fish and shrimps,
    mario tuna, labanita dairy products, redbull energy
    drinks, l’oréal cosmetics and henkel and hayat drinking
    water.

    mhcfi companies and brands

    mhcfi is comprised of several companies that distribute
    an extensive range of consumer goods to over 150,000
    outlets nationwide, making it by far the largest distribution
    group in egypt. the figure opposite outlines the eight
    companies that now make up mhcfi as well the brands
    that they manufacture and/or distribute:

alexandria, respectively. however, mhcfi conducts operations all across egypt.

mhcfi manages its operations on two different levels: some activities, such as  legal affairs, corporate affairs, external relations,
human resources, and security and administration are dealt with at the headquarters; while others are dealt with at a company
level. this allows for semi-independent organizational structures and flexible support functions that meet each company’s specific
needs. the figure below illustrates mhcfi’s organizational structure.

     sustainability challenges and approach




     s
12

egypt has faced numerous social and economic challenges following the egyptian revolution. mhcfi was among many businesses
negatively affected by economic instability, yet has managed to continue growing as the economic situation began to stabilize. one of
the most significant challenges mhcfi faced after the revolution was the overall lack of security, particularly evident with increased
robberies. while robbery risks then dropped significantly in 2013 and 2014, mhcfi faced new challenges, highlighted below.

main challenges

over the past few years, lack of security has been an issue of concern nationwide.  in 2013, mhcfi was still struggling with the
repercussions of low security levels that resulted in losses for the company. however, mhcfi managed to improve security in 2014,
reporting a significant decrease in the number of robberies affecting the business.  predictably, new challenges have emerged
which we are planning on facing this upcoming year.

the economic challenge

as of 2015, egypt continues to experience many economic challenges. one of the most persistent problems is the steady increase
in inflation. this increase reflects directly on the purchasing power of the consumer, putting pressure on affordable brands more
appropriate to decreased consumer purchasing power. despite the problems posed by increasing inflation, egypt still lacks effective
policies to counter this particular threat.

there is also the issue of lack of availability of usd in the formal currency markets.  this kind of situation forces businesses like
ours, that require usd to purchase imported goods, to deal with the informal or ‘black’ market. this affects profitability due to the
added cost of buying dollars at higher rates than those officially quoted.

the energy challenge:

electricity blackouts and fuel shortages represent a challenge to every business. in mhcfi’s case, the problem of energy supply
affects all the production and distribution phases of our industry. the increase in the cost of diesel and gasoline naturally affects
both transportation and manufacturing costs. this in turn translates into an increase in the prices of products, directly impacting
the consumer’s ability to purchase those products. increases in the cost of water and electricity also affects our capacity to
manufacture while maintaining a profit margin.




                                                                                                                                         13

 switching partnerships:

 on july 1st 2014, amidc ended a long-term partnership with philip morris international (pmi) and cemented a new partnership
 with imperial tobacco group (itg). the new partnership brought in a tobacco manufacturing market share of 0.02% which rose
 to 0.6% market share by end of 2014.

 this represents a challenge as the partnership with pmi entailed a share amounting to 24% of the tobacco market. to fill in
 the revenue gap, mhcfi has been looking into adding new tobacco-related businesses and retaining the workforce.
 as a first step, we are looking at restructuring the tobacco business to ensure more effective business management.

 management approach

 the volatile situation in egypt over the past few years appears to have subsided, and the country is now turning its attention
 towards stabilizing the national economy. one strategy being actively implemented by the current leaderships is to stress a more
 attractive and supportive investment climate. accordingly, mhcfi is committed to supporting the growth of the national economy
 through new investments and expansion. we are hopeful that the election of a new parliament will provide clear public policies
 regarding the types of investment needed for the economy to stabilize.

 while the company is aware that we remain in a transitional period, where uncertainties are present, mhcfi is equipped with
 a team of experienced professionals implementing a business plan designed to help us adapt to the challenges that lie ahead.  
 this includes the installation of a new risk assessment mechanism that will enable mhcfi to foresee upcoming risks and develop
 effective strategies to minimize them.

 our main priority focus is to capitalize on mhcfi’s manpower. this is reflected by a management approach that seeks to
 address employees’ individual well-being, seen as of equivalent importance to that of the company’s own. mhcfi is committed
 to maintaining a solution-oriented approach to our management strategies, focusing on sustainable management techniques
 designed to help protect our employees - our main asset and the stakeholders of mg.

 in terms of environmental sustainability, we are determined to look for solutions to the energy crisis egypt is facing. this comes
 hand in hand with the development of our own energy conservation and management plan, and the adoption of new approaches
 to how energy is used in all our activities: in our offices, outlets, and production facilities.  the following table summarizes our
 sustainability approach by performance area:

     performance area                 approach

     economic sustainability          we are currently focused on maximizing efficiency, reducing production costs, and
                                      securing affordable and sustainable energy resources.

     social sustainability            we continue to support an array of civil society organizations and social enterprises
                                      across the country. our mansour foundation for development, has pioneered a locally-
                                      driven and bold approach to social investments as it focuses on key social needs including
                                      research and programmatic interventions in the areas of education, poverty alleviation,
                                      civic engagement, social entrepreneurship, among others, in neighboring communities
                                      and beyond. we plan on maintaining and expanding our social investment portfolio, in an
                                      effort to contribute to egypt’s sustainable development.  

     human capital                    our employees are one of our primary stakeholders; we continue to invest in their growth
                                      and development; to further their growth and the growth of the company. we plan
                                      on achieving a more gender-balanced managerial team by investing in the leadership
                                      potential of female middle management.  

     human rights                     we continue to be committed to a zero-tolerance policy towards child labor and are
                                      committed to the adoption of a minimum wage policy.

     environmental sustainability     the program focus this year revolved around mitigating the environmental impact of our
                                      operations. the scaling of usage for biodegradable plastic bags and energy reduction have
                                      been the center focus of this year’s program.

     product & client                 together with our employees, our clients are other key stakeholders. we continue to
     responsibility                   focus on client satisfaction and safety through stringent safety and quality management
                                      systems. we also maintain an open communication system with our clients through
                                      multiple feedback mechanisms.

     about this report




     g
16

mhcfi is pleased to present our fourth sustainability report, covering activities over the period from 2013 to 2014. the purpose
of this report is to keep both the public and our family shareholders engaged in, and informed about, our achievements and
development. we have managed to overcome hardships affecting our business over the past few years, and we plan on moving
forward by being mindful of our stakeholders and business partners. this report presents these updates against the measures and
indicators of the global reporting initiative (gri-g3.1), level b.

we have compiled the report at hand with a dual purpose in mind: to update the public about our performance, and to use the
assessments and conclusions of the report to improve our performance in the future. we committed ourselves to undertake this
reporting exercise on a biennial basis back in 2010, and have succeeded in publishing three reports to date.

in the current report, we have made every effort to improve our analyses and expand the scope of the information covered, and
we hope to continue improving our disclosure level in the future.

scope and data

the scope of this report is limited to al mansour holding company for financial investments (mhcfi), including the aggregate
activities of the eight companies comprising mhcfi. accordingly, the analysis presented here focuses on the direct community and
stakeholders of mhcfi. the report thus addresses neither the practices of the rest of mansour group to which mhcfi belongs nor
the universes of mhcfi’s suppliers and outsourced operations, on which we have little influence at the moment. we hope to be
able to extend our monitoring and disclosure capacity to parts of these universes by the next reporting cycle.

in compiling the data and the calculations disclosed below, we followed basic international measurement standards. the information
that we provide here is extracted from our databases, bills, internal reports, and externally audited statements. some information
has also been extracted through interviewing relevant personnel from mhcfi. this allows us to cover most of the information that
reflects on mhcfi’s indicators, as per the requirements of gri level b disclosure standards and the general gri reporting tradition.

in reporting on the joint performance of the eight companies comprising mhcfi, we relied mostly on our consolidated statements
and reports. the compilation of these statements and reports progressed smoothly, as these companies share several central
departments and are governed by a common top management (please see the governance section for more information). in other
words, mhcfi’s companies utilize the same top management reporting system.




                                                                                                                                       17

 despite the tremendous challenges mhcfi faced since the revolution, we are proud to say that we managed not only to maintain
 but also to expand our sustainability reporting efforts. like most companies, however, we are able to report only partially on some
 of the gri indicators. we have highlighted these indicators in a summary disclosure table at the end of this report, and we hope
 to be able to report on them more systematically by the next report in 2016.  nevertheless, this is unlikely to pose problems for
 future performance comparisons for two main reasons. first, the report labels estimates as such and explains the basis upon which
 we arrived at them. second, we have not undergone any major re-statements of information provided in earlier reports. the only
 significant change from previous reporting periods in this regard lies perhaps in the fact that we have expanded our reporting
 initiative by providing more detailed information in several fields including energy consumption and gender representation.

 furthermore, although our sustainability case requires rather straightforward measurements, a number of environmental
 indicators require capacities we have not yet acquired. nevertheless, in comparison to previous reports, environmental data has
 been expanded. this includes the steps taken to counter any negative effects of mhcfi operations on the environment.

 information disclosed on employee movement inside the company has also been greatly expanded compared to previous reports.
 the hiring and resignation disclosure is more detailed. likewise, information on employee training conducted in 2013/2014 is also
 more detailed.

 materiality and level requirements

 we designed this report to satisfy gri level b disclosure requirements. this disclosure level requires a company to report on all
 gri profile indicators in addition to reporting fully on a minimum of any 20 performance indicators. these performance indicators
 include at least one from each of: economic, environment, human rights, labor, society, and product responsibility indicators.

 in addressing these requirements, we undertook a materiality exercise, as per the gri’s methodology. the nature of the
 sustainability challenges that we are currently facing and the volatile business environment that we live in led us to believe that
 some performance areas are of paramount relevance to us, overshadowing others.

 the gri summary disclosure table summarizes the results of our materiality exercise at the end of this report.

 our team

 our sustainability department compiled this report with the support of an external consulting firm. to develop this year’s report,
 we developed a number of reporting mechanisms to monitor some of the basic indicators on a regular basis. we hope that by
 doing so we will be able to institutionalize our sustainability monitoring and improvement efforts at a deeper level. our corporate
 affairs manager, seif el batanouni, is happy to provide any additional information and elaborations on request.

     our economic performance




     b
20

mg remains one of the biggest private investment groups in the region, generating revenue up to 4 billion usd annually. this
leaves us in an excellent financial situation. as mentioned in previous sections, mhcfi is made up of eight different companies.
taken as a whole, the consolidated financial performance of the company has been excellent since its inception; a performance
that the company has been able to maintain despite revolutionary instabilities.

our current consolidated operation proceeds with 5 billion egp of current assets and 1.35 billion egp of non-current (or long
term) assets. these assets are balanced, in part by 1.98 billion egp worth of equity. on the other hand, in 2014, our consolidated
revenues reached 9.5 billion egp, and our profit reached 270 million egp.

 profitability

 increased stability in egypt has had a positive impact on the economy. for mhfci, this means better financial performance,
 resulting in greater profitability, vis-à-vis mhfci’s performance during egypt’s instability over the past couple of years.  this report
 dedicates a detailed chapter (above), to the challenges that have emerged since the political upheavals of january 2011 began. for
 the purposes of this section, however, we would like to outline our main financial results and highlight the impact of this political
 and social climate on them.

 mhcfi assets are balanced in part by 1.98 billion egp worth of equity. on the other hand, our consolidated revenues reached 9.5
 billion egp in 2014, and our profit reached 270 million egp for the same year.


                year 2014                                                                                                      egp (millions)

 mhcfi witnessed an improvement in terms of equity in 2014. mhcfi’s revenues and profits for the year 2011 were 6,649.3 million
 egp and 222.7 million egp, respectively. between the years of 2011 and 2012, our revenues increased by 1,409.2 million egp, and
 our profits by 71.5 million egp.

mansour international distribution (mid) accounted for the bulk of our sales and profit.  other mhcfi companies experienced
mixed performance. while some companies demonstrated a trend of high sales and profitability, other companies experienced a
drop in sales, and by extension profitability.

the table below illustrates our consolidated income statement for the year 2013, broken down by business unit.

         year 2013                                                                                                                 egp (millions)

as the above table shows, our companies paid about 119.68 million egp in income taxes in the year 2014. we are more proud
of these payments than any other payments we previously made. the egyptian government is suffering from an immense deficit
problem, and we are happy to have contributed to narrowing it down by such an amount.

value added

mhcfi analyzes the value-added components of its operations along two different dimensions. first, we divide our commodities
into (1) merchandise and services that experience some manufacturing and/or services transformation, and (2) merchandise and
services that add only retail value. we can then classify our cost of goods sold (cogs) according to these two categories. the table
below summarizes our cogs classification by business unit into value-added and retail-based for the year 2014.

               year 2014                                                                                                    egp (millions)

               value added cogs            5,266              -           245            -           -              -                   -

               retail based cogs              -            1,966         1,155       20              40           0.6                  104

               total                       5,266           1,966         1,400       20              40           0.6                  104


the second value-added dimension that we also track is our ability to add value to our production capacity. we generally reduce
this type to our capital investments in a given time-frame.  the following tables compare our capital investments in the year 2014
with their equivalent in the year 2013.

our total capital investments in 2014 and 2013 were 206.5 million egp and 112 million egp, respectively. while the economic
downturn has seen many companies considering exiting from egypt, we continue to pride ourselves on our commitment to
investing in our economy.

     governance & approach




     a
24

mansour group is a private family business; and its shares are not listed in the stock exchange. as such, it is not obligated to any
minority shareholders. however, mansour group is engaged in a number of joint ventures, and therefore needs to address the
interests of its partners.

although these ventures do not necessarily affect mhcfi, the mansour group implements a system of forming a board of directors
to govern each of its different divisions and the companies that comprise them in such a way that a given board always contains
independent members. the philosophy adopted is that independent board members bring a wider perspective and varied
viewpoints into the governance of the group as a whole, and this includes mhcfi. moreover, mansour group has standardized
a single management approach across all of its companies. thus, while the approach listed below governs mansour group as a
whole, it governs mhcfi by extension.  mansour group’s board members and managers are listed below.

place, and consists of senior management from the auditing, financial, human resources, personnel, corporate affairs, and legal
affairs departments. the committee convenes on a monthly basis to review performance, policies, and procedures, as well as
to identify and address any gaps. the committee directly reports to the group’s chairman, and engages relevant companies’
managing directors as needed.

 organization of mhcfi

 each of mhcfi’s companies has its own managing director (md), who is endowed with full authority to lead his/her company. the
 md represents the chairman of mg, youssef mansour, in whichever company they manage. mg sets annual targets for each md,
 and the performance of each company is later evaluated against these targets at the end of the year.

in running its companies, mhcfi also adopts a matrix structure organizing the management of the company along two levels. on
the one hand, the holding company centralizes several support functions that all companies share, including human resources,
policy formulation and control, supply chain management, audit, administration, security, and legal and corporate affairs. on the
other hand, each company has its own operational structure, and when needed, its own support functions. for example, security
is organized in metro market on the company level; but corporate security deals with the security affairs of all the remaining
companies.

control

the mission and values listed above govern the work of all companies in mhcfi. on top of that, the corporate system that we adopt
(previous section) is laid out in a way that supplies our companies with the independence that they need, while simultaneously
assuring a reasonable level of corporate control.

in addition to these elements, mhcfi is also governed by many internal and external standards which safeguard our performance
and help us operate in a corruption-free environment. these standards are deployed and assured by rigorous internal and external
financial and performance auditing systems. mhcfi has, in fact, an independent corporate department dedicated to undertaking
such audits.

many of our companies have certified parts of their management systems, according to their individual needs. seclam and hayat
for example, have been awarded the following certificates:




                                      iso                      iso                       iso
                                      9001                     22000                    18001



                                                  iso                       iso
                                                 14001                     17025



mhcfi is currently studying the development of anti-corruption policies. given that all of our activities are carried out in transparent
environments that provide little space for corruption, we generally didn’t consider such policies urgent in the past.   since the
revolution, however, combating corruption has become one of the main aspirations of egyptian society, and mhcfi is planning to
honor this national goal with renewed vigour.

associations and lobbies

before the protests began in january 2011, egyptian government bodies used to meet regularly with business associations and
representatives to discuss options for dealing with their regular problems. back then, we used to suffer from the complications and
bureaucracy of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses. this mechanism collapsed after the protests and currently there is
another system in the making. we are hopeful that after the election of a new parliament, we will be able to regain our position as
active members in the meetings between the private and the public sector.

as of today, we stand as active members in several business associations, including the following:

external relations

through its corporate affairs department, mhcfi constantly engages with most of its governmental stakeholders, including the
ministry of finance, the ministry of supply, the ministry of trade and industry, the ministry of health, the tax authority, the
customs authority, and the consumer protection agency, on fiscal and regulatory matters. this is done in order to ensure a long
term level playing field when it comes to proper and ethical market competitiveness. mhcfi also engages with many of these
authorities in order to find common initiatives that serve both the nation and our core businesses.

announcing our performance results and policies

given that our companies are not listed in the stock market, publishing our financial statements is not required. nevertheless,
we are always happy to share them with any stakeholder interested in such access. we email our sustainability report to all
relevant stakeholders regularly. this includes all stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by our operations, including relevant
governmental organizations, private sectors clients and partners, and civil society partners. we also publish the report on our
website.

we regularly update our policies and communicate any changes and updates to our employees. changes and updates are
initially announced to everyone involved using our internal email system. new updates are also highlighted in our internal
newsletters. moreover, announcements are addressed and communicated directly to the different department managers who in
turn communicate them to their staff. the latest versions of all our policies and procedures are available on a regularly updated
electronic database that all staff members can easily access.

gap analysis and commitment table

mansour group is continuously seeking to improve its management of economic, environmental, and social performance in
accordance with international and regional standards. to this end, the company’s management has identified the relevant gaps,
with target dates regarding when they will be addressed, in order to mitigate risks, seize opportunities, and ensure the company’s
compliance to those standards and principles.

we have listed the main commitments we are promising our stakeholders below -

our people

at mhcfi, we believe in our employees and staff and regard them as the company’s most important assets. we are proud to have
developed, over time, a robust mechanism for attracting the high caliber workforce that we need, and to have developed a system
that safeguards their interests and builds their capacities.

as a matter of principle, we seek to develop our people from the moment they join mansour group, preparing them to eventually
become a part of our senior management. we have therefore developed a high quality capacity building system that has been
proven effective over the years.

our recruitment system is based, firstly, on a pull system, whereby recruitment ensues whenever a need for a certain position
emerges in our companies. secondly, we adopted a salary scheme that pegs our pay according to the middle pay in the market,
while honoring our minimum wage policy when we find that the middle market pay is too low. thirdly, we are committed to
safeguarding the interests of our employees, and this is ensured through our specially designed human resources (hr) policies
and formal contracts. finally, we intensively train our employees and staff to build their careers with the aim of keeping them
indefinitely, if possible, or to qualify them for excellent jobs in the market if keeping them proves impractical. we are also adamant
on providing our workforce with fair, transparent, and periodic performance evaluations.


recruiting our people

mansour group advertises for vacancies through national and local media, and through appropriate communities. relevant staff
members, in cooperation with the hr department, then screen all job applications. jobs are awarded to those applicants most
qualified. all our recruitment activities are governed by publicized policies and procedures.

with respect to pay, we determine salaries according to market surveys of the fast-moving consumer goods sector (fmcgs), our
main field, conducted by third parties and specialized firms. we generally target a salary scale in the middle of the market spectrum
for the same position, as per these external studies.

these salaries are then modified according to the level of experience of the candidate, and our minimum wage policy. given that
egypt doesn’t apply a minimum wage law, mhcfi went on to adopt a minimum wage of 1,000 egp, which is 400 egp more than the
minimum wage in the governmental sector.



                                                                                                                                         35

 benefits

 in addition to our competitive salaries, mhcfi provides its staff and employees with added benefits, always trying to exceed the
 minimum requirements set forth by egyptian law. egyptian laws regulate the minimum medical insurance for workers as well as
 their pension schemes. mhcfi honors these laws and provides its staff with further benefits including:

 •           mansour medical care unit – an internal health insurance system for mansour employees;
 •           meals or allowance for meals for manufacturing workers;
 •           transportation allowance when traveling, and a company car, according to grade;
 •           company transportation for our factories;
 •           mobile phone allowance, according to grade; and
 •           special rewards for outstanding performance.

 details on the number of employees, their salaries, and their benefits are broken down by each company and can be found in the
 following table:

 in accordance with our policy, mhcfi provides all its employees with formal contracts. this provides our workers with a level of job
 security that many lack in egypt, where working informally without a contract has been endemic in recent years.

 mhcfi also follows the relevant labor laws: providing its female staff with three months maternity leave; awarding all employees
 with a one-month notice period; and following egyptian law with respect to penalties.

 employment level and turnover

 mhcfi currently employs 8,723 employees, up from 8,400 employees mentioned in the last report, making a turnover of 500
 employees during the last year. the metro market / kheir zaman company operates a labor-intensive activity based on regular
 entry of transient labor. it therefore accounts for 61% of our employment, even though it accounts for only 13% of our profits. most
 of the 500 that left the company were workers at our supermarket chains: metro market and kheir zaman.

 the turnover rate in the supermarket business is generally high in egypt, as it is worldwide, as many treat these jobs as temporary
 or transitional until they locate a more stable or long term job. with the exception of our supermarket chains, we have otherwise
 been able to retain our employees.

 career advancement

 mhcfi’s commitment to employee development is perfectly illustrated by our investment in our supermarket chain employees.  
 employee training was designed to address the high turnover in this sector, and to show our employees that we care about
 their long-term careers. all of our current store managers started out at entry level as store workers that demonstrated high
 performance, received extra training, gained experience, excelled, and were eventually promoted to store manager positions. we
 don’t need to recruit new store managers from outside our operations; they are all internally promoted workers.

 to do so, not only do we need to train our workers, but we also need to provide them with objective kpis and appraise their
 performance periodically and transparently. our end of year appraisals inform our staff about their strengths and weaknesses, and
 provide us with the main instruments by which we determine annual staff bonuses and promotions.

 safety

 all our employees are trained in evacuation steps, and in facing crisis situations; the majority of employees have also been trained
 in firefighting. although our activities generally do not put our employees at risk, we have nonetheless identified 36 jobs that
 require high safety precautions. workers in these positions received special training and were all provided with safety wear like
 goggles, gloves, helmets and safety shoes.

 mhcfi currently monitors only medium and serious work injuries, of which we have had none during the past two years. we are
 currently investigating the expansion of a monitoring system to include mild injuries as well.

gender

while we do not have   a written anti-discrimination policy,
salaries are decided based upon qualifications; leaving no room
for gender biases . nevertheless, there is a significantly larger
number of males than females across our companies, which is
something we are looking to address. the reason behind the
predominance of males in mhcfi is not a result of discriminatory
policies on the part of our company, but rather reflects a cultural
value system that dictates that females are not suited to work in
heavy industries.  we are currently working towards enhancing
the management gender ratio; but achieving a more balanced
gender balance at the blue-collar level requires longer-term shifts
in socio-cultural values.  

the following graphs show gender distribution figures across a
number of our companies:

     our community




     p
46

mansour group is highly committed to responsible business practices. it undertakes many activities to promote the welfare and
socio-economic development of egyptian society, through a variety of mechanisms. one of these is the mansour foundation for
development (mfd), which is dedicated to the eradication of illiteracy, poverty, and disease, by effectively working with, and
contributing to, the development of local communities.

our community-related work has undergone a process of evolution over the years. the following section briefly highlights some of
the milestones with regards to our community development initiatives.

historical milestones on our community-related work
mansour foundation for development is an independent legal entity that is fully funded by the mansour family. it has a separate
budget from the mansour group and does not accept any financial aid from national or international donors. mfd also has a
separate board of directors fully dedicated to philanthropic activities.   mfd works to centralize the community development
efforts of all mansour group in order to maximize their impact. mfd is an expression of the gratitude felt by mansour group
towards the people of egypt, and we expect no tax-deductible returns.

mfd’s strategy of sustainable management is based on shared value creation. the corporate success of mansour group and the
social welfare of egypt are interdependent. in an effort to sustain our foundation, we invest in the creation of a healthy, educated
workforce, and in sustainable resources - both of which guarantee effective governance of the organization. for society to thrive,
competitive businesses must be developed to create income, wealth, and tax revenues, and practice philanthropy.

mfd is dedicated to philanthropy. as a grant-making and co-executing foundation, the foundation undertakes many activities to
promote the welfare and socio-economic development of egyptian society, deploying to this end a variety of methods to eradicate
illiteracy, poverty, and disease while raising the public awareness of active citizens. mfd’s team identifies concrete goals and
objectives, prioritizes issues to be addressed, and develops defined budgets for program implementation.

our strategic high priority areas in the field of human development are:


                       education              capacity building             arts & culture            social entrepreneurship


                                     health                 academic research                human relief



                                                                                                                                       47

 we have also identified four priority segments that we want to focus on, which are as follows:


                                                                                                   inhabitants of
                         youth                    women                    children
                                                                                                   remote areas



 our objectives:

 •       leverage academic research in social entrepreneurship & youth engagement
 •       preserve & revive the egyptian identity
 •       bring creativity & innovation to big society by supporting youth entrepreneurship from core to shell
 •       upgrade public educational facilities and buildings
 •       support poor and/or disabled students
 •       provide educational scholarships in egypt and abroad
 •       prevent girls from dropping out of school
 •       combat illiteracy
 •       develop health facilities that cater to underprivileged people
 •       support health activities in deprived hospitals
 •       provide medical treatment for people with disabilities
 •       provide technical support for ngos’ staff
 •       provide educational, technical, and economic support to marginalized sectors
 •       support people with special needs in the field of sports.

 our approach is simply integration and inclusion. our pillars are passion, purpose, and people.

 we cannot fulfill our goals without adopting standard policies and procedures that ensure the delivery of utmost quality and
 trustworthiness throughout the lifecycle of our projects and activities. mfd’s approach is based on developing the human
 element in society, and is therefore based on community-driven projects. mfd seeks not only to apply mansour group’s business
 management model in its community development activities but also to transfer it to our recipients.

2013-2014 portfolio of programs

corporate volunteerism:

at mfd, we engage community members in volunteer-ism as one of the most important cornerstones of promoting corporate
citizenship. employee volunteers are perhaps the greatest asset companies can leverage when seeking to affect surrounding
communities. corporate volunteer-ism provides great benefits to a community while generating business value in the form of
increasing employee engagement and expanding opportunities for team-building.

civic education:

in its broadest definition, “civic education” means all the processes that affect people’s beliefs, commitments, capabilities, and
actions as members or prospective members of any given community. for civic education to achieve its utmost potential, the
institutions present in the community need to act and behave in a certain manner that can later be transmitted to the remaining
members of the community over time. civic education is certainly not limited to schooling or the education of children and youth.
families, governments, religious institutes, and mass media are just some of the institutions involved in the process of civic
education, which we at mfd, understand to be an ongoing process.

as advocates and activists in the field of civic education, mfd has implemented the following:

1.     civic manners film making workshop
2.     children values workshop
3.     ways forum for youth engagement in development
4.     civic education egypt conference
5.     development road show
6.     development book fair

social entrepreneurship:

investment in social entrepreneurship is vital because it harnesses creativity and devises innovative solutions to deep rooted social
problems. it nurtures a pool of future leaders who have ambitious dreams of change yet manage to stay rooted and solution-
oriented. their commitment to positively impacting society is central to the mission of our business and this is why we support
social entrepreneurship from core to shell through:

1.     regional study on corporate sustainability and social entrepreneurship
2.     entrepreneurs’ stanford scholarship

culture & arts:

the sign of a healthy community is its simultaneous ability to preserve and invent its culture — that is, to conserve its history and
heritage and here is our contribution in this regard:

1.     dcaf
2.     elfan midan
3.     qabila documentary film festival
4.     wanas folklore festival

health:

mfd has systematic activities to prevent and cure health problems, and to promote positive health in egyptians through the
following:

1.     hepatitis a vaccination school campaign
2.     annual cure support program

capacity building:

our aim is to create an enabling environment for appropriate ngos via institutional development, human resources development
and strengthening of managerial systems to maximize the capacity of ngos to overcome the challenges of community development.
mfd currently provides assistance to the following ngos:

1.     dar awladi orphanage
2.     elgabal elasfar (yellow mountain) local community development association
                                                                                                                                        49

 3.     elsaktiya local community development association, upper egypt
 4.     bedaya (start) charitable association, elfayoum governorate
 5.     women’s association for better health, sohag governorate

 advocacy, awareness & networking:

 one of mfd’s aims is to influence decisions within institutions relevant to development and social systems. we advocate this
 through many forms including media campaigns, public speaking, research & papers, and peer networking. our activities in this
 field can be listed as follows:

 1.     arab foundation forum board of directors
 2.     organizing a roundtable about corporate foundations’ role in time of change in salzburg
 3.     mfd paper presentation at 10th csr conference uae
 4.     qatar education summit
 5.     panel discussion on collaboration, governance & engagement emirates youth summit

 social solidarity:

 social solidarity is the basis for maintaining social cohesion by strengthening the ability of individuals to support each other.
 although activities listed below perform different tasks and often have different values and directions, the order and solidarity of
 society members hinges on their ability to rely on each other in order to overcome times of crisis. people feel connected through
 philanthropic and social activities, including:

 1.     holy quran competition for factory workers
 2.     1,000,000 blankets campaign
 3.     food convoys to the underprivileged

 2013-2014 success in figures:

 no of beneficiaries: 10,000 people
 no. of programs: 28
 no. of governorates served: 6
 no. of partners: 26

 2013-2014 outcomes are focused in value preposition and shared value:

 •      scale up programs; highly responsive to crisis at the time that deeply affected the development sector.
 •      join hands with mansour employees to spread the spirit of corporate citizenship via serving the community.
 •      fund & execute numerous development activities; that contribute to positive change and building the future.
 •      address, engage and support youth in all of our programs.
 •      develop & expand our outreach methods.

 other projects

 in addition to mfd’s considerable community development efforts, mansour holding also has separate projects aimed at contributing
 to egyptian society. furthermore, a number of projects were implemented through collaboration between mansour holding’s
 corporate affairs department and the mfd. for example, 35 trash bins were installed in the wadi degla natural protectorate in
 collaboration with the ministry of environment, and a clean–up campaign was undertaken in the area.  additionally, since 2011,
 the corporate affairs department has been organizing bi-annual blood donation campaigns for company employees.

 suez canal investment certificates worth 10 million egp for the poorest families in luxor

 the ministry of social solidarity and mansour group launched an initiative to support the people in the luxor governorate. the
 initiative comes in line with the implementation of a memorandum of understanding signed between the ministry and mansour
 group under the patronage of youssef mansour, the chairman of the mansour group, aimed at activating the partnership initiative
 to support the poorest families in the governorate.

 minister ghada waly indicated that the ministry is adopting an approach that targets the sustainable development of the most
 marginalized of areas through partnerships with the private sector. she added that the memorandum of understanding signed with
 the mansour group is a successful implementation of such an approach and emphasized its success.

the mansour group has financed the purchase of one thousand new suez canal investment certificates at egp 10,000 / certificate
with a total value of 10 million egp, through the ministry of social solidarity, which will distribute these certificates to the poorest
families in the luxor governorate, especially targeting widows who provide for children below 16 years of age, and persons with
special needs.

the social solidarity directorate in luxor determined the target families based on its records and it selected armant and esna
districts for being the closest to banque misr from which the certificates were bought.

youssef mansour said that the initiative is a part of the mansour group’s strategy to contribute to sustainable development and
finding prompt solutions for poverty. he added that luxor was selected because it has been struck very hard by the dramatic
decline in tourism in recent years. he also noted that it needs massive and continuous efforts to combat poverty, illiteracy, and
other social challenges in order to rise up to its deserved position, both locally and globally.

     our environment and product responsibility




     d
52

this section presents our environmental and product responsibility performance. we divided the section into two parts, dedicating
one part to each of the two topics. we also structured our exploration of these two areas around the relevant material gri
performance, as in the previous chapter.

environment

our environmental footprint is not among our high impact areas; much of the gri indicators that cover this area are therefore of
moderate to low materiality for us. most of our operations do not pose any threat to biodiversity or endanger listed species, are
not located within or near protected or restored habitats, and produce little non-recyclable waste. moreover, our operations are
generally not energy intensive, nor do they emit large quantities of cfcs or greenhouse gases. the aspects of our environmental
performance that might be of high materiality to our operations are, essentially, our waste and transportation activities.

waste

all of our companies deploy waste management systems that collect their waste and separate it by type. an external contractor
(usually the supplier of the original material) then buys the majority of this waste from us, since most of the waste generated acts
as inputs in other industries.

the type of waste that we produce includes: plastic bottles (which are sold to plastic factories), paper, wood, dust tobacco, rolling
paper, and unsold supermarket commodities. we also produce other production-related waste, but in very small quantities. our
indirect waste includes the packaging material that we use in our production or distribution, mainly paper and aluminum cans,
and plastic bottles.

to date we monitor the aggregate waste in our supermarket chains only; and we calculate the numbers in terms of a percentage of
sales, rather than by weight and volume. we also do not monitor the portion of materials used that are recycled by us or by others.
we have developed a comprehensive waste-monitoring framework that is being rolled out over the next two years.

waste management

metro and kheir zaman successfully adopt 100% biodegradable plastic bags.

one of the key objectives of the corporate affairs department is to adopt environmentally sustainable practices in the areas of
energy consumption, waste management, water use, and paper consumption, in order to minimize environmental degradation.  

                                                                                                                                        53

 in line with this objective, the corporate affairs department, in cooperation with the procurement department at metro market,
 began to examine ways to minimize environmental degradation through practical applications in 2013. they began by looking at
 the use of plastic bags at all 99 metro and kheir zaman stores.  the stores, located in 12 governorates, use approximately 80 million
 plastic bags per year. accordingly, efforts began to convert all plastic bags to recyclable plastic bags.

 through cooperation with symphony environmental ltd., based in the uk, the d2w technology was adopted to convert old-
 fashioned plastic bags into 100% biodegradable plastic bags. the d2w mark was affixed on all plastic bags to encourage competitors
 to adopt the same technology in order to reduce the collective harmful effects that plastics have on the environment.

 future plans

 we are currently putting in place a new waste-monitoring system that monitors waste by type, weight, and volume. this should
 supply us with crucial information that we still lack. we are also moving to expand this waste management system to the whole
 company. furthermore, we have been offering products that we remove from our inventories well before their expiry dates to our
 employees at heavily discounted rates.

 energy

 electricity remains our primary source of energy, with all of our companies operating on electricity, and connected to the national
 electricity grid.  our hayat company is the only exception, as it generates all of its electricity in-house because it operates in an
 area that lacks access to the national grid.  furthermore, to overcome issues of blackout, we have secured a number of generators
 for companies to operate on when the power is out.  while all of our companies operate on electricity, and many of them own and
 operate emergency generators to cover electricity blackouts, we don’t have generators in our supermarket stores.

 we have expanded our reporting on all of our direct and indirect energy consumption. we still need to further expand the relevant
 data from our various databases. we have also started working on reducing our energy consumption by studying the advantages
 of converting all our conventional lights to led’s. in addition, we aggregate most of the fuel consumed by the fleets of our different
 companies, which represents our largest environmental impact. the following table summarizes our fuel consumption in egp.

 the table illustrates our increased fuel bill, which amounts to roughly 18% over the past year. this increase this year was caused
 by an increase in the price of fuel.

 emissions

 our emissions are mostly limited to the fuel consumed by our transportation fleets and the fuel used to generate electricity in our
 hayat factory, in addition to the electricity consumption of our 99 metro and kheir zaman supermarkets. we have expanded our
 monitoring on greenhouse gas emissions compared to our previous report. the following tables show the total expenses for our
 diesel, water, and electricity consumption in 2013-2014:

 it should be noted that hayat also donates 8,000m3 of its water to local farmers to be used for agricultural
purposes.   the rest of our companies generally don’t consume much water, and typically recycle none.

product responsibility

mansour group enforces all the necessary precautions in order to ensure the safety and quality of our products.

one of our companies – seclam dairy factory – produced a comprehensive quality policy document that defined the international
hygiene standards that are material and applicable to seclam’s manufacturing sites. these standards focused strongly on minimizing
any risks of product contamination, and ensuring that the products meet the high standards that customers expect from any of
the mansour group companies, thereby avoiding any manufacturing deficiencies that might damage the quality of the products
or that of the health of our customers. the associates of seclam share the objective of manufacturing safe, wholesome, and high
quality products. below are some of these product quality policies:

   outside the factory. defined waste areas have to be established
   and segregated from production activities, and waste disposal
   must meet legislative requirements and thus be disposed of by
   licensed contractors.


food safety checks are performed in accordance to biological, chemical, and physical specifications, with transport and storage
quality specifications also existing for all finished products. finished products are stored separately from raw materials, and rejected
products or returned goods are labeled and stored separately. furthermore, vehicles that move products must be appropriately
temperature-controlled, hygienic, and clean.

pest control

a comprehensive pest management program is in place to greatly reduce the risk to products from pests. monitoring for pest
activity is frequent and regularly reviewed and pest control audits and treatments are recorded. incoming raw materials are also
thoroughly checked for pests.

personnel

each site has qualified personnel with the necessary education, training, background, and experience to ensure that all activities,
including hygiene and protective clothing, are correctly performed. procedures are established to identify training competency
requirements for all associates to carry out their responsibilities. managers and supervisors have sufficient knowledge of food
hygiene to be able to judge potential risks and take the appropriate preventative measures and corrective actions, while ensuring
that effective monitoring and supervision is taking place. this ensures that all personnel entering manufacturing areas have an
appropriate level of training in basic food hygiene and company hygiene procedures. furthermore, all personnel are made aware
of their contribution to the quality and food safety of the finished products; and of the possible consequences of errors or lack of
attention to details.

customer satisfaction

our customer care unit has a call number dedicated to receiving customer feedback and complaints. all received complaints are
addressed within 72 hours of their receipt. we also implement other procedures to ensure our customers’ satisfaction, these
include the use of customer feedback forms and mystery shoppers at our supermarkets to gather data about staff performance,
quality, among other variables. we compile quarterly reports about received complaints, and communicate them to senior
management and our governance body on a quarterly and yearly basis.
