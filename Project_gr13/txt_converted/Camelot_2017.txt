responsible game design
when it comes to games, we believe prevention is better than cure – which is why we strive to design games that are low-risk
for consumers to enjoy. we use tools and processes to ensure this, and closely monitor games as they are being developed
and launched.




what’s been happening?                                           what’s next?

in the past year, we have increased our use of live-testing
games to assess the potential risks presented by new
online games, once our existing game design process steps
have been completed.
                                                                 100% the percentage of

behavioural analytics and interventions
in order for us to encourage responsible play, we need to understand what harm looks like. we’ve worked with a partner
organisation, featurespace, to define what harm looks like in online play, categorised by a ‘basket’ of indicators. this has
allowed us to explore different types of intervention with players who are showing signs of harm. the interventions set out
to encourage players to manage their play more responsibly.
