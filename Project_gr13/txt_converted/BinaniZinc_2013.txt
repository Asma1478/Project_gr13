zinc:
stimulating sustainable
development




08 binani zinc limited

zinc, with its key attributes of essentiality, durability and
recyclability, is well positioned as a material of choice for a
sustainable society.

origin
zinc, a metallic chemical element, is the 23rd most abundant element in the earth's crust.
alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called "philosopher's wool". the element was
probably named by the alchemist paracelsus after the german word 'zinke'. around 1800, luigi
galvani and alessandro volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc.
ore and manufacturing
the most commonly found zinc mineral is sphalerite (zns) also known as zinc blende, which is
found in almost all currently mined zinc deposits. zinc concentration is usually done at the mine
site before sending the concentrate to the processing plant. concentration is achieved using
crushing and grinding followed by froth flotation method. zinc is manufactured by reducing the
concentrated zinc using pyro-metallurgical or hydrometallurgical methods.
properties and applications
zinc has the third highest usage of non-ferrous metal, behind aluminum and copper. owing to its
resistance to non-acidic atmospheric corrosion, it is used to galvanise steel, thus, is instrumental in
extending the life of steel goods and structures of every kind. due to a relatively low melting point,
it is used in the production of a number of alloys such as brass. the metal also finds applications in
the pharmaceutical, nutrient, construction, battery and chemical industries.
zinc is a valuable commodity because of excellent recyclability characteristics. it can store six times
as much energy per pound as any other battery system, increasing the range of electric vehicles.
zinc is far friendlier to the environment as compared to other metals. the energy required to
produce zinc from ore is one-fourth of that needed to produce aluminum and half that of copper
and steel. zinc is a non-poisonous and an environmentally sound product.
the major zinc-producing nations are
canada and china. in india, the major
end uses of zinc are in galvanising, dry                     chemicals 6%   misc 4%
batteries, die casting, paints and
                                              rolled zinc 6%
pigments. steel galvanising,
accounting for majority of the
demand, is expected to witness
                                                  brass & bronze 17%
healthy growth. demand of refined                                                           galvanising 50%
zinc in india was 501 kiloton in 2011,
which represented about 4% of
global demand and is expected to                             diecasting 17%
increase substantially. in the medium
term, the zinc demand in india is
expected to grow at a compounded
annual growth rate (cagr) of 8 -                                                    figure 1: global applications of zinc

goal is to safeguard the planet and leave a
legacy for our future generations by ensuring
that everything we do is sustainable."

sustainability impacts, risks and opportunities
the close financial and trade ties forged among economies by the
globalisation process over the preceding decades enabled the financial crisis
which began in late 2008 to spread almost instantaneously to practically every
country of the world. this triggered the deepest and broadest recession since
the 1930s and ended the growth cycle that had lasted from 2003 to the first
half of 2008.

india has seen relatively slow growth since second half of 2008 in a cautious
economy. the demand for zinc in india is estimated at approximately 600 kt
and is growing at around 8% cagr. the average zinc price in the london
metal exchange (lme) was approximately $2,185 / tonne during 2010-11.

the major challenges we face include raw material availability, fluctuation in
zinc & energy prices and enhanced metal supply in market. we have drawn a
comprehensive plan to mitigate the perceived threats.

we have attained sufficient expertise in hedging to safeguard ourselves from
wide fluctuations in zinc price and have a good spread of sales depots in the
country that ensures a good market for our product. our product quality and
brand equity are well accepted in the market. our focus on value addition has
brought improved margins and new customers.

we have long term contracts with suppliers of raw material which secures
around 75% of our requirement of zinc concentrate in the coming year.
investments in mines through our subsidiaries rbg minerals industries ltd.
and bz minerals (australia) pty. ltd. will help ensure continuous and
sustainable availability of raw material in the long run.

we create sustainable value for our stakeholders by
delivering transformational growth and by applying
operational excellence to our portfolio. given the
economic climate of the industry, we aim to not only
meet the economic standards and parameters set by
our peers, but to be comfortably above them.

revenue facts and figures
production quantity and lme price are two significant factors that impact our direct
economic value generated and operating cost. in the reporting period, our direct economic
value generated increased to inr 4153.91 million due to the higher commodity price of zinc
at lme. due to increased prices of zinc concentrate on lme, our operating cost also
witnessed an increase to inr 3858.04 million. we have not received any grants or significant
financial assistance from the host government in the reporting period.

creating local wealth and fostering inclusive growth
we follow a policy of sourcing input material from nearby locations (within kerala and india)
based on availability of material, quality and other commercial parameters. this pertains to
most goods and services required for operations at the binanipuram facility. in addition to the
financial benefit accrued on account of local sourcing, we strive to develop business
opportunities in the state of kerala and india. we have to import zinc concentrate, our major
raw material, due to business constraints within the country. in the reporting period, we
sought 42% of input material from kerala (excluding zinc concentrate).

 “speed is irrelevant if you are moving in
 the wrong direction”
                        - mahatama gandhi
four decades of the environmental revolution has changed how
companies do business. till 1970s, corporates were in denial stage
regarding their environmental impacts. then a series of highly visible
ecological problems & accidents created ground for strict regulations
and global treaties. but as we stepped into the 21st century, the stress
on natural resources, water shortage, soil exhaustion, loss of forests, air &
water pollution and degradation of coastlines forced organisations to
look beyond regulatory compliance and move towards sustainable
development.

we understand that the various business operations are dependent
upon natural ecosystem and therefore, makes it inevitable the
constrained on the environment. hence, we take cognizance of our
responsibility and imbibe sustainable development philosophy in our
business operations and planning. as a part of our commitment to
environmental management, we have implemented iso 14001 in our
unit. we have been adhering to this environment management system
for improving the environmental performance. under iso 14001,
significant environmental aspects and impacts are identified and
comprehensive environmental management plans are developed to
minimise the impact. for other environmental impacts, operational
control procedures are developed to be able to minimise the same
during our daily operations.

monitoring of air pollutants, solid waste and wastewater discharges is
carried out and authorities are provided with annual reports detailing
our environmental performance. relevant training is imparted to
employees in the area of environmental management for enabling
them to help the organisation imbibe sustainability in its dna.

this section of the report aims to provide an overview of our
environmental performance and our approach to address significant
environmental issues as we operate our business.

       roasting

            the concentrate, zinc sulphide, is roasted in a fluidised bed roaster
            and converted to calacine (zinc oxide). the flue sulphur dioxide is
            used to manufacture sulphuric acid (h2so4) in dcda acid plant.




       leaching

            the calcine is leached with spent electrolyte to get zinc sulphate
            solution and subjected to two stages of purification, using
            appropriate purification technology licensed from um engineering,
            belgium. the process ensures removal of all traces of impurities and
            pure zinc sulphate electrolyte is produced. cadmium metal is
            recovered as a by-product from the purification residue.




       purification

            in this process, the impurities like copper, cadmium, cobalt and nickel
            are extracted from the impure zinc sulphate solution. copper,
            cadmium, cobalt and nickel are purified and the solution is filtered.
            pure zinc sulphate electrolyte is then sent for electrolysis.




       electrolysis

                 the purified zinc sulphate solution is electrolysed in an
                 automated jumbo cell house. the zinc thus, produced is
                 deposited on aluminium cathodes, which are stripped in a
                 cycle of 48 hours.




       melting

                 the stripped cathode zinc sheets are melted in an induction
                 furnace and cast into saleable ingots.

on our ability to retain employees, though it is a challenge to attract
and retain skilled and competent workforce.

our workforce strength (including management and non-
management employees) stood at 334 in fy 2010-11, of which 11 were
female employees. we also employed 92 contractual workers during
the reporting period.

we recruit from top engineering campuses in kerala through referrals,
job placement agencies and through market recruitment. we have a
knowledge sharing agreement with the government engineering
college (gec), trichur, one of the first colleges to begin a course in
chemical engineering. we recruit management trainees from gec,
trichur and also offer internships to students.

we have in place a comprehensive screening and interview procedure
which involves interviews at multiple levels.

medical camps are conducted by gbhc once a month where patients get free consultation by appointments
and are treated by specialist doctors. two cancer detection camps have been held which were open to
employees, their dependents and the community. in association with the esic hospital, pathalam, we
organised a comprehensive medical checkup camp for contractual workers in september 2010.

 pakal veedu (day home)
 this is a unique initiative wherein the chief medical officer examines the members of the day home twice a
 month. an anaemia detection programme was conducted in february 2011 by the health centre for the
 'pakal veedu' (day home) members. 58 consultations were recorded. the programme consisted of lab tests
 for hemoglobin detection and blood sugar estimation. m/s. wyeth ltd. (a pharmaceutical company) supplied
 free medicine samples. a patient awareness programme on food and nutrition with special emphasis on
 anemia management was conducted by a food and nutrition consultant of the national rural health mission.

we celebrated safety day on 4th march, 2011 and distributed safety awards to 21 employees. the national
safety council conducted a safety audit of the facilities and an industrial hygiene study was conducted by
hindalco. a one-day awareness programme was organised by us for safety committee members of various
organisations. the programme saw participation of 84 delegates from 16 organisations. the national safety
council, kerala chapter, in association with us and the indian medical association, organised a two-day
state-level workshop on 'first-aid for industrial employees' at the binani zinc training hall. 33 participants
across 13 industries participated in the workshop.

union relations
we share good industrial relations with our workforce. all operational changes affecting workers are
discussed well in advance with the workforce and notice period is decided based on statutory requirements
as well as consultations with the unions.

we respect workers' right to collective bargaining. all permanent workmen are unionised and elect union
representatives. they are organised into three unions, viz. cominco binani zinc employees union, cominco
binani zinc employees association and cominco binani zinc employees organisation. all the three union
representatives were elected as the non-management representative. these representatives meet every
month to sort out workplace grievances, welfare measures, health and safety facilities, etc. we do not restrict
any company personnel from joining or forming a trade union. all terms and conditions negotiated by the
unions on behalf of the workmen are incorporated in the long term agreement. the purpose of this
agreement is to provide orderly collective bargaining relations, to secure prompt and fair disposal of
grievances, foster fair work practices, discourage unfair labour practices, to establish fair work standards,
fair wages and other working conditions to improve efficiencies, to maintain harmonious relationship
between all employees and the workmen and the company to attain efficient and uninterrupted
operations of the plant to prevent strikes, lock-outs, slowdown, etc. to promote stability and prosperity of
the company. however, industrial relations in the organisation are very good and workers seldom approach
the representatives as most of their concerns / grievances are resolved at section-level. workers have access
to senior staff and management members. all workers are aware of our grievance redressal procedure
which forms a part of the 'long term agreement'. as per the procedure, the affected employee can escalate
his / her grievance from the immediate supervisory-level to the president.

our corporate social responsibility (csr)
activities are focused on the all-round
development of the local communities
around our plants wherein we work in
tandem with them and play an
important catalytic role in their
development.

we endeavour to meet their needs and create appropriate
opportunities for their socio-economic development.

the engagement process actually begins even before our
work starts and continues throughout the lifespan of a project.
when starting a new project, we work closely with our
stakeholders to identify local need gaps and once our work
goes into operation, we continue to engage with them to
help ensure their needs are considered. we follow a structured
approach in framing our community development agenda.

in 2007, we appointed the rajagiri-casp sponsorship project
(the live laboratory of the rajagiri college of social sciences)
to conduct a need-assessment study of ward 17 of
kadungalloor gram panchayat, in the ernakulam district of
kerala, in the vicinity of our operations. such studies are an
effective way of assessing and addressing the developmental
needs of the community.

our product
stewardship




70 binani zinc limited

zinc is a sustainable material with a wide variety
of end uses, the most prominent being
galvanising to protect steel from corrosion. main
application areas for zinc products are
construction, transport, consumer goods &
electrical appliances and general engineering.

the environmental footprint of zinc starts with
documenting the resource requirements and
environmental releases associated with upstream
metal production operations, but it also involves
understanding the impacts and the benefits of
using zinc during other stages in the product life
cycle. these benefits can arise in use (e.g.
extending the life of steel products) and through
end-of-life recycling (e.g. by utilising recycled zinc
to create new products). zinc occurs naturally,
therefore, eliminating it from the environment is
neither possible nor desirable. there are no
negative health and safety impacts of zinc ingots
during the use phase.

we have internally conducted a brief life cycle
assessment of our product. the study showed
that the carbon footprint of the product is
approximately 3 tonnes of co2 equivalent per
tonne of zinc produced. the system boundary
selected for the study is presented below.
