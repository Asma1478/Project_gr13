                                                    virtue, on the one hand, and give top priority to the needs of students in order to provide
                                                    them with value beyond their expectation, on the other, ultimately establishing itself

                                                    local community, asia, and the whole world.




     jo yeong-jin                                   in order to sharpen the competitive edge of wonkwang university, it is important to
                                                    respond preemptively to the rapidly changing educational environment and the decline

                                                    energy, and chinese studies. especially, wonkwang university launched offices in the
                                                    northern and southern regions in china in order to aggressively respond to globalization
                                                    and opened the institute of confucius as a basis for research and education. now,
                                                    universities face the tough reality that they have to cooperate with local communities and
                                                    businesses for survival, rather than clinging to the traditional model of university as an
                                                    ivory tower. accordingly, i believe that wonkwang university should be able to develop
                                                    a curriculum to meet the needs of society, reform its curriculum to produce talented
                                                    professionals, adopt an industry-university cooperation system to lay the foundation
                                                    for mutual growth, and win bids for diverse government-funded projects to overcome
                                                    financial difficulties and at the same time consolidate its financial basis for a bright future.



     jeong so-jeong                                 in my opinion, what is most important for wonkwang university is to attract students,
                                                    because schools do not exist without students. in order to lure students, aggressive

                                                    the school is competent enough to meet the needs of students. i hope that wonkwang
                                                    university will continue to do its best to become a sustainable school by encouraging
                                                    students to pursue their academic goals at the prestigious school.

among staff members. transparent and ethical management may be critical for the
improvement of the school image. as the public offices give top priority to citizens and
strive to provide citizens with friendly services, wonkwang university should make
an effort to improve customer (student) satisfaction and actively participate in social
activities in order to become a member of the local community.


wonkwang university is pushing its mid- and long-term plans consistently under
the leadership of the president. i could also witness the university s capacity for

conditions and provide students with quality education and services by winning
government-funded projects in diverse areas. having experienced the president s
leadership and determination to meet the needs of the students in every aspect as a

as a brand. as value is created by people inside and the most important is the leader s
performance, i hope that wonkwang university will continue to progress as a partner.




despite its constraints as a regional university, wonkwang university received the
highest grade a at the higher education restructuring assessment in 2015, proving that
                                                                                                   lee dae-hun

university specialization
wonkwang university aims to serve as a university for humanities convergence that focuses on fundamental concepts of learning,
korea s best university that respects life, the only academic base of green energy in the southwestern region in korea,
and a leader in chinese studies.




formulation of strategy for university specialization
a cradle of learning and virtue for future leaders, wonkwang university is preparing for
the future through constant changes and innovation. it is geared to become a leader
through specialization of diverse areas, including humanities, culture industry, life
science, green energy, and chinese studies.


plans for university specialization
wonkwang university formulated plans for university specialization based on the
analyses of its educational goals and vision, the government's industrial policies
in relation to the local industrial policies, and strategic markets for globalization.
the areas for specialization are divided into horizontal specialization (knowledge in
humanities and culture industry, chinese studies) and vertical specialization (life
industry and green energy). the horizontal specialization is designed to help students
increase their basic knowledge in humanities and develop capacities that set them
apart from their peers, while the vertical specialization aims to produce talented
professionals in some disciplines that meet industrial needs.

improvement of students' learning capacity
wonkwang university is making a consistent effort to improve students' learning
capacity by operating support bodies for learning capacity building.


support bodies for learning capacity building
wonkwang university engages in diverse activities for students' capacity development
by organically collaborating with the student capacity development committee and
other relevant departments. for instance, the department of education and training,
college of liberal arts, human resources office, institute of moral education,
individual colleges, and department of international exchange serve as the support
bodies for program operation, while the student capacity development committee is
responsible for the evaluation of each program and supervision of all the programs as a
whole. the staff members in charge of the student learning capacity building program
are equipped with relevant professional certificates (degrees) by completing related
programs and boast expertise and professionalism in relevant areas.

development of learning capacity building programs
wonkwang university offers diverse programs it developed for the development of
students' learning capacity on the basis of the demand surveys the university conducts
on a regular basis. we have come up with various measures for improvement by
analyzing preliminary student surveys and university policy surveys. we identified
several tasks for improvement, including the "enhancement of a sense of community
service for the cultivation of morality, reinforcement of basic learning in major areas for
each level, improvement of self-motivated learning, improvement of global capacity"
and "foreign language proficiency," and "development of learning capacity for each
college," and operates 13 learning capacity development programs based on the tasks.

university encouraged students to join interrelated learning capacity building
programs, such as special training and writing and humanitas programs, as a result,
students who attended the writing program excelled and won awards at the humanitas
reading contests (19 students in 2012, 65 students in 2013, and 90 students in 2014).
wonkwang university has also offered special courses for students preparing for the
national teacher exam and video labs for students preparing for civil service exams and
achieved good results.
the virtue training program run by the institute of moral education at wonkwang
university is the only certified character education program. we also operated virtue
and character programs that reflect the school philosophy, "cultivation of knowledge
and virtue and moral practice," and, as a result, various student clubs, including mano
en mano, which aims to public prejudice against people with physical disabilities, have
been named outstanding student clubs by outside institutions. in addition, students
who participated in the humanities programs, including thehumanitas reading contest,
won awards at the tvn campus debate battle and students active in the club activities
related to their majors won the prime minister award at the global s/w context,
proving the positive effect of the learning capacity building programs.

employment and start-up support program
for the efficient operation of the employment and start-up support programs, wonkwang
university presents the capacity students should possess in the career roadmap for
students in each year of study and runs diverse programs necessary for capacity building.
we allow employment support officer in each college and the human resources office
to help students understand the career maps and participate in the step-by-step capacity
development programs. also, we created the career planning professor system for each
undergraduate department and designated the "self-innovation and career development"
as a compulsory course to encourage students to focus on self-development as part of their
career preparation. each undergraduate college also runs the program it developed for
the improvement of employment and career preparation (employment, certification, etc.).
wonkwang university included the employment rate evaluation index in the regulations on
the faculty and personnel and performance assessment starting 2012 to draw attention to
students' employment. we also emphasize on-job training for the rise of employment rate.

taken by each department, and reports the final result to the university headquarters
(president), incorporating it into the university development plans. in order to enhance
the reliability of the survey,

the feasibility and reliability of the survey results. we design the survey by reflecting
the characteristics of internal and external educational customers. the result of the
satisfaction encompassing the university services as a whole the curriculum, faculty

the wonkwang university industry-academic cooperation team formulated the strategy
to concentrate on developing regional companies in a bid to vitalize local networking.
to that end, it is striving to form a specialized industry-academy cooperative model by
establishing "family companies," efficiently sharing information between businesses
and the school, and consolidating the operation of the family companies. as the
collaboration of the university with local companies ideal for the university s specialized
development strategy is critical, the university makes the best use of the family
companies as a center of industry-university cooperation in order to carry out r&d and
technological problem solution projects for family companies and business consulting
projects, establish an one-on-one mentoring system between the family companies and
professors, build a network among family companies and between family companies
and public institutions for research sharing and promote research performances.

      in the area of green energy to help address climate change and environmental
      degradation. meanwhile, rare and endangered plant species designated by the
