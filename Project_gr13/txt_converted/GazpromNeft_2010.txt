dear colleagues!

sustainability overview was prepared during the period of global turbulent economic and financial environment, which
dramatically affected the russian business. however, i am convinced that the crisis is a temporary occurrence. we keep our
mind on a long-term development and have all necessary conditions for efficient growth and sustainable development.

gazprom neft’s ambitious goal is to become one of the major international market participants. it can’t be reached without
a strong professional team able to effectively solve the ambitious tasks of the company. in recent years, we have done a lot
to build a new hr management system and a transparent system of compensation policy and career development.

working on efficiency , we pay close attention to the social responsibility of our business. basic programs are focused on the
development of an integrated control system in environment protection and industrial safety field, support of professional
and amateur sports, support of indigenous small ethnic communities of the north. the key element of social responsibility
in the regions of the company’s activities is a constructive cooperation with authorities.

i hope the overview will help to summarize key results and set out our further steps towards improving of the company’s
stability in current difficult conditions.

i am sure that gazprom neft’s business is in safe hands of a professional team.




                                                                                                        alexander dyukov

       the          company
       development in 2007–2009:




2007   2007 had to be crucial, stabilize oil production, determine the business strategy, goals
       and objectives, an efficient system of management. the year was indicative indeed, as the
       expansion of the resource base started; a number of large projects in oil production, refining
       and sales were launched. some new managerial tools started being developed; the company’s
       own corporate culture started being formed.


2008   2008 confirmed the company’s ambitions to become the best performing leader in all business
       lines of the industry, to begin expansion to foreign markets. implementation of strategic
       initiatives and projects, in particular the purchase of 50% in tomskneft and 51% in nis (serbia),
       helped us to lay down the foundation for future growth and stability.


2009
       in 2009 the company’s strategy remained the same: business growth. the company’s
       performance indicators after the 1st quarter are the best among major russian oil industry
       participants. in order to remain a leader, the company shall implement strategic initiatives
       aiming to increase efficiency of business processes, resources and production facilities used.



                                                                 overview of sustainable development

about
               the overview




sustainable development and openness to dialogue are those values the adherence to which is being tested today at many
companies. the economic instability rapidly identifies ineffective corporate practices and principles. and, quite the contrary,
dictates a demand for what may become a real guideline in the global crisis for the staff, partners and customers. in line with
its traditional sustainable development report, gazprom neft confirmed its readiness to follow its leadership strategy. gazprom
neft does not renounce its obligations.

it would be difficult to show the company’s continuous efforts to achieve its strategic goals within the framework of an annual
report. the impact of the global economic crisis on some of the company’s indicators may be misinterpreted as an adjustment
of corporate priorities. the 2007–2009 overview, on the reverse, allows to evaluate the consistency in moving toward the
corporate goals, such as effective business, international reputation, staff social security, and safe production shown by the
company in different time periods. this movement had different speed at different stages of the way, subject to macroeconomic
environment, oil market conditions, efficiency of the gazprom neft staff. the nearest future puts some serious challenges
before the company; however, the adherence to sustainable development shown in figures and results guarantees that
the team of gazprom neft will be able to overcome all difficulties and turn them into new opportunities.

the objectives set by the company as far back as in 2007 and included into its medium-term strategy for 2008–2010 remain
significant. environmental, social, educational programs, often worked out for more than just one year, will mostly continue
ensuring successive and sustainable development of the company. gazprom neft continues its strong investment activities
started in 2007 and 2008. making itself a global company, gazprom neft will continue purchasing foreign assets in addition
to its purchases of 2008–2009 (tomskneft, serbian oil company nis, and an italian oil and lubricant producer).

the company holds firmly to the vector of improvements and reorganizations in all directions set by the overview: management
of sustainable development, economic activities, hr policy, regional social activity, cooperation with suppliers and consumers,
environmental policy and industrial safety.

furthermore, the crisis provides a unique opportunity to reduce expenses, increase efficiency and improve performance.
gazprom neft possesses all resources available to develop and realize its leadership ambitions and overcome the crisis with
even a more distinct outlook of sustainable development.

    the role of managers in the responsible development
    in 2007–2008, gazprom neft formed its new top management team, which turned to be the youngest among russian oil
    companies. ambitious promising managers having gained a successful experience with leading russian and international
    business structures joined the company, and under their guidance gazprom neft became one of the fastest-growing
    market participants. in 2007 and 2008, gazprom neft showed the best net specific profit results among russia’s top-five oil
    companies. despite the global economic crisis, the results of 2008 were the best in the company’s history in terms of profit
    and ebitda, according to us gaap. q1 2009 confirmed the competences of gazprom neft leaders; the company’s financial
    and economic results are the best in the industry.

    development principles and practices throughout the company, including subsidiaries. gazprom neft’s strategic goal is to
    become a leader among the world’s oil & gas companies in terms of sustainable development. such issues as staff support,
    environment, and relations with regions are closely connected with production & economic priorities.

    key codes and policies
    since 2007 gazprom neft has adopted a number of policies and codes determining the company’s adherence to sustainable
    development. for example, in 2007-2008, the following policies were adopted: charity policy, project management policy,
    management documentation policy, information security policy, strategic planning policy, risk management policy, it
    policy, industrial safety, labor protection and environment protection policy, the corporate code. in turn, on the base of
    these a number of standards and projects have been worked out, which directly contribute to the company’s sustainable
    development. in 2009 the company will keep on implementing new documents, for example in the field of corporate ethics
    and risk management..

                           gazprom neft’s board regularly monitors the company’s key risks.

regularly monitors         the integrated risk management system (irms) developed and implemented at the
the company’s key risks.   corporate center in 2008 is gazprom neft’s key risk management tool. this approach
exposure of risks          ensures transparency and availability of risk-related information, enabling to determine
to determine timely        timely a response strategy, to develop risk management measures, and to monitor their
a response strategy,       effectiveness. the irms standard will be approved in 2009.
to develop risk
management measures,       the first step to implement the irms in the corporate practice was the creation in the
and to monitor their
effectiveness
                           beginning of 2008 of a register of key risks and risk factors on the basis of interviews with
                           heads of the company’ departments and top managers.

                           the next step involved drawing up of ‘risk cards’ containing all information about the risk,
                           its assessment and management measures. in order to finalize the register of key risks,
                           the irms is being implemented on the level of blocks and independent business units
                           of the corporate center. in 2008 42 employees of blocks and directly subordinated units
                           completed risk management training.

                           the next stage in the company’s risk management development is irms implementation
                           at subsidiaries and affiliates in 2009–2010. in 2008 a pilot project of irms deployment was
                           launched at the omsk oil refinery. as a result, irms will become an integral part of the
                           company’s corporate management system.

     development
     strategy
     in 2007–2009, gazprom neft kept on developing its traditional activities in russia and abroad, including oil and gas
     production, oil processing, wholesale and retail of oil and oil products, including special products (aviation fuel, marine
     diesel, lubricants), as well as rendering special services in oil and gas production, including geological survey, drilling,
     and wells and pipelines construction and maintenance. all of the company’s projects and initiatives were in line with
     the gazprom neft’s goals of development by 2020 in accordance with the long-term strategy adopted in 2007. by 2020,
     the company shall achieve:

     • volume of prospected extracted hydrocarbon resources: about 2200–2400 mn t;
     • volume of oil production: about 90–100 mn t;
     • volume of internal processing: about 70–80 mn t;
     • retail network: about 5000–5500 gas stations;
     • premium oil products sales: about 40 mn t.

     while achieving its goals in 2007–2009, gazprom neft considerably expanded its presence in russian oil and gas industry,
     including purchase of new assets. at the end of 2007, the company purchased 50% of shares in tomskneft and entered into
     an agreement with the holder of another half of the company’s shares, rosneft. in the beginning of 2008, gazprom neft
     entered into an agreement on shared management of the moscow oil refinery with its other shareholders.

     naturally, the global drop of oil prices from usd 85 per bbl early in 2008 and usd 140 per bbl in the middle of 2008 down
     to usd 35 in january 2009 affected gazprom neft’s business and corporate initiatives. however, balanced investment policy,
     low amount of borrowed loans and accumulation of own financial reserves enables the company to meet its obligations
     in full, and to stabilize its position in russian and international markets.

     in february 2009, gazprom neft completed the purchase of 51% of shares of the serbian company nis, one of the leaders
     of central and eastern european oil and gas sector with average annual oil production of 1 mn t and processing capacity
     of 7.3 mn t. through the acquired serbian company nis, gazprom neft will be able to enter not only the serbian market,
     but also other european markets. with nis, marketing and production synergy of another new asset of the company
     is expected, namely that of an oil and lubricant producer in bari (italy) purchased in april 2009 from chevron global energy.
     the plant’s annual capacity amounts to 30 kt of oils and 6 kt of lubricants. all products manufactured by the plant meet
     european quality standards. gazprom neft’s strategic goals remained the same; however, its medium-term objectives were
     re-adjusted subject to the crisis management, which enables the company to achieve its preset quantitative and qualitative
     indicators without any substantial change.

     key economic
     results in 2007–2009
     2007–2008 were the best years in the history of the company’s economy. in 2008 ebitda increase was equal to 28% (10%
     in 2007), net profit increased by 12.5% (13.2% in 2007). because of the collapse of world oil prices in q4 2008 the profit
     of the company, like that of other russian oil companies, decreased dramatically; however, due to activity and structure
     optimization measures, we were able to reverse the situation as early as in q1 2009.

     among positive factors for the oil industry was the reduction of tax burden authorized by the russian government in 2008,
     including reduction of export duty, mining tax, zero duty on imported unique equipment. gazprom neft took an active part
     in the dialogue between oil companies and the government. in the new economic conditions the company justified the
     reasonability of tax burden reduction based on its own activity taken as an example. in the issue of oil industry support
     measures to be taken in 2009 gazprom neft will receive additional profit of about rur 10 bn, which will partially be invested
     in the production and processing, as well as applied to compensation of natural monopolies’ rate growth.

     gazprom neft makes a considerable contribution into development of the russian economy. in 2007–2009, the company
     traditionally invested its profit in the support and development of sustainable production activity, efficient use of oil and gas
     resources, creation of new jobs and wage payment to employees.

     the created value was also allocated into dividend payments to shareholders, federal and regional taxes, financing of social
     and economic partnership programs and charitable projects in the regions.

     the achieved economic results make gazprom neft one of russia’s major taxpayers. in 2008 total amount of taxes (other
     than income tax) paid by the company reached usd 5.237 bn, which is by 52.6% more than in 2007. in addition, profit tax
     amounted to usd 1.730 bn, which is by 47.6% more than in 2007. export duties paid by gazprom neft in 2008 grew by 64.6%,
     up to usd 7.217 bn. the company considers timely assessments to all levels of budgets as a part of its social responsibility
     and a ground for the development of its social projects.




        in 2008 the total volume of taxes (other than income tax) paid by the company amounted
        to usd 5.237 bn, which is by 52.6% more than in 2007.
        the company sees the complicated circumstances as a challenge and an inducement

oil production
gazprom neft’ production facilities are located in major russian oil and gas areas:
kmaa, ynaa, chukotka autonomous region, omsk and tomsk regions. in 2007–2008,
gazpromneft- noyabrskneftegaz remained gazprom neft’s key oil producing unit.

the company managed to increase the oil production general indicators by 5,6% in 2008.
llc gazpromneft-khantos remained a leader among jsc gazprom neft business units
in terms of production growth in 2007 and 2008 (+12.7% in 2008). however, the purchase
of tomskneft added up the largest contribution in production volumes growth. at most
enterprises, though, due to depletion of many fields the production figures kept on
dropping: in 2008, aggregate decrease in the oil production of subsidiaries and affiliates
amounted to 6%. moreover, the world crisis caused a significant cut of the investment
program of field support in 2008–2009, and affected oil production volumes in most units.
as pre-estimated, investments in production as compared to 2008 will fall in 2009 by 25–
30%. however, priority units will accelerate their operations. thus, gazpromneft-khantos
will increase drilling rates by 8% in 2009.

gazprom neft keeps a fundamental safety margin due to the fact that since 2007 the
company has been focusing on provision of oil reserves. as a result, by the beginning of
2009, the company’s proven oil reserves amounted to 4.5 bn bbl. this puts gazprom neft
among the world’s twenty largest oil companies. from 2007 to 2008, gas reserves grew
by 195.7% up to 2154 bn ft3.

       development



     the company considers complicated circumstances as a challenge and an inducement to work more efficiently. in 2009 the
     largest amounts (about 70%) will be invested by the company in exploration and production. gazprom fields in the north
     of yamal peninsula, which will be developed by gazprom neft together with the gas corporation, bear a foremost potential.
     oil reserves extracted there amount to about 400 mn tons, that is, at the peak, will enable the company to achieve an annual
     production of 15 to 20 mn tons, which makes almost half of the current gazprom neft production. in 2009 gazprom neft
     intends to prepare a feasibility study on these fields development.

     gazprom neft is studying production opportunities in plenty of the world regions. for example, advantages of central asia
     include a mentality similar to the russian one, experience and similar geological conditions. operations are also possible
     on continental shelves of the west and north africa (libya, algeria), where gazprom plans to launch some of its projects.
     gazprom neft is a member of the russian consortium for heavy oil fields development in venezuela, and became the first
     russian company qualified for operations in cuba. gazprom neft will keep on its performance in those regions in line with
     expanding into the middle east (iran, iraq).

     oil processing
     the success of gazprom neft in the oil products processing was achieved due to high level of technologies used in the
     company’s units, as well as their advantageous geographical location. during the last three years, the company has
     always been among the first companies in russia in terms of production growth rates due to such assets as jsc slavneft-
     yaroslavlnefteorgsintez, jsc moscow oil refinery and jsc gazpromneft-omsk oil refinery. jsc gazpromneft-onpz
     is the largest processing unit of the company. in 2007–2008, the omsk refinery showed strong growth as compared to 2006,
     having increased oil processing by 12.9% (from 16.3 to 18.4 mn tons). in 2007-2009, the refinery remained a leader in terms
     of production volumes of light oil products and aromatic hydrocarbons among russian oil companies.

     within the last few years the company’s general trend included production of environmentally friendly products, enabling
     to enter absolutely new markets. so, the omsk refinery development plan provides for a changeover for euro 4 standard
     gasoline and diesel fuel production starting from 2012, and after 2015 for euro 5 standard. for these purposes, in 2008,
     the l-24/9 diesel fuel installation was reconstructed; in 2008–2009, two hydrorefining installations are being designed (for
     diesel fuel and catalytic cracking gasoline); and in january 2008, construction of izomalk-2 (an isomerization plant) began.
     the isomerization plant in omsk will be the largest in russia with annual rated input capacity of 800 kt. its construction
     is to be completed in 2010. the new complex along with a gasoline hydrorefining unit will enable to increase the volume
     of automobile gasoline products and achieve  euro 4 standard quality.

     construction of the isomerization plant is the first stage of the medium-term investment program of environmentally
     friendly fuels production.




        within the last few years the company’s trend included production of environmentally
        friendly products.
        oil products sales volume in the domestic market grew in 2008 by 17.2%.

                             an isomerization plant similar to that in omsk is planned for construction at jsc slavneft-
                             yaroslavnefteorgsintez (yanos) as well. yanos was one of few plants to quickly organize
                             production of low-sulfur diesel fuels. so, in 2008, the production of diesel fuel with 10
                             mg/kg sulfur content (standard 5 requirements) was about 55% of the total production
                             volume. due to reduced sulfur content in the fuel vehicles emit less sulfur dioxide, which
                             is one of the most environmentally hazardous substances.

                             despite reduced investments into processing in 2009–2010, works on the projects
                             ensuring standard 4 and 5 fuels production will continue in accordance with the deadline
                             set by the government.

                             sales
                             in 2007–2009, gazprom neft with its expanded sales network in russia has strengthened
                             its positions in retail and wholesale oil products markets. oil products sales volume in
                             the domestic market grew by 17.2% in 2008 (12.6% in 2007) up to 15.7 mn tons. taking
                             the crisis into account, in 2009 the main sales target will be to retain the sale volumes

         17,2%               achieved in 2008. the company is constantly improving its service and attracting new
                             customers thanks to its reputation of a reliable partner.

                             in 2009 the plan of sales network re-branding will be fulfilled in the minimal volume: over
                             200 gas stations (gs) will get new appearance and improve their service. in the nearest
                             future no new gss are planned to be purchased. during the market recession, the company
                             will search for land lots for its future projects. official land registration takes usually plenty
                             of time, so it is important to do it for the future. the company is particularly interested in the
oil products sales
volume in the domestic       most promising and developing moscow and saint petersburg areas, as well as in the regions
market grew by 17.2%         neighboring oil refineries (moscow refinery, omsk refinery and yaroslavnefteorgsintez).
in 2008 up to 15.7 mn tons   instead of extensive sales network expansion the program of increasing regional sales
                             efficiency will continue being implemented, which provides for a common system of
                             customers attraction in all gss. the implementation involves introducing of flexible
                             demand stimulation mechanisms: discounts, bonuses, prize drawings, etc. consequently, a
                             comprehensive system of active sales will be built, when the company meets the customer’s
                             requirements through understanding his needs and timely responding to them.

                             oil services
                             in 2007 gazprom neft restructured its oil service sector. established in september
                             2007 jsc gazpromneft-nefteservice took over the guidance of the following units:
                             jsc gazpromneft-noyabrskneftegazgeofizika, llc well overhaul-service, llc service
                             drilling company and another seven service business units. the resulting company
                             has become one of major russian oil service companies with optimized business units
                             structure and possibility to work on large-scale projects.

                             in the second half of 2008 and early 2009, the company’s oil service sector due
                             to decrease in orders, first of all for new wells drilling, faced rather a complicated
                             situation. the number of drilling crews will have to be reduced; instead, the employees
                             will get additional qualification, in particular, in repairs of existing wells.

     efficiency policy
     – tactical optimization

     in 2007–2008, gazprom neft became a leader among top-five russian oil companies in terms of economic efficiency. this
     is evidenced by the highest specific net profit of the company. the economic recession started in 2008 put the whole industry
     into more severe conditions than ever before. due to the crisis, in 2008–2009, all managerial and expert efforts were focused
     on optimization of current and operating expenses. the optimization policy will continue and will be further implemented and
     enforced with special anti-crisis programs.

     jsc gazprom neft management sees several possible scenarios of 2009–2010. the main scenario is based on usd 50 per
     bbl; while the stress scenario assumes an oil price of usd 30 per bbl. the package of anti-crisis measures elaborated by
     the company for each scenario includes the following: firstly, revision and optimization of the investment portfolio; secondly,
     reduction of operating expenses and search for internal reserves; and, thirdly, revision of contracts with contractors.

     each sector has its own expenditures structure. the policy of increasing of the company’s overall effectiveness is intended for
     optimization of major expense items.

     for oil producing companies key optimization measures include shutdown of not-paying and unprofitable wells, reduction of pipe
     breaks, energy saving projects. in some cases anti-crisis measures turned out to be needless due to efficient performance. for
     example, due to the fact that gazprom neft chooses precise and reasonable priorities in its construction program, the volumes
     of construction of facilities meant for oil production volume support have not virtually been cut (these include pipelines, power
     lines, pumping units, roads, bushes). another important aspect of the crisis-anticipatory optimization was the reorganization
     of gazprom neft’s scientific and analytical department into the scientific and technical center (stc) in 2007.

     the key goal of stc is to stabilize oil production in 2009–2010 and increase its capacity starting from 2011, when new assets
     are to be put into operation.

     stc’s researches are purely practical and utilize scientists’ potential in the achievement of business objectives and realization
     of the sustainable development concept. for example, after the center had examined the practice of bed hydraulic fracturing
     designs, proppant (a material increasing oil-well output) costs decreased by 30%. before, the amount of proppant per well




        each sector has its own expenditures structure. the main item of expenses in the corporate
        centre is employees, while key production and refining costs lay in the sphere of power,
        repairs and logistics. the policy of increasing of the company’s overall effectiveness
        is intended for optimization of major expense items.

     as far back as in 2006, with the company’s growth new motivation methods and hr management policy had to be developed.
     in 2007 a united system of quarterly motivation was developed and implemented. it includes both achievement of corporate
     goals, such as the company’s financial results, and meeting objectives relating to a specific functional line.

     a system of target-oriented management (tom) is in force for key managers. it allows targets cascading from gazprom neft
     general director to heads of departments of subsidiaries and affiliates. the tom system enables to plan clearly and achieve
     the company’s key performance indicators, and realize most important strategic initiatives. the program involves every of
     550 key managers of the corporate center, subsidiaries and affiliates.

     the so called grade system is considered to be the key element in the labor motivation being elaborated and actively
     implemented during 2006–2009. a grade means a range of positions having approximately equal value for the company
     (similar functional, competence, experience and responsibility requirements). a grade is determined by such universal
     criteria as professional skills, knowledge of features of the business and the company, social competence, intellectual
     capacity, and level of the work complexity, independent decision-making, scale and nature of influence. the evaluation has
     determined job hierarchies, which were subsequently grouped by grades. there are 23 grades included into the system.
     within the scheduled wage revision the amount of bonuses and composition of the package are attached not to the position
     itself, but to the grade.

     starting from some pilot projects launched in the second half of 2008 at llc gazpromneft-khantos, the omsk refinery and
     jsc gazpromneft-omsk, the grading system was introduced at subsidiaries as well.

     social support

     social package
     in 2007–2009, gazprom neft traditionally utilized social programs as an additional tool of employees attraction and retention.
     along with statutory benefits, the social package includes voluntary medical insurance, accident insurance, death allowance,
     payment for meals, anniversary bonuses, financial aid, payment for tourist vouchers, eventual financial aid (marriage, child
     birth, etc.), holiday gifts for employees and their families.

     in 2007 the average amount of a social payment made rur 14.7 thousand per employee, which shows a 35% increase
     as compared to 2006. the dynamics continued, and in 2008 a payment per employee amounted to rur 32 thousand, that
     is, more than doubled within one year.

     cooperation with labor unions
     two thirds of gazprom neft employees are members of labor unions, including 85% of employees from kmaa and omsk
     region. therefore the 2007–2009 proved to be the years of close cooperation between the company management and
     the labor union. primary labor union units are established at some of the company’s enterprises. so, in early 2009, the
     employees of llc gazpromneft-center decided to establish a primary labor union unit, the professional union of oil,
     gas and construction workers of the russian federation.

     the company realizes that the goal of the labor union is not limited to the protection of employees’ interests and influence
     on labor relations, but also represents a kind of the public mood indicator. the labor union expresses the employees’
     reaction upon the social and economic policy carried out by the enterprise, and contributes to its timely correction. in
     view of this gazprom neft welcomed the company staff initiative of establishment of the interregional labor union as a
     coordination body for representatives of each team. we worked on this in 2008 and will keep on working in 2009.

                                                 the company considerably increased the financing of social aid programs for orphanages,
                                                 schools, boarding schools and culture institutions.

                                                 these priorities determined both in respect of social and economic agreements with
                                                 regions of presence and individual charitable programs and projects. identification

                                                 is growing, the market situation in 2009 can adjust gazprom neft’s social activity.

                                                 focusing on sustainable development of territories includes not only charitable programs
                                                 financing. high standards of customer service form an important part of the commitment
                                                 toward the social environment where the company is conducting its business. therefore
                                                 gazprom neft considers the work on improving of its units’ service quality as a contribution
                                                 to the development of the regions. in the global economic crisis and due to the cutting
                                                 of the investment program in 2009, gazprom neft is going to focus on further improvement
                                                 of the service quality and overall level of consumption culture in the regions.

     st. petersburg administration founded jsc public & business center okhta, which develops the territory adjacent to gazprom
     neft’s future headquarters. the project of the new business area was firstly declared in november 2005 in a cooperation
     memo between jsc gazprom and st. petersburg government. by 2009 a tender for the project’s architectural concept was
     carried out, key geological works, as well as historic and archeological surveys completed. in february 2009, due to the new
     economic circumstances, st. petersburg legislative assembly decided to sell the city’s share (22.69%) to gazprom neft. the
     company declared that it assumes a 100% financing of the okhta center. works on the project will run in accordance with the
     construction schedule and shall be completed by 2016.

     development
     of the quality standards


     gazprom neft is not only an oil producer, but also one of the major oil products market participants. the gazprom group
     brand is traditionally associated with high quality; therefore along with fulfillment of its business targets, gazprom neft
     undertakes a social function by offering client-friendly services.

     in 2007–2008, gazprom neft continuously tried to turn its sales units and gas stations in the regions into the points
     of growing consumer culture.

     standardization and quality improvement of consumer services
     one of the key quality indicators in the oil products retail realization is the standardization of work of the staff standing
     in direct contact with clients.

     during 2007–2008, considerable work was done in terms of analysis and systematization of documents regulating the
     activities of retail network personnel; a book of operating rules for gazprom neft gss staff was elaborated representing
     a complete set of operating standards for gas stations staff. since 2008, all gss staff is being retrained in conformity with the
     program prepared according to standards. the purpose of the retraining is to teach the employees the principles of client-
     oriented behavior. the program provides for a stronger control and greater responsibility of employees for complying with
     the standards, which finally shall bring the quality of client servicing to a fundamentally new level.

     in 2008 the company conducted its first promo action named thirty liters to monaco. the action aimed at encouraging
     the clients to a larger volume of a single refueling in the period of summer demand peak. the winners of the action were
     awarded with a journey to monaco to attend the match between zenith and manchester for the uefa supercup.

     another network pr action paris. spring. romanticism was conducted in january–march 2009 in order to attract consumers
     to the company’s gss during the winter demand fall. the winners of the action were rewarded with a possibility to visit
     paris.


        today the quality of a service is the quality of the technology underlying the service.
        the company means to create an environment offering the consumer a guaranteed level
        of comfort.
        a common “hotline number” specified on each fuelling card will ensure a clients’

                   a retail individual customer loyalty network bonus program was launched. in 2009
                   a pilot version of the program will be launched in two regions, and following the pilot,
                   the program will be spread in all regions of the company’s activities.

                   retail sales of gazprom neft’s distribution units may serve as an indicator of quality
                   of the services offered. moreover, total number of gss operated by the company’s sales
number of gss      units grew from 783 in 2007 up to 865 in 2008, and the average daily product sales per

                   as far back as in 2001, the company commenced the development of a cashless payment
                   program for gss using the mobile card system. however, in 2008 the conception of the
                   technology upgrade changed. key role in creating of new standards of consumer quality
                   was now attached to the cashless payment system petrol plus based on microprocessor
                   fuel cards and widely spread both in russia and abroad.

                   the main difference of the new system from the mobile card is in the provided by the
                   petrol plus system possibilities of unifying the system of customer service, expanding the
                   geography of acceptance of the new card products, building partnership relations with
                   russian and foreign sales networks, reducing costs and technological defects inherent in
                   old systems. another task set before the petrol plus project is to establish a call center.
                   a united “hotline number” specified on each fuel card will ensure a clients’ feedback.
                   moreover, a separate website will be designed for customers who will be able to check
                   their accounts on a personal page.

                   in 2009 the cashless payment system petrol plus will be introduced at all of the company’s
                   units supplying oil products.

                   during 2009–2011, gazprom neft intends to reconstruct over 200 gas stations. consumers

     re-branding project
     in 2007 gazprom neft started re-branding its infrastructure facilities. the company sees the project as a priority one, as the
     brand is one of the key loyalty forming tools on the part of clients and employees.

     after the gazprom group became a majority shareholder in sibneft, the company was renamed gazprom neft. however,
     the design of industrial facilities and office buildings, roof structures, vehicles, overalls, documentation, souvenir and
     representative products still bore the sibneft logo. the re-branding aimed at creating a clear, consistent and positive image
     of gazprom neft as a modern, fast-growing and highly efficient company within the gazprom group. besides, the company
     must be easily recognized by consumers and suppliers, as well as by all interested parties.

     by the beginning of 2009, most works in respect of industrial projects re-branding were successfully completed. not only
     corporate center departments, but also gazprom neft subsidiaries underwent a re-branding. for example, in 2008 15 facade
     and roof structures reflecting gazprom neft new corporate style were installed on office buildings in the company’s regions
     of presence.

     in 2008 renowned british companies minale tattersfield and maildberry have developed and detailed the conceptual design
     of a new gs network consumer brand. the new style of gazprom neft gs network will symbolize a new level of consumption
     and service being client-open, close and friendly. basic elements of the gs design (gazpromneft identity block and
     supergraphics) evidence the succession to the gazprom group brand. in the course of an independent survey conducted by
     the regional sale department, the new brand identity was highly appreciated by the focus group of consumers.

     a full-scale re-branding program provides for the new brand to be implemented in 2009 on 225 gss. the first unit in the new
     firm style will start operating in early june 2009 in st. petersburg. the 2009 schedule provides for massive implementation
     of the new brand in the central and north-west regions. newly styled gss will appear in ural and siberia. during 2009–2011,
     all of the company’s gss will be brought to a untied up-to-date look.

     in 2009 the book of gazprom neft gs network consumer brand corporate style will be finalized to systematize all elements
     of the brand’s visual identity. the brand book of corporate style will become a corporate standard for construction and
     subsequent operations of gas stations of various forms.




        in 2009–2011, gazprom neft will reconstruct over 200 gas stations. thus, the client
        services package will gradually achieve a new level.

     implementation
     of industrial safety,
     labor and civil protection policy,
     and systemic tools of its
     realization

     on march 27, 2008 by order № 32-p, jsc gazprom neft approved its policy on industrial safety, labor and environment
     protection (hereinafter “the policy”). according to the said policy, the company shall work to increase the national heritage and
     realize its responsibility before the society for creating safe labor conditions and conservation of favorable environment.

     principles and targets of the policy
     the company guarantees adequate and safe labor conditions to its employees, as well as compliance with environment
     protection requirements.

     the policy determines the company’s key goals and objectives and prescribes equal treatment of industrial safety, labor and
     environment protection issues and economic issues.

     the policy has been developed and implemented due to forming of a separate corporate unit of the department of industrial
     and environmental safety, labor and civil protection. its appearance was induced by the understanding of the fact that
     today’s labor safety culture requires continuous and consistent efforts, as well as personal involvement of all employees
     and understanding by each manager of his/her personal responsibility. today the policy implementation is ensured
     by the general director of jsc gazprom neft and managers at all company levels.




        today the policy implementation is ensured by the ceo of jsc gazprom neft
        and managers at all levels.
        the integrated ies, lp and cp management system complies with key recommendations
        of the international association of oil and gas producers and requirements
        of international iso 9000, 14001, ohsas 19001 standards.

    3       the policy formulates the company’s strategic goal of becoming a leader among
            world oil and gas companies in terms of industrial and environmental safety, labor
            and civil protection (ies, lp and cp). this involves an everyday contribution to the
            improvement of labor conditions, increasing of the level of industrial and environmental
            safety, implementation of an efficient ies, lp and cp management system, exchange
            of information with interested parties, increasing the employees’ competence and
            involvement in the policy realization, setting higher environmental and industrial safety
            requirements toward the company’s own business units and toward contractors working
            on the company’s projects.

            the principles fixed in the policy determine the company’s goals and objectives:



        1   • consistent reduction of the occupational injury rate, occupational diseases, accident
               rate and negative environmental impact;



        2
            • organization of safe production and environmental protection by implementing
               by 2011 of a single integrated is, lp and ep management system in jsc gazprom
               neft’s production units, complying with the world standards including processes of
               hazard identification, occupational risk assessment and management;


        3
            • consistent implementation of the world best practices in the fields of engineering,
               technology and industrial safety, labor and environment protection management
               at all production units of jsc gazprom neft.

            in order to realize the preset goals, a target-oriented management program was
            introduced in the company. within the activity horizon of each manager and each profile
            department, personal values of ies, lp and cp are set, which, when successfully met,
            brings the company closer to its strategic goal, namely to a leading position among the
            world peers in the field of industrial safety, labor and environment protection. it is not
            the efforts made that are considered to be the key factor of success assessment, but
            the efficiency of the respective measure.

       industrial and environmental safety,
       labor protection – developing safely




     systemic tools of the safety policy realization
     the basic tool of the policy realization is the risk management mechanism. in the second half 2008, the company developed
     and approved the procedure of detection, assessment and minimization of industrial and environmental safety, labor
     and civil protection risks, which regulates this process.

     in 2009 the company intends to launch a full-scale risk assessment of works performed on the company’s project in order
     to form an ies, lp and cp risk portfolio, and elaborate respective minimization measures. the risks detected according
     to this methodology will be ranked and, pursuant to a risk’s importance, certain correcting measures will be included
     in future budgeting.

     in 2008 an integrated ies, lp and cp management system was developed and introduced in the company, complying with
     key recommendations of the international association of oil and gas producers, and requirements of international iso 9000,
     14001, ohsas 19001 standards. the document allows systemizing all activities in this field, setting respective priorities,
     ensuring personnel development and forming the basis of enterprise assessment. starting from 2009, the system will
     be intensively implemented at all units of the company.

     moreover, in 2008 the company elaborated and launched the azimuth system representing an ies, lp and cp information
     & control system for integration of collected industrial safety information, automation and standardization of managerial
     reporting, improving control of compliance with industrial safety requirements, immediately informing about accidents
     and measures taken, providing assistance in investigations directing them toward detection of key causes of the accidents.

     outlook of the policy
     at the same time, the company has got a considerable reserve for improvement of industrial and environmental safety.
     gazprom neft is on the way to create its corporate ies, lp and cp management system, where any managerial decision shall
     consider and give priority to safety reasons. therefore, in 2009 the focus will be put on involvement of all-level managers
     in the development of ies, lp and cp system.

     the company’s priority includes the construction of a living system. in the second half of 2009, existing targets will be
     complemented with new initiatives, such as fire safety standard implementation. as of late, there have more fires occurred
     at the company as compared with the previous year (12 in 2008, against eight in 2007) due to non-compliance with fire safety
     rules, wear of process equipment, non-compliance with vehicle operational conditions. therefore, important measures
     to be taken in the company in 2009 shall include compliance with schedules and plans of current and scheduled equipment
     repairs, targeted checks of compliance with fire safety norms and rules, conducting fire alarm in offices and administration
     buildings, conducting fire-fighting trainings on industrial facilities.




        key result of the systemic approach to the safety policy:
        in 2008 there were no work accidents at gazprom neft’s enterprises
        (two accidents in 2007).

     labor protection
     and industrial safety
     reduction of injury rate
     one of the main goals of the policy is to reduce the accident and injury rate. in a company with complicated and hazardous
     production processes, this problem immediately demonstrates the rate of the corporation’s seriousness in treating
     of the labor safety.

     labor protection costs per employee increase annually: in 2007 the figure amounted to rur 6500, and in 2008 achieved
     rur 12200. the funds are applied toward workplace certification, improvement of medical service, provision of employees
     with ppe.

     to avoid wasting of funds and ensure high efficiency of the measures assumed, one should be aware of the kinds of incidents
     occurring at the company, as well as of direct and systemic reasons of their occurrence. jsc gazprom neft is aware that
     a system offering a possibility to hide industrial accidents is absolutely unacceptable. in this connection, the company
     implements a program for increasing of reporting transparency. the company’s subsidiaries and affiliates on a permanent
     basis exchange information in respect of accidents and investigation results.

     consequently, the rate of transparency in respect of accidents (ratio between major, significant and insignificant accidents)
     in 2008 grew by 40% as compared to 2007, and achieved the level of the world leading oil companies. the speed of injury
     cases reporting improved as well (97% of the events were reported within 24 hours).

     the company management believes that registration of accidents without an adequate investigation and elimination
     of all causes giving rise to them is a waste of resources. therefore in 2008, there was a certain standard accidents.
     immediate reporting, investigation, accounting and periodic reporting elaborated; managers and specialists were trained
     in comprehensive investigation; lessons learned from accidents exchange is performed on a regular basis. in 2009
     the company is going to keep on fulfilling regular quality analysis of accident investigations and increase the transparency
     of the statistics by at least 50%, as well as reduce at the same time the number of major accidents by 30%.

     improving employees’ competences in labor protection, industrial
     and environmental safety
     regular analysis of accidents shows that a great part of them is caused by non-compliance with occupational discipline
     and industrial process requirements, therefore professional advancement of employees is very important in the sphere
     of injury rate control, including clarification of the necessity of compliance with labor protection, industrial and environmental
     safety requirements.



        the rate of transparency in respect of accidents (ratio between major,
        significant and insignificant accidents) in 2008 grew by 40% as compared
        to 2007 and achieved the level of the world leading oil companies.

gazprom neft requires from all managers and employees of the company to be aware
of their responsibility for their own and other persons’ safety. in this connection,
any employee is entitled to stop and/or refuse to perform an operation putting in danger
his/her life or health or that of other people. in order to improve the employees’ safety
competence, various forms of training and coaching are encouraged.

in 2008 trainings were launched for the company staff in ies, lp and cp. specialists
of ies, lp and cp department, as well as instructors of specialized companies trained
about 1000 people in the major production sections.

in 2009 the company plans to apply a more systemic approach by creating a division
of internal instructors with a corporate training program to be presented by them
subsequently.

providing employees with up-to-date
personal protection equipment (ppe)
although personal protection equipment is the last barrier between the employee
and the hazard (in case of preventive measures failure), it allows considerable
minimization of the hazard impact upon his/her life and health. therefore the company
attaches great importance to the provision of employees with ppe. the respective
program has been launched as far back as in december 2007. in 2008 an analysis of
ppe market was carried out and subsequently the following were elaborated on the
basis of its results and on-site tests:

• a corporate standard procedure of employees provision
   with personal protection equipment;
• a catalogue of ppe allowed for use at the company;
• a technical specification for overalls manufactured in gazprom neft corporate style.

while implementing the program, the company focuses not only on ppe provision,
but also on employees training for correct and efficient usage of ppe, explanatory work
about advantages of ppe and innovative ppe.

the company takes an active part in the legislation drafting in the field of standardization
of personal protection equipment for oil industry workers. jsc gazprom neft has
proposed some amendments to the public standards of free-of-charge ppe provision…

a pilot project on providing jsc gazpromneft-noyabrskneftegaz employees with doublet
winter overalls in the corporate style has already been put into effect.

new types of employees’ ppe are systematically being put at disposal. these include:
purchase of wear made of fabrics not only protecting from hazardous factors (exposure
to open flame, electric arc and chemical substances), but also complying with the re-
quirements of oexo-tex standart 100. textile tested pursuant to oexo-tex standart 100
criteria guarantees that it does not content any substance hazardous to human health.

     environmental
     safety
     investments in the environment
     being one of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, jsc gazprom neft fully realizes its responsibility before the society
     for conservation of favorable environment. the company tries to fully meet the requirements of the present environmental
     legislation, compensating to the utmost the damages caused to the nature by its activities.

     in accordance with active regulations, the company takes comprehensive measures in terms of adoption of environmental
     norms and determination of maximum permissible levels of environmental impact; requirements in respect of field
     development project documentation expert examination are constantly monitored, as well as requirements in respect
     of hydrocarbons processing authorization and compliance with license obligations.

     amounts paid by jsc gazprom neft’s key units for exceeding the norms of environmental impact are insignificant compared
     to the company’s scale. in 2008 it amounted to about rur 58 mn; about rur 47 mn in 2007.

     during the last three years the company’s current expenses on environmental measures including technologies of negative
     environmental impact optimization, exceed manifold the amount paid by the company for the environment pollution.
     in 2008 those costs made rur 1018,2 mn against rur 577.7 mn in 2007. the funds are spent on elaboration of norms,
     environmental monitoring, industrial environmental control, recovery of oil polluted territories, equipment upgrading,
     professional advancement and environmental protection trainings.

     in 2009 the company will due to the crisis implement some adjustment measures to reduce its technogenic environmental
     impact to the amount of rur 705 mn. in particular:

     • launch the practice of annual pipelines overhaul at the rate of at least 400 km,
        to ensure the frequency of ruptures by 300 per year;
     • ensure 100% replacement of leak clamps after rupture elimination;
     • increase the level of pipeline operation (inhibition, troubleshooting, reduction of aggressiveness of pumped fluid);
     • ensure timely drafting (prolongation) of environmental authorizations;
     • ensure adequate financing of measures for re-vegetation of oil polluted land and slime bins to avoid paying
        extra charges for exceeding the limits.




        the company’s current and capital expenditures for environmental measures
        including technologies of negative environmental impact optimization exceed
        manifold the amount paid by the company for environment pollution.

stock-taking of greenhouse gases
oil industry operations entail great atmospheric loads. it is impossible to achieve
immediate crucial results; however, optimization measures always result in positive
changes.

during the last years, gross gas emissions by gazprom neft’s enterprises remained
approximately on the same level, showing insignificant positive (downward) dynamics.
in view of the company’s activity magnification, the stability of this index shall be deemed
as a success. this was supported by reconstruction of industrial facilities, replacement
of burner devices, optimization of technological parameters, reconstruction of tanks
and implementation of a unit for precise and leak-proof loading of oil products.
the efficiency of measures is growing consistently; 2008 demonstrated a downward
trend in hazardous atmospheric emissions in 2007 (from 161.8 to 157.2 kt). the company
expects that the positive dynamics will continue in 2009.

production of environmentally friendly fuel
the program developed at the omsk refinery provides for a complete changeover to the
production of environmentally friendly fuels by 2012. in 2008 about 9% of automobile fuel
manufactured by the plant complied with euro 3 standard requirements.

in 2009–2010, an installation of annual rated capacity of 800 thousand tons isomerizate
is planned for construction. the isomerizate is one of the most valuable high-
octane components of today’s engine fuel. it does not contain any olefinic or aromatic
hydrocarbons; therefore, the end product (fuel) becomes more environmentally friendly.
the upgrading will enable the onpz to change over to the production of euro 4 and
euro 5 standard diesel fuel.

the construction of the isomerization plant is the first step in realization of the medium-
term investment program aimed at the production of environmentally friendly fuels.
according to gazprom neft’s decision, plants to be constructed at onpz will form the
basis for the company to enter absolutely new markets and contribute to the environ-
mental protection.

     power and water consumption
     in 2008 water consumption for internal needs grew by 15% as compared to 2007 due to launching of a drilling waste
     recycling complex at gazpromneft-khantos.

     intensification of the company’s activities affects the power consumption as well, which results in a 5.5% increase from
     2007 to 2008.

     in 2009 water and power consumption will also be considerably affected by the macroeconomic situation, which determines
     the company’s demands for new projects and activities.

     waste treatment
     major part of the company’s operational waste consists of drilling waste of iv hazard grade (low hazard). total share of low
     hazard and virtually non-hazardous waste (grade v) exceeds 90%. in 2008 activities on improving of waste treatment became
     systemic, which can be observed in the improved statistics.

     jsc gazpromneft-onpz processes waste oils generated by the enterprise by way of sending the waste industrial oils
     to a fpu (fuel-power unit) for re-use as a component of fuel oil.

     in 2007 a mobile cleaning unit was implemented at oil products supplying enterprises, intended for removal of solid deposits
     from the interior tank surface. the cleaning is performed by way of supplying a special chemical mix to the tank walls under
     high pressure. after the walls and the bottom are cleaned, the resulting emulsion is pumped out, and the mobile complex
     separates petrol out of it which can be used further.

     in 2008 gazpromneft-khantos put into operation a unique complex of drilling waste recycling by pumping them into the bed
     instead of filling slime bins. this unprecedented in russia project was realized in cooperation with m-i swaco (canada).
     the ministry of natural resources of the russian federation distinguished it as the best environmental project of 2008
     in the nomination nature conservation technologies. daily capacity of the unit for industrial waste pumping into subsoil
     beds achieves 340 m3. the plant achieved its rated capacity in september 2008.


        the target of the program developed at the omsk refinery is to change over
        to the production of environmentally friendly fuels in accordance with
        the requirements of the technical regulations on requirements to car
        and aviation petrol, diesel and marine fuel, jet engine fuel and residual fuel oil.

     due to production growth, the volume of on-site waste treatment more than doubled during the year (from 290 to 629
     thousand tons).

     restoration of oil-polluted territories
     in 2008 the rate of slime bins and oil-polluted land recovery was increased. in order to reduce the volume of damaged soil,
     the company implemented binless drilling methods on a number of fields in 2009.

     increasing associated gas recovery rate
     within continuous increase of environmental responsibility and economic efficiency gazprom neft elaborated and approved
     in 2008 a medium-term investment program (mtip) for increase of recovery and efficient utilization of associated petroleum
     gas (apg) for 2008–2010.

     the share of apg recovery at key production units of the company grew in 2008 by 11%, as compared to the previous year,
     up to 46.8%. 2009 forecast is 61.2%.

     total volume of investments within frame of the medium-term program amounts to rur 17.6 bn. of them:

     •o  ver rur 12 bn spent on construction of gas collecting networks and gas processing facilities;
     • about rur 5 bn spent on development of own generation;
     • about rur 600 mn spent on audit of existing apg resources, recovery of low-pressure gas, and organization of apg
        metering.

     actual financing of mtip in 2008 amounted to 106% of the plan. the medium-term programs, subject to their actualization
     in 2009, will allow achieving by 2011–2012 a 95% rate of apg recovery at jsc gazprom neft oil producing units.




        in 2008 gazpromneft-khantos put into operation a unique complex of drilling waste
        recycling by pumping them into the bed instead of filling slime bins. the ministry
        of natural resources of the russian federation distinguished it as the best
