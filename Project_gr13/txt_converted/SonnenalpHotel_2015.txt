     thank you for taking the time to read our bnnual sustainability report. as a member of the sonnenalp family, you
     can help us in our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint and preserve the natural beauty of this incredible valley we
     call home. we encourage you to share any ideas you may have to further our mission of being leaders in our industry
     when it comes to sustainable practices.

     rosana and johannes faessler
focus on green
the faessler family has been in the hospitality business for four
generations, starting nearly a century ago with a hotel in the
beautiful alpine setting of ofterschwang, bavaria, in germany.
drawn by the pristine natural environment of the colorado
rockies, the family fell in love with the area surrounding vail and
opened the sonnenalp hotel in vail in 1979. sonnenalp, which
means “sun on the mountains,” began with a respect and appreci-
ation for our wonderful mountain setting, something that remains
a core value at the sonnenalp today.
we are committed to protecting these resources by pursuing
practices and initiatives that help us protect the environment and
support the communities in which we live and work. we invite
you to join our efforts. together we can make a difference.
                                                                                            4poofobmq)pufmpxofs+pibooft'bfttmfs
