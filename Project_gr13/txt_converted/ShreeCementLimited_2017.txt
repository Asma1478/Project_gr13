overview

                            what immortalised bruce lee are not just his films or martial arts but his
                            philosophy. he is certainly admired by everyone as an ace martial artist
                            and a global action movie hero. but more importantly, the world also knows
                            him as a revered philosopher who was extremely well-read and as an




                                                                                                            style
                            evolved human being. this has helped his legacy outlast his films and
                            peers.

                            bruce lee developed - jeet kune do - his own martial arts form. the core
                            philosophical tenet behind “jeet kune do” was, "using no way as way,
                            having no limitation as limitation". this consisted of getting rid of the
                            formalised approach which bruce lee claimed was indicative of traditional
                            styles. he developed a system with an emphasis on "ingenuity,
                            perseverance, adaptability, efficiency and focus". he emphasised what he
                            called 'the style of no style'.

                            bruce lee's philosophy of 'the style of no style' finds relevance much
                            beyond the circles of martial arts. he propounded that not keeping oneself
                            bound by the dominant accepted beliefs/knowledge ultimately helps open
                            up opportunities, find innovative solutions and attain outcomes that
                            otherwise seem to be unattainable. it is this belief that we at shree cement
                            limited are inspired by.

                            at shree, we have our own effective and unique way of questioning status
                            quo, challenging current beliefs/practices and thereby creating newer
                            opportunities which are not visible to a cursory eye. we are in a perennial
                            search of knowledge and keep on asking ourselves, "can we come up with
                            a better way? can we attempt an output that no one would have yet dreamt
                            of?". of course, there are limitations at every step of way, but at shree our
                            resolute belief of overcoming all limitations has continually inspired us to
                            better our own benchmarks time and again.

                            more so, we remain focused and continually track developments to identify
                            risks and take actions to not only mitigate them but turn them into
                            opportunities. at shree, like bruce lee, we learn everyday from
                            everywhere and come up with our own ingenious solutions that intercept
                            the ever-changing future. be it solving critical problems or growing with
                            stakeholders, human resources, community and environment: shree has
                            always emerged a winner by coming up with its own way – a sustainable
                            and better way; a way that is emulated by others in the industry. clearly,
                            our style is of no style!
                                                                                                            no
                                                                                                            style
                                                              empty your mind, be formless. shapeless, like water.
                                                              if you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. you
                                                              put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. you
                                                              put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. now, water
                                                              can flow or it can crash. be water, my friend

                                                                                                              – bruce lee

                       if a mason says that he is putting bricks together, then that’s a normal
                       thing. if he says he is making a wall, that is also okay. but if he says that
                       he is making a temple, that would make things different and it would
                       mean that he is acting like an entrepreneur. that is how everybody works

           managing director’s
           outlook




                                 the term “science” is used today with a wide range of meanings,
                                 with sustained insistence of applying it to every branch of study or
                                 theory – the reason for this could be an attempt to satiate the need for
                                 vanity and maybe an effort towards ascribing precision and
                                 certainty to one's conclusion. often we come across statements
                                 attributing to the belief that “management is a science that can be
                                 used to achieve specific goals”. i would like to raise a pertinent
                                 question here. can “management” be termed as a science?

                                 at the core of every science is a scientific method, which is a
                                 process for experimentation that is used to explore observations and
                                 answer questions. this starts with an observation, forming a
                                 hypothesis (that possibly explains the observation) and then doing
                                 experiments to test the hypothesis with data by an iterative process.
                                 final outcome is a general theory that can then predict events with
                                 great precision. once a theory has been proved by a scientific
                                 method, it is regarded as an absolute truth applicable universally to
                                 predict the output irrespective of location or time. newton's laws of
                                 motion are as applicable in new delhi as they are in new york!

                                 can the same be said about management? management also
                                 involves application of scientific methods. it involves building cause
                                 and effect relationships, experimenting, applying logics and then
                                 making decisions. in this sense, management can be called as
                                 science. the difference is in terms of its applicability as general
                                 theory and as a universal truth. given the volatility, complexity and
                                 other factors in the operating environment, both internal and
                                 external, a standard 'fits all and works always' theory won't work for
                                 management. there will be little utility of such general theory as
                                 management models if they are not tested from time to time about
                                  their utility in the ever changing world and situations specific
                                     demands. management can be a science as long as it doesn't
                                       remain static and keeps evolving itself with the changing times
                                         and situations.

                                           at shree we duly respect, value and use the rigorous
                                            analysis and constant experimentation part of 'scientific
                                             method'. we however avoid falling into the trap of trying
                                              to enforce any fixed model or pattern or style of
                                               management into our operations and on our people.
                                                 we observe and analyse things to develop our
                                                   approach that is best suited as per the specific
                                                      requirement. our approach has to be dynamic
                                                         and constantly evolving with time, situation
                                                           and place. thus our management style is
                                                             a “style of no style”.

the underlying philosophy




                            style
                                    in a dynamic world,
                                    assimilation is a virtue.
                                    flowing water never grows
                                    stale. on the other hand,

                                    meaningless as they rely
                                    more on familiar routines,
                                    add unnecessary rituals
                                    and limit options. no style
                                    is a style in itself.

the underlying philosophy

      ingenuity




                     master's take: pinnacle of success demands innovation. a true master’s emphasizes on reinventing
                     oneself constantly through inventiveness and developing thoughts that question the accepted beliefs to
                     find better ways.
                     strategy in action at shree: shree believes in the power of collective thinking; a bottom-up approach to
                     problem-solving which has an unlimited scope and yield surprising outcomes that are benchmarks of
                     innovation for others. actions that aim to serve a purpose-innovation, this defines one and all at shree.
      perseverance




                     master's take: the master knows too well that challenges and obstacles are a part and parcel of life.
                     only perseverance helps an individual emerge victorious. a prerequisite is daily practice and a strong
                     will to push beyond limits. building from strength to strength, working towards the goals set.
                     strategy in action at shree: at shree, challenges/obstacles are welcome aspects of life. what sets the
                     team apart is its determination to pursue the goals and overcome all obstacles to achieve desired
                     outcomes. success of shree is in the determination and hard-work of its people who are driven by a zeal
                     to keep on attempting till success is attained.
     adaptability




                     master's take: opportunities unfold. they present themselves purely 'in the moment' not in the future
                     which is procrastination. those who live in the moment - the wise ones - are able to respond faster.
                     they are faster in adapting and less distracted by outside thoughts.
                     strategy in action at shree: shree believes opportunities are also created. by going beyond borrowed
                     concepts, by not adopting patterns and practices blindly. an open mind and insatiable curiosity help us
                     explore new paths. the idea of remaining adaptable, flexible and flowing is akin to mindfulness
                     practices; so very necessary to achieve peak performance.

efficiency
                  master's take: economy of motion entails using ‘efficiency’, ‘directness’ and ‘simplicity’, all of which help
                  attain results in the simplest and most economical way.
                  strategy in action at shree: shree believes in getting maximum output from minimum input of energy,
                  materials and time. current efficiency standards are continuously worked and improved upon to ensure
                  that our objective of working in the most economical manner is a never ending journey.




                 master's take: a single-minded approach towards goals sets a true seeker apart. the master too
                 inculcates self-discipline among his pupils which gets reflected in the performance. a regimen to remain fit
                 so as to perform up to one’s potential.
focus




                 strategy in action at shree: shree is growing across the country, however focus is not lost on maintaining
                 the same performance benchmarks at all sites. there is a sharp focus on not losing grip on performance
                 parameters due to geographical diversification. shree has always maintained its focus on financial health.
                 not withstanding the robust growth, the company has resisted the temptations to over-leverage its debt-
                 equity position.




                 master's take: the master believes that in order that people be happy in their work;
                 three things are needed:
people




                 •they must be for it (motivated) •they must not do too much of it (work-life balance)
                 •they must have a sense of success in it (ownership)
                 strategy in action at shree: employees at shree feel they are part of ‘shree family’. they are motivated to do
                 better everyday at their daily job. this is driven by the shree's way of caring for its people in such a way that
                 they are seen as co-owners rather than workers working for remuneration.
sustainability




                 master's take: the master knows that we humans are children of mother nature. it is only when mother
                 nature is respected; can her children remain healthy. respect for mother nature is everyone's first
                 responsibility.
                 strategy in action at shree: shree creates benchmarks by building systemic efficiency to pursue
                 sustainable growth. while efficiency gives financial gains in short term, in long term it helps shree
                 contribute its part in leaving a more sustainable world for future. shree believes in following a path of
                 sustainable growth so that the next generation is handed over a greener and more sustainable planet.

                            ingenuity



           illustrating the trait…
           ingenuity is either smartly deploying available solutions from across domain-areas or thinking out
           newer solutions in order to find a way forward. this calls for being alert to developments across
           sectors from time to time as well connecting the dots to find their application when facing a challenge
           in one's domain. constant questioning of current state is a pre-requisite for finding newer
           ways/solutions.
           shree is replete with examples of inventiveness. one such comes from the mines department. in one
           instance the topographical survey of mines was not practically possible to the extent desirable.
           spread over a vast area, local factors, uneven terrain, etc. were just some of the challenges. even if
           overcome, the time consumption and manpower deployment were other factors to be considered. all
           this still carried a risk of the outcome having fair a margin of error. this is when the team at shree
           decided to deploy unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) 'drone' technology. this first-of-its-kind-in-india
           survey was entirely planned by the team at shree; completed in just 3 days as against the alternative
           time requirement of two months. shree is probably the first indian cement company to have
           successfully used the 'aerial survey by drone' technology.

           systems. monitoring becomes more effective. technology
           makes process more efficient. human intervention is
           minimized and thus any likelihood of pilferages. shree has
           installed cba (cross belt analyser) on crusher belt feeding to
           limestone pile. in conventional technology, neutrons are
           generated through a radioactive material which is always
           active (emitting radiations) even during shutdown of cba.
           the cba installed at shree produces electrically activated
           neutrons. so whenever the crusher stops, it automatically
           stops. it automatically gets active at the time of analysis.
           what's more, there is no risk of radiation during maintenance.
           it gives real-time analysis of limestone feeding to pile as well
           as captures quality of 100% limestone passing through the
           belt (while in conventional system only samples are taken for
           analysis). due to this, trust on chemical results of limestone
           has improved. there is no involvement of human being in the
           process. the chances of errors or manipulations have been
           totally eliminated. decision making based on chemical
           analysis has also become easier. above all, the system of
           quality control has become more accountable. shree is
           amongst the first cement manufacturing company to adopt
           this technology in india at its mines.

           illustrating the trait…

           shree works with resolve towards setting tight time limits for its projects and realizing them ahead of
           schedules. a project is an activity where our main role is to plan, supervise and allocate resources.
           actual work on the ground is typically done by outsourced contractors and suppliers. this is a domain
           which has all the things that have the potential to go wrong causing project delays. accordingly, despite
           best of intent and efforts, given the interlinking nature of components (civil, mechanical, electrical,
           etc.) of a project and dependence of external agencies, failures and set-backs are bound to happen;
           leading to potential delay in project commissioning. yet, shree has not only completed all its projects
           on time, but has also improved its track record each time a project is executed. and, in the process, new
           benchmarks are created and world records are broken. obstacles do deter us, hurdles do hinder us and
           problems do galore. it is sheer determination and resolve of our people to “never give up” and “try one
           more time”, that makes us win over all such challenges. each time we overcome a challenge, our self-
           belief builds further and gives us the energy and motivation to overcome all the remaining obstacles to
           ensure we not only set-up our projects in world class benchmark time but also of world class quality.
           never say 'yes' to 'no'; is surely our core belief.

           finding root cause - finding solutions

           our raipur team was facing a problem of repetitive
           overheating and consequent melting of rotor leads (wires)
           of raw mill fan motor. each failure of rotor leads was
           causing 4-5 hours of breakdown of raw mill fan and
           complete raw mill circuit as also repetitive expenditure
           towards lead replacement.
           this was brought to the notice of oem supplier and their
           service engineer visited the plant twice but the root cause of
           the repetitive failure of rotor flexible leads could not be
           identified. experts from oem conveyed that since the likely
           problem area in equipment was very confined it was not
           possible to perform internal inspection, and the motor shall
           have to be sent to oem factory for dismantling so as to
           identify the root cause of rotor leads failure. this was not a
           practical option as it was expected that the oem may keep the
           critical component with him for long and still not be able to
           identify the fault.
           not satisfied with the oem's approach, our team started a
           detailed analysis wherein all the different factors that could
           lead to melting of rotor leads were controlled one by one to
           see if they could identify the root cause by a process of
           elimination of potential factors. despite best efforts they
           could still not identify the problem.
           nevertheless our people were not disheartened and the next
           time when the motor tripped due to same problem, engineers
           in the team decided to make a video (using a mobile) of the
           internal sections of the confined areas of the equipment that
           could not be manually inspected. they could then notice that
           'brazings' between rotor stud & slip-ring had failed at some
           points and this was causing overheating. once the problem
           was identified our team performed proper brazing between
           rotor stud & slip-ring before it was re-started. since then the
           motor has been operating without failure. not giving up
           despite intermittent challenges helped our team to come out
           with an enduring solution to the problem at hand.

           illustrating the trait…

           flexibility is a natural outcome when one has his eyes fixed so hard on the goal that he is not ready to be
           beaten down by the difficulties on the path to his goal.
           being on-time, every time, is a virtue at shree. an organisation that takes immense pride in its focus on
           'freezing the roadmap' to project execution can face dilemma if it were to change its course or face
           project delay. not shree.
           the coal mill erection work was on and the time required for setting up its civil structure was likely to
           take time that had the risk of delaying the project. while the obvious solution was to expedite the civil
           work but given the nature of civil construction requirement; the minimum time required would have still
           been more than the time that was available for overall project commissioning. evaluating the situation
           the team came up with an alternate approach of converting sections of civil structure with steel
           fabrication structure which could save time. evaluating the options the case was presented to seniors
           and decision was taken to switch some sections from civil structure to steel structure. end result was
           that the coal mill section got commissioned on time. the teams were thus not blinded by the
           conventional way they were required to work and were flexible to alter their approach as was required
           by the situation.
           adaptability at shree also recognises no compromise with values such as quality, products, etc. yet,
           shree always views the developments with an open mind and receptive to mid-course corrections. this
           adaptability is a hallmark of shree.

           illustrating the trait…


           shree takes pride in the performance benchmarks it has sets in all areas of its operations. this has
           been possible only because of an unwavering commitment to our passion for efficiency in everything
           we do. this in turn pushes us to the top spot in terms of lowest cost of production.
           how much shree values efficiency is illustrated in an example. an excavator procured from a global
           leader was tagged with an operating life of 13,000 hours after which a major overhaul was needed. our
           mines team worked on various aspects of its operation and maintenance activities including
           continuous monitoring of its health. result is that they have been able to continuously operate the
           excavator for more than 41,000 hours against 13,000 hours time limit of supplier without requiring an
           overhaul. the machine's qualitative output and fuel efficiency is still at optimum level. even the
           equipment supplier has appreciated the performance benchmark set by our team.

           the limitation of no limitation
           in most martial arts forms unusual display of action is at play. this activity without focus and adaptability is nothing but wastage
           of moves by a player; in turn leading to loss of energy and time. in jkd, the emphasis is strongly on conserving every move to
           deliver precise punch or kick. for a fighter, this economy is a function of focus and flexibility. economy is akin to competency that

minimum input. this includes cutting or avoiding wastes,
increasing productivity and optimal utilization of resources
(man, machine, materials). passion for efficiency requires
organization to turn their isolated, uni-direction efforts and
initiatives into a systemic efficiency. systemic efficiency
seeks to extend the concept of efficiency to a level where the
process of getting more out of less is continuous one and
runs across the breadth of an organisation. real sustainable
gains are assured only if systemic efficiency is weaved into
the cultural fabric of the organization. such systemic
efficiency then gets converted into an economic advantage
that is sustainable and leads to competitive leadership.
efficiency has two levers. first is maximizing output. getting
more achieved than earlier! second is minimizing input. using
less (men, machine, material, time) than before! to move

    for people at shree, the process
    of improving the input to output
    ratio is woven into a never
    ending journey.
either of the two levers; the starting point is to believe that our
current state is not the best and it can be improved. the
people will then certainly work on finding innovative ways and
novel ideas to create more value. next is the faith and
trust of the leadership to allow people to nurture their ideas,
try and attempt them, encourage them even if results
may not be along expected lines. the incessant spree of
regular advancements and perfections will be a sure shot
outcome.
shree has embedded this culture of efficiency all across its
operations. for people at shree, the process of improving the
input to output ratio is woven into a never ending journey.
each one of them wears the hat of an entrepreneur and thus is
perpetually motivated to bring about incremental change from
the present levels for better. they clearly know that what was
their best yesterday has to be improved today, and what has
become best today must be further improved tomorrow.
in today's hyper competitive business environment if we do-
not take the pro-active steps to be the leader in efficiency,
marketplace may evolve and we may soon lose our cost
leadership due to steps of our competitors. passion for
efficiency thus has to be sustained as a perpetual milestone.
shree has exactly taken it in its right earnest. as a result,
shree has earned the distinction of being one of the lowest
cost producer in the industry.

           illustrating the trait…


           with the focus firmly on achieving its vision, shree believes in optimizing performance, over and over
           again. in a cyclical industry like cement, the key to remain competitive is to focus on cost optimization.
           at shree, focused attention is given to everything one is doing. people don't accept this based on
           perceptions. instead, thorough analysis is done. meticulous plans are made. action oriented efforts
           are carried out by the teams to study and find out the ways for betterment. one such area is energy and
           fuel consumption which forms a major chunk of the cost of production. people at shree have made
           relentless efforts to bring down their consumption. today, shree has the lowest power and fuel
           consumption levels in terms of per ton of cement and clinker production in the industry.


           the choice of no choice
           in a bout of any martial arts, a fraction of a second decides the direction of the event; sealing the fate of a fight forever. this
           requires high focus on the opponent and his moves. similarly a singular focus is the most important thing in business. whether it
           is a routine activity like operating a machine or undertaking a maintenance job or taking a strategic decision, people tend to
           become distracted and scattered, in both decision making and its execution. they try to move in too many directions at the same
           time. this lack of focus ends up causing a lack of real movement for the business in any one particular direction which can
           ultimately lead to failure.

           execution team knows exactly what is to be achieved in a day
           and plan ahead for the next. there is another advantage of this
           focused approach. the schedules are tight but the pressure
           on the team is nil. and above all, everyone is not only aligned
           but also in control of the situation. no wonder, shree has
           bettered its own score with each successive project!

           focus on quantifying in value equivalent

           at shree, there is focus on achieving 'systemic efficiency.'
           one can argue there are targets for each and every function in
           every company, and efficiency parameters defined with
           enough checks and balances in place. however, shree has
           moved a notch up by moving from 'targets' driven approach
           to any parameter's 'value equivalent' terms. the notional loss
           for not achieving the efficiency parameter is calculated and
           shared with respective department. the idea is to bring in
           prudence in the system as only awareness can cultivate
           responsibility. for instance, monitoring of 'truck waiting
           time' at shree. company has set an internal benchmark of
           four hours for a truck to do its round at shree so that it hits the
           road at the earliest to reach its destination. being a good
           paymaster with efficient systems, there are many players
           who have been offering services to shree at competitive
           prices. yet, shree works out the 'value equivalent' (notional)
           loss of a truck staying on campus beyond the stipulated time.
           this is just to reinforce the fact that focus is not lost.
           company believes no vendor will bear the cost of extra
           waiting and that sooner or later a vendor structures
           company's systemic inefficiency into its offered pricing
           which has direct impact on company's freight costs. also,
           this helps the company work towards and demand 'dynamic
           pricing' in its favour from the vendors.

           happy and motivated employees create a happy and robust eco-system around a company. in the 'man,
           machine and material' mix, man is always on top of the pyramid, bringing out the best in all the three in
           the mix. shree believes in the power of its people. this belief has only strengthened over time with
           some of the most amazing solutions coming from our highly committed people. people at shree relish
           challenging assignments rather than business as usual and status quo.
           the challenge for the organisation lies in institutionalising this process of idea generation from all
           quarters so that they are not limited to an occasional trickle but come out continuously. thus to
           motivate employees to innovate in their domain and think out of the box, shree has set-up a reward and
           recognition program for celebrating innovation. all employees are free to submit innovative ideas
           implemented by them in an internal system and the same is reviewed by a cross-functional group of
           leaders. based on the nature of innovation implemented, the teams that implemented these ideas are
           publically appreciated and rewarded at company-wide celebrations held on the republic day and the
           independence day. the idea is to make our people feel that their innovations and idea generation is
           appreciated by company and the organisation is willing to trust them by supporting them in novel ideas
           generated by them.

           the structure of no structure
           people are not only an asset of an organization. they are the organization. an organization's reputation - good or bad - for being
           innovative, aggressive, slow, ethical, or values-driven, etc. is actually a reflection on the collective traits of the people it nurtures,

      fair value techniques:
      the fair value of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
      a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
      a)   fair value of cash and short term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, current loans, other current ﬁnancial assets, short
           term borrowings and other current ﬁnancial liabilities approximate to their carrying amount largely due to the short term
           maturities of these instruments.
      b)   long term ﬁxed rate and variable rate receivables / borrowings are evaluated by the company based on parameters such as
           interest rate, speciﬁc country risk factors, credit risk and other risk characteristics. fair value of variable interest rate borrowings
           approximates their carrying values. for ﬁxed interest rate borrowings fair value is determined by using discounted cash flow
           (dcf) method using discount rate that reﬂects the issuer’s borrowings rate. risk of non-performance for the company is
           considered to be insigniﬁcant in valuation.

     c)   the fair value of derivatives are estimated by using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on readily
          observable market parameters basis contractual terms, period to maturity and market parameters such as interest rates,
          foreign exchange rates and volatility. these models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do
          not require signiﬁcant judgement and inputs thereto are readily observable from actively quoted market prices. management
          has evaluated the credit and non-performance risks associated with its derivatives counterparties and believe them to be
          insigniﬁcant and not warranting a credit adjustment.
     fair value hierarchy
     the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of company’s asset and liabilities grouped into level 1 to level 3
     as described below:
     quoted prices / published net asset value (nav) in an active markets (level 1): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets that are
     measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and ﬁnancial instruments like
     mutual funds for which nav is published by mutual funds. this category consists mutual fund investments.
     valuation techniques with observable inputs (level 2): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, measured using
     inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
     indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
     valuation techniques with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs (level 3): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
     measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). fair values are determined in whole
     or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market
     transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

       during the year ended 31.03.2017 and 31.03.2016, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements
       and no transfer into and out of level 3 fair value measurements. there is no transaction/balance under level 3.
       the fair values of the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities included in the level 2 categories above have been determined in
       accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash ﬂow analysis, with the most signiﬁcant inputs being
       the discount rate that reﬂects the credit risk of counterparties. following table describes the valuation techniques used and key
       inputs to valuation for level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 31.03.2017, 31.03.2016 and 01.07.2015, respectively:

48. financial risk management objectives and policies
      the company’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. the
      main purpose of these ﬁnancial liabilities is to manage ﬁnances for the company’s operations. the company has loans, trade and
      other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arrive directly from its operations. the company also holds fair value
      through proﬁt or loss investments and enters into derivative transactions.
      the company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.




                                                                                                                annual report 2016-17 | 197

notes forming part of financial statements




      the company manages market risk through a treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the
      entire process of market risk management. the treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which
      are approved by senior management and the audit and risk management committee. the activities of this department include
      management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies and ensuring
      compliance with market risk limits and policies.
      the board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below:
      market risk and sensitivity
      market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instruments will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market
      prices. market risk comprises two types of risk: currency rate risk and interest rate risk. financial instruments aﬀected by market risk
      include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivatives ﬁnancial instruments. foreign currency risk is the risk that the
      fair value or future cash ﬂows of ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. interest rate risk is
      the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates. this
      is based on the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held as at 31.03.2017 and 31.03.2016.
      the sensitivity analyses excludes the impact of movement in market variables on the carrying value of post-employment beneﬁt
      obligations, provisions and on non-ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. the sensitivity of the relevant statement of proﬁt and loss item is the
      eﬀect of the assumed changes in respective market rates. the company’s activities exposes it to a variety of ﬁnancial risk including the
      eﬀect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the company uses derivatives ﬁnancial instruments such as
      foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps of varying maturity depending upon the underlying
      contract and risk management strategy to manage its exposures to foreign exchange ﬂuctuation and interest rates.
      interest rate risk and sensitivity
      the company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the long term debt obligations and buyer’s
      credit obligations with ﬂoating interest rates.
      the company’s policy is to manage its ﬂoating interest rate loans and borrowings by entering into interest rate swaps, in which the
      company agrees to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the diﬀerence between ﬁxed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by
      reference to an agreed upon principal amount.
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible changes in interest rates on that portion of loans and
      borrowings aﬀected, aﬅer the impact of hedge accounting. with all other variables held constant, the company’s proﬁt before tax is
      aﬀected through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings, as follows:
                                                                                                                            (` in crore)

                                                                                in basis points

                                                                                        -50                              0.04

      the assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment.
      foreign currency risk and sensitivity
      the company has obtained foreign currency loans and has foreign currency payables for supply of fuel, raw material and equipment
      and is therefore, exposed to foreign exchange risk. the company uses cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to
      eliminate the currency exposures.
      the impact on proﬁt before tax is due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including non- designated foreign
      currency derivatives.
      the following tables demonstrates the sensitivity in the usd, jpy, euro and gbp to the indian rupee with all other variable held
      constant.

       credit risk
       credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a ﬁnancial instruments or customer contract, leading to a
       ﬁnancial loss. the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing
       activities including deposits with banks, mutual funds and ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments.
       trade receivables
       the company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. the company considers factors such as credit track record in
       the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers. the company monitors the payment track record of the
       customers. outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. the company evaluates the concentration of risk with
       respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdiction and industries and operate in largely
       independent markets. the company has also taken advances and security deposits from its customers which mitigate the credit risk
       to an extent.
       the ageing of trade receivables are as below:

         financial instruments and cash deposits
         the company considers factors such as track record, size of the institution, market reputation and service standards to select the
         banks with which balances and deposits are maintained. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties.
         the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet is ` 4,824.76 crore as at 31.03.2017 and ` 3,822.21
         crore as at 31.03.2016, which is the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, investments (other than
         equity investments in subsidiary), trade receivables, loans and other ﬁnancial assets.
         liquidity risk
         liquidity risk is the risk that the company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without
         incurring unacceptable losses.
         the company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. this tool considers the maturity of both
         its ﬁnancial investments and ﬁnancial assets (i.e. trade receivables, other ﬁnancial assets) and projected cash ﬂows from operations.
         the company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of working capital
         loans, letter of credit facility, bank loans and credit purchases.
         the table below provides undiscounted cash ﬂows towards non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities and net-settled derivative ﬁnancial
         liabilities into relevant maturity based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date:

        1. basis of preparation
        these ﬁnancial statements, for the year ended 31.03.2017, are the company's ﬁrst ind-as financial statements. for periods up to
        and including the year ended 31.03.2016, the company prepared its ﬁnancial statements in accordance with accounting standards
        notiﬁed under section 133 of the companies act, 2013, read together with para 7 of the companies (accounts) rules, 2014 (indian
        gaap).
        accordingly, the company has prepared ﬁnancial statements which comply with ind-as applicable for periods ending on 31.03.2017,
        together with the restated comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31.03.2016, as described in the signiﬁcant
        accounting policies and basis of preparation. in preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the company's opening balance sheet was
        prepared as at 01.07.2015 (i.e. transition date opening balance as at 01.07.2015), the company's date of transition to ind-as. this
        note explains the principal adjustments made by the company in restating its indian gaap ﬁnancial statement, including the balance
        sheet as at 01.07.2015 and the ﬁnancial statements as at and for the period ended 31.03.2016.

      2. exemptions applied
      ind as 101- first time adoption of indian accounting standards allows ﬁrst time adopters certain optional exemptions from the
      retrospective application of requirements under ind as. the company has availed the beneﬁt of and applied the following
      exemptions:
      a)   ind as 103 business combinations has not been applied to acquisition of cement grinding unit, which are considered business
           under ind as that occurred before 01.07.2015. use of this exemption means that the indian gaap carrying amounts of assets
           and liabilities, that are required to be recognized under ind as, is their deemed cost at the date of acquisition. aﬅer the date of
           acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective ind as. assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under
           ind as are excluded from the opening ind as balance sheet. the company did not recognize or exclude any previously recognized
           amounts as a result of ind as recognition requirement except goodwill which was adjusted as per ind as 101.
      b) carrying value of all property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as recognized in previous indian gaap ﬁnancial is
           recognized as deemed cost at the transition date under ind as.
      c)   the company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, such as cross currency and interest rate swaps, to hedge its foreign currency
           and interest rate risk. under indian gaap, there is no mandatory standard that deals comprehensively with hedge accounting,
           which has resulted in the adoption of varying practices. the company has designated various economic hedges and applied
           economic hedge accounting principles to avoid proﬁt or loss mismatch. all the hedges designated under indian gaap also
           qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ind as 109 on the transition date. accordingly, the company has applied the
           hedge accounting in accordance with ind as 109 and gain/loss are recorded in other comprehensive income.
      3. estimates
      the estimates at 01.07.2015 and 31.03.2016 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with indian gaap
      (aﬅer adjustments to reﬂect any diﬀerences in accounting policies).

      9.    footnotes to the reconciliation of equity as at 01.07.2015 and 31.03.2016 and proﬁt or loss for the nine months
            period ended 31.03.2016:
      a)    financial assets at amortized cost
            under indian gaap, the company accounted for long term investments in bonds and debentures as investments measured at
            cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. under ind as, the company has designated
            these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost. at the date of transition to ind as, diﬀerence between
            amortized cost and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings. subsequent to the date of
            transition to ind as, interest income has been recognized based on eir method.
      b)    financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss (fvtpl)
            under indian gaap, the company accounted for long term investments in preference shares and mutual funds as investments
            measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments and current investments at
            lower of cost or market value. under ind as, the company has designated these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at fair
            value through proﬁt or loss. ind as requires that investment designated at fvtpl, are measured at fair value. at the date of
            transition to ind as, diﬀerence between fair value and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings.
            subsequent to the date of transition to ind as, fair value gain or loss has been recognized to statement of proﬁt and loss.
      c)    derivative financial instruments
            the fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps is recognized under ind as. under indian gaap, there is no mandatory
            standard that deals with accounting of swaps, hence the same was not recognized. the swaps, which were designated as hedging
            instruments under indian gaap, have been designated as at the date of transition to ind as as hedging instruments in a cash ﬂow
            hedge. the corresponding adjustments have been recognized as a separate component of equity, under the eﬀective portion of
            cash ﬂow hedge reserve.
      d)    deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities
            both under indian gaap and ind as, the company recognized costs related to post employment deﬁned beneﬁt plan on an
            actuarial basis. under indian gaap, the entire costs, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to statement of proﬁt and
            loss. under ind as, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains or losses, the eﬀect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts
            included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net
            interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability) are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit
            to retained earnings through other comprehensive income. thus, the employee beneﬁt cost is increased by ` 5.32 crore and
            remeasurement gain on deﬁned beneﬁt plan has been recognized in the other comprehensive income, net of tax.
      e)    provisions
            under indian gaap, the company has accounted for provisions, including long term provisions, at the undiscounted amount. in
            contrast, ind as 37 requires that where the eﬀect of time value of money is material, the amount of provision should be the
            present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. the discount rate(s) should not reﬂect risk for
            which future cash ﬂow estimates have been adjusted. ind as 37 also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying
            amount of a provision increases in each period to reﬂect the passage of time. this increase is recognized as borrowing cost. this
            led to a decrease in the provision for mines reclamation expenses on the date of transition by ` 12.37 crore and which was
            adjusted to retained earnings.

      f)   deferred tax
           indian gaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach, which focuses on diﬀerences between
           taxable proﬁts and accounting proﬁts for the period. ind as 12-income taxes requires entities to account for deferred taxes
           using the balance sheet approach, which focuses on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amount of asset or liability in
           the balance sheet and its corresponding tax base. the application of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred
           tax on new temporary diﬀerences which was not required under indian gaap.
           in addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary diﬀerences. according to the accounting policies, the
           company has to account for such diﬀerences. deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying
           transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity.
           mat credit entitlement is in the nature of deferred tax under ind as. hence on transition to ind as mat credit entitlement of
           ` 95.87 crore as on 01.07.2015 and ` 107.40 crore as on 31.03.2016 has been grouped under deferred tax assets from current
           tax assets.
      g)   government grants
           under indian gaap, government grants in the nature of promoter's contribution are recognized to capital reserve. under ind as,
           all government grants has to be recognized to the statement of proﬁt and loss. accordingly, government grants recognized to
           the statement of proﬁt and loss. further, the government grants credited to capital reserve under erstwhile indian gaap have
           also been reclassiﬁed to retained earnings as per ind as 101 - first time adoption of indian accounting standards.
      h)   sale of goods
           under indian gaap, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. however, under ind as, sale of goods includes excise duty.
           excise duty on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly, sale of goods under
           ind as for the nine months ended 31.03.2016 has increased by ` 676.32 crore.
           under ind as cash discount and other sale incentives are required to be netted oﬀ from sale of products which was accounted as
           expenses under indian gaap. hence sale of products is decreased by `116.72 crore for the period ended 31.03.2016.
           under ind as when goods or services are exchanged or swapped for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value, the
           exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue. thus sale of products and cost of material consumed has
           been decreased by ` 21.20 crore for the period ended 31.03.2016.
      i)   statement of cash flows
           the impact of transition from indian gaap to ind as on the statement of cash flows is due to various reclassiﬁcation
           adjustments recorded under ind as in balance sheet, statement of proﬁt and loss and diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of cash and
           cash equivalents in ind as and indian gaap.
      j)   borrowings
           under indian gaap, transaction costs incurred in connection with borrowings are charged upfront to statement of proﬁt and
           loss for the period/year. under ind as, transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of ﬁnancial liability and
           charged to statement of proﬁt and loss using eﬀective interest method.
      k)   other comprehensive income
           under indian gaap, the company has not presented other comprehensive income (oci) separately. hence it has reconciled
           indian gaap proﬁt or loss to proﬁt or loss as per ind as. further, indian gaap proﬁt or loss is reconciled to total comprehensive
           income as per ind as.
      l)   proposed dividend and tax on proposed dividend
           under indian gaap, proposed dividends including tax on proposed dividend are recognized as liability in the period to which they
           relate, irrespective of the approval by shareholders. under ind as, proposed dividend is recognized as a liability in the period in
           which it is declared by the company (when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid. therefore, the proposed
           dividend and tax on proposed dividend of ` 58.70 crore as on 01.07.2015 has been derecognized and recognized in 2015-16 on
           approval by shareholders and payment.

56. previous year ﬁgures have been regrouped and rearranged wherever necessary.

      fair value techniques:
      the fair value of the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer
      a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
      the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
      a)    fair value of cash and short term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, current loans, other current ﬁnancial assets, short
            term borrowings and other current ﬁnancial liabilities approximate to their carrying amount largely due to the short term
            maturities of these instruments.
      b)    long term ﬁxed rate and variable rate receivables / borrowings are evaluated by the company based on parameters such as
            interest rate, speciﬁc country risk factors, credit risk and other risk characteristics. fair value of variable interest rate
            borrowings approximates their carrying values. for ﬁxed interest rate borrowings fair value is determined by using discounted
            cash flow (dcf) method using discount rate that reﬂects the issuer’s borrowings rate. risk of non-performance for the company
            is considered to be insigniﬁcant in valuation.

     c)   the fair value of derivatives are estimated by using pricing models, where the inputs to those models are based on readily
          observable market parameters basis contractual terms, period to maturity and market parameters such as interest rates,
          foreign exchange rates and volatility. these models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do
          not require signiﬁcant judgement and inputs thereto are readily observable from actively quoted market prices. management
          has evaluated the credit and non-performance risks associated with its derivatives counterparties and believe them to be
          insigniﬁcant and not warranting a credit adjustment.
     fair value hierarchy:
     the following table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of company’s asset and liabilities grouped into level 1 to level 3
     as described below:
     quoted prices / published net asset value (nav) in an active markets (level 1): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets that are
     measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and ﬁnancial instruments like
     mutual funds for which nav is published by mutual funds. this category consists mutual fund investments.
     valuation techniques with observable inputs (level 2): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, measured using
     inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or
     indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
     valuation techniques with signiﬁcant unobservable inputs (level 3): this level of hierarchy includes ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
     measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs). fair values are determined in whole
     or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market
     transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

      during the year ended 31.03.2017 and 31.03.2016, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and
      no transfer into and out of level 3 fair value measurements. there is no transaction/balance under level 3.
      the fair values of the ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities included in the level 2 categories above have been determined in
      accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on a discounted cash ﬂow analysis, with the most signiﬁcant inputs being
      the discount rate that reﬂects the credit risk of counterparties. following table describes the valuation techniques used and key
      inputs to valuation for level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as at 31.03.2017, 31.03.2016 and 01.07.2015, respectively:

49. financial risk management objectives and policies
      the company’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. the
      main purpose of these ﬁnancial liabilities is to manage ﬁnances for the company’s operations. the company has loans, trade and
      other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arrive directly from its operations. the company also holds fair value
      through proﬁt or loss investments and enters into derivative transactions.




                                                                                                                annual report 2016-17 | 253

notes forming part of consolidated financial statements




      the company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
      the company manages market risk through a treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the
      entire process of market risk management. the treasury department recommends risk management objectives and policies, which
      are approved by senior management and the audit and risk management committee. the activities of this department include
      management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies and ensuring
      compliance with market risk limits and policies.
      the board of directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below:
      market risk and sensitivity
      market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instruments will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market
      prices. market risk comprises two types of risk: currency rate risk and interest rate risk. financial instruments aﬀected by market risk
      include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments and derivatives ﬁnancial instruments. foreign currency risk is the risk that the
      fair value or future cash ﬂows of ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. interest rate risk is
      the risk that the fair value or future cash ﬂows of a ﬁnancial instrument will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates. this
      is based on the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held as at 31.03.2017 and 31.03.2016.
      the sensitivity analyses excludes the impact of movement in market variables on the carrying value of post-employment beneﬁt
      obligations, provisions and on non-ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. the sensitivity of the relevant statement of proﬁt and loss item is the
      eﬀect of the assumed changes in respective market rates. the company’s activities exposes it to a variety of ﬁnancial risk including the
      eﬀect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the company uses derivatives ﬁnancial instruments such as
      foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps of varying maturity depending upon the underlying
      contract and risk management strategy to manage its exposures to foreign exchange ﬂuctuation and interest rates.
      interest rate risk and sensitivity
      the company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the long term debt obligations and buyer’s
      credit obligations with ﬂoating interest rates.
      the company’s policy is to manage its ﬂoating interest rate loans and borrowings by entering into interest rate swaps, in which the
      company agrees to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, the diﬀerence between ﬁxed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by
      reference to an agreed upon principal amount.
      the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible changes in interest rates on that portion of loans and
      borrowings aﬀected, aﬅer the impact of hedge accounting. with all other variables held constant, the company’s proﬁt before tax is
      aﬀected through the impact on ﬂoating rate borrowings, as follows:
                                                                                                                                     (` in crore)

                                                                                  in basis points

      the assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the currently observable market environment.
      foreign currency risk and sensitivity
      the company has obtained foreign currency loans and has foreign currency payables for supply of fuel, raw material and equipment
      and is therefore, exposed to foreign exchange risk. the company uses cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts to
      eliminate the currency exposures.
      the impact on proﬁt before tax is due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including non-designated foreign
      currency derivatives.
      the following tables demonstrates the sensitivity in the usd, jpy, euro and gbp to the indian rupee with all other variable held
      constant.

       credit risk
       credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not meet its obligation under a ﬁnancial instruments or customer contract, leading to a
       ﬁnancial loss. the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its investing
       activities including deposits with banks, mutual funds and ﬁnancial institutions and other ﬁnancial instruments.
       trade receivables
       the company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. the company considers factors such as credit track record in
       the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers. the company monitors the payment track record of the
       customers. outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. the company evaluates the concentration of risk with
       respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several jurisdiction and industries and operate in largely
       independent markets. the company has also taken advances and security deposits from its customers which mitigate the credit risk
       to an extent.
       the ageing of trade receivables are as below:

         financial instruments and cash deposits
         the company considers factors such as track record, size of the institution, market reputation and service standards to select the
         banks with which balances and deposits are maintained. investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties.
         the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet is ` 4,824.88 crore as at 31.03.2017 and
         ` 3,822.24 crore as at 31.03.2016, which is the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances, investments,
         trade receivables, loans and other ﬁnancial assets.
         liquidity risk
         liquidity risk is the risk that the company may not be able to meet its present and future cash and collateral obligations without
         incurring unacceptable losses.
         the company monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. this tool considers the maturity of both
         its ﬁnancial investments and ﬁnancial assets (i.e. trade receivables, other ﬁnancial assets) and projected cash ﬂows from operations.
         the company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of working capital
         loans, letter of credit facility, bank loans and credit purchases.
         the table below provides undiscounted cash ﬂows towards non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities and net-settled derivative ﬁnancial
         liabilities into relevant maturity based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date:

58. first time adoption of ind as
       1. basis of preparation
       these consolidated ﬁnancial statements, for the year ended 31.03.2017, are the company's ﬁrst ind-as financial statements. for
       periods up to and including the year ended 31.03.2016, the company prepared its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance
       with accounting standards notiﬁed under section 133 of the companies act, 2013, read together with para 7 of the companies
       (accounts) rules, 2014 (indian gaap).
       accordingly, the company has prepared consolidated ﬁnancial statements which comply with ind-as applicable for periods ending on
       31.03.2017, together with the restated comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31.03.2016, as described in the
       signiﬁcant accounting policies and basis of preparation. in preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the company's opening

     balance sheet was prepared as at 01.07.2015 (i.e. transition date opening balance as at 01.07.2015), the company's date of
     transition to ind-as. this note explains the principal adjustments made by the company in restating its indian gaap consolidated
     ﬁnancial statement, including the consolidated balance sheet as at 01.07.2015 and the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at and
     for the period ended 31.03.2016.
     2. exemptions applied
     ind as 101- first time adoption of indian accounting standards allows ﬁrst time adopters certain optional exemptions from the
     retrospective application of requirements under ind as. the company has availed the beneﬁt of and applied the following
     exemptions:
     a)    ind as 103 business combinations has not been applied to acquisition of cement grinding unit, which are considered business
           under ind as that occurred before 01.07.2015. use of this exemption means that the indian gaap carrying amounts of assets
           and liabilities, that are required to be recognized under ind as, is their deemed cost at the date of acquisition. aﬅer the date of
           acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective ind as. assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under
           ind as are excluded from the opening ind as balance sheet. the company did not recognize or exclude any previously recognized
           amounts as a result of ind as recognition requirement except goodwill which was adjusted as per ind as 101.
     b) carrying value of all property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as recognized in previous indian gaap ﬁnancial is
           recognized as deemed cost at the transition date under ind as.
     c)    the company uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, such as cross currency and interest rate swaps, to hedge its foreign currency
           and interest rate risk. under indian gaap, there is no mandatory standard that deals comprehensively with hedge accounting,
           which has resulted in the adoption of varying practices. the company has designated various economic hedges and applied
           economic hedge accounting principles to avoid proﬁt or loss mismatch. all the hedges designated under indian gaap also
           qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ind as 109 on the transition date. accordingly, the company has applied the
           hedge accounting in accordance with ind as 109 and gain/loss are recorded in other comprehensive income.
     3. estimates
           the estimates at 01.07.2015 and 31.03.2016 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with indian
           gaap (aﬅer adjustments to reﬂect any diﬀerences in accounting policies).

     9.   footnotes to the reconciliation of equity as at 01.07.2015 and 31.03.2016 and proﬁt or loss for the nine months
          period ended 31.03.2016:
     a)   financial assets at amortized cost
          under indian gaap, the company accounted for long term investments in bonds and debentures as investments measured at
          cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. under ind as, the company has designated
          these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost. at the date of transition to ind as, diﬀerence between
          amortized cost and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings. subsequent to the date of
          transition to ind as, interest income has been recognized based on eir method.
     b)   financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss (fvtpl)
          under indian gaap, the company accounted for long term investments in preference shares and mutual funds as investments
          measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments and current investments at
          lower of cost or market value. under ind as, the company has designated these investments as ﬁnancial assets measured at fair
          value through proﬁt or loss. ind as requires that investment designated at fvtpl, are measured at fair value. at the date of
          transition to ind as, diﬀerence between fair value and the indian gaap carrying value has been recognized in retained earnings.
          subsequent to the date of transition to ind as, fair value gain or loss has been recognized to statement of proﬁt and loss.
     c)   derivative financial instruments
          the fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps is recognized under ind as. under indian gaap, there is no mandatory
          standard that deals with accounting of swaps, hence the same was not recognized. the swaps, which were designated as hedging
          instruments under indian gaap, have been designated as at the date of transition to ind as as hedging instruments in a cash ﬂow
          hedge. the corresponding adjustments have been recognized as a separate component of equity, under the eﬀective portion of
          cash ﬂow hedge reserve.
     d)   deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities
          both under indian gaap and ind as, the company recognized costs related to post employment deﬁned beneﬁt plan on an
          actuarial basis. under indian gaap, the entire costs, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to statement of proﬁt and
          loss. under ind as, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains or losses, the eﬀect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts
          included in net interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net
          interest on the net deﬁned beneﬁt liability) are recognized immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit
          to retained earnings through other comprehensive income. thus, the employee beneﬁt cost is increased by ` 5.32 crore and
          remeasurement gain on deﬁned beneﬁt plan has been recognized in the other comprehensive income, net of tax.
     e)   provisions
          under indian gaap, the company has accounted for provisions, including long term provisions, at the undiscounted amount. in
          contrast, ind as 37 requires that where the eﬀect of time value of money is material, the amount of provision should be the
          present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. the discount rate(s) should not reﬂect risk for
          which future cash ﬂow estimates have been adjusted. ind as 37 also provides that where discounting is used, the carrying
          amount of a provision increases in each period to reﬂect the passage of time. this increase is recognized as borrowing cost. this
          led to a decrease in the provision for mines reclamation expenses on the date of transition by ` 12.37crore and which was
          adjusted to retained earnings.



                                                                                                                 annual report 2016-17 | 263

      f)    deferred tax
            indian gaap requires deferred tax accounting using the income statement approach, which focuses on diﬀerences between
            taxable proﬁts and accounting proﬁts for the period. ind as 12-income taxes requires entities to account for deferred taxes
            using the balance sheet approach, which focuses on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amount of asset or liability in
            the balance sheet and its corresponding tax base. the application of ind as 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred
            tax on new temporary diﬀerences which was not required under indian gaap.
            in addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary diﬀerences. according to the accounting policies, the
            company has to account for such diﬀerences. deferred tax adjustments are recognized in correlation to the underlying
            transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity.
            mat credit entitlement is in the nature of deferred tax under ind as. hence on transition to ind as mat credit entitlement of
            ` 95.87 crore as on 01.07.2015 and ` 107.40 crore as on 31.03.2016 has been grouped under deferred tax assets from current
            tax assets.
      g)    government grants
            under indian gaap, government grants in the nature of promoter's contribution are recognized to capital reserve. under ind as,
            all government grants has to be recognized to the statement of proﬁt and loss. accordingly, government grants recognized to
            the statement of proﬁt and loss. further, the government grants credited to capital reserve under erstwhile indian gaap have
            also been reclassiﬁed to retained earnings as per ind as 101 - first time adoption of indian accounting standards.
      h)    sale of goods
            under indian gaap, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. however, under ind as, sale of goods includes excise duty.
            excise duty on sale of goods is separately presented on the face of statement of proﬁt and loss accordingly, sale of goods under
            ind as for the nine months ended 31.03.2016 has increased by ` 676.32 crore.
            under ind as cash discount and other sale incentives are required to be netted oﬀ from sale of products which was accounted as
            expenses under indian gaap. hence sale of products is decreased by `116.72 crore for the period ended 31.03.2016.
            under ind as when goods or services are exchanged or swapped for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value, the
            exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue. thus sale of products and cost of material consumed has
            been decreased by ` 21.20 crore for the period ended 31.03.2016.
      i)    statement of cash flows
            the impact of transition from indian gaap to ind as on the statement of cash flows is due to various reclassiﬁcation
            adjustments recorded under ind as in balance sheet, statement of proﬁt and loss and diﬀerences in the deﬁnition of cash and
            cash equivalents in ind as and indian gaap.
      j)    borrowings
            under indian gaap, transaction costs incurred in connection with borrowings are charged upfront to statement of proﬁt and
            loss for the period/year. under ind as, transaction costs are included in the initial recognition amount of ﬁnancial liability and
            charged to statement of proﬁt and loss using eﬀective interest method.
      k)    other comprehensive income
            under indian gaap, the company has not presented other comprehensive income (oci) separately. hence it has reconciled
            indian gaap proﬁt or loss to proﬁt or loss as per ind as. further, indian gaap proﬁt or loss is reconciled to total comprehensive
            income as per ind as.
      l)    proposed dividend and tax on proposed dividend
            under indian gaap, proposed dividends including tax on proposed dividend are recognized as liability in the period to which they
            relate, irrespective of the approval by shareholders. under ind as, proposed dividend is recognized as a liability in the period in
            which it is declared by the company (when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid. therefore, the proposed
            dividend and tax on proposed dividend of ` 58.70 crore as on 01.07.2015 has been derecognized and recognized in 2015-16 on
            approval by shareholders and payment.
