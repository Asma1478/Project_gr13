                                    divergent
                                    markets

                                    the past year featured diverse challenges in the various
                                    market segments that were reflected in two different
                                    aspects: recovery and growth on the one hand, and
                                    decline and contraction on the other, with severe margin
                                    pressure.

                                    while the residential and property development sector is recovering
                                    after more than seven years of crisis, the infrastructure sector experi-
                                    enced particularly difficult market conditions in 2015 and had to cope
                                    with the risks and results of previously acquired projects. the infrastruc-
    bert van der els                ture market in the netherlands is relatively stable in terms of volume,
    ceo heijmans n.v.               but also features intense competition. new types of contract were
                                    introduced which increased the responsibilities placed upon contractors
                                    such as heijmans. heijmans, as well as its competitors, has experienced
                                    difficulties in pricing these risks properly in combination with often
                                    complicated conditions involving numerous stakeholders. another
                                    important factor is that contractors and customers had to find a new
                                    balance with respect to how they collaborate, which requires fairness
                                    and trust as well as contractual agreements. the new vision of the

profile and
business model


vision
construction is more than ever a profession in which development and
realisation are important. customers require perfectly executed
solutions delivered on time that are aesthetically appealing and
tailored to suit the user. often, in circumstances that are complicated.
this requires a high level of knowledge and expertise. heijmans is
building these spatial contours. the environment is increasingly being
determined by the scarcity of space, raw materials and other resources.
this requires improved processes, efficiency, cooperation and integra-
tion of systems.

mission statement
our mission is to play a leading role in making building smarter and
more efficient by adding value in the areas of energy, materials and
spatial quality in the collaborations we enter into, the processes we
operate and the products we generate. in this endeavour, we take
responsibility for achieving renewal, entering into partnerships, and
providing customers with the best insight. to realise and continue our
strategy designed to achieve margin growth, heijmans aims to realise
an ebit margin in realisation and execution of between 3% and 4%. our
target margin in development is around 8%.

strategy and ambition
our aim is to be the best and thereby the most innovative construction
company. we will achieve this through striving for continuous improve-
ment of our core activities through the bundling of our procurement,
consistency in sales and tender management and strong project
management. the objective is to achieve higher margins with good
management of risks. based on this continuing improvement, we can
further increase our market share in existing markets by adding value.
in addition, our goal is to improve our position by increasing our
differentiating qualities and innovating. our ambition is defined by our
drive to improve and renew.

     note
     heijmans delivers added value by active chain management with the aim of achieving efficiency and integration of this
     chain and increasing the level of knowledge and competence within the company through innovation and integration.
     to do this, heijmans works together with partners and uses the various capital flows in the chain. continuous improve-
     ment is achieved through central direction of tender management, project management, procurement and sales and
     setting central improvement targets for these areas. heijmans is increasingly using lean planning techniques, central
     and and uniform processes and systems. the business model reflects the demand from customers for integrated
     solutions in which design and engineering, realisation, maintenance and management as well as funding are combined.

     are issued for them. with effect from 1 january 2014, the yield is 7.9%. the dividend will be revised as at 1 january 2019
     and every five years thereafter. the company has the right to repurchase or cancel these financing preference
     shares b at any time. on 15 april 2015, the general meeting of shareholders authorised the executive board for a term of
     18 months to repurchase up to 40% of the financing preference shares b in its own capital. this means that the out­

     repurchasing and cancelling these shares, and in mid-july 2015 2,100,000 preference financing shares b were

     strategy:
     the contours
     of tomorrow

     strategic direction
     heijmans is building the contours of tomorrow, and we are therefore
     designing and initiating the spatial world in which we live. a fast-mov-
     ing environment in which complex regulation, increasing assertiveness
     from users and stakeholders and dealing with scarcity of spatial quality
     are the major challenges.

     our aim is to be the best and thereby the most innovative construction
     company in our field. to produce the most suitable design and content
     in the built-up environment and thus create added value for our
     customers and their end users.

     improve and renew: top priority for restoring our
     financial result
     we will achieve this through striving for continuous improvement of
     our core activities through the bundling of our procurement, consisten-
     cy in sales and tender management and strong project management.
     this forms the basis of our strategy. through this continuous improve-
     ment we can reduce costs, increase efficiency and further increase the
     contribution to earnings from our market share in existing markets by
     adding more value. this will enable us to sell new products and services
     in these markets and serve new markets and new customers. 'improve
     and renew' defines our ambition.

key points in 2015
the net result in 2015 was €27 million negative (versus €47 million
negative in 2014). the revenue of just under €2.0 billion was slightly
higher than in the previous year (2014: €1.9 billion) mainly due to
strong grows at property development and residential building and
the german operations. the underlying operating result came to
€5 million negative (2014: €12 million negative) with an improvement
in the second half of the year compared to the previous year (2015: €6
million positive versus 2014: €5 million negative). write-down of real
estate and land holdings of €12 million significantly affected the net
result.

the improvement in the underlying operating result was mainly due to
the positive developments at property development and residential
building netherlands (collectively €10 million better than in 2014) and
infra germany (improvement of €5 million). operations in belgium had
a satisfactory year, contributing €7 million to the underlying operating
result. however, as in the previous year the result was heavily affected
by the negative result of the infra operations in the netherlands. a loss
of €26 million was reported here, compared to a loss of €22 million in
2014, with both years heavily influenced by the processing of risks and
results from projects acquired in 2012-2013. the conditions in this
market, which is relatively stable in terms of volume but features a high
level of competition, are only gradually improving. a positive factor is
that the regional infrastructure and asset management activities, in
which road construction has a prominent share, showed an improve-
ment in the second half of the year.

           or less unchanged compared to year-end 2014.

           the level of working capital fluctuates significantly
           during the year. fluctuations may be project-specific
           and related to payment schemes, or may be due to
           discussions regarding the progress of a project. the
           construction sector features a seasonal pattern impacted
           by higher levels of activity in the second and fourth
           quarters. this is particularly visible in the infra and
           non-residential segments. moreover, large integrated
           projects often involve contractual discussions on the
           part of both the customer and the contractor that are
           financially settled in the fourth quarter of the year.
           working capital is usually at its lowest level at the end
           of the year. higher requirements for working capital
           during the year lead to a higher capital requirement,
           which heijmans meets by using a revolving credit
           facility.

residential: property development and residential
building
last year saw a strong recovery in the market. this trend was national,
with the greatest development in the four large cities, where pressure in
the market and demand increased sharply. contrary to the market in
the pre-crisis period, there is greater than ever demand for influence on
product development and customers continue to be critical with respect
to quality in relation to price. the composition of products is also
changing, partly due to demographic developments such as the ageing
population and individualisation. in addition, apart from the increasing
demand for housing, there is pressure with respect to affordability,
especially for young people looking to buy a home. rental therefore
continues to be attractive. investors have been offering more affordable
rented accommodation in recent years to cater for this demand,
especially since the housing associations focused more on their core
activity in 2015 and the management of their core portfolio. for them,
making their stock more sustainable is a more topical theme than
new-build. for heijmans, this has led firstly to the development and
realisation of investment rented accommodation, also in the lower-cost
segment and secondly an increase in renovation, management and
maintenance to make the existing portfolio more sustainable. heijmans
continues to focus on the private owner-occupier market, consisting of
apartments and ground-level dwellings.

            i  may be only 25 years old, but i’m not afraid
             to remind colleagues and subcontractors about
             safety. sometimes there are people who have a
             problem with this. they see me as just a youngster
             and they don’t care about the rules. you have to
             ignore this and show that everyone has to keep
             to the rules. old or young, it makes no difference

health and
safety:

sustainable employability focuses on optimising the health, involve-
ment and development of employees. the aim of sustainable employa-
bility is that work should be more fulfilling, that there should be less
absenteeism and higher productivity. at the same time, economic and
technological developments require organisations to be versatile. this
requires people and organisations to be fit, both literally and figurative-
ly, to cope with the changes they are asked to make. in past years the
human resource policy has focused mainly on market developments
and the need for downsizing the organisation. the organisation had to
become more flexible in order to adapt to changes in the market. the
market changed again last year, especially within the residential
segment, and there is once again potential for cautious growth. in
combination with the rapid ageing of the population, especially at
construction sites, flexibility is more important than ever in our hr
policy.

heijmans achieves sustainable employability by targeting safe working
conditions, continuous availability (‘the right people in the right place’),
increased flexibility and the development of its employees.

safety
the construction sector features constantly changing circumstances
and a high degree of complexity. builders work with partners, suppliers
and subcontractors under high pressure in terms of both time and cost.
construction is labour-intensive and not without danger. the number
of accidents is slowly declining, but in comparison with other sectors
the construction industry has high scores for absenteeism and
accidents leading to hospitalisation. health and safety therefore
directly affects the construction industry, not only as regards cost but
also the attractiveness of the sector. moreover, this aspect directly
affects reputation.

         “
            b       roadly speaking, the level of fire safety
             in the netherlands is not a cause for concern.
             compliance with legislation and regulation has
             been tightened up significantly since volendam
             and se fireworks. at the same time, we like to
             believe in illusions: anyone who thinks that the
             health and safety act and the building decree
             work together seamlessly is making a mistake.
             this can create a false sense of safety. there is
             additional risk at care and wellness institutions,
             where the end users are often less self-reliant.
             being aware of this, building owners and market
             parties are increasingly seeking advice.”

knowledge
intensity

the essence of the work is becoming increasingly complex and
knowledge-intensive. extensive knowledge is needed to be able to meet
the desires and requirements of customers and end users, usually
within a short time period, in a competitive market and subject to strict
regulation. unlike the situation in the past, construction is increasingly
less about simply having operational capacity, today and in the future
it is much more about relieving concerns, meeting performance
agreements and identifying and realising new possibilities that
increase quality, efficiency and convenience in the long term. this
means that the profile of a heijmans employee is changing, since this
development places direct requirements on an employee’s ability and
intelligence.

heijmans positions itself as a ‘learning organisation’ and therefore
encourages learning (both collectively and individually) in various
ways:

learning
the right knowledge and skills are needed to deliver good performance.
by linking strategic objectives to personal ambitions and talents of our
employees, ‘learning’ can make a big contribution to quality. based on
the fact that learning is a responsibility of the individual employee,
heijmans facilitates the learning process. heijmans bases this on
learning on the job and gaining experience, but learning is also
supplemented by coaching, feedback and targeted courses and training.
the first element, learning by gaining practical experience, is the
biggest investment.

to the entire organisation in 2015. these knowledge
levels are categorised by the level of training. the next
step will be to identify this for the foreign operations
and then determine what the future scope and require-
ment for knowledge levels is, given the development
described above towards increasing complexity and
knowledge intensity.

the training level is classified in four categories that
can be indicated for the various geographical regions. all
employees were then classified in these categories. this
classification was already applied to employees in the
netherlands in 2014, meaning that the figures for the
netherlands between 2014 and 2015 are comparable.

procurement
and chain
integration


vision for procurement, chain integration and
cooperation
heijmans and its contractors have a collective responsibility for the
chain. on this basis, heijmans strives to do business with suppliers,
subcontractors, business partners and service providers in an open and
professional way. heijmans makes objective and commercial considera-
tions in its selection of these parties and expects agreements to be kept
on both sides. heijmans pursues a sustainable policy in its procure-
ment whereby the preconditions are created. this section presents a
summary of this policy and vision. the full text of the procurement
policy is available on our website.

cooperation in the chain
the volume of procurement at heijmans represents approximately 70%
to 80% of its annual revenue. close cooperation in the chain is therefore
needed to reduce failure costs, increasing efficiency at projects, the
development of concepts and to arrive at sustainable and most suitable
solutions for customers. the effect of how procurement is organised at
heijmans and the way in which we work together with third parties are
highly important for the achievement of our strategic ambitions.
sustainable procurement can contribute to minimising the harmful
effects of our activities and reducing the drain on natural resources. by
including our contractors in taking this responsibility, heijmans
contributes to improvements to social aspects such as working
conditions and safety, health and the environment.

development of expertise
the bundling of product groups into 10 clusters
has created an expertise centre which also provides for
account management and contract management with
respect to contractors. this enables development,
combination and safeguarding of knowledge in crucial
areas and therefore creates extra added value for the
organisation. the setting up of account management for
suppliers also provides a single contact point within the
heijmans organisation where the right expertise is
located and relationship management can be used to
bring about further sustainable cooperation with
preferred parties across multiple projects.

encouraging sustainability, safety and
innovation
via procurement, a significant contribution is made to
the realisation of our ambitions with respect to safety,
sustainability and innovation. the following actions
were also taken in 2015 to further improve awareness of
safety and the actual level of safety:
• suppliers and subcontractors have been assessed on
   their safety performance with effect from 2015.
   warnings and sanctions are registered by the quality
   & safety department and discussed at procurement
   meetings.
• all subcontractors and suppliers are informed about
   the go! safety programme. they are also involved
   and reached via the regular site meetings. the
   heijmans policy and the associated rules are an
   integral part of the contractual agreements with all
   subcontractors and suppliers.
• the top 50 suppliers and subcontractors were invited
   to attend a stakeholder event in march 2015. this
   meeting also featured extensive attention to the go!
   programme and the go! app was introduced. further
   details of the go! app are provided in the section
   titled ‘health and safety’ on page 55.

sustainable
business
conduct and
projects


heijmans is building the contours of tomorrow, and is working on a
portfolio of thousands of projects. the way in which heijmans initiates
and realises these projects can make the difference in using scarce
resources and raw materials such as energy, timber, water and so on.
heijmans strives to reduce this burden through real reductions in its
co2 emissions, the volume of residual material, separating waste and
re-using waste after removal. the ultimate goal by 2020 is not to
withdraw but to contribute: materials, energy, space and therefore also
value.

examples and progress in 2015

innovative materials
last year showed that the circular economy is becoming increasingly
significant for making processes and business operation sustainable.
this is not yet actually reflected in legislation and regulation. in
addition, it emerged that after years of focus on energy, pressure from
developments such as 3d printing and usage of alternative materials
has led to an even greater emphasis on innovative materials and
sustainability. lighter and/or re-used materials are leading to signifi-
cant changes to design and realisation contracts in the construction
industry. for instance, the use of composite as a building material for
bridges or lock gates. this weighs much less and therefore, in the case
of the composite bridge over the a27, is much faster to install and
therefore causes less disruption to road traffic.

corporate
governance

vision
generally speaking, corporate governance concerns five basic issues.
firstly, the strategy and the achievement of business objectives,
'strategy implementation' in the list of material issues. the second
element is the effective management of the relationships between
directors, supervisors and other stakeholders such as the shareholders
and the works council, but also customers and suppliers. the third
element is the corporate culture, where the issue is ethical behaviour in
the organisation. the fourth element concerns monitoring and
evaluation, in which implementation and direction are important. the
final element relates to reporting and transparency in internal and
external communication.

a culture of discipline and unity is an essential precondition for the
improvement and renewal strategy. heijmans endorses the importance
of good corporate governance and a code of conduct in order to achieve
its business objectives and associated corporate culture, and according-
ly strives to apply the highest standards. this means that heijmans
complies with and respects legislation, and observes and initiates
guidelines that apply either to the company in particular or the
industry as a whole. it also means that heijmans strives to apply the
highest possible integrity and transparency in its actions and deci-
sion-making towards its stakeholders, that it conducts a permanent
dialogue with its stakeholders and has a policy of simultaneous and
accessible distribution of information.

for an account of the organisation of governance and supervision at
heijmans, see the corporate governance statement (as referred to in
sections 2(a) and 3 to 3(b) of the decree adopting further provisions
regarding the content of annual reports (vaststellingsbesluit nadere
voorschriften inhoud jaarverslag) and including the information
required under the decree implementing article 10 of the takeover
directive) which is available on the heijmans website under the
heading ‘corporate governance': codes, articles of association and
regulations’.

     conduct,
     integrity and
     dilemmas

     culture and structure
     heijmans attaches a high value to ethical conduct by its employees.
     openness is a basic requirement for this. a more open working attitude
     is encouraged by the example set by the management and directors,
     the discussion of large and complex works in the weekly executive
     board meeting, and the review meetings with management . in addition
     to this culture, heijmans has introduced a structure for the reporting of
     issues relating to conduct and integrity. such reports are then investi-
     gated if necessary and action can be taken.

     compliance officer
     heijmans has appointed a compliance officer who acts as the central
     contact and reporting point for integrity issues. the anonymity of
     reports is ensured and the compliance officer considers the action
     necessary in each case given the nature of the issue and the applicable
     rules. in many cases, issues are resolved on the shop floor, for instance
     in consultation between the employee and their supervisor; however
     this is not always the case.

     integrity committee
     the integrity committee is responsible for advising the company with
     respect to integrity. the integrity committee discusses issues, dilem-
     mas and themes relating to integrity and all matters associated
     therewith twice a year, and makes recommendations on this basis for
     policy or the initiation of training, for example. the executive board
     establishes the policy and decides which actions are to be taken in this
     context. the committee is chaired by the ceo. other members of the
     committee are the compliance officer, the director of procurement and
     the chair of the cwc,

     the human environment & transport inspectorate
     in early 2014, heijmans was the first contractor to sign a
     declaration of intent with the human environment and
     transport inspectorate (ilt) to arrive at an enforcement
     agreement with respect to the enforcement of the (very
     extensive) regulation that falls under the scope of the ilt.
     heijmans already has such an agreement in place with
     regard to the driving times decree. ilt supervises
     enforcement of the regulations for several so-called
     domains, including soil, transport and dangerous
     materials). a compliance agreement introduces
     horizontal supervision on the basis of which heijmans is
     expected to report deviations on its own initiative, take
     preventive measures and report annually to ilt. within
     heijmans, the ilt domains mainly cover the activities of
     infra. the agreement was signed by ilt and heijmans
     n.v. on 26 june 2015. the agreement has a term of two
     years and will be reviewed annually.

risk
management

doing business in the construction and property sector involves risk. in
principle, there can be no competitive advantage without taking risk and
therefore no return. the operating margins in the industry and at
heijmans are currently low and below the strategic levels that
heijmans aims for and are required to operate profitably. this further
underlines the importance of risk management. it is therefore an
essential duty of the management to make well-considered decisions
with respect to the risks the company wishes to incur, and how these
risks are managed.

the markets in which heijmans operates have contracted sharply in
recent years. competition is intense and pressure on margins has
increased. in addition, new types of contract have been introduced that
led to a shift of responsibilities to contractors such as heijmans.
at the same time, this development offers strategic opportunities for
adding value. heijmans aims to achieve this, on the basis of its knowl-
edge, expertise and innovative strengths, by leading the way in the
offering of integrated sustainable and socially relevant solutions to
customers and users. for heijmans, the only way to maintain a
sustainable position in this market is to add value.
risk management was a high-priority item on the business agenda
during the reporting year. this section describes the risk profile, the
main risk factors and the way in which these are managed. it also
describes the main activities and results in 2015 with respect to risk
management and lists the priorities for 2016. the risk section also
describes the main items of attention in the management letter from
the external auditor.

focus of risk management in 2016
many of the items of attention and actions from
previous years will be followed up in 2016, with the
addition of certain other actions and/or measures.
in practice, this means:
• extensive attention to the management of large and
    mostly integrated projects at infra and non-
    residential in the netherlands, especially in the
    start-up phase;
• consistent direction regarding the implementation of
    the 'improve the core' programme with respect to
    tender management, project management, procure-
    ment and sales;
• continuation of the go! safety programme with
    higher target figures, as well as an increased focus on
    safety in germany and belgium;
• continuation of the 'fit for cash' programme
    including intensive monitoring and management of
    liquidity in the light of the desired improvement of
    profitability;
• continued roll-out of the sap-erp environment
    including the introduction of follow-up initiatives
    designed to achieve the desired business benefits;
• strengthening the funding of the company;
• a stronger audit programme carried out by the risk
    and audit officer;
• ensuring compliance with respect to hr-related risks
    as a result of the labour market fraud (bogus
    schemes) act (was), sequential liability, changes to
    regulations for self-employed persons, employment
    of foreign nationals and the protection of personal
    information - in the awareness that changes have
    either been made or will be made in the regulations
    for these domains.

principles of the remuneration policy
the supervisory board of heijmans n.v. pursues a remuneration policy
for the company’s executive board that is based on the following
principles:
• executive compensation must be such that it is possible to attract
    and retain top managers, not only from the building industry but
    from related sectors, such as property development and electrical
    and mechanical contracting;
• the remuneration policy must be consistent with the company’s
    corporate governance policy;
• remuneration must be guided by the strategic and financial
    objectives and must to a significant degree be performance-based,
    with an appropriate balance between short and long-term results
    and/or targets;
• remuneration must not include any incentives that could result in
    individual behaviour that is in conflict with the company's interests;
• the executive board operates as a team with ultimate responsibility
    clearly resting with the chair, although the other executive directors
    are, in addition to their specific areas of responsibility, also accounta-
    ble for the overall end result.

relationship with the corporate governance code
heijmans endorses the principles relating to the remuneration of
executive directors stated in the corporate governance code. heijmans
moreover endorses the recommendations relating to the remunera-
tion-related responsibilities of the supervisory board and the role of the
remuneration committee.

four years for executive directors as well as the compensation stated in
the code in the event of involuntary dismissal.

transactions between business segments are conducted at arm’s length terms that are comparable to those for transacti-
ons with third parties. assets not allocated mainly concern deferred tax assets. unallocated liabilities mainly concern
interest-bearing loans and other financing commitments.

by the nature of its operations, the infra segment is highly dependent on public sector contracts.

property, plant and equipment valued at €1.6 million (2014: €2.4 million) have been leased under financial lease
agreements. of this amount, €1.3 million relates to land and buildings, and €0.3 million to machinery, installations and
large-scale equipment. the leased assets serve as security for the lease commitments. the future minimum lease
payments amount to €0.4 million in 2016 and €1.0 million annually in 2017 to 2021 inclusive.

the carrying amount for assets under construction includes an amount of €4 million for expenditures incurred during
the financial year, mainly relating to materials.

at year-end, the contractual obligations relating to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounted to
€1.1 million.

since the beginning of 2015, given the limited importance, investment property (property held for its rental income and/
or increase in value) has been recognised as “other capital assets”, rather than as a separate item in the statement of
financial position. the comparative figures for 2014 have been restated accordingly. investment property amounted to
€2 million (2014: €2 million).

the item “machinery, installations and large-scale equipment” includes approximately €11 million in assets that were
previously recognised as “other capital assets” in connection with the reallocation of these items. the comparative
figures for 2014 have been restated accordingly.

the item ‘other’ mainly refers to the cash-generating unit infra netherlands (€16 million).

the remaining amortisation term for the intangible asset that was part of the burgers ergon acquisition is 11 years.

the remaining intangible assets of the other acquisitions relate mainly to concessions for sand quarries.

goodwill is tested annually for impairment, based on the relevant cash-generating unit. for an explanation of the
calculation of the realisable value, reference is made to the accounting policies.

the impairment tests are based on the value in use calculated by means of the discounted cash flow method. the pre-tax
wacc (weighted average cost of capital) used for this calculation ranged from 10% to 11% (2014: from 11% to 12%),
corresponding to a discount rate after tax of 8.6% (2014: 9.1%).

the value in use of the cash-flow generating business units is based on their expected future cash flows. the period
adopted to determine the present value of cash flows is indefinite. in the determination of future cash flows, the medium
to long-term planning for the relevant cash-flow generating unit is used. the assumptions underlying the medium to
long-term planning are partly based on historical experience and external information sources. the medium to long-
term planning generally covers a period of 5 years. cash flows after 5 years are extrapolated using growth rates not
exceeding 2% (2014: 2%).

the realisable value calculated for the impairment test depends on the growth rate used and the period over which the
cash flows are realised.

the amortisation of the other intangible assets is recognised in the statement of profit or loss under “other operating
expenses”.

      the expected cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax wacc varying between 10% and 11%. if the pre-tax wacc had
      been 1% -point higher, this would not have resulted in an impairment. cash flows after 5 years are extrapolated using
      growth rates not exceeding 2%. if this maximum were 1%-point lower, this would not result in an impairment.

      the cash-flow generating unit non-residential – to which the goodwill and other intangible assets of burgers ergon and
      the majority of the goodwill for ibc is allocated, in total €62 million, – is sensitive to changes in the assumptions,
      whereby the realisable value could become lower than the carrying amount. according to the impairment test, the
      realisable value of the cash-flow generating unit non-residential is currently some €120 million higher than the
      carrying amount. one significant factor in this context is the change in the ebit margin. for the test, the ebit margin was
      assumed to grow to 4% of revenue in future years. if the ebit margin were nil, the realisable value would be equal to the
      carrying amount. the change in the funding status of projects is another important factor.

      the realisable value of the cash-flow generating unit oevermann is now approximately €45 million higher than its
      carrying amount. the realisable value is sensitive to changes in the assumptions, so that it could be lower than the
      carrying amount. one significant factor in this context is the change in the ebit margin. for the test, the ebit margin was
      estimated to grow to approximately 2 to 3% of revenue. another major factor is the expected settlement of debtor
      positions.

measurement of deferred tax assets
as at year-end 2015, the loss carry-forward is €40.8 million, of which €35.2 million relates to the loss carry-forward of
the dutch fiscal unity. this loss carry-forward has been set off against the fiscal unity’s deferred tax liabilities. breaking
this loss down shows that €12.3 million relates to 2012, €17.0 million to 2014, and €5.9 million to 2015. in order to
prevent under-utilisation of 2009 losses available for set-off (amounting to € 9.1 million) and to improve the tax position
of the heijmans nv fiscal unity, a change in the accounting policy was made in 2015 when preparing the 2013 corporate
income tax return with regard to the valuation of the strategic land holdings. the value for tax purposes of these land
holdings has thereby been aligned to the ifrs valuation. for the 2013 tax return, this has resulted in a one-off €30.5
million tax benefit. the resulting positive taxable amount has been used to offset all of the 2009 and 2011 tax-deductible
losses and part of the 2012 tax-decuctible losses. this has led to application of the loss of €4 million written down in
2014 in relation to the year 2009.

the losses of the dutch fiscal unity are subject to a loss carry-forward period of 9 years. a deferred tax asset is recognised
to the extent that it is probable, based on forecasts, that sufficient future taxable profits will be available that can be
utilised towards realising the deferred asset. the forecasts are based on the order book, the 2016 business plan, and the
long-term forecast. these also underlie the measurement of the realisable value of goodwill (for impairment tests). for
the long-term forecast, the average ebit margin of the dutch fiscal unity is assumed to grow to approximately 3% of
revenue. the forecasts of the results before tax up to and including 2021 show that there will be sufficient profits
available to set off any tax losses. the remaining settlement term of 9 years is generally longer than the period currently
used until 2020. a factor inherent in the measurement of the deferred tax assets is that the utilization of losses depends
on the realisation of the 2016 business plan and the long-term forecasts, which are the group’s best estimates.

the remaining loss carry-forward amounts to €5.6 million, and relates to a number of belgian operating companies
(€1.5million), to oevermann (€2.1 million) and to franki (€2.0 million). in principle, losses in belgium and germany can
be set off against future profits for an indefinite period, subject in germany to a maximum for the annual profit being
used for set-off. taxable profit of up to €1 million in any year can be used in full for set off. of taxable profit exceeding €1
million, only 60% can be used for set off.

measurement of deferred tax liabilities
for determining the amount of the deferred tax liabilities, the value for tax purposes of the construction work in progress
in the netherlands (including residential building projects) is largely treated as being equal to the value under ifrs.

deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised for any temporary differences originating at subsidiaries, joint operations
or joint ventures. no deferred tax assets or liabilities have been recognised for temporary differences arising from
investments in associates in view of their relative insignificance.

the majority of the deferred tax liabilities have a term of more than one year.

tax losses not recognised in the statement of financial position
at year-end 2015, unrecognised losses of the heijmans nv fiscal unity amounted to €16.0 million (2014: €4.0 million).
at year-end 2015, the other tax losses not recognised in the statement of financial position amounted to €45.9 million
(2014: €62.0 million). the larger part of this relates to a number of subsidiaries in belgium (€42.3 million). the other
unrecognised losses relate to a number of german operating companies (€3.6 million).

      strategic land portfolio
      the strategic land portfolio comprises land holdings that are measured at cost or net realisable value if lower. net
      realisable value of an individual land position can be the direct or indirect recoverable value. the net realisable value
      depends on the expected manner and timing of realisation. accordingly, the value is generally derived by using an
      indirect method for determining the recoverable value. the indirect recoverable value is the estimated revenue in the
      normal course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling. to calculate the present value of the
      expected cash flows, a discount rate of 6% is often used, unless, thanks to favourable financing terms, a different percen-
      tage has been set for a joint arrangement. setting the discount rate takes into account the expected capital structure,
      operating risks, and circumstances relating to heijmans or specifically to the project.

      determining the indirect recoverable value involves the use of judgements and estimates. the strategic land portfolio is
      affected by several elements of uncertainty, such as demographic changes, location, and details and implementation of
      development plans and administrative decisions, with as local a focus as possible. for each location, the outcome is an
      expected trend for land and residential property prices, as well as other variables, that ultimately determine the indirect
      recoverable value. twice a year, the group carries out its own assessment of the values of all the land holdings.

      in general, the risk of deviations from the judgments and estimates is greater for strategic land holdings without a site
      allocation plan than for those with one. moreover, this risk keeps increasing the longer the expected delay is for the start
      of the development work. the net realisable value of the strategic land portfolio was calculated in 2015 and compared
      with the carrying amount. this led to a write-down of €11,2 million and a write-down of €0,4 million concerning a joint
      venture (2014: write-downs totalling € 16.5 million and a reversal of an earlier write-down of €2.8 million concerning a
      joint venture). the decreases in value are partly due to specific local conditions that have adversely affected the success
      of projects, time to completion, expected margins and the number of completed residential properties.

in principle, the term of the strategic land portfolio is more than 12 months after the closing date (mostly 5 to 10 years).
items in “residential properties in preparation or under construction” usually have a term of 3 to 5 years as from the
closing date. the other items in principle have a term of less than 12 months.

residential properties in preparation or under construction
residential properties in preparation or under construction can be analysed as follows:

      the value of work in progress is periodically assessed for each project by the project manager and the manager of the
      unit concerned. the assessment is mainly based on the information in the project files, the project accounting records
      and the knowledge and experience of the persons involved. estimates are an inherent feature of this process and of the
      project activities’ valuations, as is the fact that the group is involved in negotiations and discussions on the financial
      settlement of projects, such as extra work or reduced work, claims, arbitration and penalties, delivery times and the
      quality of the work. it may turn out at a later stage that actual results differ from the estimates. this will be so particu-
      larly for long-term projects that include considerable customisation. it can also occur if there are unsettled claims or
      discussions with clients about additional work that are still continuing on the closing date. with respect to one of its
      infrastructure projects, heijmans has a difference of opinion with the client regarding payment for potential additional
      works. heijmans is of the opinion that additional works fall outside the scope of the contractual agreement, however the
      client is of the opinion that these works are covered by the original contract amount and are for the account and risk of
      heijmans. at the time of preparation of the financial statements, the parties were in consultation. the costs of these
      potential additional works, which have not as yet commenced, are estimated at several tens of millions of euros and have
      not been recognised. the executive board is of the opinion that it is under no obligation to perform these additional
      works and has concluded that it is unlikely that these costs will be for the account of heijmans, and, if the additional
      works have to be performed, that heijmans will be entitled to an additional payment.

      the uncertainty surrounding the abovementioned estimates increases, for example:
      • contract types involving special arrangements mean more risks for the group. such is the case with a dc contract,
         under which the group accepts the design risk. dbmo contracts also include responsibility for maintenance and
         operation;
      • projects are in the design stage. when producing a final design from a provisional one, significant changes may be
         necessary, which can require a positive or negative adjustment to the initial forecast.
      projects are also fraught with opportunities and risks during execution. examples include additional work, claims and unfore-
      seen circumstances that could be for the account of the group.

revenues from additional work are included in the overall contract revenues if the client has accepted the sum involved in
any way. claims and incentives are recognised under work in progress insofar as it is probable that these will generate
revenue and can be reliably determined. when determining the amount to be recognised, specific contractual arrange-
ments and the legislation of the country where a project is being carried out are taken into account.

for claims and penalties imposed by contractors against heijmans, because of construction overruns for example, these
are recognised if it is likely that they will have an adverse effect.

bonuses are recognised as revenues from work in progress if the project is far enough advanced and it is probable that the
performance indicators specified will be met, and the bonus amount can be reliably determined. if the bonus can only be
received after expiry of a predetermined period following completion of the project, then that bonus is only recognised
when it is sufficiently probable that the bonus will be received.

the positive balance of work in progress represents all the projects in progress for third parties where the incurred costs
plus the capitalised profit, less the recognised losses, are greater than the progress billings.

the negative balance of work in progress represents all the projects in progress for third parties where the incurred costs
plus the capitalised profit, less the recognised losses, are smaller than the progress billings.

revenues from work in progress under contracts with third parties recognised in the reporting period amounted to
€1.7 billion (2014: €1.7 billion).

work in progress generally has a term of less than 12 months.

cumulative financing preference shares b
at year-end 2015, 4,510,000 cumulative financing b preference shares were outstanding at €10 a share. the dividend on
these shares is 7.9% as of 1 january 2014 and is payable annually, 14 days after the general meeting of shareholders. at
the general meeting of shareholders in april 2015, the shareholders voted in favour of authorising the executive board
for a period of 18 months to repurchase up to 40% of the cumulative financing b preference shares in the company’s
capital. subsequently, the amount outstanding on these shares can be reduced by 40% by cancelling cumulative
financing b preference shares. in line with the adopted resolution, heijmans’ executive board repurchased 2,100,000
cumulative financing preferences shares b in july 2015. the dividend will be reassessed on 1 january 2019 and every 5
years thereafter. the group has the right to repurchase or cancel these cumulative financing preference shares b before
their maturity date in case of an interest rate change or at any other time subject to payment of compensation.

      lanschot bankiers and deutsche bank. collateral has been provided for the facility. the credit margin on this facility
      ranges from 1.5% to 2.0%, depending on the leverage ratio. €50 million of this facility was used at year-end 2015. the
      financial covenants agreed are a (recourse) leverage ratio not exceeding 3 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 3,
      both to be tested every six months. in principle, if the conditions are not complied with, drawings under the facility are
      repayable immediately on demand. the executive board actively monitors compliance with the conditions.

      agreement was reached with the bank consortium comprising rabobank, ing bank, abn amro bank and kbc on
      24 february 2016 to extend the facility until 30 june 2018. as of 1 april 2016, the committed facility will be €256
      million, in which a previously uncommitted overdraft facility will be included. the agreement stipulates that from 31
      march 2016, the aforementioned interest coverage ratio will be tested quarterly and must be at least 4 (formerly 3) as
      from year-end 2016. in addition, commencing mid-2017 the company will have to test for an average leverage ratio of
      2.5. additional collateral has also been provided. this extension and the amended conditions are in line with heijmans’
      plans for this financing period, to structurally improve the ratio of net debt to ebitda.

      the leverage ratio is calculated as the net debt divided by ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
      amortisation). the interest coverage ratio is calculated as the ebitda divided by the net interest expense. the definitions
      of these items include several adjustments in the reported figures, as agreed upon with the bank consortium in the
      credit agreement. the key adjustments in relation to the accounting definition of net debt are increase by net debt from
      joint ventures, and reduction by the amount of outstanding cumulative financing b preference shares and the financing
      of certain projects that are negotiated without any recourse towards heijmans (non-recourse). the main adjustments
      with respect to the ebitda in accounting terms concern the capitalised interest, results on the sale of business units, fair
      value adjustments, reorganisation costs, and operating results of joint ventures. the main adjustments with respect to
      the net interest expense in accounting terms are removing the interest expenses from non-recourse project financing and
      cumulative financing b preference shares. these ratios were complied with during the reporting year. as the (recourse)
      net debt was negative at year-end 2015, the (recourse) leverage ratio is not relevant. interest coverage ratio at year-end
      2015 was 6.0. given the business plan for 2016, the group expects it can continue operating during the next financial
      year within the framework of the covenants. the development of ebitda and the net debt are the relevant parameters in
      this respect. the development of net debt is subject to seasonal effects and fluctuations due to specific projects, which is
      mainly relevant for the the covenants in mid-year, when the capital requirement is higher.

      project financing
      project financing was negotiated for specific (real estate) projects. the repayment schedules for project financing are
      usually related to the projects’ progress. project financings will generally expire no later than the date of completion
      and/or sale of the projects. recourse is limited to project assets only, including future positive cash flows from these
      projects, as well as the contracts and mortgage collateral related to the project / project company in most cases.
      heijmans n.v. has guaranteed the repayment of principal and/or interest up to an amount of €1 million (2014: €6
      million) of the total project financing. regarding the remaining €11 million (2014: €1 million), this is therefore financed
      without recourse towards heijmans n.v. or it’s subsidiaries.

      financial lease commitments						
      the financial lease commitments relate primarily to equipment in belgium. the lease commitment is equal to the
      present value of the debt. the lease payments fall due as follows:

      the total liability arising from defined benefit pension plans and jubilee payments is recognised in the statement of
      financial position as follows:


                                                                                              31 december 2015           31 december 2014

      current employee benefits                                                                               3.181                    2.043
      employee-related receivable                                                                         -37.688                     -24.484
                                                                                                           -12.475                     4.290



      the employee-related receivable concerns a plan that, in accordance with the regulations for valuation in the pensions
      act as specified in the financial assessment framework, is subject to a funding ratio of 103.5% (2014: 107.8%). (see
      “stichting pensioenfonds heijmans n.v.” below.) the receivable is based on the assumption that this closed plan will
      gradually wind down, and on the conclusion that the group, as the employer, will eventually be the sole remaining
      stakeholder and therefore logically entitled to the final balance.

      liability for defined benefit plans in the netherlands						
      the liability for defined benefit plans concerns the liabilities recognised for one company pension fund and approxima-
      tely 15 plans placed with insurance companies.
      						
      stichting pensioenfonds heijmans n.v.						
      for the portion of salary above the maximum for the industry pension fund, the pension accrual is placed with an insurer. this
      plan came into effect on 1 january 2012 for new employees. as of 1 january 2013, existing employees have also been accruing
      pension rights under this plan. (this concerns employees who have been with the company since before 1 january 2012 and
      were accruing supplementary pension rights with pensioenfonds heijmans.) the plan is an average pay scheme with
      conditional indexation and qualifies as a defined contribution plan. no new members will be admitted to the pensioenfonds
      heijmans plan. the pension accrual of these employees (who became members of the supplementary plan before the end of
      2012) remains guaranteed by stichting pensioenfonds heijmans n.v. while employees stay with heijmans, the pensions they
      accrued until the end of 2012 are conditionally indexed. heijmans pays a contribution each year to cover the costs of this.
      approximately 29% of the members in the new plan were members of the former plan who are still employed by heijmans,
      and accordingly have a conditional right to indexation, depending on the salary increase in accordance with the collective
      employment agreement for the construction industry for a maximum of 4% per year. for the rest, 50% are former employees
      and 21% are pensioners. the average term of the pension liabilities is approximately 17 years. because of the funding deficit in
      the former plan, heijmans made an additional contribution of €5 million in 2012, and a further €3 million in 2013. heijmans
      is under no obligation to make a subsequent contribution. the pension contributions and required buffers are calculated in
      accordance with the rules stated in the pensions act. in accordance with these rules, the contributions are cost effective, and the
      funding ratio set by the pension fund policy needs to be at least 104% at year-end 2015 (2014: 104%). the coverage ratio as at
      31 december 2015 is 103.5%. it is expected that equity will be at the required level within the prescribed term and that no
      further measures will be necessary. supervision of compliance is a responsibility of de nederlandsche bank (dnb), the
      netherlands central bank. the board of the fund comprises representatives of the employer, employees and pensioners.

insured plans						
heijmans has some 15 insured pension plans in the form of guarantee contracts. other than the costs of indexation,
heijmans is not liable for payments due to aggravated mortality assumptions. the risks inherent in the plan of these
being necessary are largely borne by the insurers. it is a responsibility of the insurers to hold sufficient funds to pay out
all benefits. supervision of this aspect is in the hands of dnb. the indexed value is determined according to the variables
set out in the insurance contract. the average term of the pension liabilities is approximately 15 years.

industry pension funds						
the majority of the pensions have been placed with industry pension funds, the main ones being the collective pension
fund for the construction industry and the pension fund for the engineering, mechanical and electric contracting sector
(the bouwnijverheid pension fund and the metaal en techniek pension). both these funds operate average pay plans with
indexation. the funding ratio set by the policy of the collective pension fund for the construction industry
(bouwnijverheid pension) was 110.9% at year-end 2015 (year-end 2014: 114.5%). the funding ratio set by the policy of the
pension fund for the engineering, mechanical and electric contracting sector (the metaal en techniek pensions fund)
was 98.5% at year-end 2015 (year-end 2014: 103.0%). these funding ratios are calculated in line with the accounting
principles used by the various industry pension funds, in accordance with the pensions act and the financial
assessment framework. with regard to these plans, heijmans has an obligation to pay the predetermined premiums.
the group cannot be obligated to supplement any shortfalls, other than by means of future contribution adjustments.
heijmans has no claim to any surplus in the funds. as the employees bear the actual risks of the plans, they are
recognised as defined contribution plans.

liability for defined benefit plans in germany							
pension plans apply to a number of german employees, for which plans a liability has been recognised in the statement
of financial position. these plans have not been placed with outside insurance companies or funds. the pension
entitlements consist primarily of fixed, income-independent monthly payments.

pension plans in belgium 						
in belgium, most employees participate in a defined contribution pension plan provided by the employer. the belgian
vandenbroucke act requires that, in principle, a minimum yield of 1,75% must be earned on the amounts deposited with
insurance companies. a payable, if any, to the insurance company at the end of the year will be recognised. the minimal
guarantee of return might affect heijmans’ future cash flows.
				
jubilee payments						
the jubilee payments in the netherlands and belgium consist of a monthly salary, or a portion thereof, for employment
periods of 25 and 40 years. in germany, the anniversary payment is a fixed sum for an employment period of 10 years,
one and a half months’ salary for a period of 25 years, and two months’ salary for a period of 40 years.

stichting pensioenfonds heijmans n.v. assets
at stichting pensioenfonds heijmans n.v., approximately 65% of the interest-rate risk associated with the liabilities is
hedged using a liability-matching portfolio. of the total plan assets, valued at €205 million, €166 million is in fixed-
interest securities, €38 million in shares, and €1 million in liquid assets and current receivables. the fixed-interest
securities as well as the shares are listed, and these assets are measured at list price. no investments are made in
heijmans shares.

reasonably possible changes as of the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, with the other
assumptions remaining unchanged, can affect the liabilities associated with the defined benefit plans as shown below.

the above effects were determined by the actuary who performed the calculations. the combined effect of changes to
more than one of the assumptions can be different from the sum of the corresponding individual effects owing to
interactions.

the effects presented apply only to the liabilities, and not to the fair value of the investments. for a plan in the form of
an insurance contract, the effect of a change in the discount rate is largely mitigated by an equal but opposite effect on
the plan investments. this is because of the guarantee provided by the insurer.

heijmans expects to contribute approximately €3 million in 2016 to the defined pension plans and approximately €30
million to the defined contribution plans. the expected contributions in subsequent years are likely to be in line with
those expected for 2016, depending as well on changes in the above-mentioned actuarial assumptions.

      general									
      provisions for warranty obligations, restructuring costs and environmental risks are recognised if heijmans has an existing
      obligation and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will occur. the amount of each provision can be reliably
      estimated. the provisions are stated at face value, unless the time value of money is material.

      provision for warranty obligations
      the provisions relate to complaints and deficiencies that become apparent after the delivery of projects and that fall
      within the warranty period. the magnitude of the costs provided for is dependent partly on the estimated allocation of
      the claim to the related construction partners. it is expected that most of the obligations will materialise in the next two
      years.

      provision for restructuring costs
      the provision for restructuring costs relates to the expected severance costs related to organisational changes. most of
      the provision will be used in 2016 and the remainder in the years 2017 and 2018. the release in 2015 relates mainly to
      the failure to obtain dismissal permits from the uwv.

      provision for environmental risks
      this item represents possible site restoration costs. the costs have been estimated by site, based on government
      regulations concerning the method of restoration and soil investigation. the periods within which restoration needs to
      take place vary by site. in the event that the restoration does not have to take place for another few years, there is an
      obligation to monitor the pollution. the expected monitoring costs have also been included in the provision.

      6.23       financial risks and management

      general					
      in the normal course of business, heijmans is exposed to various financial risks, including credit, liquidity, market, price
      and interest-rate risks.				

      this section describes the degree to which these risks manifest themselves, the objectives set regarding the risks, and the
      policy and procedures for measuring and managing them, as well as the management of capital.			
      		
      the risk policy is focused on the identification and analysis of the risks to which the group is exposed and the setting of
      acceptable limits.					

      the risk policy and systems are assessed on a regular basis and then modified if necessary for changes in market
      conditions and the operations of the group. the objective is to create a disciplined and constructive approach to risk
      management, with the aid of training, standards and procedures whereby all employees are aware of their roles and
      responsibilities.					

      the audit committee periodically reviews the risk management policy and procedures. in addition, the committee
      reviews the risk policy used in the light of the risks to which the group is exposed.					
      					
      credit risk					
      credit risk is the risk that the group will be exposed to financial loss if a party against which heijmans has a claim fails
      to meet its contractual obligations. credit risks arise primarily from receivables due from customers and consortium
      partners.

      the credit risk associated with property development is limited, as future residents can only take possession of the new
      property once they have met all their obligations. the creditworthiness is assessed in transactions involving the
      development of commercial property, building assignments and infrastructure projects, with additional collateral
      possibly being requested. heijmans carries out many assignments for public authorities for which the credit risk is
      considered extremely limited.

      the assessment of creditworthiness is part of the standard procedure. credit risk is mitigated by pre-financing arrange-
      ments and payments in instalments. risks are insured with a credit insurer if considered necessary.

      the large number of clients, a substantial part of which are private individuals and public authorities, means there is no
      concentration of credit risk.

      the cash and cash equivalents are held at different banks that are assessed as regards creditworthiness, and as a result
      credit risk is limited.

      a provision for doubtful receivables is recognised following an assessment of the potential risks for each individual
      receivable. doubtful receivables are subjected to an impairment test and written down as necessary to the present value
      of the future cash flows if lower.

      liquidity risk
      liquidity risk is the risk that the group cannot meet its financial obligations at the time it is required to do so. see also
      note 6.19, “interest-bearing loans”. the liquidity risk management assumption is that sufficient liquidity levels will be
      maintained to meet current and future financial obligations, both under normal circumstances and exceptional circums-
      tances, without incurring unacceptable risks and without endangering the reputation of the group.

      12-month rolling liquidity forecasts are used to determine whether the group has sufficient liquidity available. based on
      this forecast, the group considers that sufficient liquidity is available to conduct operations.

      to secure the availability of financial resources for both the long term and the short term, heijmans has access to the
      following facilities:
      • €45 million in cumulative financing preference shares without a repayment obligation;
      • (from 1 april 2016) €256 million committed and syndicated bank financing for a term expiring end of march 2017,
          and €246 million for a term expiring end of june 2018;
      • project financing for which committed financing is available for most of the anticipated principal sum and duration of
          the project in question; and
      • €10 million in overdraft facilities. these are uncommitted.

      in order to satisfy clients’ requirements for bank guarantees, heijmans has access to sufficient guarantee facilities with
      various institutions. these facilities are uncommitted.

      at year-end 2015, the guarantee facilities totalled €501 million (2014: €524 million) provided by 22 parties.
      the contractual maturity dates of the financial obligations, including interest payments, are as follows:

market risk							
market risk is the risk that the income of the group or the value of financial instruments is adversely affected by changes
in market prices, for example, due to movements in exchange rates, interest rates and share prices. the objective of
managing market risk is to keep the market risk position within acceptable limits while achieving optimum returns.to
manage market risk, derivatives may be bought and sold, and financial commitments may be undertaken. transactions
of this nature are carried out within established guidelines.

      price risk							
      price risk associated with the purchase of raw materials and auxiliary materials, as well as with outsourced work, is
      mitigated by making price indexation agreements with clients, or where possible by making price agreements with
      suppliers at an early stage. if necessary, derivatives may be used occasionally to hedge the price risk of procuring raw
      materials.

      interest-rate risk							
      the interest rate policy at heijmans is directed towards limiting the impact of changes in interest rates on the results of
      the group. in addition, some of the loans have been concluded at fixed interest rates.
      .					
      if the interest rate for 2015 had been 2%-points higher on average, then the result before tax based on the positions of the
      statement of financial position at year-end would have been approx. €2.1 million higher (2014: €1.2 million higher). the
      effect of a 2%-points difference in interest rates on the group’s equity (assuming all other variables remained constant)
      would have been an increase of €1.6 million (2014: an increase of €0.9 million). this effect on the result before tax was
      mainly due to the cash balance at year-end 2015. the interest rate exposure measured on the basis of the average debt
      during the year would have a more limited effect on the result.

as at the closing date, 39% (2014: 77%) of the interest-bearing debt had been negotiated at a fixed interest rate, and 61%
(2014: 23%) at a floating rate. due to seasonal effects, the average debt during the year is higher than the debt at the
closing date. the portion of the gross debt subject to a floating interest rate is also higher during the year. the gross
floating rate interest debt is offset by items such as cash and cash equivalents, which are also subject to floating rate
interest.

the average weighted interest term to maturity of the project financing is 0.1 years (2014: 0.2 years).

the interest-bearing loans are measured at amortised cost rather than at fair value. the measurement of the loans is
therefore not affected by changes in interest rates.

currency risk
the currency risk on sales, purchases and loans is extremely limited for heijmans, since by far the greater part of the
cash flows within the group are in euros.

fair values
the table below shows the fair values and the carrying amounts of the financial instruments. the fair values are
allocated to different levels of the fair-value hierarchy, depending on the inputs used to determine the measurement
methods.
the levels are defined as follows:
level 1: 	quoted (unadjusted) market prices available to the group on the measurement date, in active markets for
           identical assets or liabilities.
level 2: 	input that is not a quoted market price at level 1, but is obtainable for the asset or liability concerned, either
           directly (as a price) or indirectly (derived from a price).
level 3: input for the asset or liability not based on data available in a market (unobservable input).

heijmans has no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value.

      * the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.


      the above values are based on the present value of future cash flows. the loans with a fixed interest rate are discounted using
      the yield curve for 31 december 2015, plus the relevant risk mark-up.

      all loans with a variable interest rate are assumed to have a fair value equal to their carrying amount.

      capital management
      the policy has been designed to achieve a sound capital position with sufficient availability of credit to be able to ensure
      continuity for stakeholders. a sound capital structure is based on a leverage ratio, a net interest-bearing debt after deduction of
      cumulative preference finance shares b plus non-recourse finance, divided by ebitda not exceeding 3.0 and an interest cover
      ratio of at least 4.0 (see also note 6.19 for a description of the financial ratios in the conditions agreed with the banks).

a charge of €29 million for operating leases was recognised in the statement of profit or loss for 2015 (2014: €30
million).
a charge of €16 million for rental costs was recognised in the statement of profit or loss for 2015 (2014: 17 million).

the lease commitments primarily relate to future instalments on leases for vehicles and equipment. the rental
commitments are for the lease of company buildings. the joint ventures in which heijmans participates have undertaken
neither rental commitments nor lease commitments.

approximately 3,500 lease vehicles (2,550 cars, 850 vans, and 100 trucks) are leased in the netherlands under an
operating contract. in 2013, an umbrella agreement covering the cars and vans was signed with the main leasing
company for a term of 4 years. the individual contracts covered by the agreement have terms varying from 12 months
to 72 months. these contracts can only be dissolved after compensation is paid for the difference between the market
value and the carrying amount (only if the market value is lower), and for the portion of the lease payments representing
the management fee or administrative expenses and interest. for trucks, the maximum term is usually 120 months.

      6.26       contingent liabilities

      general
      contingent liabilities are potential liabilities resulting from events prior to the closing date. the liabilities are potential
      because the outflow of economic benefits depends on the occurrence of uncertain events in the future.			
      					
      contingent liabilities can be divided into bank guarantees, parent group guarantees and other contingent liabilities.

      the members of the executive board have been granted conditional short-term variable remuneration for 2015 equal to
      20% of their respective basic salaries. for this grant to become unconditional, the conditions stated in the remuneration
      policy must be met in 2016 or 2017. the long-term variable remuneration granted in 2015, amounting to €0, is for the
      period 2013-2015. for more information, refer to the section on remuneration in the annual report.

      a reserve of €0,6 million has been formed for the variable remuneration to the current members of the executive board
      for the periods 2014-2016 and 2015-2017 (2014: €0.6 million for the periods 2013-2015 and 2014-2016). an amount of
      €246.882 has been reserved for mr l.j.t. van der els (2014: €246,882), €197,831 for mr m.c. van den biggelaar (2014:
      €197,831), and €197.831 for mr a.g.j.hillen (2014: €197.831).

      the charge in 2015 for the long-term variable remuneration for members of the executive board was €0 (2014: €0).

      in order to bind directors to the company for the long term and to encourage a focus on long-term value creation, with
      effect from 2010 a bonus investment share matching plan has been introduced, whereby directors can decide on a
      voluntary basis to use part of their variable short-term remuneration to purchase heijmans shares.

      in april 2011, the members of the executive board purchased heijmans shares for an amount equal to half the net
      short-term variable remuneration allocated for 2010. for each share purchased, one share is conditionally allocated
      under the share matching plan. in april 2014, the allocation of 9,171 shares became unconditional, and the group issued
      9,171 shares to the executive board members concerned. these shares are subject to a mandatory lock-up period of two
      years.

      in april 2014, mr van der els used 50% of his short-term bonus for 2013 to purchase shares in heijmans. similarly, mr
      van den biggelaar and mr hillen each used 20% of their short-term bonuses for the same purpose. for each share
      purchased - in total 2,289 shares - one share is conditionally allocated under the share matching plan. the allocation
      becomes unconditional after three years, following which a mandatory lock-up period of two years comes into effect. the
      total expense relating to the allocation of shares is determined at the time of allocation and is recognised on a time-
      proportionate basis in the statement of profit or loss during the period that the allocated shares become unconditional.

fund and the directly insured average pay plan. until the end of 2014, mr van den biggelaar’s pension plan was a
defined contribution for a retirement pension payable from the age of 65, a partner pension, and an orphans’ pension.

      6.28       management estimates and judgements

      the accounting information in the financial statements is partly based on estimates and assumptions. the group makes
      these estimates and makes assumptions about future developments, based on factors such as experience and expectati-
      ons about future events that may reasonably be expected to occur given the current state of affairs. these estimates and
      assumptions are continually reassessed.

      revisions of estimates and assumptions, or differences between estimates and assumptions and actual outcomes, may
      lead to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.

      supplementary to the estimates already described in the accounting policies (section 5) and the explanatory notes (6.1
      to 6.27), the key elements of estimation uncertainty are explained below.
      				
      measurement of projects

  x €1,000

  8.1        general

  the company financial statements are part of the 2015 financial statements of heijmans n.v.
  with reference to the company statement of profit or loss of heijmans n.v., use has been made of the exemption
  pursuant to section 402, book 2 of the dutch civil code. please refer to the notes to the consolidated statement of profit
  or loss and statement of financial position for items in the company statement of profit or loss and statement of
  financial position for which no additional explanations are provided.

  8.2	accounting principles for measuring assets and liabilities and the determination of
       results

  for determining the accounting principles to use for measuring the assets and liabilities and the determination of results of
  its separate financial statements, heijmans n.v. makes use of the option provided in section 362, subsection 8 of book 2 of
  the dutch civil code. this means that the principles to measure assets and liabilities and the determination of results
  (accounting principles) applied in the separate financial statements of heijmans n.v. are the same as those applied in the
  consolidated eu-ifrs financial statements. participating interests over which significant control is exercised are recognised
  using the equity method.

  the share in the result of participating interests consists of the share of heijmans n.v. in the result of these participating
  interests. results from transactions where there is a transfer of assets and liabilities between heijmans n.v. and its participa-
  ting interests or between participating interests themselves are not recognised insofar as they can be deemed to be
  unrealised.

  for details of the remuneration of the members of the supervisory board and the executive board, see note 6.27 to the
  consolidated financial statements.

result appropriation



  in accordance with article 31 of the articles of association, profit is distributed as follows:
  1. subject to the approval of the supervisory board, the executive board transfers as much of the profit to reserves as it
     deems necessary.
  2. insofar as the profit is not transferred to reserves, it is available to the annual general meeting of shareholders in
       whole or in part for transfer to the reserves or in whole or in part for distribution to the holders of ordinary shares in
       proportion to the number of ordinary shares owned.

  subject to approval by the supervisory board, it is proposed to withdraw a sum of €27.3 million from the
  reserves. given the development of both the operating results and the net result in 2015, it will be proposed at the
  general meeting of shareholders that no dividend should be distributed on ordinary shares and depositary receipts for
  ordinary shares.

  dividend policy
  heijmans n.v. maintains a dividend policy whereby, except in special circumstances, the pay-out ratio amounts to 40% of
  the profit from ordinary business operation after tax.

heijmans n.v. is the parent company of a group of
entities. the financial information of this group is
included in the consolidated financial statements of
heijmans n.v.

our group audit in particular focused on the property
development, non-residential and infrastructure
operating segments. we performed the majority of the
audit procedures at those segments ourselves. we also
used the work of other ey and non-ey auditors when
auditing a number of partnerships and foreign activities.
we performed specific audit procedures for several other
entities, including residential building operating sector.
in all, these audit procedures represent the group’s
entire revenues.

by performing the procedures mentioned above at
group entities, together with additional procedures
carried out at group level, we have been able to obtain
sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the
group’s financial information to provide an opinion
about the consolidated financial statements.

      residential
      the stakeholder meeting on 15 july was attended by 7
      different clients and suppliers and the management of
      property development and residential. the strategy was
      explained and questioned at this meeting. the partici-
      pants stated that in their view the chosen course of
      ‘improve and renew’ was the right one. the courage to
      innovate with partners in one ecosystem was seen by
      them as an opportunity for the future. they saw further
      development and increased professionalism of the
      commissioning process as governments decentralise as
      necessary and as an opportunity for the construction
      sector.

      non-residential
      the stakeholder meeting on 19 october was attended by
      9 different clients and suppliers and the management of
      non-residential. the purpose of the meeting was the
      proposition that the focus in the market was more on
      the end users, so that buildings should not only be
      practical but also serve ecological and social goals. the
      question was whether those present endorsed this
      proposition and how this could be reflected by non-
      residential. the participants stated that they had also
      noticed this trend and expected heijmans to take a
      proactive stance. the withdrawal by the government
      and new contract types meant that contractors could
      assume a much greater role and thereby introduce
      innovation. heijmans could help to develop this with an
      ecosystem of knowledge and partners.

        1: a relatively large amount of rubble was removed in 2015 due to the nature of the projects acquired. this also weighs heavily in the
