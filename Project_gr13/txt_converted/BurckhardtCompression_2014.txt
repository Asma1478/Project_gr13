to our shareholders



                                   dear shareholders
                                   the key markets addressed by burckhardt compression exhibited positive developments during
                                   the past year despite the many challenges the world economy was faced with. order intake and
                                   sales were significantly higher in fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year. with exceptionally
                                   high growth in the compressor systems (cs) business area. incoming orders at the components,
                                   services & support (css) business area fell short of expectations. as forecasted during the
                                   reporting of half-year results, the operating profit margin for 2013 of 15.8% was in the lower third
                                   of the long-term target range of 15% to 20%.

                                   annual order intake exceeds half a billion for the first time orders received amounted to
                                   chf 517.1 mn, surpassing the record high from the previous year (chf 427.8 mn) by a substantial
                                   20.9% (22.8% at constant exchange rates). 2013 marked the first time in the history of burckhardt
                                   compression that annual order intake passed the chf 500 mn mark. this result was achieved
                                   thanks to the surge in business at compressor systems, which reported a 41.7% increase in orders
                                   received from chf 272.7 mn to chf 386.3 mn. the components, services & support business
                                   area was unable to repeat its strong performance from the previous year. its order intake of
                                   chf 130.8 mn was 15.7% lower y-o-y (chf 155.1 mn), mainly due to the absence of new contracts
                                   for major revamp/engineering projects.

                                   strong sales growth thanks to compressor systems – lower margins full-year sales of
                                   chf 445.0 mn (plus 21.3%; at constant exchange rates plus 22.4%) marked the highest full-year
                                   sales figure burckhardt compression has ever achieved in its entire history. as in the preceding
                                   two years, sales were higher in the second half than in the first half due to the compressor sys-
                                   tems delivery schedules set by our customers. sales at the components, services & support
                                   business area increased slightly by 0.7% from chf 151.0 mn to chf 152.1 mn. the substantial
                                   increase in sales is largely attributable to the compressor systems business (plus 35.8% to
                                   chf 292.9 mn). gross profit of chf 139.2 mn was 2.4% or chf 3.2 mn higher compared to the pre-
                                   vious fiscal year. this resulted in a gross profit margin of 31.3% (37.1% in the previous year). a shift
                                   in product mix and two larger compressor systems projects that closed with a negative margin
                                   prevented both the cs and css business areas from maintaining their high gross profit margins
                                   from the previous year. operating profit of chf 70.2 mn was slightly less (–4.3%) than in the pre-
                                   vious year, mainly because of the corresponding slight increase in gross profit. the operating
                                   profit margin therefore slipped to 15.8% (20.0% in the previous year). net income declined by 1.8%
                                   from chf 54.9 mn to chf 53.9 mn. net income per share amounted to chf 15.87 (previous year
                                   chf 16.42).

                                   balance sheet remains strong total balance sheet assets increased 8.7% to chf 645.9 mn in
                                   the fiscal year 2013 (chf 594.4 mn in 2012). the equity ratio rose once again, reaching a high
                                   55.5% at the end of the reporting period (54.7% in the previous year). the net financial position
                                   increased by chf 15.0 mn to chf 165.8 mn (march 31, 2014).

further market success in new application areas in the year under review burckhardt com-
pression sold a large number of laby®-gi boil-off gas compressor systems for use on lng carri-
ers. orders were also received for a smaller version of laby®-gi for use on smaller-sized lng
tankers, a new product that allows us to now cover the entire size range of lng carriers. our sub-
sidiary in korea is being expanded to enhance our ability to provide that country’s shipbuilders
with technical expertise. further growth was achieved in the oil and gas production industry with
orders for sour gas compressors that are used to improve oil recovery.

board of directors our director urs fankhauser succumbed to a serious illness and passed away
on february 27, 2014 at the age of 54. mr. fankhauser had served on the board since 2006 and con-
tributed to the company’s positive development in many ways. the process to fill the vacancy on
the board of directors was initiated in march 2014. a corresponding proposal will be submitted to
the annual general meeting on july 4, 2014 with the pending proposals to re-elect the current
members of the board of directors.
                                                                                                         valentin vogt
positive outlook for fiscal year 2014 most of the markets burckhardt compression is active in
continue to show positive developments, especially the application areas petrochemical industry
and gas transport and storage. from today’s standpoint, burckhardt compression expects both
the cs and css business areas to increase their order intake. we also expect a renewed substan-
tial increase in sales compared to the year under review. operating and net profit are likewise
expected to be clearly higher. the second half year will be clearly stronger than the first half year
in terms of sales, opearating and net profit.

increased dividend the board of directors will propose a dividend of chf 10.00 (previous year
chf 9.00) per share at the upcoming annual general meeting. that corresponds to a payout ratio
of 63.0% (previous year 54.8%) of net income, which is in the middle of the targeted range of
50%–70%.

a word of thanks on behalf of the board of directors and the executive board we thank the more
than 1’200 employees for their extraordinary drive and strong commitment. we thank our share-
holders for their ongoing trust and confidence, which strengthens our resolve to steadfastly
implement our long-term strategy. lastly, we wish to thank our customers and our suppliers for
the long-standing partnerships we have built on the basis of mutual respect and trust.                   marcel pawlicek

profit margin of 31.3% (37.1% in the previous year). a shift in prod-
uct mix prevented both the cs and css business areas from
maintaining their high gross profit margins from the previous
year. the lower gross margins in the cs business were further-
more influenced by two large compressor systems projects
which closed with a negative gross profit, while the css business
contained some revamp/engineering projects which did not
match the same high gross margins as achieved in the prior year.

in september 2013 burckhardt compression began using a
leased 4’000 m2 warehouse in the vicinity of winterthur. an
additional assembly hall for the winterthur site had to be found
to accommodate the high order intake in fiscal year 2013. all
hyper compressors will be assembled for the time being at this
warehouse in the future. production capacity in winterthur,
pune and shanghai continued to be modernized and expanded
with top-of-the-line manufacturing equipment.



research & development
development of a new size of laby®-gi compressor
a new frame size for the laby®-gi compressor, which is pri-
marily used for compressing natural gas in on- and offshore
applications, was developed during the past fiscal year. this
gives customers an even broader range of operating possibili-
ties. this latest development allows us to cover the entire
spectrum of lng carrier sizes available today.

successful field tests for stepless flow control system
during the year under review we continued to build our know­
ledge of stepless flow control for reciprocating compressors in
an ongoing field test, including in application areas involving
explosive gases. the process control advantages and energy
savings versus conventional control systems were confirmed in
field tests. these field tests and long-term testing will set the
stage for the subsequent market launch of this new product.

recycling and waste disposal
we dispose of our waste in such a way that as much as possible
is recycled and as little as possible is wasted. internal collec-
tion points ensure that employees sort and dispose of waste in
the correct manner. by implementing such measures, most of
our waste can be recycled. the rest is sent to the neighboring
waste incineration plant, where district heating is generated for
warm water and room heating. specialized companies are hired
to recycle certain materials (e.g. metals), in order to ensure the
materials are recycled in the appropriate and environmentally
friendliest manner. waste management practices were further
improved. friendliest manner. in 2012 the disposal of packing
material and wood was significantly improved. as a result the
total waste declined from 2011 to 2012 from 246 tonnes to 197
tonnes. in the year under review the total amount of waste pro-
portionally rose with the sales increase of 21.3%. we aim to
keep the amount of waste at the current level despite the
higher output.

8.4. information tools of the external auditors
the audit committee assists the board of directors in monitor-
ing the company’s accounting and financial reporting. it assesses
the internal control procedures, the management of business
risks, the audit plan and scope, the conduct of the audits and
their results. the audit committee also reviews the auditor’s
fees. the statutory auditor is present during the examination of
the consolidated annual and semi-annual financial statements.
once a year, the members of the audit committee receive from
the statutory auditor a summary of the audit findings and sug-
gested improvements. the audit committee held two half-day
meetings during fiscal year 2013, in which the auditor in charge
and another representative of the auditor took part.

board of directors
the nomination and compensation committee (ncc) determines
director compensation guidelines. the compensation paid to the
directors and adjustments thereto are determined by the full
board of directors pursuant to the proposals of the ncc.
    compensation paid comprises a fixed cash component, an
additional cash payment for the directors serving on a formal
board committee, and a variable performance- and profit-related
component distributed as shares (free shares).
    up to an including fiscal year 2012 the variable compensa-
tion was based on a percentage of net profit after minorities
generated by the burckhardt compression group and converted
into a specific number of shares using the closing price of bchn
shares at the end of the respective fiscal year. if a minimum
financial target with regard to ebit margin was not achieved,
entitlement to the variable compensation for the corresponding
fiscal year lapsed. if the financial target was at least reached
and the ebit margin was equal to or higher than the returns
achieved by the benchmark, entitlement to the full variable
compensation component was granted; if not, the variable com-
ponent was reduced by 50%. the benchmark consisted of one
direct competitor and two companies selling products in the
same market as burckhardt compression group. the free
shares for the fiscal years 2011 and 2012 were distributed at the
end of june 2013.
    effective as of the fiscal year 2013, adjustments were made
to the variable performance- and profit-related components of
compensation. variable compensation is now based on the
attainment of the net income targets as specified in the mid
range plan for fiscal years 2013 to 2016 and will be calculated
in two allotments as a percentage of the cumulative net income
for the fiscal years 2013 and 2016 and for the fiscal years 2015
and 2016, respectively. a maximum amount in absolute terms
will be set as the upper limit on the awardable variable com-
pensation for each allotment. if a defined minimum amount in

compensation was paid to a total of 13 persons sitting on the
executive board in fiscal year 2013 (fy 2012: 12 persons).
    the increase in fixed cash compensation in the previous
year (fy 2012) is attributable to the overlap of personnel
expenses by four months each during the transition of the func-
tions of the vp design & manufacturing and the md burckhardt
components ag.
    the increase in variable cash compensation is attributable
to the additional person sitting on the executive board and to
the adjustments made during the course of a realignment of
the total compensation package offered to the executive board
members with respect to the percentages of net income gen-
erated by burckhardt compression group that are used to cal-
culate variable compensation. the ceo did not receive any
share-based compensation in the fiscal years prior to 2012.

chf 645.9 mn. inventories grew by chf 30.4 mn, mainly in
work in progress and to some extent also in finished products
and trade merchandise as well as advance payments to suppli-
ers, all related to the higher workload compared to the previous

advance payments increased by chf 6.0 mn, but with a nega-
tive balance of customers’ advance payments versus work in

chf 13.9 mn. shareholders’ equity rose by 10.2% to chf 358.5 mn

2.17. research and development expenses
research costs are recognized as expenses in the period in
which they arise. development costs are recognized as intan-
gible assets if it is highly probable that the project in question
will be commercially successful, is technically feasible and the
related costs can be reliably measured. all other research and
development costs are recognized as expenses as incurred.

2.18. deferred taxes
using the liability method, deferred tax is provided for all tem-
porary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements
prepared in accordance with ifrs. however, if the deferred tax
arises from initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a trans-
action other than a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit
(tax loss), it is not accounted for. deferred taxes are measured
using the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or sub-
stantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realized or the
deferred tax liability is settled.
    deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent of the
probability that future taxable profit will be available, against
which the temporary differences can be utilized.
    deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differ-
ences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associ-
ates, except where burckhardt compression is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and
when it is probable that the temporary differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

2.19. leasing
lease agreements in which a substantial portion of the risks and
rewards associated with ownership of the leased asset remain
with the lessor are classified as operating leases. payments
under operating leases are debited to the income statement on
a straight-line basis over the duration of the lease.

2.20. dividend distribution
dividends distributed to the shareholders of burckhardt com-
pression holding ag are recognized as a liability in the period
in which they are approved by the company’s shareholders.

3. financial risk management
– basic principle the goal of the group-wide risk management
  policy is to minimize the negative impact of changes in the
  financing structure and financial markets, particularly with
  regard to currency fluctuations. derivative financial instru-
  ments such as foreign exchange contracts may be used to
  address the respective risks. burckhardt compression pur-
  sues a conservative, risk averse financial policy. financial risk
  management is based on the principles and regulations estab-
  lished by the board of directors. these govern burckhardt
  compression’s financial policy and outline the conduct and
  powers of the group’s treasury department, which is respon-
  sible for the group-wide management of financial risks. the
  financial principles and regulations govern areas such as
  financing policy, the management of foreign currency risk, the
  use of derivative financial instruments and the investment
  policy applicable to financial resources not required for oper-
  ational purposes.

– liquidity risk each burckhardt compression group company
  is responsible for managing its liquidity so that day-to-day
  business can be handled smoothly, while the group treasury
  is responsible for maintaining the group’s overall liquidity.
  some of the group subsidiaries may secure loans from local
  banks within the limits approved by the group management.
  the group treasury provides the local group companies with
  the necessary funds or invests their excess liquidity. the
  group treasury maintains sufficient liquidity reserves and
  open credit and guarantee lines to fulfill the financial obliga-
  tions at all times.
  	 burckhardt compression follows the principle of security
  before return in the investment of financial resources. the
  liquidity is invested mainly on current accounts and occasion-
  ally in the money market (time deposits with first class finan-
  cial institutions).
  	 the actual and future cash flows and cash reserves are
  compiled monthly in a rolling liquidity forecast. the execu-
  tive board and the board of directors are informed about the
  liquidity situation and outlook with the regular financial
  reporting.

– currency risk burckhardt compression hedges all major
   usd-denominated sales transactions of its swiss entity
   (burckhardt compression ag). eur-denominated sales and
   purchase transactions of the swiss company are fairly evenly
   balanced when viewed over a period of 1–2 years and are
   therefore, to a certain extent, naturally hedged at the net
   profit level over said period. these foreign-exchange flows are
   regularly monitored by the group treasury; if there is evidence
   of a sustained shift in these flows, major sales and purchase
   transactions will be hedged on a case-by-case basis. for this,
   the group treasury normally uses forward exchange con-
   tracts. the other companies belonging to burckhardt com-
   pression group may, after consultation with group treasury,
   hedge the foreign-exchange risks of their sales and purchase
   transactions through local qualified institutions or group
   treasury, the objective being the optimization of the net profit
   of each group company as reported in its functional local cur-
   rency. the group management regularly monitors the changes
   in the most important currencies and may adjust hedging pol-
   icy accordingly in the future.
   	 as a globally active corporation, burckhardt compression
   is also exposed to currency risks resulting from the transla-
   tion into swiss francs of items in the balance sheets of the
   foreign group companies. based on income and invested cap-
   ital, the following currencies are primarily relevant: eur,
   usd, cny and inr. burckhardt compression holding ag does
   not hedge these translation risks.

– income taxes burckhardt compression is obliged to pay
   income taxes in various countries and is therefore required to
   make significant assumptions in order to calculate its world-
   wide tax provision. in the case of a number of transactions
   and calculations, the final tax liability cannot be ultimately
   determined during the normal course of business. where the
   final tax liability arising from these transactions differs from
   the initial assumption, this will affect current and deferred
   taxes in the period in which the tax liability is ultimately
   determined.

  the   amounts shown under expenses by nature are related to the costs of goods manufactured (not cost of goods sold) during the respective fiscal year.
  the higher level in raw materials and consumables is in line with the increase in workload. the increase in salaries and wages is attributable to the increase
   in the headcount to 1’232 as per march 31, 2014 compared to 1’078 as per march 31, 2013.

subsidiary. the decrease in finance costs in fiscal year 2013 is                       four years (22.9%).
mainly achieved through the further reduction of local bank
borrowings by the indian subsidiary and to a smaller extent to
the partial repayment of the mortgage for the real estate in
winterthur.
    as a result of the persisting low level of interest rates,
interest income further dropped from the low prior year level.

28 risk management
burckhardt compression has an integrated risk management
policy. in a two steps process, the board of directors identifies
key risks in an early stage and assigns them into categories of
strategic, financial and operational risks. the risks are then
assessed and processed and consistently monitored, avoided or
reduced through adequate risk management measures. the
first step consists of a continuous risk management process
where risks are systematically identified and assessed in a
periodic leadership cycle at the larger locations of the burck-
hardt compression group in order to define and monitor the
necessary measures with responsible people and deadlines for
the according implementation. the second step consists of a
periodic management review which takes place as part of the
semi-annual meeting of the audit committee of the board of
directors. for this purpose the ceo prepares an overview of the
key risks the burckhardt compression group is exposed to and
presents an assessment of the probability of such risks to hap-
pen and the impact they could have on the group. the presen-
tation is given to the audit committee of the board of directors
together with adequate measures and responsible people and
deadlines to implement these measures. the audit committee
then informs the full board about the findings of the risk man-
agement review.

29 events after the balance sheet date
the board of directors and the executive board were not aware
of any significant events occurring after the balance sheet date
when the consolidated financial statements were approved on
may 20, 2014.
