our commitment

ceo letter
message from ursula burns, chairman and chief executive ofﬁcer


dear stakeholders:


at xerox, global citizenship is wired into everything we do.


from our earliest days, we have believed that a successful company should provide both business and
social beneﬁts.


that thinking has led us to consider human, economic and environmental impacts as we develop
products, services and solutions, manage our operations, drive innovation, engage with our customers,
partners and shareholders, and care for our employees and communities. it also inﬂuences how we hold
ourselves to the highest standards of integrity, ethics, diversity and accountability.


as you explore this year’s global citizenship report, you will see many examples of how we translate
that commitment and passion into our operations, products and programs. these achievements would
not be possible without the dedication of our global team members who deliver outstanding service to
our customers, while supporting the communities we serve.


we are proud of the positive effects of our citizenship efforts, and we are even more excited for the
possibilities ahead as we separate into two market-leading companies — xerox and conduent
incorporated. citizenship will continue to be integral to both companies. each will carry forward our
values and culture, including a steadfast commitment to integrity, innovation, sustainability and
community.


we look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress as we work to better the world around us.




                                                                                                        2/137

how we report
this report describes xerox’s global principles, policies and programs through september 2016, unless
otherwise noted. it provides in-depth information in broad areas of corporate social responsibility,
including governance and ethics, customer privacy and satisfaction, employee diversity and
development, environmental initiatives, corporate donations and volunteerism, and much more.


we report yearly on our progress, including changes to our business and emerging issues. this report
was prepared using the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 sustainability reporting guidelines and
contains standard disclosures. a table linking the content of this report to the gri g4 standard
disclosures can be found here. third party assurance was received for the energy and ghg emission
data in this report.


much of the information in this report reﬂects the activities of xerox in the countries where we do
business. some of our systems for collecting and reporting reliable social and environmental
performance data, however, do not always cover all of our operations. where appropriate, we identify
operations excluded from speciﬁc disclosures. environmental data in this report that is normalized to our
ﬁnancial performance utilizes company revenues as reported using generally accepted accounting
principles (gaap). fuji xerox publishes its own citizenship report. information about gri is available at
www.globalreporting.org.

our commitment

materiality
in 2016, we updated our materiality matrix to align with global reporting initiative (gri) g4
guidelines, company strategy and stakeholder feedback. we examined changing external factors
including regulations and standards, social challenges people face around the world, our evolving
business model, and the environmental impact of our products, services, processes and operations. our
assessment included an array of fact-ﬁnding forums including interviews and workshops with internal
stakeholders and xerox leaders. we reﬂected on discussions with external stakeholders as well as
feedback from our employees and concluded:


     managing operations responsibly across our value chain — from decreasing environmental impact
     and protecting customer privacy to promoting diversity and ensuring ethical behavior — remains a
     priority for xerox.
     product, service and operations-related opportunities, such as improving energy efﬁciency and
     expanding access to technology, represent the leading areas where we can create value for society
     and for our business. enhancing health, safety and labor conditions in our global value chain is
     among the most important ways we can drive sustainable development.

with these ﬁndings, we updated corporate social responsibility (csr) goals and priorities, further
deﬁned our governance structure and reafﬁrmed the importance of our partnerships with non-
government organizations, customers, academia and regulatory agencies. our code of conduct covering
human rights, ethics and sustainability continues to be the foundation of our management approach
to which we hold our employees and global suppliers accountable.

preserving the planet

goals and progress
through our people, innovation and partnerships, we create solutions that reduce environmental impact
and expand opportunities. we have conducted a comprehensive review of the environmental impact of
our company and have identiﬁed four strategic commitment areas where we can make a signiﬁcant
positive impact:


1. reducing energy use and protecting the climate
   we invest in technologies that reduce the carbon footprint of our operations and offer solutions to
   our customers that reduce energy use, cost and waste.

2. preserving the world’s forests and biodiversity
   xerox works with partners to advance a sustainable paper cycle through environmentally sound
   paper offerings, advances in forest management standards, and products and services that reduce
   ofﬁces’ dependency on paper.

3. preserving clean air and water
   we work to eliminate the use of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials throughout the
   supply chain. we look for ways to use water efﬁciently and to avoid the release of hazardous air
   emissions from our products and facilities worldwide.

4. preventing and managing waste
   our goal is to produce waste-free products and services for our customers and operate waste-free
   facilities across our real estate portfolio and within our customers’ workplaces.




                                                                                                         27/137

1 products end-of-life management: returns processed through xerox's worldwide asset recovery centers and 3rd party
recyclers. 2012 data adjusted to include units sold as used through new resale program introduced 4th quarter 2012. in
2014, xerox's operation in itatiaia brazil sent surplus parts to landﬁll as part of a one-time clean-up. this resulted in a
decrease in the reuse/recycle rate of products and consumables returned to xerox.


2 in 2012, the supplies returns program changed the array of cartridges and bottles accepted. the weights of those
containers also changed. the data was restated to reﬂect more accurate volumes. the 2013 supplies remanufacturing
volumes were restated to reﬂect an error discovered in the total units returned.


3 the greenhouse gas inventory is based on the new xerox energy goal which began in 2013 using 2012 as baseline and
encompasses ﬂeet and facilities for the xerox technology business and xerox services. note: the 2012 baseline has been
restated. in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol, inventory adjustments are completed each year as a result of
the opening and closing of facilities and the use of more appropriate emission factors to make data and performance
trends between years more comparable.
note: the new energy goal 2020 uses 2012 as baseline. units of measure are 1000 mt co2eq.

                                                                                                                                  31/137

4 direct emissions from natural gas and fuel used in ﬂeet of xerox sales and service personnel and natural gas consumed
in facility boilers for facilities both leased and owned by xerox. emissions for facilities are based on actual data as
reported on utility invoices, with estimates for remainder of facilities in the inventory using commercial building energy
consumption (cbec) energy use factors. emissions from ﬂeet are based on actual fuel receipts and vehicle efﬁciency rates.
note that 2012, 2013 and 2014 data has been re-stated as new emission factors were used and the facilities inventory
has been updated.


5 indirect emissions of greenhouse gases include emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity and steam for
facilities leased and owned by xerox. cbec energy use factors were used to include estimated emissions for ofﬁce and
warehouse facilities where data is not readily available (us and canada). hfc emissions were estimated based on square
feet. note that 2012, 2013 and 2014 data has been re-stated as new emission factors were used and the facilities
inventory has been updated.


6 indirect emissions for worldwide xerox services data centers, located in the u.s. and europe. based on actual data as
reported on utility invoices in the u.s. and the u.k. estimates were used for the remaining data centers, based on the
average energy consumption per square foot using power usage effectiveness (pue). in december 2014, we announced
an agreement to sell our information technology outsourcing (ito) business to atos and began reporting it as a
discontinued operation. the sale was completed on june 30, 2015. the data centers are associated with the ito business
and the majority of them have been transferred to atos upon closure of the sale of the ito business.


7 renewable energy and renewable energy credits. it does not include the renewable energy available by default in the
power grid. this encompasses use of 100% energy in the u.k and the netherlands and rec's from wind from wilsonville,
oregon. total energy encompasses ﬂeet and facilities for the xerox technology business and xerox services.


8 includes worldwide air travel emissions for total xerox, as provided by xerox's global travel services provider, based on
aircraft, load, and miles. assumes 147,000 global employees.


9 non-hazardous solid waste: process waste consists primarily of paper, wood pallets, waste toner, plastics and packaging
waste such as corrugated cardboard; equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal, waste batteries and lamps,
miscellaneous trash, and end-of-life equipment and parts. increases in energy from waste and landﬁll volumes in 2015 are
related to disposition of stored toner inventories in brazil.


10 % non-hazardous solid waste to landﬁll/incineration restated to include treatment volumes.


11 hazardous waste volumes referenced in the report represent xerox's technology business only.


12 the majority of air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner, photoreceptor drums
and belts, and fuser rolls. data has been restated from prior years to include air emissions data from brazil photoreceptor
manufacturing operations and minor, overlooked byproduct emissions.


13 nox and sox emissions are calculated using emission factors applicable to small boilers from the epa's ap-42, vol.1,
ch1.4: natural gas combustion (http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch01/ﬁnal/c01s04.pdf). 2012-2014 data has been
revised to ensure consistency with facility occupancy assumptions made for ghg reporting purposes.


14 operations with on-site reportable toxic chemical releases to the air, land, or water in amounts of greater than one
metric ton were established in 2011 with goals, targets and objectives related to chemical releases.


15 reduction accomplished by reclaiming and distilling waste mibk from fuser roll manufacturing. normalized to number

16 total amount of methylene chloride used to produce xerox photoreceptor components.


17 from toner resin manufacturing, normalized to volume of resin produced. baseline reset to 7.14 lbs./batch in 2015 due
to changes in inventory management practices.


18 water consumption increased slightly in 2014 due to volume increases not being fully offset by conservation efforts.

preserving the planet

responsible operations
reducing our company-wide carbon footprint
while our ultimate goal is to be climate-neutral, our ﬁrst priority is to reduce our total greenhouse gas
(ghg) emissions by lowering the energy intensity of our operations. xerox is ﬁnding success with the
following approaches:


     shifts toward energy-efﬁcient technologies such as emulsion aggregation (ea) toner, which is
     estimated to generate 28 percent fewer ghg emissions in the manufacturing process than
     conventional toner
     process improvements including using digital multifunction systems in our workplaces instead of
     stand-alone printers, copiers, fax machines and scanners
     energy management and equipment upgrades such as utilizing outdoor pipes to cool process water
     in winter months (rather than powered industrial chillers) and replacing outdated heating and
     cooling systems with energy-efﬁcient and digitally controlled models
     use of renewable energy sources to power our facilities (our u.k. facilities are entirely powered by
     green energy) or to offset energy use (our webster, new york; wilsonville, oregon; and dallas,
     texas, facilities in the united states voluntarily use renewable energy or credits to offset a portion
     of electricity consumption)
     efﬁciency-promoting initiatives including purchasing energy-efﬁcient lighting and vehicles, reducing
     packaging sizes, mileage tracking and route efﬁciencies



data in this section associated with air emissions, releases, water, hazardous and non-hazardous waste

energy goal 2020
in 2003, we made a public commitment to reduce ghg emissions — our carbon footprint — by joining
the u.s. epa climate leaders program and launching an internal program known as energy challenge
2012.


this 10-year initiative set a goal to reduce ghg emissions across all company operations by 10 percent
by 2012. we met this target six years ahead of schedule, so we set a new target of 25 percent
reduction by 2012 (from a 2002 baseline). at the conclusion of the program, we successfully cut
emissions by 42 percent — that’s 210,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e) — and reduced
energy consumption by 31 percent.


our new corporate-wide goal is to reduce energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020 (from a 2012
baseline). in 2015, we reduced energy consumption by 12 percent and cut emissions by 20 percent —
that’s 65,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e).*


*excludes data centers numbers. energy challenge 2012 included ﬂeet and facilities for the technology business (and
services where co-located). energy goal 2020 encompasses all parts of our business.



energy consumption




energy and ghg emissions totals are associated with fuel consumption by company-owned ﬂeet and natural
gas/electricity consumption in facilities. vendor invoices from utility and fuel providers are the preferred source of data,
when unavailable, estimations have been used.


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol and to make annual data comparable, we adjust the energy and
emissions data each year as a result of the opening and closing of facilities and more appropriate emission factors that
are available.




                                                                                                                               35/137

greenhouse gas inventory
in keeping with the international guidelines of the greenhouse gas protocol developed by the world
resources institute and the world business council for sustainable development, we track the six major
ghgs: carbon dioxide (co2), methane (ch4), nitrous oxide (n2o), hydroﬂuorocarbons (hfcs),
perﬂuorocarbons (pfcs) and sulfur hexaﬂuoride (sf6). we express our carbon footprint in terms of
carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e).


energy sources account for more than 99 percent of our ghg emissions. our ghg inventory includes
direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, primarily natural gas and indirect emissions from
purchased electricity and steam at our manufacturing sites, ofﬁces and warehouses. the inventory also
includes the combustion of gasoline and diesel fuels in our service and sales vehicle ﬂeet.


in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol, inventory adjustments are completed each year as a
result of the opening and closing of facilities and changes to the vehicle ﬂeet; as reﬂected in energy
consumption and ghg emission charts. we have expanded our ghg tracking to include scope 3
emissions, from employee business travel, product transport, employee commute and waste generated in
operations.


in 2015, xerox ghg emissions totaled 261,071 metric tons of co2e. about 57 percent were indirect
emissions from purchased electricity and steam. the remaining 43 percent were direct emissions from
the combustion of natural gas, gasoline and diesel fuel. xerox-owned or leased facilities, such as
manufacturing sites, ofﬁces and warehouses, are associated with 54 percent of our direct ghg
emissions. the remaining 46 percent are direct emissions from our service and sales vehicle ﬂeet and
other mobile sources.

the assessment of scope 3 emissions poses many challenges due to the large number of variables, the
difﬁculty in collecting data from suppliers and increasing uncertainty in the data as the sources become
further removed from the company. we have begun calculating scope 3 emissions according to the wri
scope 3 accounting standard. we will use the information to prioritize our ghg emission reduction
opportunities and to integrate consideration of carbon impact into sourcing and internal decision-
making.


our scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 ghg emissions have been veriﬁed by a third party

climate change risks and opportunities
xerox has examined the regulatory, physical and commercial risks and opportunities associated with
climate change across our value chain.


we assess and manage our carbon risk by maintaining both a robust ghg emissions inventory and a
mature regulatory tracking function that provides the necessary information to stay abreast of
developing regulation. we do not consider our company to be subject to unique risks due to changing
weather patterns, rising temperatures and sea levels, but we recognize that our business could be
impacted by more frequent disruptions as a result of severe weather in locations where we operate. we
may also need to invoke our business continuity and resumption plans to aid customers who are
impacted by business disruptions due to severe weather. we’re experienced in working with customers
to ensure continuity of critical applications by prioritizing business needs and developing customer-
speciﬁc preparedness plans where appropriate. our business resumption plans include communication
with employees and customers, management of employee health and safety issues, business continuity
and resumption processes, and interaction with government organizations.


we recognize that the increasing costs of energy and concerns around energy security are issues that
affect both our operations and those of our customers. our commitment to reduce energy use in our
operations was driven in part by cost savings, and we recognized that helping our customers to reduce
energy costs through more efﬁcient document solutions could increase our revenues.


our immediate (short-term) focus is reducing energy consumption in our own operations as we make
progress toward achieving our corporate goal of 20 percent reduction by 2020. we strive to provide
sustainable document management technology solutions to our customers to reduce the energy and
environmental impacts of their business.


to meet our commitment for “reducing energy use and protecting the climate,” our long-term (more
than three-year) strategy is to continue to invest in technologies that reduce the carbon footprint of our
operations and develop technology solutions that help our customers to reduce the energy and
environmental impacts of their business. our ultimate aim is to be carbon-neutral.


we invest in innovation, market leadership and sound management practices that deliver measurable
beneﬁts to the environment, our customers and society and that also increase shareholder value. we
recognize the importance of creative partnerships with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders to
achieve these beneﬁts and maximize their value. being smart with product innovation is an important
part of sector leadership.


we are well positioned for current and potential future regulation by our investment in a robust ghg
emission inventory. we are currently gathering scope 3 emissions data and other key metrics to assess
climate change risk in the supply chain.

preserving clean air and water


air emissions
xerox has signiﬁcantly reduced manufacturing air emissions over the past 20 years. continuous
improvement remains a priority.


most of our air emissions originate from the production of imaging supplies such as toner,
photoreceptor drums and belts, and fuser rolls. approximately 22 tonnes of volatile organic process air
emissions (voc and non-voc) were released to the atmosphere from these production activities in
2015. emission reductions, over time, have primarily come from process modiﬁcation, lower production
volumes of legacy products coated using organic solvents, and production declines attributable to
longer-life components.


volatile organic process air emissions




2013–2014 emissions have been revised in this report to reﬂect the inclusion of brazilian photoreceptor emissions, which
are now quantiﬁed on the basis of annual monitoring, and relatively small amounts of byproduct emissions that were
better quantiﬁed in 2015.


a subset of these volatile organic process emissions is deﬁned by the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa) as hazardous air pollutants (hap). in 2015, xerox reported worldwide air emissions of
approximately 5 metric tons of hap under national toxic chemical release regulations, including the
united states’ toxics release inventory (tri) program. methylene chloride, methyl isobutyl ketone
(mibk), 1,3-butadiene and styrene represent virtually all of these hap emissions.




                                                                                                                           39/137

2015 hap air emissions
as reported under national toxic release regulations




ozone-depleting substances
xerox policy prohibits the use of ozone-depleting substances (ods) as ingredients in products, spare
parts, accessories and packaging. ozone-depleting substances are used as refrigerants in facility and
vehicle air conditioning systems and various food/equipment-cooling systems. although ods may be
released during the normal operation and failure of these systems, the total amount released is not
signiﬁcant from a company-wide perspective. elimination of ods as refrigerant is managed consistent
with government phase-out dates.


toxic chemical releases
the release of materials used in our worldwide operations is evaluated annually and reported to
government agencies under national toxic chemical release reporting regulations, such as the u.s. toxics
release inventory, the canadian national pollutant release inventory, and the european pollutant
release and transfer register. releases for reporting year 2015 were 14 percent lower than 2014 levels
and 75 percent lower than 2007 levels. in 2015, reportable releases and transfers decreased primarily
due to decreases in the amount of organic solvent used in production manufacturing processes.




                                                                                                           40/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report


reportable toxic chemical releases and transfers




in 2011, operations with reportable toxic chemical releases to the air, land or water — in amounts of
greater than one metric ton — established goals, targets and objectives related to chemical releases.
progress against these goals as of year-end 2015 is summarized below:


     an initiative to reclaim spent methyl isobutyl ketone (mibk) continued to exceed expectations in
     the fourth full year of implementation. recovered solvent was qualiﬁed for use as a cleaning
     solvent for the ﬂuid delivery systems used in u.s. fuser roll coating operations. as a result, the
     amount of virgin mibk purchased in 2015 for use in the manufacturing operation has been
     reduced by 36 percent from the 2010 baseline on a normalized, per-part basis.
     the amount of methylene chloride used to manufacture xerox photoreceptor belts was reduced by
     more than 62 percent from the 2010 baseline, greatly exceeding target. this dramatic reduction
     was primarily due to volume declines of legacy products and process modiﬁcations that reduced
     the amount of methylene chloride used for batch cleaning of production equipment.
     emissions of 1,3-butadiene from u.s. toner resin manufacturing operations slightly exceeded the
     normalized, per-batch target in 2015, primarily due to an accidental 14-pound release that
     occurred during the year. low-emission hose connectors were installed to offset increases in
     transfer losses caused by a more frequent delivery schedule.

spills and accidental releases
our goal is to prevent all environmental releases of regulated materials to air, soil and water. we have
greatly reduced the frequency of spills and accidental releases, though we have not yet reached our
target of eliminating these events.


in 2015, our north american operations identiﬁed four reportable accidental spills/releases. three events
occurred at our monroe county, new york, location. two of the three were contained and did not reach
the environment. one of the events went to a containment system with minimal impact to the



                                                                                                            41/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

environment. the fourth event occurred at our oklahoma city, oklahoma location. it was an accidental
release to air that occurred after a maintenance activity. corrective measures for all spills and releases
were put in place to minimize the potential for these types of incidents to occur in the future.


water consumption and treatment
as part of our commitment to conserve resources, we monitor water consumption across our
manufacturing, distribution and r&d facilities worldwide. water consumed by xerox operations is
sourced from local municipal suppliers who withdraw water from the ground, lakes, rivers or other
surface waters.


our current goal is to reduce water consumption by 35 percent by 2020 (against a 2010 baseline).
water consumption in 2015 was down 38 percent against the 2020 goal.


in 2015, a major contributor to reduced water consumption was manufacturing consolidation activities.


a pilot program was initiated at our plant in wilsonville, oregon to evaluate the use of reverse osmosis
reject water for a secondary purpose. the water will be utilized to supply cooling towers at the site.
currently, this water is sent to the sanitary sewer and ultimately to the publically owned treatment
works. projections indicate approximate water savings of up to ﬁve percent of purchased water per year.


the water discharges at manufacturing sites are monitored to validate compliance with local sanitary
sewer discharge limits. wastewater from manufacturing processes is treated, as necessary, before being
discharged into local sanitary sewers. we utilize best practices to prevent unwanted pollutants from
entering waterways via surface contamination and run-off. extensive sampling of wastewater,
discharged to both sanitary and storm sewers, ensures that discharged water meets our strict
requirements.




                                                                                                             42/137

hazardous waste
there were no signiﬁcant changes to our worldwide hazardous waste volumes in 2015. xerox beneﬁcially
managed 69 percent of the hazardous waste generated in 2015 through recycling and/or fuels blending
technologies.


we do not export hazardous waste to developing nations. a third party supplier is contracted to recover
spent methyl isobutyl ketone; this material is returned to us to support ongoing coating operations.
solid and liquid hazardous waste streams that have an adequate btu value are managed via a fuels
blending program. an off-site waste disposal vendor blends these waste streams to meet the
speciﬁcations provided by cement kilns.

non-hazardous solid waste
we have had major waste reduction efforts in place for many years. we reuse boxes, pallets and
containers for parts delivery. we recapture toner that is outside the acceptable size range during
manufacturing, recycle returned equipment and reuse totes for recycling scrap metal and paper.


we have an aspirational goal to drive our reuse/recycle rate to 100% by 2020 at our technology
facilities compared to a baseline year of 2009. additionally, xerox has committed to developing a
process to collect and track solid waste data at all of our services facilities.


our global manufacturing operations and all facilities in monroe county, new york generated 47,100
metric tons of non-hazardous solid waste in 2015, up slightly from 44,000 metric tons in 2014. process
waste consists primarily of paper, wood, pallets, waste toner, plastics and packaging waste such as
corrugated cardboard. equipment manufacturing waste includes scrap metal, waste batteries and lamps,
miscellaneous trash, and non-usable end-of-life equipment and parts that our customers return to xerox
for processing and remanufacturing. this waste made up about 71 percent of the non-hazardous solid
waste managed by xerox operations in 2015. xerox is able to reuse or recycle over 98% of the waste
generated from our customer returns.


in 2015, we managed 94 percent of non-hazardous solid waste beneﬁcially, up from 93 percent in 2014.
the increased reuse/recycle rate can be attributed to an increase in our manufacturing operations using
energy from waste technology for non-recyclables in 2015. additionally, in 2015 our equipment resellers
were able to return a number of products to the marketplace for resale. that resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction of all non-hazardous waste. please note that the reuse/recycle rate has been revised from
previous years to more accurately represent non-hazardous waste management methods.

environmental remediation and compliance
in 1985, we began a voluntary assessment program that identiﬁed 68 of our worksites requiring
remediation. we worked closely with the appropriate federal, state and local agencies to initiate prompt
and appropriate measures to ensure the protection of employees, neighbors and the environment.


today, only two of the original 68 sites still require active remedial or control measures. we have
removed or greatly reduced the source areas of contamination and have remediated these properties for
reuse or redevelopment. our remedial focus is now shifting to establishing the completion of required
post remediation compliance monitoring at sites no longer subject to active remediation so the
regulatory process for managing these sites can ofﬁcially be terminated.


in addition to using conventional techniques for groundwater recovery and treatment and soil
excavation, we have a history of developing innovative remedial technologies to enhance our remedial
efforts. these included techniques that improve and accelerate the recovery of contaminants such as
high-vacuum 2-phase extraction and enhanced bedrock fracturing. we also employ technologies where
contaminants are converted to less-harmful substances through enhanced natural biodegradation and
chemical oxidation.


compliance reporting
we require our various operations and subsidiaries worldwide to report allegations of regulatory
violations to our ehs&s group for tracking, evaluation and corrective action, where appropriate. in 2015,
ﬁve instances resulted in a notice of violation. two were administrative due to late ﬁling of reports.
three others involved exceeding wastewater discharge limits: one of which resulted in a penalty. all
issues have been abated and closed out with the relevant authorities, and we’ve established appropriate
controls to ensure ongoing compliance.




                                                                                                            48/137

reducing environmental impact through our services and solutions
our expanding services business offers solutions that reduce energy consumption and improve
environmental performance.


we provide an array of solutions to improve the productivity of transportation systems, customer care
and back-ofﬁce processing. an added beneﬁt of many of these solutions is the opportunity to decrease
environmental impact through reduced electricity usage, reduction in paper waste and reduced
consumption of gasoline. for example, xerox’s merge™ parking solution uses occupancy data from
meters, sensors and collection systems to enable rates to vary by location and time of day to create
availability. this reduces time spent searching for on-street parking, reducing fuel usage and leading to
associated air quality improvements. the merge™ parking management system was recently recognized
as a “product of the year” by environmental leader, a leading daily trade publication. our electronic toll

industry labeling standards for each market.


lifecycle assessment
xerox integrates lifecycle thinking into all of our product and service development activities as well as
our innovation activities. lifecycle assessments (lcas) are a means of technically evaluating the
environmental impact of a product’s materials, manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life. we
conduct full lcas — in accordance with the appropriate iso standards — to determine where in the
product lifecycle the largest environmental impacts arise and to compare products with a signiﬁcant
difference in technology. full peer-reviewed lcas have been conducted on our solid ink products (8860,
8870, 8700 and colorqube 9200 series) and many of our laser technology devices (workcentre
5325/30/35, workcentre 5945/55, and phaser 7100). in 2015 we completed 14 cradle-to-grave peer-
reviewed lcas on xerox printer and multifunctional device conﬁgurations. the completion of these lcas
directly contributed to achieving epeat gold certiﬁcation for these conﬁgurations and provided valuable
input to our design teams to determine future opportunities for reductions in environmental impacts.
we encourage our customers to learn more about how their printing behavior affects the overall carbon
footprint of their organization from a lifecycle perspective.


product design
xerox has long incorporated environmental considerations into product design. scientists in our
materials research group evaluate aspects of safety, energy, materials and sustainability (sems) using a
tool we developed that allows researchers to quickly compare the current design with a future proposed
design. the tool challenges designers to think about the whole lifecycle of the product and recognize
any positive or negative impacts to the environment. by using sems, we can quantify energy reductions,
reduce risk of regulated materials and track progress over time. sems was designed to be used in early
research and development stages to understand tradeoffs and help make decisions early in the product
lifecycle.


epeat®
for ofﬁce products, xerox uses the electronic products environmental assessment tool (epeat ®) as the
foundation of our design for environment program. a comprehensive environmental rating system,
epeat® identiﬁes electronic equipment that meets speciﬁc criteria. it combines comprehensive criteria
for design, production, energy use and recycling with ongoing independent veriﬁcation of manufacturer
claims.


epeat® criteria reﬂect several categories of environmental attributes that span the lifecycle of electronic
products: material selection, design for end-of-life, product longevity/life extension, energy conservation,
end-of-life management, corporate performance, packaging, consumables and indoor air quality. xerox
continues to support epeat initiatives and has a representative on the epeat advisory council to
promote collaboration between stakeholders and aid in the success of the program moving forward.
since 2014 xerox has committed to launching all new ofﬁce products with epeat silver or gold. xerox is
the only company to claim all eight corporate optional criteria.

reducing energy use through our products and technology
     energy star®
     more than 10 years before the inception of the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)
     energy star® ofﬁce equipment program, xerox introduced the ﬁrst imaging product with an
     automatic power-down mode. since joining with the epa as a charter partner in 1993, we continue
     to introduce copier, printer, fax and multifunction products that have earned energy star ® status,
     even as the certiﬁcation criteria have grown more stringent.

     in 2015, 100 percent of all our new eligible product introductions achieved energy star ®. this
     continued success in cutting the power consumption of our laser-based printing products has been
     achieved by adjustments in the fuser design, changes to the properties of the toner, more efﬁcient
     electronic controls and the workings of the xerographic system as a whole.

     the energy star® program introduces progressively more stringent requirements over time, with
     the most recent revision having gone into effect january 1, 2014. while the new standard was
     challenging to meet, our goal remains to have 100 percent of new product introductions achieve
     this label.

     multifunction devices
     our multifunction systems further reduce the amount of energy required to copy, print, fax and
     scan by combining the functions of multiple products into one machine. the annual energy savings
     of replacing several individual energy star®-qualiﬁed copiers, fax machines and printers with one
     xerox energy star-qualiﬁed workcentre multifunction system is up to one-half. energy savings
     would be substantially higher if a multifunction system replaces individual products that have not
     earned the energy star® rating.

     xerox connectkey™
     connectkey is a software solution that enables information to be moved to and from the cloud
     without the security risks that commonly exist. cloud computing is an alternative to large data
     centers and is being recognized worldwide as less energy intensive than data centers while
     generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. in addition, xerox connectkey™ and cisco energywise
     enable energy management by allowing for control, management, and reporting of a device’s
     power consumption and the setting of power states and timeout intervals.

deinkability
in recent years, deinkability has become an area of increasing concern, particularly among our graphic
communications customers. ensuring that prints produced with our equipment and materials can be
responsibly managed at the end of their useful life is an important consideration in our product
development process. when appropriate, independent testing conﬁrms that these prints pose no unique
challenges to the recycling stream. while the deinkability of xerographic prints has long been
demonstrated, a key milestone for a new technology came in 2010 when the cipress printer achieved a
“good deinkability” rating from ingede, the international association of the deinking industry.


paper use
our equipment and software is designed to help customers operate efﬁciently. the “earth smart”
feature, integrated into the xerox global print driver, brings several resource-saving settings together at
the single click of a button. these features, such as duplex (two-sided printing), n-up (multiple pages per
sheet), proof print and toner saving modes, make it easier for customers to make responsible print
choices. xerox enterprise print services customers have access to sophisticated print management and
reporting tools, such as xerox print agent, which provides additional methods of encouraging and
tracking responsible print behavior. software products such as docushare ® and freeflow ® digital
workﬂow collection help xerox customers reduce paper consumption by facilitating electronic data
management, scan to email, print-on-demand and distribute-then-print workﬂows. xerox has also been

                                                                                                              51/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

exploring creative ways to engage employees in the sustainability effort. the xerox ® print awareness
tool is an innovative solution that allows employees to view graphical representations of print usage
and take an active role in helping their organization reach print reduction targets.


packaging and distribution
packaging and distribution are integral parts of our product commercialization process. we strive to
eliminate, reduce, reuse and recycle packaging. we document our expectations in our environment
health and safety requirements for packaging standard — ehs-710, and also in our general packaging
standard — 88p311. our commercial equipment is designed and tested extensively to be shipped
without requiring any packaging. we strive to eliminate or reduce packaging wherever feasible, which
conserves natural resources and decreases fuel use for distribution; a sustainability win for business and
the environment.


we also offer the xerox® automated packaging solution. this system uses the latest in document
technology to print, ﬁnish and cut customized folding cartons in short runs. by creating packaging
quickly and cost-effectively, this solution enhances materials efﬁciencies as well as decreasing
obsolescence through the creation of customized boxes and containers. automated packaging reduces
ﬁnancial and environmental costs associated with warehousing, storage and disposal; an advantage for
focused marketing campaigns and rapidly changing competitive markets.


a few examples that illustrate our commitment to sustainability in this area:


developer housing assembly — converting to use of molded pulp
for many years our principal supplier shipped housing assemblies to us packed in foam. we moved
production to the u.s. and redesigned the packaging to allow us to take advantage of readily recyclable
molded pulp solutions.


the expanded polystyrene endcaps, weighing 68 grams each and measuring 5 inches in length, 6.5
inches in width and 6 inches in height per side were replaced with molded pulp endcaps. the result was
a decrease in our material footprint large enough to increase the amount of product per unit load from
77 units per pallet to 144, an increase of 87 percent. this eliminated 4,800 kilograms (10,575 lbs.) and
8,559 cubic feet of foam annually; reducing costs and also conserving natural resources.


workcentre 7120 customer replaceable units (crus) — reducing our footprint
as with our developer housing assemblies, we redesigned packaging provided to us by a large supplier of
color workcentre 7120 crus by removing polystyrene endcaps and reducing the size of the package.
the result was a reduction of 4,725 kilograms (10,417 lbs.) or 27,756 cubic feet of polystyrene waste
annually, and a 27 percent increase of product per unit load.


xerox replacement cartridges (xrc) — reducing solid waste
for xrc products, xerox packaging engineers replaced hot wire expanded polystyrene endcaps with
inﬂatable air bags. upon receipt of the package, the air bags are easily deﬂated, producing far less solid
waste by mass and cubic volume compared to polystyrene, creating an environmentally preferable
alternative.


materials
we have made a long-term commitment to eliminate the use of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic
materials throughout our supply chain by applying strict internal standards and by tightly managing




                                                                                                             52/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

chemicals in our supply chain. our supplier requirements are periodically updated as regulations change
and new information becomes available. all new product designs refer to these requirements, and
suppliers are expected to verify their compliance with them. learn more at www.xerox.com/environment.


toxicologists conduct a comprehensive assessment of new materials in our products to ensure
conformance with applicable global registration, hazard communication, and waste handling and
disposal requirements. as a result of our stringent requirements, xerox toners and printing products are
non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic. in addition, these products do not cause adverse developmental
or reproductive effects; pose a toxicity hazard to humans or aquatic species; cause a permanent adverse
impact to the skin, eyes or respiratory system; or have the potential to generate federally regulated
hazardous waste. we were the ﬁrst in our industry to evaluate the health effects of toner and did so for
over 30 years.


our requirements for minimizing toxic materials govern our product design and materials selection. we
have re-engineered or eliminated processes to dramatically reduce the use of toxins and heavy metals
and have made substantial progress in eliminating the use of mercury. mercury-containing lamps that
scan images and backlight user displays are being phased out as alternatives become available.


our safety and supplier processes enable us to meet global regulations governing chemical use. since
2007, xerox’s newly launched products have been designed to meet the european union’s restriction of
hazardous substances (rohs) requirements in all markets. however, where regulations allow, some
products may contain parts with small amounts of rohs substances in order to avoid premature
disposal of existing parts that continue to have usable life. similar types of legislation continue to be
implemented in many other market regions. through our proactive regulatory tracking process, we
expect to be fully compliant with all aspects of these regulations as the provisions become effective and
applicable.


in 2015, xerox was informed by two suppliers that certain units of several product families shipped in
the second half of 2014 and in 2015 may not comply with the european union’s rohs recast directive.
the concern was limited to small plastic parts in some of the affected units containing a small amount
of cadmium which exceeded permitted limits, and a small capacitor in other units containing a small
amount of lead, also slightly in excess of limits. xerox stopped shipment of the affected units within our
control and inventory was reworked with compliant parts. affected product already placed at customer
locations is being reworked on a “next service call” basis for the cadmium containing plastic parts, while
the lead in the capacitor is being addressed at machine end-of-life. there is no customer or employee
exposure or risk in either instance. in accordance with applicable regulations, xerox self-reported these
nonconformities to the relevant authorities who assessed no penalties.


third-party supplies sold by xerox
xerox sells imaging supplies through its distribution network that are manufactured by other companies
for use in other oem printers. manufacturing processes combine patented and patent pending
technology, environmental management principles and proven waste prevention manufacturing and
recycling processes. we thoroughly review these supplies to ensure compliance with appropriate
regulatory requirements. in addition, we also assess against our own stringent standards. the results of
these reviews ultimately determine which products carry the xerox brand. information is provided on
safety data sheets (sds), which have been recently updated to meet the requirements of the globally
harmonized system of classiﬁcation and labeling of chemicals (ghs) as implemented through
regulations in our various markets.




                                                                                                             53/137

end-of-life management
our aim is to design products, packaging and supplies that make efﬁcient use of resources, minimize
waste, reuse material where feasible and recycle what can’t be reused. to meet this commitment, we
developed several programs: xerox’s green world alliance (gwa) initiative provides a collection and
reuse/recycling program for spent imaging supplies; xerox’s product takeback and recycling program
manages equipment at end-of-life; and we invest in technologies that reduce the creation of waste. our
solid ink imaging process utilizes compact “cartridge-free” solid ink sticks with no plastic housings or
casings, thereby reducing print-related waste by up to 90 percent compared with comparable color laser
products. for laser-based products, materials innovation has extended the life of critical replaceable
components by up to 50 percent.


our approach to managing products at end-of-life translates into signiﬁcant environmental and ﬁnancial
beneﬁts. globally, our combined returns programs (equipment resale or remanufacture in conjunction
with parts and consumables reuse and recycling) prevented nearly 47,500 metric tons of waste from
entering landﬁlls in 2015.


consumables takeback and recycling
xerox’s green world alliance (gwa) initiative provides a collection and reuse/recycling program for
spent imaging supplies. gwa is central to our commitment to waste-free products.


currently, more than 35 countries participate in the xerox green world alliance. each has its own gwa
country website that describes the processes available to the customer or the appropriate points of
contact for more information. worldwide, our customers returned over 2.1 million cartridges, toner
containers and other used supply items in 2015, equating to 4,400 metric tons.


returned products are sorted, and items suitable for remanufacturing are cleaned, inspected and then
remanufactured. remanufactured consumables, containing an average 90 percent reused/recycled parts,
are built and tested to the same performance speciﬁcations as new products. items that are not
suitable for remanufacturing are recycled or recovered through energy from waste. recycled waste toner
and toner reclaimed from manufacturing that qualiﬁes for reuse may account for 25 percent of the
weight of new toner, without compromising toner functionality. reusing waste/reclaimed toner saves
several million dollars in raw material costs each year. of the toner that can’t be reclaimed, 75 percent
is recycled by our consumables recycling partner while the remaining volume is utilized as energy by
waste facilities to generate steam and electricity.




                                                                                                            54/137

equipment and parts takeback and recycling
in the early 1990s, we pioneered the practice of converting end-of-life electronic equipment into
products and parts that contain reused parts while meeting new-product speciﬁcations for quality and
performance. we have developed a comprehensive process for taking back end-of-life products and have
established a remanufacture, parts reuse and recycling program that fully supports our waste-free
initiatives.


we design our machines with high durability and reuse capability in order to facilitate multiple product
lifecycles. during the active phase of a product, all returned equipment and spare parts are evaluated
for reuse opportunities throughout the supply chain. finally, all parts and equipment that are not
destined for reuse have speciﬁc guidelines which enables easy and consistent recycling.


xerox enables reuse according to the following principles:


     reuse of complete end item. this requires the least reprocessing, transportation and energy usage.
     remanufacturing or conversion into a newer-generation product or part. product families are
     designed with a high level of commonality to enable maximum reuse in this manner. this allows
     us to remanufacture to “as new” performance speciﬁcations while reusing 70 to 90 percent of the
     machine components by weight without degradation of quality or performance.
     used equipment. equipment returns are evaluated for potential reuse. based on the condition and
     market demands, equipment may be put through an extended maintenance/veriﬁcation process to
     return it to a high standard and then be redeployed. nearly 65 percent of machines returned in
     the u.s. are given new life by being sold as used or sent for remanufacturing.
     reuse of major modules, subcomponents and parts for spares or manufacturing. many of our
     machines that have outlived their useful lives are stripped of usable parts and components prior to
     the scrap/reclaim process. used spare parts returned from the ﬁeld are also included in this reuse
                                                                                                           55/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     stream. xerox has been continually increasing the number of components that are reused in
     upstream and downstream processes after the original machine has been designated for recycling.
     material recycling. after the processes noted above have been followed, any remaining portion of a
     machine is stripped of any recyclable material (e.g., plastics, copper wire) and material requiring
     special disposal services, such as printed wiring boards, batteries and lamps. the remainder of the
     machine is then sent to an industrial reclaim facility.


changes in volumes of waste diverted from landﬁlls is due in part to increases in product and reuse
opportunities, changes in product mix, and a move to lighter-weight machines, as well as growth of
regulatory-driven local recycling schemes. for example, the transition to digital equipment and lighter-
weight parts has reduced the weight of both ofﬁce and production equipment by as much as 50 percent
over the last 10 years. the decline also includes a decrease in the number of ofﬁce machines returned
for remanufacturing in europe due to participation in eu member state waste electrical and electronic
equipment (weee) programs. in geographies where xerox exercises direct control over the end-of-life
management of equipment, return rates are high. for example, approximately 60 percent of all u.s.
equipment installs are ultimately returned to xerox for end-of-life disposition, a ﬁgure that rises to 100
percent for leased equipment.


in 2015, 9,400 metric tons of equipment/parts related waste was diverted from landﬁlls to recycling at
our u.s. reverse logistics center. globally, that volume rises to 43,000 metric tons.




                                                                                                             56/137

e-waste
while xerox has long been committed to responsible end-of-life management of equipment, the
proliferation of e-waste regulations has created a need for multiple programs in different countries and
even states. the subtle differences in requirements among these regulations pose challenges from a
process consistency and efﬁciency standpoint. for example, with the implementation of the european
union’s waste electrical and electronic equipment (weee) directive, we continue to operate our
european take-back program to enable equipment remanufacturing and parts reuse. we also participate,
as needed, in european member states’ individual collection and recycling programs.


in the u.s., xerox recently partnered with a large electronics recycler to ensure that our customers have
a means to have their old imaging devices processed in a responsible manner. the program is consistent
with the requirements deﬁned in the various manufacturer take-back initiatives.


we carefully manage suppliers who provide recycling and waste disposal services. a waste vendor
approval process assesses the safety and environmental practices as well as compliance history of each
vendor. where appropriate, we require these companies to document the ﬁnal disposition of materials
sent to their facilities, including electronic scrap. xerox does not allow its vendors to send electronic
scrap to developing nations for processing. we strive to work with only those recyclers who have
implemented voluntary programs that are certiﬁed by accredited organizations. the programs are the
u.s. epa’s responsible recycling (r2) standard for electronics recyclers or the basel action network’s e-
stewards standards. in addition, in 2014 xerox’s two u.s. equipment processing facilities achieved r2
certiﬁcation.



                                                                                                            57/137

paper
we recognize our obligation to responsibly source paper and enable efﬁcient paper use. our strategy
begins upstream with the ﬁber source and continues on to processing and manufacturing, through use
and end-of-life. we utilize a multi-pronged approach, through partnerships with our customers and
suppliers, the nature conservancy and other stakeholders, including non-government organizations
(ngos), government agencies and academia. our long-term goal is to support a sustainable paper cycle
and minimize environmental impact while meeting our customers’ exacting business needs.


in 2013, domtar signed an agreement with xerox for the acquisition of the xerox paper and media
products business in united states and canada. this deal gives domtar exclusive rights for the
marketing and distribution of xerox brand paper and print media. read more about domtar and
sustainability. the same year xerox’s paper business in western europe was sold to antalis. read more
about antalis’s sustainability charter. xerox maintains the paper business in its developing market
operations.


we apply stringent paper sourcing guidelines for companies that provide paper to xerox for resale. the
requirements cover all aspects of papermaking, from forest management to production of ﬁnished
goods. we supply papers that comply with sustainable forest management standards, including the
forest stewardship council (fsc) and programme for the endorsement of forest certiﬁcation (pefc).
fsc-certiﬁed papers use raw materials from an fsc-certiﬁed source, controlled wood sources or post-
consumer reclaimed sources.


we offer papers ranging from 80 to 100 percent post-consumer recycled content. our recycled papers
use post-consumer waste and/or recycled ﬁber in place of new pulp. recycled products are required to
meet the same strict performance speciﬁcations as virgin products and are designed for optimal
performance in our equipment.


our partnership with the nature conservancy (tnc)
since 2006, xerox and the nature conservancy have partnered to conserve and protect globally
important forests. this work is supported through xerox foundation grants of over $2 million. in 2015,
our partnership expanded to include volunteers from xerox and tnc working together in conservation
efforts. our partnership builds on the commitment of xerox to sustainability throughout its operations
and corporate leadership on the world stage.


during the third term of the partnership in 2015, xerox supported the conservancy’s efforts to:


     develop and test a broadly applicable forest carbon methodology for improved forest management
     that would allow landowners to achieve forest certiﬁcation and serve as a platform for potential
     carbon beneﬁts.
     strengthen a key tool for identifying priority habitats — the high conservation value (hcv)
     approach — building consistency across projects, disseminating standards and training assessors
     through global and regional hcv networks.
     promote responsible forestry through the implementation of forest management standards by
     working with xerox suppliers and other land managers at two sites in north america: central-
     western new york and across the canadian boreal forest (including a focused project in northwest
     ontario).

these initiatives have improved forest conservation, helping to develop a sustainable paper cycle and
advance sound forest management practices through market incentives, landowner investment and
resource networks. most importantly, our work has and will continue to stem the tide of forest loss and
degradation, a contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.

                                                                                                          58/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

in 2015, xerox and tnc encouraged employees to participate as volunteers in their local communities.
in june 2015, employees of the central and western new york chapter of tnc and xerox created an
exhibit at the rochester international jazz festival to educate the public on the world’s water shortage
and to provide attendees with clean tap water in reusable cups as an alternative to bottled water. the
exhibit highlighted the tnc’s role in protecting hemlock and canadice lakes, the last two undeveloped
finger lakes in new york state and the source of the drinking water for the festival. over 240 gallons of
water were consumed – equivalent to 1,900 plastic bottles of water. nearly 2,000 people engaged with
xerox and tnc volunteers to learn about the source of the water and tnc’s work around the region.

preserving the planet

environmental leadership
as innovators who introduced two-sided copying in 1970 and as one of the ﬁrst employers to allow
employees to work from home saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, xerox has
operated at the forefront of environmental sustainability. our accomplishments span from being the ﬁrst
to make available ofﬁce equipment with an energy-saving mode to playing a key role in developing the
innovative transportation solutions of today and tomorrow.


in 2015, xerox was one of the ﬁrst organizations to join the road to paris initiative, a collaborative
effort of cdp (formerly the carbon disclosure project) and the we mean business coalition. in a similar
initiative supported by the white house, xerox signed the american business act on climate pledge,
along with dozens of the nation's largest companies. we committed to further ghg reductions and
energy reductions in our operations globally — an additional 20 percent by 2020, from our 2012
baseline. we also committed to continuing to provide products and services to enable our customers to
realize ghg reductions in their workplaces and communities. we also committed to investing in clean
energy for our facilities.


assuming a lead role in sustainability requires a focused effort on aspects that will drive the greatest
value to our stakeholders and company. we utilize materiality assessments to prioritize this effort. in
our most recent assessments, we reafﬁrmed that sustainable products and services are a material aspect
for xerox, providing value for our company and our stakeholders. as an example of one effort to
advance sustainable products, we teamed with the university of michigan and other companies to
create “mcity” — a 32-acre simulated urban environment to enable mobility developers to test the
capabilities of connected and automated vehicles and systems. in another effort geared for the ofﬁce,
we developed “digital alternatives” and the print awareness tool. digital alternatives helps organizations
transition from paper-based tasks to streamlined digital workﬂows, increasing the efﬁciency of routine
document processes. the xerox print awareness tool® provides end-users with graphical displays of their
print usage as well as “eco-tips” to enhance sustainability awareness and choices.


our sustainability leadership has been recognized by such organizations as cdp, dow jones and
ethisphere.


governance
our corporate environment, health, safety and sustainability (ehs&s) governance policy, ﬁrst adopted
in 1991, provides the foundation of our environmental leadership program. our environmental
governance model uses clearly deﬁned goals, a set of worldwide standards and an audit process to
validate compliance.


the vice president of strategic partnerships & alliances and ehs&s reports to the president of corporate
operations, who is a corporate ofﬁcer and a direct report to the chief executive ofﬁcer. the vice
president is accountable for our corporate social responsibility governance framework and chairs the
xerox corporate social responsibility (csr) council.


the csr council is responsible for the materiality assessment process and establishment of a deﬁned
management approach for aspects deemed to be material to both our stakeholders and our business.
the council reports progress to the csr steering committee, corporate management committee and
the board of directors at a deﬁned cadence throughout the year. for more on our csr governance
model, see the governance section of this report.

                                                                                                             60/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

our enterprise risk management (erm) process, with oversight by the xerox board of directors,
strengthens our capability to assess, monitor and manage all categories of business risk, including
climate change. vital strategic and operational risks identiﬁed are approved by the corporate
management committee (cmc) and reviewed annually by the board.


a risk mitigation plan, in which leaders are assigned to each identiﬁed risk, is developed and reviewed
by the cmc and the board. the business ethics and compliance ofﬁce and various internal control
committees also monitor risk management and exposure. the board of directors regularly reviews the
enterprise risk proﬁle and monitors the effectiveness of management policies and decisions, including
risk management activities.


the ofﬁce of global government affairs is responsible for tracking external developments, including
climate change policy, and for determining if these developments are likely to affect xerox products and
operations. through trade associations and partnerships, ehs&s tracks applicable regulations and also
policy changes that may affect the company. we develop processes, new technologies and products to
counter the risks associated with external changes.


our major operating units and key corporate functions (e.g., risk management, real estate) also are
responsible for evaluating, monitoring and managing, within their respective businesses, site-speciﬁc
risks that potentially have an impact on xerox’s ability to achieve its overall business objectives. the
business continuity assurance process ensures business units are prepared for environmental risks.


standards and programs
environmental, health and safety standards guide employees and suppliers in complying with corporate
policies. these worldwide standards apply across xerox and establish speciﬁc requirements for products,
services and operations. we also have company-wide programs, such as zero injury, to engage
employees worldwide.


supply chain management
as a critical element of supply chain governance, we extend environmental, health and safety
requirements across our supply chain. since 1998, we have asked our materials, electronics and
component suppliers to meet speciﬁc environmental, health and safety requirements. in 2006, we joined
the electronic industry citizenship coalition’s (eicc) code of conduct to broaden our means for
validating that suppliers are operating according to accepted industry standards. as an eicc member,
we assess our own facilities as well as suppliers, using eicc auditing protocol.


for more information, see the supplier relations section of this report.


employee engagement and training
employees and third-party contractors learn how our operations affect the environment and employee
safety through training and internal communication. beginning with our new hire orientation, employees
are made aware of company-wide environmental, health and safety requirements. global programs such
as energy challenge, zero injury, sustainable you, environmental faces of xerox and the xerox earth
awards engage employees throughout the company. regional earth and safety fairs and green teams
also help to communicate challenges, best practices and accomplishments.


yammer, our internal social media network, allows our employees across the globe to connect with each
other. through groups such as working green, living green and simply well, employees exchange
information about the environment, safety and health. the xerox yammer network boasts nearly 25,000
employees worldwide.

                                                                                                           61/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

the formation of local “green teams” provides employees, who are part of a common work group or
share a workspace, with the opportunity to work together to educate, support and seek process or site
changes that will enable environmental improvements, cost savings or productivity improvements.


as appropriate, employees receive training on topics such as hazardous waste management, spill
prevention and response, recycling, iso 14001 and a variety of other topics. in addition to safety topics
for which regulations require training, employees are trained on established safe job procedures based
upon the job-speciﬁc hazards they may encounter and procedures and protective equipment they are
expected to use. a signiﬁcant number of procurement professionals participated in training on xerox
corporate sustainability goals to re-emphasize our socially responsible purchasing policy.


our environmental management policy is available on the xerox internal website. we communicate
environmental, health and safety goals to all our operations and integrate those goals into processes for
product development and services. through our iso 14001 environment management system,
employees identify the environmental aspects associated with their responsibilities. our facilities
management personnel are introduced to our environmental sustainability and compliance programs
and trained to identify sustainability opportunities and perform regulatory applicability assessments.
this training included both xerox facilities personnel and those from our third-party management
company.


stakeholder outreach
we communicate with stakeholders about environmental health and safety programs, goals and
performance. stakeholders include employees, customers, investors, universities, government agencies
and environmental groups. we track inquiries and comments from customers and other stakeholders.
customers provide input through focus groups, and we tap into the larger community through
participation in external organizations.


we regard our customers, employees and investors as strategic partners and stakeholders. since our
earliest days, our engagements have been deeply rooted in education and the community. in
progressing toward the goal of sustainability for our own operations and those of our stakeholders,
partnerships with regulatory agencies and academia play a crucial role in legislating progressive policies
and the academic world by driving fundamental innovation.


in 2015, we joined with the los angeles department of transportation and the denver department of
public works to develop citysight®, a new cloud-enabled performance management system that uses
data analytics to help parking enforcement supervisors better manage workloads, make smart
dispatching decisions and create high-performance teams of parking enforcement ofﬁcers.

caring for communities

the xerox foundation
we invest in the communities in which we live and work for reasons beyond fulﬁlling our obligation as a
corporate citizen. we do it because it makes our company stronger and more competitive.


a foundation for good




our philanthropic efforts are managed through the xerox foundation, which executes a deliberate
investment strategy to deliver the greatest impact possible for every dollar spent. in 2015, we invested
$13.5 million in the non-proﬁt sector through the xerox foundation. more than 2,500 non-proﬁt
organizations, colleges and universities received direct ﬁnancial support in the form of grants, matching
gifts or community involvement activities of xerox people.


our philanthropic efforts, carried out through the foundation, support objectives within the following
four categories:




                                                                                                            64/137

                                    xerox 2016 global citizenship report

employee volunteer activities: bolster communities through the coordinated volunteer efforts of
xerox community members
education and workforce preparation: provide educational access to underserved minorities
science and technology: promote innovation through the support of institutions of higher learning
in science and technology
national and cultural affairs: support organizations dedicated to worthy causes and cultural
enrichment




                                                                                                    65/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report


caring for communities

employee volunteer activities
at xerox, we believe a combination of ﬁnancial and human resources can bring about greater change
than either on its own. this philosophy is perhaps best represented by our community involvement
program. this long-running, grassroots initiative backs the voluntary spirit of our employees with funding
support from xerox. in this way, we’re making the biggest difference in the communities where we live
and work.


since the program began in 1974, thousands of xerox people have been involved in regional,
community-focused projects each year. in 2015, the xerox foundation invested over $1.3 million in the
community involvement program, enabling 12,000 xerox people to participate in 800 projects.


outside of our employee volunteer programs, xerox people also give their time and talent to a wide
variety of causes. here are a few examples:


     xerox scientists participate in the xerox science consultant program, which sends our people into
     elementary schools to teach science to inquiring young minds and to ignite interest in science as a
     career.
     xerox lawyers provide pro bono work to a wide range of non-proﬁts.
     people across xerox — from the c-suite to the factory ﬂoor — volunteer their time to help make
     our world a better place, whether by giving their time to a corporate board or by rolling up their
     sleeves and packing boxes for a holiday food and gift drive.

during 2015, 91.3 percent of our philanthropic investments were directed to institutions and
organizations where someone from xerox was personally involved.


no relationship better illustrates xerox’s commitment to community volunteers than the one we have
with the united way. in 2015, the xerox foundation gave $1.7 million in grants to some 70 united
way organizations throughout the united states, including $450,000 to the united way of rochester,
new york. in addition, xerox employees personally donated more than $590,000 of their own money, as
well as volunteer hours, to the united way agencies and day of caring.


the grand total of xerox’s contribution to the united way in 2015, combining foundation grants and
employees’ donations, was more than $2.2 million.




                                                                                                             66/137

caring for communities

education and workforce preparedness
as part of a larger effort to support individuals pursuing technical degrees and help the u.s. address its
shortage of scientists and engineers, we provide matching gifts to colleges and universities. in 2015,
366 different institutions received 1,116 matching gifts from the xerox foundation.


investing in education




to help train a new generation of scientists and engineers, the xerox foundation awarded grants to 366
different institutions throughout the u.s. in 2015. the top ﬁve beneﬁciaries of this program were the
university of rochester, the rochester institute of technology, rensselaer polytechnic institute, the
university of notre dame and stanford university.




                                                                                                             67/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

our support of education involves managing programs with a common theme: providing educational
access to underrepresented minorities. in turn, this supports the strategic interest of the company by
enabling us to recruit from a highly motivated, technically educated talent pool. in addition, our own
people beneﬁt by being involved on college campuses. the three programs are:


     the black college engineering liaison program awarded 20 grants to schools such as howard
     university; spelman college; morgan state university; and tuskegee university.
     the hispanic college liaison program dispersed 21 grants to schools such as the university of
     puerto rico; city college of new york; the university of california; the university of central florida;
     the university of texas; and the rochester institute of technology.
     the xerox technical minority scholarship program provided 128 scholarships to help deserving
     minority students complete degrees in engineering.

we also continued our partnership with the national academy foundation’s academies of engineering.
these “schools within schools” provide incentives for minority and female high school students to pursue
college degrees and ultimately careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, the stem
principles.


in partnership with the national merit scholarship corporation, the xerox foundation also awarded a
total of 39 xerox merit, xerox achievement, national merit and national achievement scholarships.


other investments in education and workforce preparedness include:


     a better chance
     prep for prep
     national action council for minorities in engineering
     monroe community college (in new york)
     first

caring for communities

science and technology
at xerox, innovation is our foundation for success. academic organizations play an important role in the
long-term strategic interests of the company by furthering scientiﬁc research and training the next
generation of scientists. in 2015, xerox scientists championed 32 grants to 26 different universities —
17 located in the u.s., and nine worldwide.


grants worth more than $1.2 million were recommended to university science programs by the xerox
university affairs committee, which consists of a dozen xerox scientists from the u.s., canada and the
united kingdom.


our scientists, and the professors we funded, co-authored and published 20 research papers in leading
academic journals.


academic organizations play an important role in the long-term strategic interests of the company by
furthering scientiﬁc research and training the next generation of scientists. this is why the xerox
foundation supports many such organizations, including the university of rochester and the university
of rochester/wilmot cancer institute, the new york hall of science and the nyu tandon school of
engineering.


in 2015, xerox hosted 12 visits and researchers made 19 personal visits to universities in the u.s. and
internationally, as well as 55 remote visits. as a result of the grant program, xerox hosted eight interns
in 2015.




                                                                                                             69/137

caring for communities

national and cultural affairs
xerox supports a variety of organizations that address issues facing our nation, help those in need, or
honor veterans or victims of national tragedies. we also support many cultural and arts institutions in
the communities where our employees live and work.


organizations that address national problems include:


naacp legal defense and educational fund, partnership for drug-free kids, paralyzed veterans of
america, national center on addiction and substance abuse, minority corporate counsel association
and asian american legal defense and education fund.


cultural organizations include:


kennedy center, lincoln center, ballet hispanico, stepping stones museum for children, garth fagan
dance and many more.


memberships
in 2015, we paid membership dues to 40 non-proﬁt organizations, including business roundtable,
council on foreign relations, conference board, national minority supplier development council,
american national standards institute and the technology ceo council.


disaster relief
we invest in the american red cross for its efforts to respond quickly and effectively to natural
disasters. we invest in save the children and concern worldwide, bolstering their ability to address
urgent humanitarian needs across the world. over the last year, our support went to those affected by
the syrian refugee crisis.


environmental affairs
from habitat preservation to sustainability research and the promotion of environmental consciousness,
we are committed to the protection of the environment for future generations. a grant to the nature
conservancy helps continue pioneering work in promoting sustainable forestry practices in the northern
boreal forests of canada.


science and technology
we support the new york hall of science, the nyu tandon school of engineering, the university of
rochester and the rochester institute of technology.


other grants beneﬁt outward bound; the maritime aquarium in norwalk, connecticut; national
aquarium in baltimore, maryland; suny college of environment and forestry; soundwaters and many
other organizations such as discovery center, mill river park collaborative and institutions that work
toward the goal of a sustainable world.

evolving the workplace

employee engagement
when people believe they can make a difference in an organization, they are more motivated and
effective at their jobs. that is why xerox is committed to fostering open communication between
employees and management.


we encourage one-on-one conversations between employees and supervisors. we also survey employees
regularly to gather information that becomes the basis for improvements throughout the company. our
commitment to employee engagement creates an environment of open innovation that beneﬁts our
business and strengthens our contribution to global citizenship.


voice of the employee survey (voe)
for over 45 years, our senior teams have surveyed employees and acted upon that feedback. our most
recent voe was administered in october and november of 2015. we received results from 61 countries
in 20 languages. sixty-six thousand employees from every division, every job function and every job level
shared their thoughts and knowledge.




the objectives of the voe were to assess the strength of the workgroup/manager relationship and
provide insight into the things that are working well and highlight opportunities for improvement. using
the survey’s feedback and insights helps us strengthen the communication channel between employees
and xerox, create a better experience with our clients and customers, and enable an effective and
motivating work environment where we all can thrive.


there are four categories in the survey:


     my work: questions about the job, feedback, learning opportunities, the ability to take informed
     risks and personal job satisfaction
     my manager: questions about the manager’s behaviors, expectations, communication, team
     building and the employee’s perception of his/her leadership

                                                                                                            71/137

                                            xerox 2016 global citizenship report

        our team: questions about how employees work together and collaborate
        our company: questions about xerox strategy and direction

in addition, two write-in questions ask people to describe 1) what they like best about working for xerox
and 2) where we as a company can improve.


at the conclusion of the survey 4,573 managers received a personalized report. in addition, 2,847 rollup
reports were created for divisions, business units, departments, work groups and lines of business.


since the conclusion of the survey, results have been shared and discussed with the xerox board and the
senior leadership team. in addition, leaders across all organizations have taken a close look at employee
suggestions and recommendations. throughout 2016, we will create communications programs and
tools to mitigate issues the voe uncovered.


highlights from the survey:


        employees have a solid understanding of personal contributions to team goals.
        managers make their expectations known and clear.
        managers share the information needed for employees to do their job.
        most employees feel personal accomplishment from their work contributions.
        most employees feel they can make decisions that improve the quality of their work.

more importantly, the survey reveals areas for improvement. the 2013 survey identiﬁed two key areas of
importance to our employees: ensuring fair pay and ensuring fair treatment in the workplace. in 2015,
we developed programs to address each of those.

                                                        approach to employee pay reviews across all
                                                        organizations and locations. we create industry-

                                                        each locale, then we examine employee
                                                        performance and compare current employee pay
                                                        to those guidelines in order to determine

evolving the workplace

global workforce
the experience, skills and cultural diversity of the people who work at xerox worldwide represent our
most important asset. our wide range of products and services requires a diverse employee population,
representative of the markets in which we do business.

hiring practices
we hire from the communities in which we do business. we take care to research and comply with local
labor laws to ensure the safety and happiness of all our employees around the globe. candidates must
be authorized to work in the country to which they are applying and be ﬂuent in the language of the
country where a job is based.


we never discriminate against applicants or employees because of age, race, religion, sex, disability,
sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, pregnancy, national origin, veteran status, other
legally protected characteristic or basis, or any unlawful means.


compensation is based on merit, degree of responsibility, the scope of the work, the impact the role has
on the company and other work-related criteria. we comply with all laws governing fair employment
and labor practices.


military hiring programs in the u.s.
we value the experience and skills acquired during military service. as part of a commitment to the
white house joining forces initiative, we pledged to hire 10,000 veterans by 2018; in 2015, we hired

evolving the workplace

diversity and inclusion
at xerox, diversity is not viewed as a mandate, but as an essential part of our corporate culture.
treating others with respect and offering equal opportunity regardless of origin, race, gender or sexual
orientation makes us stronger because it allows us to take full advantage of a global workforce that is
rich in experience, knowledge and creativity. many of our accomplishments as a company originate
from teams of diverse individuals whose varying perspectives complement one another as they work
together to achieve our strategic goals.


females in the workplace worldwide




we foster a culture of inclusion and opportunity, which is supported by a number of employee-focused
initiatives and tracked through measurable actions.


award-winning diversity


year after year, xerox is recognized for embracing diversity in the workplace. the following is a list of
some of our acknowledgements from 2015 and 2016:



                                                                                                            75/137

executive diversity council
the executive diversity council consists of senior leaders from across xerox. the council meets at
selected times throughout the year to discuss matters such as:


     workforce representation
     work environment
     diverse customer markets
     organizational efforts to address the needs of a multicultural workforce

in addition, select council members may be involved in other diversity initiatives, such as the corporate
champion program, where senior executives are matched with employee caucus groups. the
“champions” educate our senior management on their groups’ unique environmental perspective and
community initiatives.


independent caucus groups also play an important role in our diversity story. these caucuses, similar to
networking and afﬁnity groups, are instrumental in advocating openness, opportunity and inclusion for
the entire xerox community. they work with management to achieve common business objectives and
self-advocacy and to create an environment of inclusion. six caucus groups currently address the
concerns of employees who are african-american, hispanic, asian, women, african-american women,
and/or gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender.


non-discrimination policy
globally, we create policies that support our business goals and reﬂect the culture of the countries in
which we do business. xerox does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religious belief, sex, age,
national origin, citizenship status, marital status, union status, sexual orientation or gender identity.


by focusing on diversity, xerox hires, promotes and retains the best people who are well suited for our
business. we’ve designed our hiring and promotion efforts to ensure a deep, diverse reserve of strong
players who are ready to assume leadership roles. our hiring practices include engaging xerox people to
recruit at universities and career fairs, providing scholarships to minority students interested in
information technology and offering internships and co-op programs to diverse groups of students and
new graduates.


                                                                                                             76/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

scholarships and recruitment
we grant more than 120 scholarships each year through our technical minority scholarship program,
and we are reaching out to young people through programs such as the first (for inspiration and
recognition of science and technology) robotics competition and the xerox science consultant program
that encourages broader interest in science and technology. we introduce xerox career opportunities to
the hispanic student population at 45 universities and institutions and, to expand our recruitment
efforts further, we are partnering with the society of hispanic engineers. we have a similar university
outreach program for recruiting african-american employees.


equal employment opportunity
in the u.s., xerox complies with equal employment opportunity (eeo) guidelines and all applicable
federal, state and local laws that govern the hiring and treatment of its employees. we do not
discriminate against veterans, including veterans of the vietnam era and disabled veterans, individuals
with a disability or employees who take protected leave time.


representation of women around the globe
across all lines of business and around the world:


     twenty-eight percent of our executives are female
     forty-one percent of our managers are female
     thirty-eight percent of our board of directors are women; all are over 50 years of age
     women account for 51 percent of our employee population globally

evolving the workplace

compensation and beneﬁts
at xerox, we have long understood our success depends on attracting and sustaining a healthy and
productive global workforce. to that end, we offer well-rounded compensation and beneﬁts packages
that place value in the whole person.


our comprehensive u.s. package includes competitive pay, healthcare beneﬁts for employees and their
families, a 401k savings plan with a company match, wellness resources and workplace recognition
opportunities. we also offer employee assistance programs, healthcare coaching and advocacy support,
adoption assistance, education assistance and tuition aid. our paid-time-off program includes company-
paid holiday and vacation beneﬁts. we offer a variety of continuing education and learning
opportunities to enhance personal and professional development.


xerox supports time-off programs including personal leaves of absence, military leaves and family
medical leaves in compliance with the u.s. federal family and medical leave act of 1993.


our pay philosophy in all countries supports both individual and business needs by providing our people
with rewards that are linked to individual performance and company results. our total compensation
package includes all forms of cash (base pay, overtime and commissions), beneﬁts and recognition. to
ensure our pay and beneﬁts packages remain competitive, we participate in numerous pay and beneﬁt
surveys. we offer the same beneﬁts package to full- and part-time employees by region.


in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, we completed our second annual pay review process. this process
formalizes our approach to employee pay reviews across all organizations and geographies. following
this process, we create industry-based pay guidelines for a variety of roles in each geography. then we
examine employee performance and compare current employee pay to those guidelines in order to
determine increases.




                                                                                                          78/137

evolving the workplace

health, wellness and safety
we believe that the health of our business depends on the health and safety of our people. from giving
our employees and their families the means to manage their health to making workplaces and
commutes safer, we continue to make measurable changes in the lives of our people worldwide.


healthcare
our healthcare philosophy — healthy together — focuses on helping employees and family members to
make informed healthcare decisions and gives them the tools to manage their health and well-being.
employees can also access various health and wellness programs through the healthcare carriers they
select. as part of the healthy together program, the company provides free, conﬁdential wellness
screenings on an annual basis so employees can identify key health risks and work with their primary
care physicians. xerox also contracted with various wellness vendors to assist employees in developing
action plans to address these risks. we provide easy access to meaningful, timely and relevant
information through a single portal, simplifying the experience of choosing and using beneﬁts. currently,
this program is available to employees in the united states.


employee safety
xerox is committed to maintaining a safe work environment for our people. we strive toward a goal of
zero workplace injuries, continually decreasing the frequency and severity of injuries every year. in 2015,
within our global technology operations the total recordable injury (tri) rate decreased by 7% and day
away from work case (dafw) rate decreased by 6% from 2014 levels. in addition, across all of our u.s.
operations, the dafw frequency rate decreased by 7%, which is reﬂective of success in preventing the
more serious injuries. we did experience one work related fatality in 2015, due to a motor vehicle
accident on a public road. overall, these improvements have continued since 2012 and are a result of
the increased safety awareness and communications to our employees and focused safety management
processes within our management teams.




                                                                                                              79/137

we continued to be successful in integrating many corporate safety management processes into our
services organization, including injury recordkeeping, workplace inspections, ﬁre and life safety,
ergonomics and emergency preparedness. this integration has established common objectives and
standardized the management processes for key employee safety disciplines.


we have in place a robust, worldwide incident reporting process. this, in combination with workplace
safety inspections and hazard analysis, focuses our safety improvement efforts where we can have the
most impact on preventing incidents and where populations are most at risk. employee safety
communications take a variety of forms given the great diversity in our operations and workplaces. a
number of methods are used to keep employee safety awareness high, including site speciﬁc hazard
management, off the job safety information and unique safety concerns that may be endemic to a
speciﬁc geography.


safe facilities
in order to ensure ﬁre and life safety attributes are in place in the buildings we own and lease, all real
estate transactions are reviewed by the environment, health, safety and sustainability (ehs&s)
organization prior to occupying. xerox ﬁre safety and life safety requirements have been established
regardless of location in the world, size of facility or occupancy classiﬁcation. the focus of the safety
review is ﬁre and incident prevention, early detection, suppression, occupant notiﬁcation and prompt
emergency response. these reviews are linked with the implementation of building speciﬁc emergency
preparedness planning and drills.


audit program
a well-established internal audit program measures our success in implementing corporate standards,
allows us to share best practices and helps us validate regulatory compliance. audits at major
operations are conducted on a rolling average of once every three to ﬁve years (or sooner, based on
performance). the frequency and the focus of the audits are based on the type of operations and the
inherent risks associated with the operations. in 2012, we added our services operations to this audit
schedule.


xerox audit teams evaluate operations against our internal standards, external regulations and industry
guidelines. beginning in 2010, the teams also evaluated management system performance. with the
assistance of the local managers and support staff, action plans are developed and deﬁciencies
corrected. senior management pays particular attention to situations with the potential to pose a
signiﬁcant risk of environmental damage, serious injury to employees or regulatory non-compliance. in
2015, we met our goal of resolution of these issues within 90 days and continued to demonstrate that
the audit program has become an important mechanism for identifying and correcting performance
gaps.




                                                                                                             81/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report


establishing an audit process for our services sites
33 countries • 215 locations • 130 international + 85 us (25%)




adding services to the mix
our services operations are located in approximately 500 sites worldwide. initially, ehs&s was engaged
in audits of a limited number of facilities between 2010 and 2012. in 2013, ehs&s set out to complete
audits of all 130 international services locations and worked with various value chain partners including
global real estate and facilities, human resources, and local operations management to address any
issues that were identiﬁed.


in 2014 and 2015, audits were completed at 85 u.s. locations, for a total audit count of 215. in order
to establish a consistent level of ehs&s performance worldwide, a common set of facility requirements
was developed that applies across all geographies, taking into account existing life safety and building
codes as well as speciﬁc regulatory requirements that may apply in different parts of the world.


the on-site review of these locations provided signiﬁcant insight into the variety of business operations,
facility and/or management issues and best practices that could be used to improve overall
performance. outside of the u.s., due to the large variation in local regulations, the audits identiﬁed a
number of sites requiring some sort of physical upgrade, modiﬁcation or intervention to meet safety and
environmental requirements. corrective actions for all of these locations have been completed.


consistent application of accepted life safety and building codes within all 50 u.s. states means fewer
physical issues were identiﬁed. however, some operational management process deﬁciencies were
identiﬁed and are currently being addressed.


now in the control phase, the services operations audit project will include on-going assessment, on-site
spot checks and continued outreach. site operations and facility management will be required to
complete an annual self-assessment and provide supporting documentation as evidence of ongoing
compliance. in addition, processes are in place to ensure that acquisitions are thoroughly evaluated to
ensure that new facilities meet appropriate standards.


                                                                                                             82/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

emergency preparedness
because emergencies and disasters often strike without warning, xerox has implemented an emergency
preparedness and response program to help protect the safety of our employees, the surrounding
communities and the environment.


to prepare for emergencies, xerox facilities worldwide have implemented site-speciﬁc emergency
preparedness plans to assist with the development and execution of appropriate actions in response to
local emergencies. our plans account for common emergencies, such as responding to ﬁres; for weather-
related emergencies, such as tornadoes and hurricanes; and for more location-speciﬁc emergencies, such
as responding to earthquakes and radiological emergencies. we also include resources and procedures
for ﬁrst aid medical response in the event of an injury or illness to an employee in our facilities. in our
more complex and higher hazard operations, we have medical emergency response teams (merts).
these mert employees are provided with training and the equipment necessary to respond quickly and
stabilize the medical emergency until more advanced medical support arrives.


shelter-in-place procedures, already in place in our technology sites, are being rolled out to our services
sites to protect our employees from emergency situations that occur outside of our facilities.


in addition to emergency action plans that are established at the local operations level, there are
preparedness plans at the corporate level including major incidents, crisis management and pandemic
preparedness. these plans have been designed with a central corporate strategy that utilizes an incident
command structure. incident response managers are responsible for local/regional tactical and
emergency response, coordinating efforts at their respective locations with the corporate crisis
management team, and addressing local business operations issues. response coordination and
integration are part of the planning process.


all preparedness plans are regularly tested for effectiveness through management reviews, corporate
audits and annual drills. any discrepancies are noted and corrective actions are implemented. following
an emergency, business resumption plans are put into action to ensure business operations are quickly
restored after an incident.


motor vehicle safety
motor vehicle safety is a key component of our safety initiatives. we have a company car program that
speciﬁes motor vehicle safety requirements for our drivers as well as accident prevention and reporting
processes. employee driving records are reviewed on a regular basis, and we provide remedial motor
vehicle safety training to improve awareness and competency. motor vehicle accidents are tracked by
frequency and type and are reported to the management team.


we also participate in ﬂeet safety benchmark forums to keep up to date on the latest motor vehicle
safety practices and technologies and to share xerox’s best practices with our peers.


the use of cell phones in any company vehicle is restricted. texting is forbidden while the vehicle is
moving. employees who need to use their phones in the car are instructed to ﬁnd a safe place to stop.


a comprehensive safety review is conducted on any vehicle model prior to it being accepted as part of
the xerox ﬂeet. we review the safety ratings and crash test results of candidate vehicles and require
safety features such as daytime running lights and safety barriers between the driver’s seat and storage
areas.




                                                                                                              83/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

ergonomics
because musculoskeletal disorders represent a signiﬁcant portion of our work-related injuries, we work to
minimize the risk factors as a job is designed. we study exposure to ergonomic hazards and raise
awareness with employees so they can make improvements to their workstations.


from manufacturing operations to ofﬁce work, we continue to study the causes and potential remedies
for workplace injuries. the following provides some brief highlights.


     manufacturing operations: workstation evaluations are conducted in xerox facilities worldwide for
     ergonomic hazards based upon risk proﬁle and injury experience. ergonomic enhancements such as
     tilt tables, lifts and hoists make it easier for employees to maneuver parts and equipment during
     assembly.
     machine service: xerox customer service engineers’ (cses) exposure to ergonomic hazards has
     been studied. the ﬁndings have helped us select tools and develop procedures to mitigate risk of
     musculoskeletal disorders. throughout the equipment design process, evaluations are done to
     assess risks for our cses. the best time to make a modiﬁcation is when a product is still in the
     design or early test phases.
     ofﬁce ergonomics: our largest employee population is ofﬁce-based. raising awareness and helping
     employees make effective workstation changes is critical to minimizing risk for this population. we
     created computer-based training on ergonomics principles and practices. this method of delivery
     enables employees to go through needed training programs at a time that minimizes business
     interruptions. for employees that require additional ergonomic technical assistance due to
     workplace injuries or medical accommodations, we have partnered with a third-party consultant to
     conduct more detailed ergonomic assessments. by leveraging this consultant we are able to better
     support a larger geographic area. we also continue to focus on ways to unify the ergonomics
     program across all sectors of business.


asset protection and fire safety
the xerox asset protection and fire safety program provides ﬁre-safe workplaces and limits the
potential for losses to xerox equipment and property from ﬁre, explosion and natural hazards, such as
windstorms, snow-loading collapse and ﬂoods. the program includes periodic inspections, management
reviews of ﬁndings, and mitigation planning. our philosophy is to maintain our higher-valued locations
at a “highly protected risk” standard. in addition, locations are reviewed for conformance to xerox
standards and recognized ﬁre and life safety standards. we continue to demonstrate strong loss control
performance and beneﬁt from favorable insurance rates and premiums.


contractor safety process
the goal of the contractor safety program is to ensure contracted work conforms to all applicable
regulations and xerox environmental, health and safety requirements. contractors are qualiﬁed to the
safety and health requirements prior to beginning work at a xerox location. contractors are required to
submit a job safety plan and workers on u.s. xerox sites attend an orientation session. incidents and
injuries are tracked both as feedback and to measure program effectiveness. although ﬁrst established
at our rochester, new york, operations, this model has been applied successfully to many of our larger
locations.


xerox also functions as a contractor for many xerox client accounts. we have in place internal safety
standards and establish safety plans, deliver speciﬁc employee training and maintain management
oversight to ensure operations meet both xerox and client requirements.

our workplace health programs include processes for emergency medical response, the characterization
of employee ﬁtness for duty, illness prevention, pre-employment drug testing and health and wellness
promotion.


programs are in place for conducting medical exams in connection with safety-sensitive work, and drug
testing and immunizations based upon speciﬁc work operations and client accounts. ehs&s and
corporate risk management partner on managing accommodations and post injury or disability return
to work processes.


preventing and monitoring workplace exposures
to protect employees from unsafe exposure to chemicals, noise and radiation, xerox applies exposure
limits to worldwide manufacturing, research and technology service operations based upon the
threshold limit values (tlv) recommended by the american conference of governmental industrial
hygienists. these reﬂect the best advice of a widely respected committee of international experts.
however, in jurisdictions where government regulations are more stringent, xerox meets those regulatory
requirements. for some materials — including toners and certain solvents and metals — xerox has
established exposure limits that are more stringent than the tlv or existing regulations and standards.


using the xerox exposure assessment process, industrial hygiene and safety professionals monitor,
assess and report workplace exposures. effective process design, engineering controls, safe job
procedures and personal protective equipment are used to control exposures and protect employee
health. medical surveillance programs are in place to monitor the health of employees working in
operations with speciﬁc jobs and hazards (e.g., high noise, organic solvents). results of those medical
exams are reviewed to ensure no adverse health effects.


of the workplace exposures monitored in 2015, approximately 99 percent were within xerox limits. all
were within regulatory limits or were controlled through the proper use of personal protective equipment
where engineering controls were not possible.


environment, health and safety project reviews
we continually make modiﬁcations to work processes and operations to improve efﬁciency and
effectiveness. to ensure these changes meet xerox safety standards and follow our risk management
philosophy, projects are reviewed by technical safety and environmental professionals. the scope of the
project is deﬁned, potential safety and environmental impacts are characterized, and control
requirements are established before the project is initiated. the process serves to inform the engineering
and management teams about safety requirements and ensures all project designs have controls
integrated into work plans. the process ensures environmental, health and safety requirements are
understood and implemented at the beginning of the project.




                                                                                                             85/137

evolving the workplace

talent management and workforce
development
at xerox, we’ve built a culture around learning. rather than simply “delivering training,” we integrate
learning into day-to-day work. our employees have access to a library of learning tools aligned with our
corporate vision, values and business direction. so whether an engineer wants to brush up on writing
and editing or an accountant wants to learn what it takes to be a manager, employees can delve into
what interests them and take ownership of their own development.


we rely on the expertise of our workforce to remain competitive and thrive. for us, learning is about
much more than just delivering training.


our key priorities include:
     integrating learning with work
     building a culture of learning
     fostering ownership of high-performance and career-focused learning among employees

career planning
we want employees to have rewarding careers at all levels, and our learning strategy and assets play an
important part in making sure they do. managers and employees work together to build individualized
learning plans. in addition, we are developing our next generation of leaders. when managers identify
an emerging leader on their team, they work with the individual to plan future learning, education and
job roles. in addition, they alert their own management team about the emerging leader.


each year, our ceo and her senior team discuss individual performance and career paths with those who
are poised to assume key management roles. our human resource development council provides a
forum for senior management to review the future needs of the organization, noting strengths, gaps
and strategies to build strong teams for years to come.


learning resources
all employees (plus authorized business partners) can access our online learning environment,
learning@xerox. this includes resources for many industry and xerox proprietary certiﬁcations. in
addition to on-demand virtual learning, we offer face-to-face and virtual instructor-led classes, online
collaboration, user-generated sharing, customized online portals and performance support to our people
worldwide.


on-the-job training is tailored to improving current capabilities as well as building a foundation for the
future. these experiences provide hands-on opportunities to expand and enhance skills.


we also encourage employees to participate in advanced degree and certiﬁcation programs and, in
some cases, offer support.


we realize that a strong employee onboarding experience for new hires is important for their success.
the experience combines aspects of education about xerox culture and values with guidance about
critical elements like beneﬁts and direct deposit. targeted learning paths cover topics such as ethics,
diversity and inclusion, and security, as well as organization and critical job-speciﬁc information.

                                                                                                             86/137

asset access
during 2015, 1.2 million learning assets were accessed through learning@xerox by our employees and
partners. xerox employees and authorized partners have round-the-clock access to a collection of
approximately 750,000 learning resources, including videos, online classes and digitized books.
xstreamvideo, our video-sharing platform, contains more than 11,000 videos created by xerox
employees which increase workforce engagement, allow our people to identify and promote innovative
solutions and accelerate the adoption of successful business strategies.


we are currently working to improve our tracking and reporting process for employee training that
occurs outside of our learning@xerox environment.


learning@xerox is our web-based global learning platform that supports both formal and informal
development needs.


xerox provides learning portals with curated resources targeted to speciﬁc employee population needs.
each portal is aligned to our workforce development strategy. in early 2016 we launched
leading@xerox, an enterprise gateway to enable the targeted development of leaders at all levels.
leading@xerox provides a carefully selected collection of internal and external learning resources,
including videos, courses, books, and audio books for each level of leadership.


we evaluate all learning activities to ensure they contain relevant knowledge, ﬁll skill gaps and promote
the development of our employees. we assess the impact on our business through competency
development impact studies, which help us understand how our training enhances productivity.


our global learning and development have been recognized by the human capital development industry
for thought leadership and spotlighted in publications such as training magazine, elearning! magazine,
and chief learning ofﬁcer magazine. we have received industry recognition from bersin by deloitte as a
“learning leader” and won the whatworks® award. our xstreamvideo platform was proﬁled by ceb as
a leading example of enabling workforce knowledge sharing.


in 2015, xerox was recognized as a learning leader through participation in the white house summit
focused on the president’s upskill america initiative. the commitment to our workforce was referenced
in the associated white house report.

evolving the workplace

employee rights
at xerox, we protect the fundamental rights of our employees and respect the laws and customs of the
countries in which we do business.


we recognize our employees are our greatest asset. we continually strive to provide all of our employees
with a safe workplace, free from all forms of harassment and discrimination. we have global policies and
practices to ensure the highest ethical standards. all of our employees are to be treated fairly and
equitably regardless of nationality, religion, ethnic origin, gender, sexual orientation, language or any
other protected status.


many xerox employees are represented by labor unions, trade unions or work councils throughout our
global operations. relationships with these groups are based on applicable laws in each country.


     in europe, we recognize a variety of work councils and trade unions as established under european
     labor laws to meet requirements for information and consultation for the protection of employee
     rights. of the nearly 20,000 employees in europe, approximately half or 10,396 are covered.
     in the united states and canada, we maintain a cooperative and effective relationship with ﬁve
     unions that represent nearly 1,500 employees in 8 locations: workers united, the international
     union of operating engineers (iuoe), communications workers of america (cwa), the united
     brotherhood of carpenters, and the service employees international union (seiu), through a
     cooperative agreement with workers united.


operational changes to collective agreements
in the u.s., the notiﬁcation periods required for operational changes are speciﬁed in the different
collective bargaining agreements and vary depending on the location and type of change. as a default,
each agreement contains a “duration clause” which provides that if either party desires to make
changes to the agreement before its termination, written notice must be given 60 days prior to the
expiration date.


grievance processes
each collective bargaining agreement in the u.s. includes a provision allowing for unions to ﬁle
grievances. the number of steps in the grievance process, however, is unique to each collective
bargaining agreement, with the ﬁnal step being binding arbitration.




                                                                                                            88/137

putting customers first

customer satisfaction
our customer experience is the key to our success. by listening to customers and enhancing our work
based on their input, we are able to develop both meaningful relationships and quantiﬁable analytics to
continuously improve our programs and process.


relationship surveys
through relationship surveys, we ask our customers and partners about their experiences working with
xerox. the surveys identify levels of customer satisfaction with our products, services and support. the
feedback helps us determine which improvements are most likely to bolster customer value and help
differentiate us from the competition. we follow a rigorous management process to ensure customer
feedback is addressed at multiple levels with full accountability by the business.


transactional surveys
we employ transactional surveys to monitor satisfaction with our products and services. these surveys
help us to diagnose root causes of complex issues. transactional surveys also tell us if we have achieved
the objectives of our service-level agreements and if our customers are satisﬁed with individual
interactions.


tracking customer satisfaction
our global customer experience platform includes survey features and functions, as well as advanced
analytics capabilities, which drive progress in our customer experience program through better insights
and closed-loop follow-up. in addition, the centralized platform provides a basis for governance and
measurement process oversight.


social media
we have several customer support social media offerings, enhancing the online support experience and
providing new ways for customers to engage with xerox support in the u.s.:


     the xerox support community offers a peer-to-peer forum where customers and other industry
     professionals can collaborate about xerox equipment and software. customers may also access this
     online community with their mobile devices, enhancing their support experience with social
     networking on the go.
     the at your service blog provides customers with a light-hearted and insightful look into
     equipment features and services.
     xerox’s latest support news is shared with followers of the @xeroxsupport twitter handle.
     customers may also engage with us for product information and technical assistance.

we actively listen to, and engage in, conversations generated by consumers in public forums and social
media. this enables us to better understand consumers’ experiences with our products and processes
and their perceptions of our brand. social media listening focuses on individual, publicly available
conversations and provides insight into the impact of our products, processes, people, innovations and
communications.


xerox corporate focus executive program
the xerox corporate focus executive program fosters relationships with our top corporate accounts. a
senior xerox executive is assigned to collaborate with our account team to understand customer

requirements, establish and implement strategic account plans, marshal resources to eliminate customer
concerns and build strong, productive customer partnerships that enhance customer satisfaction and
accelerate revenue growth.


executive customer care program
for more than 20 years, our corporate ofﬁcers have volunteered in a rotation as “customer care ofﬁcer
of the day.” the program provides customers the opportunity to share their concerns with our senior
leaders. it also gives our executives a unique opportunity to hear from a broad range of customers
ﬁrsthand.


the ofﬁcer, supported by a team of dedicated professional problem solvers, assumes personal
responsibility for assisting with any and all customer concerns. the ofﬁcer of the day has three main
priorities: listen to the customer, address the customer’s problem and take the necessary action to ﬁx
the underlying cause. it is a time-honored commitment to our customer focus.




                                                                                                         90/137

putting customers first

innovative solutions
innovation is more than a buzzword at xerox. it’s what we use smartly and strategically to help the
world tackle many daunting and laborious tasks. our mission and heritage to help our customers be
more successful has led us on a fascinating journey where we innovate services, technologies and
solutions that improve the ﬂow of work, help our environment and enhance people’s lives.


xerox godenver and gola apps use innovation and analytics to get
a grip on urban growth.




we have more than 600 researchers and engineers at xerox. since we acquired afﬁliated computer
services in 2010, many of these individuals have shifted focus to our services business. we’ve developed
more than two-dozen technology platforms to drive our business. these platforms support more than
100 customer offerings, such as the merge™ parking platform, mobile analytics platform, citysight ®,
maven® outbreak management software and the xerox® program integrity validator. today,
approximately 40 percent of our patent ﬁlings are in support of our services offerings.


customer dreaming sessions
in the words of sophie vandebroek, xerox chief technology ofﬁcer and president of the xerox
innovation group, “something is only an innovation if it makes a difference to our clients or to the
world.” so the question is, how do you know what delights your customers? in our case, we ask them.


at xerox, we view our customers as partners in innovation. our researchers observe customers and their
clients directly in their work environments and employ ethnographic methods to identify needs and pain
points. last year, we conducted nearly 200 customer events with more than 2,500 participants. more
than half of those interactions were dreaming sessions, where researchers and customers get together
to explore the future of the customer’s business and identify the key issues.


from those deep dives spring ideas that develop into business opportunities. for example, we’re working
on ways to make it easier to harness data from images. scientists and engineers from our four global
research centers are applying advanced image processing, sophisticated algorithms and predictive

                                                                                                           91/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

analytics to a range of industries, including transportation and healthcare.


the merge® parking management system, deployed in downtown los angeles, is one example of a
solution built on xerox innovation. this ﬁrst-of-its-kind system gathers and analyzes data from smart
meters, off-street parking lots and more than 6,000 on-street parking sensors to provide a complete
picture of parking demand. motorists use their smartphones and vehicle navigation systems to obtain
real-time information on parking rates and available parking spaces, and to make payments. in
addition, smart-pricing algorithms adjust parking rates based on demand. this demand-based pricing
helps eliminate congestion by offering incentives to drivers to use a different mode of transportation or
park farther away.


xerox is developing an easy-to-use transit solution, called xerox seamless™, which will provide a new,
disruptive model for public transport mobile payments. operators would simply install near field
communication (nfc) tags provided by xerox on their transport network. the tags use a patented
method, developed by xerox research and development teams based in grenoble and valence, france,
to secure the encrypted transactions and transmit them even without network connectivity.


the xerox seamless solution will come with a smartphone app that makes it easy for public transport
customers to manage their travel. travelers will simply download the seamless app and register. billing
will be processed automatically, based on the trips completed on the various transport providers.




                                                                                                            92/137

safe services and products
safety has always been a cornerstone of our work in product development. our comprehensive product
safety plan details speciﬁc requirements and all xerox imaging equipment is assessed for conformance
to these requirements. we assess all potential hazards, including the ways in which different hazards
may interact. we take a conservative position on potential health risks to employees and customers,
always meeting or exceeding government safety regulations. we have robust processes for tracking
regulatory violations and non-conformity with voluntary codes and labels.


customers are encouraged to review product safety information and understand the environmental
proﬁle of our devices. user guides contain information regarding safe use as well as any applicable
hazard warning. our product safety data sheets (psds) offer environmental, health and safety
information for each xerox device. safety data sheets (sds) identify hazards associated with speciﬁc
materials and describe how they can be safely handled, used and stored. both our sds and product
labeling have been updated to meet the requirements of the globally harmonized system of
classiﬁcation and labeling of chemicals as implemented through regulations in our various markets.
customers can access sds and psds in multiple languages at www.xerox.com/environment.


ergonomic design
we consider the ergonomic aspects of our products from both a user and a service standpoint to ensure
inclusion and operability. our design teams consider all points of human interface, including a product’s
height, curves, placement of touch screens and paper trays. customers work directly with the designers
in our labs to test and continually improve the usability of new products.


machine emissions
consistent with the world’s most stringent ecolabels, we design products to control emissions of
chemicals and noise. as a result, current products have achieved chemical emission levels that are well
below global regulatory requirements — often at or near the detection limit of our measurement
equipment — and are considered to have a negligible impact on customers’ work environments. we
publish emissions data on each product’s safety data sheet.


toner study
in 2013, we concluded a comprehensive investigation that lasted more than three decades on the
health risks of inhaling xerographic toner. the studies included assessments of the health of current
employees and an assessment of the causes of death for people who worked for the company between
1960 and 1982. the analyses demonstrated that the health and mortality patterns of xerox employees
are consistent with a healthy working population, and in fact, our employees had a lower rate of disease
(i.e., are healthier) than the general population. in october 2010, the mortality study was published in
the peer-reviewed journal of occupational and environmental medicine.

data privacy
at xerox, we take the utmost care to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of information our
customers provide.


our success depends directly on the extent to which our customers trust us to manage their business
processes. we have policies and controls in place to ensure privacy protection for our customers’
personally identiﬁable information. our policies follow industry best practices, like the use of encryption
technology and data loss protection software.


additionally, we research and monitor the data-protection laws in the countries where we do business to
ensure that we comply with applicable requirements. for example, we comply with the following
international laws where applicable:


     canadian personal information protection and electronic documents act
     european union directive 95/46/ec on the protection of personal data
     u.s. “safe harbor” framework, which was negotiated between the u.s. department of commerce
     and the european commission as a way for u.s. companies to provide privacy protection as
     required by directive 95/46/ec
     applicable u.s. federal and state privacy laws

we govern our privacy practices through the xerox ethics hotline and independent external sources,
such as the better business bureau and eu safe harbor programs. both resources give customers and
employees an outlet to report any concerns about the potential misuse of data.

cybersecurity
cyber attacks pose a threat to our customers, our employees, and our partners — in short, our very
business. that’s why we’re always on the alert, working to stop hackers who would deface our website
or gain access to sensitive information. we have comprehensive plans to deal with sophisticated threats,
such as organized cyber criminals, cyber-espionage groups and even state-sponsored intrusion.


our cybersecurity strategy has ﬁve major components:


data-centric protection
we use data segregation, encryption and data-loss-prevention technologies to ensure safe and secure
processing and sharing of critical information. in addition, all data is classiﬁed according to its
sensitivity. this data classiﬁcation process enables us to understand the relative importance of securing
each dataset and to make an informed business decision about the level and allocation of resources
required.


standards-based management
by following industry-standard cybersecurity guidelines, we ensure our processes are repeatable,
predictable and easily understandable.


of the numerous cybersecurity control frameworks, we chose to implement both iso 27000 and the
national institute of standards & technology cybersecurity framework.


     iso 27000 information security management system — this international standard deﬁnes
     “requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an
     information security management system.” we incorporate iso 27000 as a normal part of our
     business processes. independent auditors have certiﬁed many of our systems and data centers as
     iso 27000-compliant.
     national institute of standards & technology cybersecurity framework — created through
     collaboration between industry and government, this framework protects networks and
     infrastructure. the prioritized, ﬂexible and scalable approach helps us manage cybersecurity-related
     risk in a cost-effective manner. while this framework is relatively new to xerox, it has already
     proven useful to predict, detect, disrupt or deter, respond and recover valuable data.

capability maturity assessments performed by independent parties and benchmarking with other
companies ﬁnd our implementation to be sound, relevant and aligned with industry standards.


continuous assessment
we utilize a combination of evidence-based assessments, vulnerability scanning and penetration tests to
validate that our data protection is effective and to ensure controls are operating properly on an
ongoing basis.


cybersecurity incident response
we have emergency response procedures in place throughout our business. if we were to identify an
attempted cybersecurity attack, we would take the following actions:


     identify whom to notify internally

                                                                                                            95/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     establish a multidiscipline virtual response team
     implement monitoring protocols and egress prevention
     estimate the extent of the compromise
     coordinate with legal counsel and insurance carriers
     if necessary, notify legal authorities

these steps provide a general framework; business units have detailed plans tailored to their needs. we
perform tests to assess our operational and managerial readiness on a regular basis.


cyber risk management
recent high-proﬁle breaches in the media demonstrate that any organization can suffer a cyber attack.
when this occurs, there may be costly consequences — such as regulatory ﬁnes or purchasing identity-
theft monitoring for affected parties. many companies invest in errors & omissions or cyber liability
insurance to mitigate this risk.


many insurance carriers and underwriters assess the level of risk when determining insurance rates.
xerox, as well as other companies, has received reduced premiums and/or more favorable policy limits by
implementing effective cybersecurity management.


cybersecurity is not solely the responsibility of the it department. by collaborating across our company,
we effectively manage risk, reduce the likelihood and limit the impact of exposure, and enable quick
recovery from any attack on our infrastructure, networks and systems.




                                                                                                            96/137

accessibility and mobility
xerox was the ﬁrst in the print industry to design products that were accessible and easy to operate,
and we are committed to upholding that standard for the products and services we provide today. to
make our systems more accessible for people with disabilities, we have developed accessories such as
angled consoles, magnifying lenses for visually impaired users, braille console labels and “start print”
foot switches. software for embedded web servers and print drivers is speciﬁcally designed to be
compatible with screen readers to allow people with visual impairments to operate them. we strive to
continually improve our performance in the area of accessibility and adapt products so that ease of use
is not compromised.


in 1998, congress amended section 508 of the u.s. rehabilitation act of 1973. we developed solutions
to adapt our technology for use by government workers who are disabled. we established a rigorous
process to evaluate our products’ compliance with section 508.


in the near future, there will be changes to the section 508 rules and new input from the european
union and the far east. learn more about our efforts to meet section 508 accessibility requirements.


today, we are focused on increased mobility with the anywhere, always-on enterprise. we’re enabling
enterprises to manage a complex infrastructure as employees are bringing their own devices to work
and demanding the same seamless, secure ability to ﬁnd, use and print business documents. xerox
technologies — such as mobile print solutions and predictive analytics used to improve the ease of
municipal parking — are enhancing mobility and easy access to information.

the xerox board of directors represents the interests of our shareholders in the successful operation of
the company. the board also oversees the management of xerox to ensure the vitality of the company
for our customers, employees and the other individuals and organizations that depend on us. the board
is accountable for ensuring that xerox executes its responsibilities in a legal and ethical manner in any
business environment.


oversight of our commitment to global citizenship rests with the corporate governance committee of
the xerox board of directors. the committee reviews signiﬁcant shareholder-relations issues and
environmental and corporate social responsibility (csr) matters, and ensures that our actions align with
our core values and priorities for citizenship. to that end, members of the board have reviewed a
detailed outline of this report and support its content.


in 2015, xerox strengthened its governance model by formalizing operation of a csr steering
committee and a csr council. the steering committee is ultimately accountable to the board.


the steering committee, which includes three corporate ofﬁcers reporting directly to the ceo, sets
corporate priorities, deﬁnes strategy and provides direction to the csr council. the csr council is
composed of senior executives with responsibility and subject matter expertise in csr elements, such as
environment, labor and supply chain. each member of the csr council leads a working group that is
cross-organizational and cross-functional. the csr council’s charter ensures consistent responsibilities
and coordination across workgroups. meeting cadence for both the csr council and the csr steering
committee is established at the start of each new year.

board independence
based on standards for independence developed by the new york stock exchange, the xerox board is
currently approximately 87.5 percent independent. it includes one non-independent director: xerox
chairman and ceo, ursula m. burns.


the board appoints one of the independent directors to serve as the lead independent director whose
responsibilities include: presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors; calling special
meetings of the independent directors as needed; addressing individual board member performance
matters as needed; and serving as a liaison on board-wide issues between the independent directors
and the chief executive ofﬁcer as needed.


criteria for membership
the corporate governance committee of the xerox board considers candidates for board membership
recommended by board members, management, shareholders and others. the corporate governance
guidelines require that a substantial majority of the board should consist of independent directors, and
that management representation on the board should be limited to senior company management.


although no speciﬁc minimum qualiﬁcations must be met by prospective candidates, the corporate
governance committee applies criteria set forth in our corporate governance guidelines. the criteria
include, among other things, the candidate’s broad perspective, integrity, independence of judgment,

                                                                                                            98/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

experience, expertise, diversity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of the
company’s business environment and willingness to devote adequate time and effort to board
responsibilities. nominees should bring a variety of business backgrounds, experiences and perspectives
to the board. the corporate governance committee does not assign speciﬁc weights to particular
criteria, and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees.


director election
each director stands for re-election every year at the company’s annual shareholder meeting. in an
uncontested election, each director is elected by the afﬁrmative vote of a majority of the total votes
cast for the director. any incumbent nominee who receives a greater number of “votes against” than
“for” his or her election is required to submit his or her resignation promptly. the remaining
independent directors then evaluate relevant facts and circumstances and determine whether to accept
or reject the resignation. following the ofﬁcial results of the election, the board is required to promptly
disclose, in a ﬁling with the securities and exchange commission (sec), its decision and the reasons for
the decision.


requirement for ownership of shares
all non-employee directors are expected to establish a meaningful equity ownership interest in the
company. this equity ownership interest is achieved by paying each director’s annual equity retainer in
deferred stock units (dsus). by serving on the board of directors for a period of approximately two
years, a director would hold dsus equivalent in value (as of date of grant) to at least three times a
director’s current annual cash retainer. the longer a director serves on the board and is paid an equity
retainer in the form of dsus, the larger his/her equity ownership interest in the company becomes
because, by their vesting terms, all dsus are required to be held by directors until a year after leaving
the board.


access to management, employees and advisors
board members have complete access to the company’s senior management and other employees and,
at the company’s expense, are authorized to obtain advice and assistance from outside professional
advisors of their choosing.


interaction with stakeholders
board members are expected to attend the company’s annual meeting of shareholders and be available
to speak with xerox stakeholders. to communicate with the non-management directors, you may
directly contact the chairman of the xerox corporate governance committee at the “contact the board”
link at www.xerox.com/governance.


executive sessions of outside directors
each regularly scheduled board meeting includes an executive session of only the independent directors.


board committees

composed entirely of independent directors.


the purpose of the audit committee is to assist in board oversight of the following:

doing good business

ethics and integrity
our commitment to business ethics represents more than a declaration to do the right thing. it has
become an integral part of the way we do business. in 2001, we established a business ethics and
compliance program to make sure xerox employees and all those working on behalf of the company
follow the highest ethical standards. the program aims to prevent, detect and address potential
violations of xerox’s code of business ethics and its policies, laws and regulations.


business ethics and compliance program
to oversee all ethics-related activities, xerox established a chief ethics ofﬁcer who reports to senior
management and the board of directors. in addition, the xerox ethics and compliance governance
board was formed to integrate the business ethics and compliance program into worldwide business
operations. the ethics and compliance governance board represents business and corporate
organizations within xerox and its subsidiaries, and participates in quarterly meetings chaired by our
business ethics ofﬁce.


each board member has the following duties within his/her area of responsibility:


     to establish a business ethics and compliance network
     to implement ethics training and education programs
     to ensure consistent enforcement of discipline policy
     to ensure that organization-speciﬁc policies are consistent with existing laws, the xerox code of
     business conduct and other company policies
     to oversee and make recommendations for changes to xerox policies, including the business ethics
     and compliance ofﬁce charter
     to evaluate ethics and business conduct issues and trends to proactively address potential
     problems
     to attest annually that organizational ethics and compliance programs are effective and all
     employees have completed required business conduct training and acknowledgements

code of business conduct
our code of business conduct serves as the foundation of our ethics and compliance program. it
embodies and reinforces our commitment to integrity and helps our people resolve ethics and
compliance concerns consistent with our core values and legal and policy controls. our code of business
conduct is available in 18 languages and accessible on our internal and external websites. the code is
aligned to our core values and covers policies and guidance on key topics, including sales and marketing
activities, controllership, insider trading, bribery, nondiscriminatory employment practices, privacy rights,
human rights and environmental stewardship. the code also speciﬁes employees’ obligations to report
suspected ethical violations and reinforces our strong “no retaliation policy.”


in addition to our global code of business conduct, we have a supplemental code of conduct for
ﬁnance employees and a speciﬁc code of conduct for the board of directors. as a member of the
electronic industry citizenship coalition, xerox uses the electronic industry code of conduct (eicc) as
our supplier code of conduct.


key components
at the start of every year, our ceo distributes a message on business ethics to all employees. all
employees must complete ethics training annually and acknowledge that they have read the code of


                                                                                                                101/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

business conduct. at the same time, ofﬁcers and senior managers must certify that they are in
compliance with our code of business conduct and have processes in place to support the company’s
business ethics and compliance program.


we promote awareness of our ethics and compliance program on our ethics & policies website and our
intranet. periodically, we send ethics surveys to employees in several countries to gauge the state of the
company’s ethical culture and help us focus on areas in need of improvement.


we provide a variety of channels for employees, suppliers and customers to report suspected ethical
violations, including phone, web, email and postal mail. our ethics helpline is available globally 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, in multiple languages, via toll-free telephone numbers (see
www.xerox.com/ethics) and our web reporting tool (www.xeroxethicshelpline.com) which supports
multiple languages. we’ve contracted with an independent third party that specializes in helpline
reporting with immediate electronic transfer of all reports to our business ethics and compliance ofﬁce
for case management.


for some cases, the business ethics and compliance ofﬁce provides guidance and takes immediate
action; for others, including allegations of wrongdoing, an ethics investigation is required. the ofﬁce
follows a formal, consistent method for assessing alleged violations and complaints and directs them to
the appropriate functional areas for investigation, resolution and closure. our business ethics and
compliance ofﬁce charter includes a “worldwide assignment of responsibility matrix for handling
potential ethics violations and associated penalty guidelines.” the matrix includes a wide range of
possible ethics and compliance violations within each category of our code of business conduct. ethics
allegation matters that are substantiated, in whole or in part, result in some sort of disciplinary action
— either counseling, training, warning letter, job reassignment, ﬁnancial penalty or, in some cases,
dismissal from the company. in addition to disciplinary action, resolution of many cases also may
involve changes in processes or policies to prevent future occurrences.


our business ethics and compliance ofﬁce tracks all cases from initial reporting to closure. additionally,
the ofﬁce reports quarterly case activity and trends to the business ethics & compliance governance
board and the audit committee of the board of directors, including the number of matters reported,
case categories, outcomes and disciplinary action.

program.

anti-corruption
xerox operates an active and comprehensive anti-bribery and anti-corruption program that complies
with all related laws and regulations. we have developed a global compliance program, supported by
policy and training, to ensure zero tolerance for the giving or offering of a bribe of any amount or value,
including so-called “facilitation payments.” the program also includes risk assessment of third-party
intermediaries, followed by the application of appropriate due diligence, training and certiﬁcation prior
to engagement. we are committed to enhancing the program continually.


banknote anti-counterfeiting
the risk of banknote counterfeiting has increased with the quality of digital imaging tools and color
printing technology. in response, we have joined other companies, the u.s. secret service and the
central bank counterfeit deterrence group (a consortium of 32 central banks and note printing
authorities) to assess threats to currency and support the use of anti-counterfeiting technologies.
technology to deter the use of digital equipment for counterfeiting banknotes is being standardized.
xerox sales and service employees are trained to respond to inquiries about our anti-counterfeiting
efforts.


black market supplies
every year, the global imaging industry — and the customers who use its products and services — suffer
the loss of millions of dollars due to counterfeiting or theft of supplies. we continually remind our
customers that counterfeit supplies can result in poor equipment performance, low supply yields, inferior
print quality, toner leakage, increased failure rates and equipment downtime — all of which can cost
time and money. to avoid this risk, we advise our customers to purchase solely from xerox authorized
resellers. we work closely with our procurement department to call attention to “blending” of supplies
— the mixing of counterfeit with original materials to achieve lower pricing and make detection of
counterfeit items more difﬁcult.


theft of customer supplies represents an increasingly costly problem for xerox and its customers. it is
difﬁcult to prevent because web-based sales channels make it easy to purchase stolen products and to
sell them once they are stolen. we continue to invest in technology and resources to bring the problem
to the attention of customers and to identify their obligation to maintain the security of supplies
(contracted and purchases). through engagement and support of our customers and local law
enforcement agencies, we also provide tracing of stolen goods to identify and close the sources of theft.


                                                                                                              103/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

xerox is leading the charge against counterfeiting and other black-market activities, independently and
in collaboration with other original equipment manufacturers (oems). to combat acts of piracy and
fraud, our security team routinely works with the u.s. federal bureau of investigation, attorneys general
ofﬁces, the postal inspector’s ofﬁce and other global law enforcement agencies. in addition, we are a
member of the imaging supplies coalition (isc), a trade association that serves to heighten customer
awareness of black-market activities. wholesalers, dealers and consumers may submit questionable
goods to the isc for authentication by the manufacturer. for more information, visit www.isc-inc.org.

doing good business

human rights
as a truly global enterprise, we understand that we have an obligation to play a larger role in the world.
we lead by example, encouraging respect for human rights in our own company and through our
business relationships. every employee engagement, partner relationship and customer touchpoint
represents an opportunity for xerox to exercise its commitment to human rights.


our code of business conduct supports the principles of the united nations universal declaration of
human rights. we make sure those principles are followed in our labor relations and employment
practices, relationships with suppliers, risk management, internal audit systems and our approach to
building business in emerging markets.


xerox is a member of the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc), an organization that promotes
a standards-based approach for monitoring the social responsibility of suppliers. through the eicc, we
further our commitment to human rights in such areas as labor, health, safety and environmental
activity. see supplier relations for more information.


we also manage a comprehensive data privacy program. we take utmost care to preserve protection of
customer and employee personally identiﬁable information. see data privacy for more.


a corporate-wide global policy letter serves as the foundation of our position on human rights.




                                                                                                             105/137

supplier relations
social responsibility is ingrained in our business model starting at the very beginning — with our supply
chain. as a major organization spending approximately $9 billion per year to support our operations, we
feel an obligation to actively manage our global supplier base and ensure these critical partners meet
our high ethical standards.


as a part of the purchasing process, we assess the quality, cost, delivery and sustainability of all
products and services. across the u.s., europe and asia, xerox employees source, contract and purchase
everything from transportation to technology. our often local presence encourages direct interaction
with our suppliers.

supplier code of conduct
our supplier code of conduct and compliance program are the primary tools we use to ensure ethical
management in our supply chain.


in 2006, we began working with the electronic industry citizenship coalition (eicc), whose code of
conduct sets industry standards on social, environmental and ethical issues in the electronics industry
supply chain. in 2008, we became an ofﬁcial member of the eicc. we have adopted the eicc code of
conduct as our supplier code of conduct, and xerox serves on the eicc senior executive advisory
council.


we continually reinforce the importance of the supplier code of conduct to our supplier base. we
incorporate standards from the supplier code of conduct in purchase agreements. we run a risk
assessment and require suppliers to participate in the xerox compliance program. finally, we send an
annual communication to our entire supplier base.


the xerox compliance program upholds our supplier code of conduct and our supply chain
transparency statement. the following are components of the compliance program:


     all suppliers are subject to an initial risk assessment, which is based on objective criteria.
     suppliers ﬂagged in the risk assessment — in addition to suppliers deemed critical to our supply
     chain — are required to complete detailed questionnaires. in addition to highlighting areas of
     potential concern, these questionnaires clarify our expectations and reinforce the importance of
     these topics.
     based on the assessments and questionnaires, we annually select suppliers for compliance review
     or audit.
     trained xerox personnel conduct audits on-site. audits and compliance reviews both follow the
     eicc audit format, which addresses labor practices, freedom of association, child labor and forced
     labor, human rights, environmental concerns and more.
     during the audit, we classify areas of nonconformance as “priority,” “major,” “minor” or “for
     review.” we provide each supplier with a written performance assessment.


business performance and reviews
we regularly review suppliers’ performance against expectations and contractual requirements,
prioritizing based on business risk and revenue impact. suppliers with the highest business risk and
potential revenue impact are considered “critical” and are required to maintain an acceptable business
resumption plan. we inspect these plans on a regular basis.


revenue risk criteria include:


     the amount of revenue at risk
     the total dollar amount spent
                                                                                                              108/137

                                         xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     the length of time before the machine or parts in the ﬁeld impact recovery time
     the total spend across xerox product families

business risk criteria include:


     whether a supplier is a single source
     length of time to resume normal business practice after an adverse event
     percent of business revenue xerox represents
     the stability of the industry
     propensity for natural disasters or political turmoil
     supplier’s performance in a ﬁnancial assessment

in 2015, we conducted 66 supplier audits/self-assessment questionnaires, and 32 supplier compliance
reviews, representing 62% and 24% of xerox direct/technology supplier spend respectively. since 2010,
we’ve conducted over 300 compliance reviews and audits.


conﬂict minerals
we are committed to improving mining conditions associated with mining in conﬂict regions.


     xerox has an extensive conﬂict minerals policy.
     we publish our due diligence activities in our yearly conﬂict minerals report.
     our internal processes incorporate the organisation for economic co-operation and development
     (oecd) framework for responsible supply chains of minerals from conﬂict-affected and high-risk
     areas.
     we are an active member of eicc and the conﬂict-free sourcing initiative (cfsi).
     we use the cfsi reporting template to survey our supply base about conﬂict-free mineral usage.
     we support the conﬂict free smelter program (cfsp), which independently audits smelters and
     reﬁners to determine if they have a system in place to assure sourcing of conﬂict-free minerals.
     our supplier contract template includes a speciﬁc reference to conﬂict-free minerals to ensure
     responsible sourcing in our supply chain.
     we ﬁled form sd with the sec on may 18, 2016.


supply chain security
the xerox brand is known worldwide for delivering industry-leading document technology, services and
solutions. counterfeit parts and supplies misrepresent the quality of our products and pose a serious
threat to our reputation.


     we have rigorous processes to identify and eliminate counterfeit supplies and components from
     our supply chain. read our anti-counterfeiting statement.
     whenever possible, we source from a base of trusted suppliers (and their authorized distributors)
     who have been through our comprehensive vetting system.
     we also always seek warranties guaranteeing authenticity and quality; among other beneﬁts, this
     practice mitigates obsolescence.
     if suppliers wish to substitute an item different than originally agreed upon, they must obtain
     approval from our global procurement group.
     we’ve built security controls into our supply chain to help ensure the uninterrupted ﬂow of
     products from the point of manufacture to the customer.
     we are a certiﬁed participant of the u.s. customs and border protection customs-trade
     partnership against terrorism (c-tpat) and the e.u. authorized economic operator (aeo) program
     in the netherlands and ireland. as part of these memberships, we’ve adopted speciﬁc criteria for
     both our supplier security requirements and internal security policies and standards.


                                                                                                         109/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

     we have an ongoing assessment program to monitor compliance by high-risk suppliers as well as
     internal locations. we belong to the transported asset protection association (tapa).


in 2009, xerox became the ﬁrst organization to achieve global certiﬁcation from the chartered institute
of procurement and supply (cips) in the area of procurement excellence through processes and
procedures, now known as cips silver. in 2012, xerox achieved cips gold certiﬁcation at a global level,
which recognizes our leadership in ethical, sustainable and strategic procurement and veriﬁes our
effectiveness in managing our global supplier base.


in 2015, xerox achieved the highest certiﬁcation awarded at a global level, cips platinum certiﬁcation.
the platinum certiﬁcation signiﬁes world-class levels in all aspects of ethical, sustainable and strategic
procurement when measured against cips’ globally respected standards structured around leadership
and organization, strategy, people, processes and systems, and performance measurement and
management.


the certiﬁcation process helped xerox global procurement to identify and validate internal best
practices, identify areas for improvement, and provided an unbiased measure of our organization’s
performance against benchmark industry criteria.


in addition, it was a development opportunity for our people. team members, as well as the other
resources they engaged, were energized by the experience. this project put the spotlight on the
excellent work done by our procurement team.


supplier diversity
we proactively identify and seek to work with certiﬁed small and diverse businesses. a diverse supplier
pool is a competitive advantage and a powerful business tool. we are committed to:


     actively seeking out certiﬁed diverse suppliers that can supply competitive, high-quality goods and
     services and whose business models align with our business strategy
     ensuring the inclusion of diverse suppliers as a part of our strategic sourcing and procurement
     process
     communicating the value of supplier diversity both internally and externally to all stakeholders
     leveraging our supplier diversity results to meet our clients’ supplier diversity requirements




                                                                                                             110/137

                                          xerox 2016 global citizenship report

during 2015, xerox and our subsidiaries purchased goods and services from the following:

several independent groups have recognized xerox as having outstanding supplier diversity. learn more
about the awards we have received.


diversity and inclusion are important not only to our company, but to our society and our world. we
take part in several efforts with the goal of increasing diversity and inclusion in several different
business areas.


     the inclusion initiative is committed to identifying and increasing opportunities for minority- and
     women-owned (mwbe) law ﬁrms. since joining the initiative in 2011, we have continuously
     exceeded and increased our annual goals for spend with mwbe ﬁrms.
     the national minority supplier development council’s (nmsdc) corporate plus member
     accreditation recognizes and raises awareness for deserving minority-led companies. in 2014, we
     nominated and sponsored a key partner/supplier for this program.
     we are an active member of the nmsdc and the women’s business enterprise national council.
     we participate in various national and regional conferences, matchmaker events and forums, which
     promote business with small and diverse businesses.

risk management
with global leadership comes global responsibility...not only to our people and shareholders, but also to
the suppliers, distributors and citizens of the countries in which we operate. that’s why we devote
considerable resources toward enterprise risk management (erm), anticipating and avoiding risks to the
ﬁnancial and operational health of our business.


erm follows a clearly deﬁned business strategy that is shared across the company and that is aligned
with our strategic and organizational goals. our erm process adheres to the coso ii (committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission) framework. we assess all categories of business
risk — strategic, operational, compliance, legal and regulatory, reputational and ﬁnancial reporting —
and coordinate our erm assessment with the internal audit risk assessment to ensure consistency
between the erm plans and upcoming internal audits.


several executive committees integrate erm with business management by monitoring both risk
exposure and how effectively those risks are managed.


these committees include:


     management committee
     enterprise risk steering committee
     business ethics and compliance governance board
     it risk governance board
     credit committee
     currency strategy committee
     reputation management committee
     management audit committees

in addition, the audit committee of the board of directors plays a key role in erm oversight, while the
roles of other committees (including compensation, governance, and finance) are restricted in scope.
as needed, the board will establish special committees to focus on speciﬁc business risks.




                                                                                                            112/137

business continuity
we respond to major events that could disrupt business operations — such as natural disasters and
pandemics — with comprehensive business continuity action plans. these plans are designed to
minimize adverse effects to our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and assets. they are well
documented, communicated across all business units and tested annually to ensure rapid and effective
response.


xerox is a leader in telecommuting practices. when weather, power outages, or other work disruptions
affect speciﬁc geographic areas, we are often able to continue our high level of service by redirecting
the affected activity to employees and/or systems in other locations.


as an example, severe winter weather forced the closure of our american logistics center for parts and
supplies. in accordance with our business continuity action plan, we routed requests to distribution
centers throughout the united states and set up regional locations to fulﬁll the requests. in doing so,
we protected our people and assets while meeting our customers’ needs.


safety is always our top concern. often, local customers experience the same work interruptions;
communicating with clients and other stakeholders is paramount.


our business continuity program ofﬁce is responsible for the business continuity assurance process. all
xerox organizations assess their plans against a standard set of criteria and report the status during
operational reviews.




                                                                                                          113/137

investor relations
xerox investor relations provides information about our ﬁnancial performance, strategic intent and
expectations for long-term proﬁtable revenue growth to investors, ﬁnancial analysts and potential
shareholders worldwide. investor relations pays special attention to the clarity and accessibility of this
information, which is released on a timely basis through press releases, webcasts, quarterly earnings
presentations, annual reports, and securities and exchange commission (sec) ﬁlings.


institutional investors hold approximately 85 percent of xerox’s common shares; of this group, the top
20 own close to 50 percent of the shares.


in 2015, we held the following investor-related events:


     xerox executives participated in 13 brokerage conferences.
     investors and analysts met with xerox leaders at the graph expo 2015 show in chicago, and we
     conducted an audio call related to our services commercial healthcare business.
     we hosted approximately 34 small group meetings with current and potential investors in major
     markets, including baltimore, boston, chicago, dallas, frankfurt, london, montreal, new york, paris,
     san francisco and toronto.
     xerox executives spoke with investors/analysts during approximately 315 one-on-one meetings and
     phone calls.

public policy engagement
xerox has a long-standing tradition of civic engagement. our involvement in the political process and
global public policy debate is a natural extension of our core values. we work with governments, others
in our industry and the broader business community to advocate for public policies that support our
business goals.


on issues for which our experience and knowledge add an important perspective to public debate, we
seek to educate policymakers, both directly and indirectly, through various coalitions and trade
associations. through the ofﬁce of global government affairs, we have interactions with governments
and governmental organizations throughout the u.s. (at federal, state and local levels) and around the
world. we engage on issues that range from legal, trade, tax policy and ﬁnancial activities to regulatory
compliance, intellectual property and government procurement.


international trade
we support open markets and free trade. international trade is a powerful engine of global economic
development that fosters job growth, improved living conditions and opportunities around the world. we
support government-to-government negotiations aimed at liberalizing trading rules and opening
markets, both on a bilateral and multinational basis. more open markets are critical for our technology
and service solutions where we face barriers worldwide. we believe that all participants must be
responsible citizens of the countries in which they do business.


our chairman and ceo serves as the chair of the president’s export council; the principal national
advisory committee on international trade. the council advises the president about government policies
and programs that affect u.s. trade performance, promotes export expansion, and provides a forum for
discussing and resolving trade-related problems among the business, industrial, agricultural, labor and
government sectors.


competitiveness
through our support of the change the equation initiative, which directs more resources to science,
technology, engineering and mathematics (stem) education programs, we focus on improving the
ability of the u.s. to compete on the global stage.


corporate taxation
as a global enterprise, we comply with the tax laws and regulations in all 180-plus countries in which we
operate. for more detail on the taxes we pay, please see our 2015 annual report.


at the same time, we work in support of u.s. corporate tax reform. the u.s. has the highest tax rates
among large, industrialized nations. corporate tax reform is needed if u.s. companies are to be fully
competitive in overseas markets where 95 percent of the world’s population lives.


intellectual property
as a participant in the coalition against counterfeiting and piracy, we play an active role in combating
theft of intellectual property by counterfeiters who manufacture knock-off products. we are also strongly
supportive of changes in the law that would reduce the impact of frivolous intellectual property
litigation that imposes unnecessary costs on innovative companies.



                                                                                                            115/137

                                           xerox 2016 global citizenship report

environment
our environment, health, safety and sustainability governance policy, adopted in 1991, forms the
foundation of our environmental leadership program.


state legislation
we promote policy positions that make information technology (it) more effective in supporting state
and local government missions, improve government technology acquisition processes, maximize the
positive ﬁnancial impact of it investments and create better outcomes for americans served by state
and local government agencies and programs. our ofﬁce of global government affairs has an
established network of state and local government consultants whose responsibilities include monitoring
legislation and policies that would impact our various government lines of business. examples of our
government business interests include business process outsourcing, regulation of credit card fees,
eligibility and health information exchanges, emergency management services, work zone speed
enforcement and electronic toll collections.


retirement policy
we believe policymakers should foster a legal and economic framework that encourages employers to
maintain and increase the number of workers who have access to employer-provided retirement security.
we take our commitment to our employees, both current and retired, very seriously and work with the
u.s. congress and the administration to formulate policies that allow us to meet those commitments.


healthcare
as an active player in healthcare, we promote policies that allow for sustainable, high-quality systems
that are more accessible, less costly and more patient-centered. we support every citizen having access
to quality, affordable health coverage. however, too many obstacles — regulatory mandates,
inaccessible data, inefﬁcient processes, incomprehensible billing and ever-rising costs — threaten to
undermine our ability to provide healthcare effectively. we seek to use our healthcare expertise, our
heritage of innovation and our inﬂuence to enhance the entire healthcare ecosystem. we work with
patients, providers, payers, employers and governments at all levels to improve people’s lives through
better, more accessible and more affordable healthcare.


professional organizations and associations
trade associations around the world play an important role in assisting our company with business
development opportunities and citizenship activities, as well as in helping us meet certain public policy
objectives. we are a member of a wide array of trade associations. any trade association dues, or
portions thereof, that are not deductible for tax purposes are reported in our lobbying disclosure reports.
our senior managers play a leadership role in various organizations, such as the business roundtable
and the u.s. chamber of commerce. these organizations develop and promote public policies that are
considered important to our public policy interests and operations.


while we prefer to make political expenditures directly rather than through professional organizations
and associations, xerox, like all major corporations, is a member of various 501(c) organizations that
may engage in political activities. while we may not necessarily agree with every position taken by each
organization to which we contribute, we determine that the intended use of a contribution is consistent
with our mission and core values before making a contribution to any such group. we inquire and make
a reasonable effort to obtain from those associations the portion of the dues or payments that are used
for lobbying expenditures or political contributions. to the extent it is reported to us, we disclose the
non-deductible portion of our contributions annually.




                                                                                                              116/137

       advocacy functions for the business roundtable’s tax reform efforts. the roundtable has also

code of conduct training
the xerox code of business conduct contains explicit information on our policies governing contact with
elected and appointed government ofﬁcials and agencies, as well as lobbying and political contributions.
all xerox employees are required to participate in annual training on the code of business conduct and
must certify adherence to the code upon the conclusion of the course.


employee personal political contributions
while we encourage our people to participate in community and political activities, we do not endorse
any organization or activity in which employees choose to participate; and we do not discriminate in
favor of or against employees based on the organizations they choose to support. employees are not
reimbursed directly or through increases in compensation for their personal political contributions and
expenses.


xerox contributions to 527s in 2015
the following 527 organizations received support from xerox in 2015. the name derives from section
527 of the internal revenue code, under which these organizations are tax-exempt. these organizations
have a purely political focus, rather than one supporting an issue or cause. xerox contributions to the
following 527 organizations are made with corporate — rather than xerox corporation political action
committee (xpac) — funds:


       democratic governors association
       republican governors association

xerox corporate political contributions
we have a long-standing policy that nothing of value may be given, paid, promised or offered —
directly or indirectly — from corporate treasury funds for any of the following: (1) political party,
committee and/or candidate for any federal, state or local government ofﬁce anywhere around the
world; (2) independent expenditure or ballot measure committees; (3) electioneering communications; or
(4) candidates for judicial ofﬁce.


we have an established policy that does not permit any in-kind political contributions. the only
authorized method to make political contributions on behalf of xerox is through the xerox corporation
political action committee (xpac).


xerox corporation political action committee (xpac)
xpac is supported entirely by voluntary contributions from eligible xerox employees, and all
contributions go directly to candidate campaigns for political ofﬁce. xpac is nonpartisan and actively
supports candidates and helps elect policymakers whose positions are consistent with our business
values and strategies. xpac contributions promote the interests of the company and are made without
regard for the private political preferences of company ofﬁcers and executives. we strictly prohibit the
use of xpac contributions to motivate or reward any ofﬁcial act.


every proposed political contribution undergoes an internal review process to evaluate whether it is
legally permissible and in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. in many cases, we
may not agree with every position taken by a candidate whom we support.


the xpac guidelines used as a basis for supporting candidates and elected ofﬁcials include:


       the integrity and character of the candidate
       the candidate’s position on signiﬁcant policy issues of importance to our company
       the candidate’s overall support for our company and industry
                                                                                                           118/137

                                            xerox 2016 global citizenship report

       the candidate’s overall support for the free enterprise system and u.s. competitiveness
       a demonstrated willingness on the part of the candidate to work with our company and industry
       to achieve responsible public policy solutions
       the candidate’s representation of a state or district in which our company has signiﬁcant
       employees or facilities
       whether the candidate holds a leadership position within their political party
       the candidate’s electability
       permissibility under applicable law

in addition, xpac focuses on contributions that go directly to candidates for ofﬁce. special exceptions

  our goal: zero waste to landlls
  in 2015, we managed 94 percent of non-hazardous solid waste beneﬁcially, up from 93
  percent in 2014. we’ve established an aspirational goal to drive our reuse/recycle rate to
  100% by 2020 at our technology facilities compared to a baseline year of 2009.

  to learn more about this information see our chart in the responsible operations section
  of this report for further details.

  conserving water
  as part of our commitment to conserve resources, we monitor water consumption across
  our manufacturing, distribution and r&d facilities worldwide. having met our corporate
  goal to reduce water consumption by 21 percent by 2014 (against a 2009 baseline), we
  established a goal to reduce water consumption by 35% by 2020 (against a 2010
  baseline). water consumption in 2015 was down 38% against the 2020 goal.

  reducing greenhouse gas emissions
  since 2012, scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas emissions are down 20
  percent.* the reductions are the result of improved energy efﬁciency, new technologies
  and improved energy management practices.

  * note: the 2012 baseline has been restated. in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol,
  inventory adjustments are completed each year as a result of the opening and closing of
  facilities and the use of more appropriate emission factors to make data and performance trends
  between years more comparable.

  see more detailed information on greenhouse gas emissions.

new products achieve the energy star® rating
in 2015, 100 percent of our new eligible products met energy star requirements. we’ve
continuously reduced power consumption of our laser-based printing products by
adjusting fuser design, changing properties of toner, implementing more efﬁcient
electronic controls and improving the entire xerographic system.

end-of-life management
our approach to managing products at end-of-life translates into signiﬁcant
environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts. globally, our combined returns programs (equipment
remanufacture in conjunction with parts and consumables reuse and recycling) prevented
over 47,500 metric tons of waste from entering landﬁlls in 2015 alone.

energy use reduction
at the conclusion of the energy challenge program, we successfully reduced energy
consumption by 31 percent and cut emissions by 42 percent — that’s 210,000 tons of
carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e). our new corporate-wide goal is to reduce energy
consumption an additional 20 percent by 2020 (from a 2012 baseline). in 2015, we
reduced energy consumption by 12 percent and cut emissions by 20 percent — that’s
65,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (co2e).*

reducing emissions by reducing employee air travel
business travel plays a role in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. in recent years,
we’ve promoted videoconferencing and other technology as environmentally friendly
alternatives to air travel. thanks to these efforts, we’ve reduced emissions due to air
travel by 7 percent per employee from 2012. this is equivalent to 0.1 (1000 mt co2 eq)
per employee.

voice of the employee survey
for over 45 years, our senior teams have surveyed employees and acted upon that
feedback. our voice of the employee (voe) survey was administered in october and
november 2015. we received results from 61 countries in 20 languages. nearly 66,000
employees shared their thoughts and knowledge from every division, every job function*
and every job level. the chart below represents the percentage of satisﬁed employees.

employee diversity — female employees
we gain a competitive advantage as we continue to draw on the experience and
creativity of a well-balanced, diverse workforce. that means we’re better able to
understand and meet changing demands for our products and services. simply stated, a
balanced workforce makes good business sense.




                                                                                            126/137

employee diversity — minority employees
employees with different ways of thinking — and different ways of perceiving our world
— are employees who create innovative solutions. in a business like ours, whose lifeblood
is fresh ideas, this variety of perspectives is a priceless resource and a key to achieving
critical business results.

minorities represent 48 percent of employees and 15 percent of executive and senior-level
managers in the u.s. diversity reporting is not tracked in most other countries.

measuring customer satisfaction
in 2011, we began investing in a new customer satisfaction process to ensure a stronger
focus on understanding and fulﬁlling customer needs and expectations. the new process
solicits feedback from our technology customers around the globe, providing detailed
insights that help us identify systemic issues and make the necessary changes that ensure
strong customer satisfaction. improved closed-loop follow-up processes also enable faster
responses to individual problems.

2012
we continued our investment in the customer satisfaction process begun in 2011 to
ensure our award-winning service and customer-centric approach builds customer loyalty
and trust.


2013
we further developed our customer satisfaction process and saw positive results, both in
the feedback from our customers and in the internal measures we use to assess the
quality of what we are delivering to the marketplace.


2014
xerox centralized client satisfaction measurement activities and provided governance and
oversight on the measurement process with emphasis on improving our closed-loop
follow-up process. from 2013 to 2014, xerox improved average satisfaction scores in six
out of eight customer experience areas we measure in our quarterly global relationship
survey.


2015
we continue to measure the perceptions of our customers globally, using relationship and
expanded touch-point voice of the customer programs. in 2015, we focused on increasing
customer participation and managing for a quicker closed-loop follow-up. having a
signiﬁcant amount of feedback is important to help us deliver value to our customers, and
we take action on their feedback.
