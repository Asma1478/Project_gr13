reflecting on our past

our 2014 sustainability report marks a significant point in the history of the doe run company (doe run).
in 2014, we celebrated our 150th anniversary by recognizing the efforts of the past as we prepare for the
future. in reviewing the records of our predecessor, st. joseph lead company, it was both fascinating and
somewhat humbling to see the early challenges the company overcame in order to reach this landmark
anniversary. from fires and floods to wars and the great depression, the leaders and employees of st.
joseph lead company and doe run persevered. today our challenges are different, but in some ways,
just as daunting.

we celebrated our past by sharing our history broadly with employees, our communities and other key
stakeholders. perhaps one of the most lasting efforts is a microsite that hosts historical photos, a timeline
of 50 key events, and interviews with retirees and employees that enabled us to capture our history for
generations to come.

our company today

2014 was a historic
year for reasons other
than our anniversary as
it also marked the first
year of operation
following the closure of
our primary smelter in
herculaneum, missouri.
the closure of our
primary smelter — the
last such facility in the
u.s. — meant our
business transitioned
dramatically. today, the
lead concentrates we
                                                               supporting mining on capitol hill
produce must be                   jerry pyatt testified on the critical risks facing the minerals industry before a u.s. house of
exported in order to be                                      representatives subcommittee in 2014.
converted into primary
lead metal. this was a significant change for our organization, as well as for the domestic industry that
depended on primary lead metal. read more about how we worked with customers to prepare for the
transition.

the decreased production of lead metal in the u.s. placed north america in a deficit of 63,000 metric
tonnes. this deficit was made up by record imports. in 2014, imports of lead metal to the u.s. reached an
all-time high of 464,000 metric tonnes, and as a nation we became even more dependent on foreign metal
production.

our smelter closure also meant a transition for our operational organization. we created a metals division

in 2014, which combines all operations and personnel from our resource recycling (secondary smelter)
facility with our continuing refinery and alloying operations at the herculaneum property.

remediation of the smelter property in herculaneum is underway and is expected to take until at least
2020. a portion of that property was leased to riverview commerce park llc and converted to a shipping
port along the mississippi river. two companies use the port to transport fracking sand, and total shipping
increased from around 100,000 tons (in 2013) to approximately 600,000 tons in 2014.

our secondary smelter in boss, missouri, now represents our sole producer of lead metal for the company.
this smelter receives lead scrap and recycles it for future use. the company’s earliest miners likely never
conceived that the metal they produced more than 100 years ago would continue to be in circulation today.
nor could they have envisioned that today more than 80 percent of all lead is used in batteries to power 1
billion passenger vehicles globally. the 99 percent recyclability of lead-acid batteries is a modern
sustainability story.

in 2014, doe run and the north american lead recycling industry as a whole faced limited lead scrap
availability, which increased costs for feed materials. in addition, we continue to fine-tune our processes to
meet the increased domestic demand for secondary lead and alloys, as well as to address environmental
requirements. specialty lead alloys are critical to our future as they help power advanced battery
chemistries in hybrid vehicles, including a prototype nghv (natural gas hybrid vehicle) dodge ram 1500
truck. doe run showcased the truck at missouri university of science and technology in fall 2014. other
auto manufacturers also are exploring advanced lead-carbon batteries for stop-start hybrid vehicles that
combine traditional gasoline-powered engines with electric motors to reduce carbon emissions and
improve mileage. we are proud to be a part of efforts like this that contribute to a more sustainable world.

as part of the overall lead industry, doe run continues to take on leadership roles with trade organizations,
such as the international lead association , association of battery recyclers and battery council
international. these organizations champion innovative new uses for lead, and proactively establish
programs to promote safety. in 2013, lead manufacturing and mining companies industrywide introduced
voluntary targets to reduce workforce blood-lead levels for all employees to below 30 micrograms per
deciliter (µg/dl) by the end of 2016. blood-lead levels are the trace amount of lead the body absorbs
through occupational exposure. the u.s. occupational safety and health administration requires that
employees of lead industry companies be removed from their jobs if their blood-lead levels exceed 53
μg/dl on a six month average.

doe run has taken an even more protective approach by proactively monitoring employees’ blood-lead
levels on a monthly basis if they exceed 19 μg/dl at the southeast missouri mining and milling division or
15 μg/dl at the metals division. we remove employees from exposed areas if they exceed 30 μg/dl.

a commitment to safe work conditions is our number one priority, and doe run achieved a number of
safety milestones and awards this year, including a perfect safety record for 15 years at our fabricated
products inc. (fpi) subsidiary in arizona. in addition, our mine rescue teams achieved top honors,
including the title of national champions. read more about both here.

other challenges for the year included some land depressions and sinkholes that appeared in april on our
west fork mine property. used as an entry point for our other mines, the depressions and the subsequent
additional inflow of water into the west fork mine required us to close the site. we continued to address
the situation throughout the year, working with all appropriate agencies. more information can be found
here.

looking forward

overall, 2014 was an eventful year for doe run as we adjusted to the changing nature of regulatory and
market forces. the loss of america’s ability to turn an important mineral into metal for domestic
manufacturers must be underscored. such a loss jeopardizes the future of battery producers and also
means the u.s. has lost the opportunity to capture the value-added economic benefit of the full supply
chain. for that reason, i was honored to be called to testify before the u.s. house committee on natural
resources subcommittee on energy and mineral resources in july 2014 to share how regulations
impacting mining and metal production, such as those that impacted our primary smelter, put our country
on a dangerous path of foreign dependence.

doe run supports continuous improvement and sound, science-based policymaking. however, we believe
that in some areas, regulatory agencies are over-reaching and creating burdensome regulations that are
not based on health risks. the result for our company is record environmental spending the last two years
at the price of research and innovation opportunities.

our industry must explore innovations in mineral recovery, increased energy density and revolutionary
technologies, like our proposed lead electrowinning process. however, competing resource allocations,
such as those to address new regulations, impede our ability to bring new technologies to fruition. we
must continue to pressure our regulators to take a right and responsible approach backed by sound
science. we invite interested parties to visit our new website www.wearedoerun.com to learn more and
show their support.

if you are reading this report, you are important to us. we work hard to obtain the opinions of our
stakeholders through qualitative and quantitative surveys. according to our 2014 survey, we know safety
and jobs are a primary concern. we’d like to know more. please consider answering a few questions on
our online survey or email me at the below address.

finally, it is an honor to preside over a company at this historic juncture in our history. despite our
challenges, we are optimistic that the intrinsic importance of minerals and metals, and the need of society
to recycle and reuse products in a sustainable fashion, bode well for doe run and the lead industry — the
most recycled metal on the planet.

sincerely,

celebrating 150 years of missouri mining and metal
production
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /150th-anniversary/

march 2014 marked the 150th anniversary of the doe run company (doe run) and its predecessor, st.
joseph lead company, which traces its roots to an 1864 land purchase of 946 acres in bonne terre,
missouri. the company honored its anniversary with a yearlong celebration of its past and current
employees, its local communities, and mining’s contribution to missouri’s history and economy.

a cross-functional team of 10 employees from the company’s mines, mills, recycling facility and corporate
headquarters planned the anniversary activities. the committee focused on community events and public
education through local media coverage and a regional advertising campaign titled “mined here. produced
here. recycled here. employed here.”

“our goal was to educate our communities about our role in missouri’s history, and to commemorate how
mining and metal production shaped the state’s economy in the past, and continues to contribute to society
today,” said senior communications liaison and campaign manager, tammy stankey.

the 150th anniversary education campaign included:

    the doeruncelebrates150.com interactive timeline documenting 50 key events in the company’s
    history.
    a brochure highlighting historical facts shared with 3,000 employees and retirees, and distributed at
    community events.
    a video documentary utilizing historical film and employee interviews recorded at the missouri
    historical mine museum.
    a series of “miners’ moments” in which employees shared their favorite company memory with the
    community on local radio stations.
    a historical photography slide show presented during old miners’ days in viburnum, missouri.
    participation in nine community parades and events.
    appreciation gifts and celebrations for employees and retirees.
    a print, radio and billboard advertising campaign to highlight the number of people employed, and
    the volume of ore mined and lead-acid batteries recycled by doe run.

“we spent months uncovering documents and photos that captured doe run’s rich and resilient history,
and we are proud to share that history with community members — many of whom have a direct
connection to doe run and our predecessors,” said jim husman, doe run senior resource geologist for
more than 30 years. “throughout its early history, the company persevered through floods, wars,
rudimentary mining and smelting techniques, and the great depression. when ore at the original location
was nearly depleted, company geologists discovered the viburnum trend, which is today a world-class
ore body and an operation renown as an innovator for safe, high-tonnage underground mining throughout
the world. i’m proud to be a part of this history and help preserve it for decades to come.”

to highlight some of the company’s rich tradition of innovation, doe run showcased a refurbished st. joe
shovel, the world’s first electric shovel for mining that was designed by company engineers. originally built

in 1922, the shovel was one of only 52 that were built to replace hand shoveling in the company’s missouri
mining operations. a typical hand-shoveling employee loaded about 21 tons of rock in one day. with the st.
joe shovel, an operator could load nearly 300 tons each day. by comparison today, doe run operates
front-end loaders underground that weigh 34 tons with a capacity of 9 tons in each bucket load. the
restored shovel traveled to seven missouri parades in 2014.

innovation within the industry continues today, and in 2014, doe run, in partnership with the advanced
lead acid battery consortium, showcased a prototype dodge ram 1500 powered by natural gas and
advanced lead-based batteries at the missouri university of science and technology as part of educating
future engineers about technologies that can reduce carbon emissions, improve fuel efficiency and utilize
natural resources to power affordable hybrid vehicles.

“doe run has a proud history as both a great employer and an innovator,” said jerry pyatt, doe run
president and ceo. “few companies today have thrived as long as we have. we’ve done so as a result of
the efforts of our employees, our commitment to safety, and our desire to find new and better ways to do
things. as proud as i am of our history, i’m even more pleased with the opportunities we are working on
today to make missouri mining and metal production more sustainable for generations to come.”

doe run continues to operate the second-largest lead mining district in the world and one of the largest
single-site lead recycling smelters. global demand for lead is expected to grow 5 to 6 percent annually to
16 million metric tons per year by 2025. whether by researching the recovery of valuable metal from
legacy mine waste products, diversifying metal products from its secondary plant, or by exploring potential
uses for the company’s proprietary lead electrowinning process, doe run continues to innovate to meet
the demands of the future.

a look back

150 years of mining

over the last 150 years, southeast missouri’s major lead ore
bodies, the old lead belt and the viburnum trend, have
supplied the world with high-purity lead that is vital to many
industries.

primary lead metal

in its 150 years, the company has produced almost 17 million
tons, or 34 billion pounds, of primary lead metal.

recycled lead

doe run’s secondary lead smelter in southeast missouri helps
meet the industry’s lead demand by having the capacity to
recycle and recover approximately 160,000 tons of refined lead
and lead alloys annually from more than 13.5 million recycled
lead-acid batteries, which are the world’s most recycled
consumer product.

u.s. lead usage

annually, each american utilizes 45,557 pounds of minerals, including lead, which is critical to
transportation, communications, construction, healthcare,
military and technology.

listening to our community
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /community-research-results/

mark coomes, vice president – human resources and community relations for doe run, believes that
gathering community feedback helps doe run better learn how to meet the community’s needs. “the best
way to ensure we are acting as good neighbors is to ask our communities what we are doing well and
where there is room for improvement,” said coomes. “our 2014 community survey revealed that nearly 80
percent of respondents believe doe run has a good relationship with our communities. while this is an
improvement of nearly 20 percentage points since 2012, it also shows we still have progress to make.
gathering this feedback helps us be an even better neighbor.”

since the company was founded, doe run and the communities in which it operates have grown together.
the company thrived thanks to the hard working employees driving its operations, and the company giving
back to these communities by helping to build infrastructure, schools and more. doe run continues to keep
its local communities in mind when making business decisions. that’s why in 2014, doe run again
surveyed its communities to learn what matters most to them.

more than 300 residents from the areas where doe run operates — including boss, herculaneum,
viburnum and the area known as the old lead belt in st. francois county, missouri — completed
surveys for the study conducted by the survey institute of st. louis.

community notes jobs and economy are key concerns

nearly 60 percent of respondents said their most important concern is economic issues such as jobs,
unemployment and the high cost of living.

“we know good jobs and a strong local economy are a major concern for our neighbors,” said steve batts,
general manager, southeast missouri mining and milling division (semo). “we strive to employ people in
the areas where we operate. in 2014, we employed more than 1,400 people from 22 missouri counties,
and hope to continue providing good-paying jobs for our communities.

“jobs are important to communities and important to us. in fact, we face an interesting challenge in the
near future — like many industries, the mining industry has a large portion of its workforce nearing
retirement age. we are in great need of young students to pursue degrees and careers that support
mining and metal production.”

the mining industry is expected to grow by 5 to 6 percent annually through 2025. in addition, the society
for mining, metallurgy and exploration estimates the industry will need 78,000 new workers by 2019 to
replace retiring workers and support industry growth.

in missouri alone, mining operations indirectly support more than 33,380 jobs in a highly skilled, high-
paying profession, according to the national mining association’s 2014 study. compensation for
employees in doe run’s metals and semo divisions averages $75,934 (excluding benefits), which is 54
percent higher than missouri’s average wage of $49,215.

“we know that many of our positions are very technical and require specific education,” said batts.
“because of this, we support minerals education for elementary-age students and other programs that we
hope spark an interest in a mining or engineering career among our local students so they can pursue the
needed education and return to be our future workforce.”

doe run employees visit schools and youth organizations to teach students about mining and the uses of
minerals in everyday life with fun activities.

“activities like chocolate chip cookie mining teach children what goes into running a mining operation in a
fun, hands-on way,” said batts. “we enjoy visiting classrooms or youth organizations anytime we’re invited.
we’ve also made minerals education teaching tools available on our website.”

the company annually provides more than $10,000 in scholarships for students in doe run’s
communities studying chemistry, engineering, mining and geology. students can apply for the scholarships
by contacting financial aid departments at mineral area college and missouri university of science and
technology.

roadside cleanup




doe run and its employees support the local community by volunteering with area roadside and river
cleanup initiatives.

underground mine tour

doe run offers tours of its underground lead mining operations in viburnum during the annual old miners’
days event.

working safely

“again this year, community members told us they want to know that their family members, friends and
neighbors are safe while working at doe run facilities,” said coomes. “we agree. that’s why we’re
committed to training all of our employees about job safety. working safely is essential to ensure the well-
being of our employees and keep our operations running smoothly.”

the company continues to implement safety programs, like job safety analysis and behavior based
safety. these programs encourage employees to think through a job before they begin, and offer
guidelines to supervisors on providing immediate feedback about safety practices. continuous
improvement keeps safety top of mind. employees companywide completed nearly 19,000 health and
safety training hours in 2014.

doe run’s award-winning mine rescue teams train monthly to prepare for potential emergency response
scenarios. read more about doe run’s safety achievements at awards and achievements .

operating responsibly

doe run and its neighbors share a rich environment in southeast missouri.

“in the 2014 survey, our community members said doe run improved in minimizing its environmental
impact,” said coomes. “we’ve been working diligently over the years to improve processes at our
operations, and invested $71.9 million in total environmental spending in 2014 as good stewards in our
communities.” (read more at optimizing environmental investments)

in 2014, doe run and its employees focused on conservation efforts to preserve the region’s natural
beauty. employees joined the nature conservancy to clear overgrown trails and repair portions of
boundary fences at grasshopper hollow, the largest fen in north america. doe run volunteers also
supported the local stream team program by removing hundreds of tires and other waste from the big
river, meramec river and rock creek.

doe run continues to strive to accurately measure its environmental, economic and social data. due to
rounding, some percentage totals may not always equal 100 percent, but are accurate.

optimizing environmental investments
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /optimizing-environmental-investments/

water is essential to life on earth, covering roughly 71 percent of the planet. in southeast missouri, where
doe run operates, water sustains diverse plant and animal life, and supports fun activities, such as
fishing, swimming and floating. doe run continually explores ways to manage the water present in its
operations as part of its commitment to being a good steward of this important natural resource.

in 2014, doe run invested approximately $7 million on water treatment research and construction costs at
its southeast missouri mining and milling division (semo).

maximum capacity

an estimated 38 million gallons of water flow naturally into doe run’s six mines and other facilities daily. as
part of addressing significantly more stringent water quality standards, an advanced water treatment plant
(similar to a municipal water treatment plant) began operating at brushy creek mine and mill. it collects
and treats the water to meet discharge standards before it’s returned to nearby streams.

“we are diligent with our water treatment, and complete tests to confirm that the water meets water quality
standards,” said kevin james, doe run environmental engineering supervisor. “one way we quality–test
treated water is to make sure that even very sensitive species can thrive in it. while this may seem
unimportant to humans, it is an important part of the water ecosystem.”

throughout its first year of operation, it became apparent that the brushy creek water treatment plant had
potential to treat an even greater volume of water than originally anticipated. doe run worked with the
plant designers to carefully analyze the flow of water through the treatment process, and identified
opportunities for processing improvements in the system. the plant designers proposed alternative
equipment, such as larger water pumps, that could accommodate higher volumes.

“the brushy creek plant originally cost approximately $8 million to build, but by investing an additional
$500,000 in modifying the plant’s design, we almost doubled its capacity to accommodate additional water
volume,” said dan buxton, project manager at semo. “this helps us to meet our responsibilities to the
environment and our communities, as well as support the financial health of our business.”

because the water at each mine is unique, different technologies may be deployed to meet the needs of a
particular mine. for example, the brushy creek water treatment plant runs a flocculation process in which
chemicals encourage metal particles to cluster together to settle out of the water before it is released. a
similar water treatment plant is being constructed at buick mine and mill and will begin operating in 2015.

doe run’s water treatment efforts resulted in improvement at all divisions in 2014. the total amount of
lead and zinc in discharged water from all doe run facilities decreased by approximately 25 percent and
22 percent respectively.

a pilot plant tested a different water treatment process in 2014 for use at other locations, including no. 29
mine. the process, called electrocoagulation, removes metal particles from water using electrical currents.
in 2015, the glover and herculaneum facilities will test electrocoagulation for the treatment of water at the
site.

doe run also is exploring ways to manage surface water at its mine and mill sites. in 2014, the company

built a retention pond at no. 29 mine that collects storm water runoff. the water is then pumped to a series
of collection basins where metals and impurities settle out.

enhanced storage

protecting minerals in our care, especially concentrates, is another component of doe run’s
environmental programs. the company invested approximately $23 million on construction of concentrate
enclosures and baghouses at its mills since 2011. in 2014, doe run spent approximately $6.8 million to
add a concentrate enclosure and baghouse at sweetwater mill. like those installed at brushy creek mill in
2012 and buick mill in 2013, the enclosure and baghouse reduce the potential for emissions from
concentrate handling. the enclosures also help maintain the quality of milling concentrates by protecting
them from wind, rain and snow. plans are underway to construct the final concentrate enclosure and
baghouse at fletcher mill in 2015.


brushy creek enclosure

an enclosed storage building, similar to this one at
brushy creek mine and mill, was constructed in 2014
to house concentrates at sweetwater mine and mill.

brushy creek baghouse

employees regularly examine doe run’s baghouses,
like this one at brushy creek mine and mill, to replace
air filters and monitor that equipment is working
properly.

resource recycling baghouse

employees check monitoring data on baghouse
operations. baghouses capture potential fugitive
emissions.

maximum efficiency

innovation by semo’s environmental team and doe
run’s information technology team also improved
efficiency and accuracy for collecting water sample
data. together, the teams created a customized
laboratory information management system (lims)
that improved data tracking.

“previously, a lab technician manually entered the water sample data into a spreadsheet,” said amy
sanders, environmental compliance supervisor. “now, that data from the water samples is automatically
transferred from lab machines to the new lims database, reducing time and the chance of human error. as
a result, we can analyze the water sample data earlier, and respond quicker to make any necessary
adjustments to our treatment process.”

the company plans to launch the water sample tracking system at its herculaneum and glover facilities in
2015.


remediation, restoration and recreation
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /remediation/

when mining companies plan for the future, they’re focused on more than exploration and development.
they are just as active in planning the future remediation of current mines that will eventually close.
“preparing for mine closure and remediation is all a vital part of the life of the mine planning process,”
explains mark yingling, vice president – environmental, health and safety at doe run. “our commitment to
operating responsibly includes planning for the future of the site once it closes. our goal is to make closed
sites a benefit to the local area.”

st. joe state park in park hills, missouri, provides a great example of how a closed site can be converted
to a new purpose. in 1976, st. joseph lead company (a doe run predecessor company) donated land to
the state of missouri that previously housed both st. joe company mining and milling operations, as well
as the operations of an asarco inc. subsidiary. at the time, the site was vegetated. over the years, the
site became one of missouri’s most popular and profitable state parks, with off-road atv riding, swimming
beaches, bike and equestrian trails, campsites and a museum.

decades of atv use destroyed vegetation in portions of st. joe state park. in 2011, doe run remediation
crews began working at the site under an agreement with the u.s. epa, and in cooperation with missouri
department of natural resources (mdnr) – state parks department, to remediate the site in a different
manner. completed in 2014, efforts included covering and stabilizing tailings (sand-sized rock left over
from the milling process), covering 325 acres of trails with gravel, building drainage swales to control water
runoff and erosion, and building water retention ponds. previous work included replacing sand at a
swimming beach and replacing mine chat with gravel at camping sites. the park’s continued maintenance
will be handled by mdnr. nearby, doe run remediation crews also addressed and improved storm water
controls at a number of former mine sites, including leadwood, rivermines and elvins, all located in the
old lead belt area.

tri-state area

mining also took place by various companies in an area known as the tri-state area of kansas, oklahoma
and southwest missouri. production began in the 1850s and 1860s in the joplin-granby area of jasper
and newton counties of southwest missouri, and continued until the closure of the picher mines in 1967.
today, doe run contractors are addressing some chat and tailings sites in the area. remediation efforts
began in 2014 at a former mine site in jasper county. those efforts, which include removing chat and
tailings, re-grading the site and reseeding plants and vegetation, will be complete in 2015.

in herculaneum, missouri, residential yard sampling and soil remediation efforts are nearing completion as
a result of the closure of the herculaneum smelter in 2013. remediation crews continued to sample yards
within a 1.5 mile radius of the former smelter in 2014, and yards identified with elevated levels of lead in
the soil will be remediated by the end of 2015. final yard sampling and remediation, if needed, will take
place following completion of reclamation at the smelter site.

“after ending smelting operations, doe run quickly turned to identifying future uses for the site to ensure
the land continues as an economic driver for the herculaneum community,” said chris neaville, doe run’s
asset development director, and herculaneum native. “riverview commerce park llc (rcp) has

successfully transitioned existing river and rail infrastructure into a growing shipping operation.”

in november 2014, mdnr’s voluntary cleanup program approved the remedial plan for areas of the
former smelter site now utilized by rcp. the plan includes adding an approximately three-foot deep layer
of soil across portions of the property, which will prepare the area for further development of expanded port
operations. as a part of this effort, the company had to remove trees from its property. doe run will donate
trees to the city over the next few years to support the city of herculaneum’s tree city usa designation.

from smelting to shipping

in herculaneum, about 18 acres of doe run’s property along the mississippi river now operates as a
vibrant shipping port.

building on a successful first year of operation in 2013, rcp partnered with the jefferson county port
authority to add a new barge fleeting area on the mississippi river near the rcp port. the barge fleeting
area allows barges to park closer to the port, which makes loading and unloading more efficient. the
construction of the fleet area began in 2014 and was completed in early 2015.

“the shipping operations surpassed our expectations during its first two years,” said mark denton, project
manager for rcp. “what began at around 100,000 tons of sand increased to approximately 600,000 tons in
2014. with the staging area, and an upcoming second dock, we anticipate handling more than 1 million
tons of material and maintaining a 12-person workforce at the site by the end of 2015.”

supporting daily operations

in addition to remediating closed sites, remediation crews regularly support daily doe run operations. in
2014, crews assisted with repairs of land depressions and sinkholes that appeared on or near company
property at the west fork mine site. part of a depression occurred in a portion of the west fork stream
bed that crosses doe run property. after inspecting the site and obtaining permission from the u.s. army
corps of engineers and mdnr, crews rerouted a portion of the stream in order to help it maintain its
normal flow. as part of the process, doe run staff collected fish from the old channel and relocated them
into the new channel, so there was minimal loss of fish. the new channel has since shown normal aquatic
biology and water flow.

separately, in october 2014, a tailings pipe at the company’s sweetwater mine and mill broke, allowing
mostly water and tailings to spill onto the ground on doe run property and eventually making its way onto
private property. a small amount entered adair creek, with a very small amount reaching logan creek.
remediation crews worked with impacted property owners to remove tailings in a safe, effective manner.
the tailings have been removed, and impacted areas have been graded where necessary, seeded and
covered with straw.

missouri lead supplies a global market
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /missouri-lead-supplies-a-global-market/

as technology advances and developing countries evolve, our global economy becomes even more
closely connected. that’s why lead, a natural resource in abundance in missouri, plays a vital role in
meeting growing market demands around the world. as stewards of this valued resource, doe run
continues to adjust its business strategy to meet the needs of its u.s. and international customers.

“over the past several years, our business model has evolved in order to best serve our customers,” said
jerry pyatt, doe run president and ceo. “in 2014, we reorganized our business structure by merging two
divisions to create a single metals division. these efforts enable us to meet metals customers’ needs
efficiently through a single business center. the metals division, combined with our mining and fabrication
divisions, enable us to continue to generate more than $1 billion annually to missouri’s economy, and
sustain our part of the vital missouri mining industry well into the future.”

meeting lead metal demands

years before the closure of its primary smelting operations at the end of 2013, doe run proactively
identified opportunities to adapt its lead metal business to continue providing its unique services to
customers.

“in 2014, we combined our alloying, refining, casting and strip production in herculaneum, with the
secondary smelting and recycling operations at our resource recycling facility,” said gary hughes,
general manager, doe run metals division. “together, this new metals division meets the lead metal
production, refining and alloying needs of our customers.”

“doe run understands the specific requirements of our customers and meets those needs through
secondary production and refining,” said lou magdits, director of raw materials, metals division. “we
continue to serve the majority of our customers with secondary or high-purity lead.”

as a result of herculaneum smelter’s closure, the u.s. market now imports approximately 125,000 more
metric tonnes of lead to replace the lead previously produced at the herculaneum smelter. in total, the u.s.
imported more than 460,000 metric tonnes of lead in 2014, an increase of approximately 40 percent over
2013.

“in preparation to continue serving the u.s. market, our resource recycling facility also has developed an
innovative technique to deliver recycled lead at the higher purity level some customers require,” said
magdits.

through the new metals division, doe run continues to supply lead alloys and secondary lead used to
manufacture lead-acid batteries for vehicles, backup power, cell towers, data centers and heavy
machinery, like the baggage handling equipment used in airports.

“transportation in developing countries is evolving from electric bicycles and tricycles to conventional and
hybrid cars. this will continue to drive the demand for lead-acid batteries to power vehicles,” said magdits.
“manufacturers rely on recycled secondary lead for batteries, so our resource recycling facility plays an
important role in returning recycled lead metal to use in the battery market. in fact, lead-acid batteries are
recycled at a rate of 99 percent, and our facility has the capacity to recycle more than 13.5 million lead-acid
batteries annually.”

unearthing opportunities

“while metal production and recycling are important
parts of our operations, mining has been the
foundation of our business for 150 years,” said steve
batts, general manager, southeast missouri mining
and milling division (semo). “we operate the second-
largest lead mining district in the world, and the lead
concentrates we extract near viburnum, missouri, are
some of the most pure concentrates available.”

on average, lead concentrates contain approximately
45 to 50 percent lead. doe run’s lead concentrates far
surpass the industry average, containing more than 75
percent lead. prior to january 2014, a majority of doe
run’s lead concentrates were transported to
herculaneum to be smelted into primary lead metal. in 2014, doe run expanded its global concentrate
sales and now exports all concentrates for processing overseas, including copper and zinc concentrates.

“over the course of the last four years, we have identified and visited with smelting operations throughout
the world to establish direct relationships,” said john likarish, doe run marketing manager.

“in order to supply high-quality lead concentrates to the global market well into the future, doe run
explores for new ore bodies in the viburnum trend, as well as other sites in missouri,” said ross conner,
vice president – exploration at doe run. “each year we use exploration to identify mineral reserves that will
replace the ore we mine and sustain our mining business.”

“successful companies continuously evolve their operations,” said pyatt. “for more than 150 years, our
company and its predecessors have thrived by looking toward and innovating for the future. we’ve
sustained our company, which allows us to support our local economy and meet the growing demand for
lead.”

the uses of lead

lead has many applications, including underwater cabling for petroleum and communications industries;
use in more than 1 billion vehicles worldwide; protection from radiation in both medical and military
applications; backup power for telecommunications; roof flashing; ammunition; and for radiation detection
applications. fabricated products inc., a wholly owned doe run subsidiary, manufactures many lead
materials used in these applications.

roofing materials

because lead is durable and flexible, lead sheets are
used in roofing to closely fit roof pitches and to
prevent leaks. in fact, lead roofs will outlast any other
traditional building material, sometimes by hundreds
of years.

hybrid vehicles

a prototype truck, developed by the advanced lead
acid battery consortium, is powered by natural gas
and advanced lead-based batteries to reduce carbon
emissions, improve fuel efficiency and make hybrid
vehicles more affordable. doe run showcased the

technology.

scouting supply chain improvements
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /scouting-supply-chain-improvements/

equipment powers much of doe run’s mining and metal production. operations can stall if equipment
requires unplanned maintenance or replacement. doe run launched a supplier scouting program in 2014
to improve how efficiently and reliably it could source critical equipment parts and supplies.

“we asked our maintenance and production employees what challenges they face when it comes to
having the right supplies on hand when they need them,” said stephen ritchie, doe run supply chain
manager. “they noted that worn hydraulic cylinders, which help mechanical equipment like haul trucks
function, could take up to three months to repair. this can be a major setback for our operations, so we
wanted to find a local business partner to work with us to repair cylinders, which potentially reduces the
need to buy costly new replacement cylinders.”

the new scouting program identified a reliable partner in parts tek, a local salem, missouri, company,
which also helps doe run make a greater economic impact in missouri.

the scouting process

doe run hired missouri enterprise, which provides business consulting services for manufacturing
businesses, to help identify missouri companies to support its supply chain. doe run previously partnered
with missouri enterprise through its supplier development program, and in 2014, missouri enterprise
awarded doe run the missouri impact! award. (read more in awards and achievements )

the process of selecting a supplier was comprehensive:

 1. missouri enterprise compiled a list of potential missouri suppliers that could meet doe run’s needs.
 2. the top candidates were audited by missouri enterprise on criteria, such as:

    can the supplier provide the materials needed within the time required?
    do they meet doe run’s quality standards?
    will they be open to working together to identify solutions?

 1. finally, doe run visited companies that met the criteria to evaluate if the suppliers aligned with doe
    run’s standards for safety, sustainability and partnership.

doe run will continue to use the supplier scouting program to identify gaps in the supply chain that
missouri suppliers can fill.

corporate governance
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /governance/corporate-governance/

the doe run resources corporation, doing business as the doe run company (doe run), is privately
held by the new york-based renco group inc.

as a global supplier of lead, copper, and zinc concentrates and lead metals and alloys, doe run is guided
by an eight-member executive team. the team consists of the president and chief executive officer; vice
president – finance and chief financial officer; vice president – information technology; vice president –
law; vice president – sales and marketing; vice president – human resources & community relations; vice
president – exploration; and vice president – environmental, health & safety. the executive team is 87.5
percent male and 87.5 percent caucasian, and encompasses an age range of 40 to 65 years. the team
includes one female and one person of hispanic heritage. their compensation is determined using market-
based data and standard industry practices. these individuals are responsible for setting the business
strategy and organizational structure of doe run, as well as the company’s economic, social and
environmental performance with input from a sustainability governance committee led by the vice
president – environmental, health & safety. in this role, the vice president – environmental, health & safety,
as well as the president and chief executive officer and vice president – human resources & community
relations, review and approve doe run’s annual sustainability report.

doe run’s board expects management to keep pace with best practices in corporate governance. to
accomplish this goal, doe run utilizes a stringent set of corporate governance policies, procedures and
practices to ensure that the business is properly directed, administered and controlled. for example:

    as a privately held company, doe run is not legally bound to meet the requirements of
    the sarbanes-oxley act . this act was passed by congress in 2002 to help restore confidence in
    publicly traded companies after several major corporate and accounting scandals. however, doe
    run chose to adopt sarbanes-oxley requirements that can be applied to privately held companies.
    these include good documentation procedures, rigorous internal accounting controls based on a
    proper segregation of duties, and strong internal audits and reviews. we also undergo annual
    external audits by the accounting firm of crowe horwath llp, which adheres to generally accepted
    auditing standards (gaas) as established by the american institute of certified public
    accountants. our decision to take these steps is consistent with our desire to conduct business
    ethically and responsibly. following this control framework also supports our efforts to maintain
    international organization for standardization (iso) certifications at several operating sites. our
    herculaneum site, resource recycling facility and vancouver, washington, fabricated products
    inc. site are certified under iso 9000 programs, which verify that strong, quality procedures are in
    place. doe run’s sweetwater mine and mill, fletcher mine and mill, and resource recycling facility
    also hold iso 14001 certification, which focuses on environmental management. specifics related
    to these certifications are included in our full gri report. we believe these efforts support the
    expectations of many of our stakeholders to exhibit the rigor and responsibility mandated by the
    sarbanes-oxley act.
    doe run has written procedures and policies in place to ensure the accuracy and completeness of
    our financial records and the effectiveness of our internal control systems, particularly in such areas
    as accounting, purchasing, vendor receipts and customer transactions. on a semiannual basis, doe
    run’s internal audit department compares our employee master list with our vendor master list to
    help ensure no conflicts of interest are present. in addition, the legal department reviews contracts
    for business risks and potential conflicts of interest.

    as a federal sub-contractor, doe run adheres to the requirements of the office of federal contracts
    compliance program (ofccp). in doing so, doe run develops an annual affirmative action plan,
    which supports the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action in all of its
    employment policies and practices, including recruiting, hiring, compensation, benefits, transfers,
    training, promotions, social recreation programs, company sponsored events, and in other terms
    and conditions of employment.
    doe run strives to maintain open communication with important audiences both inside and outside
    the company. as described within the reporting process, doe run regularly surveys stakeholders
    through third-party surveys of community stakeholders and employees (conducted in 2012 and
    2014). through our corporate office, doe run provides our operating sites with guidance and
    education about community engagement. sites then implement programs based on the specific
    needs of local communities. these programs include regular community outreach, facility tours,
    public meetings and ongoing dialogue with local communities. you can share feedback with the
    company through any of these forums, or by contacting communityinfo@doerun.com.
    we also provide our employees with a mechanism by which they can anonymously share issues or
    concerns via a hotline system managed by an outside third party. once an employee makes a
    report, the third-party firm sends an email to the internal audit department, the vice president –
    human resources & community relations, and the vice president – law. timely investigations are
    conducted for all reports made to the hotline, with issues of safety given highest priority. any
    necessary communication between the reporter and the company is handled through the third-party
    firm to maintain confidentiality.

potential employees begin learning about the company’s expectations, values and sustainability policy
from our website and in hiring ads. in addition, the company’s standards of business conduct and
company values, vision, mission and business strategy are reviewed formally during the onboarding
process. employees also are required to sign an acknowledgment that they have received and understand
the doe run employee handbook and standards of business conduct.

our core values are reinforced daily in conversations, business processes, and internal and external
communications.

we believe we can enhance the quality of life through:

    safety: protecting one another.
    integrity: demonstrating transparency and honesty in all we say and do.
    collaboration: working together with employees and external stakeholders to realize shared goals.
    respect: recognizing that every employee has a voice and opinion that matters; diversity of
    experience, thought and ideas is encouraged.
    stewardship: conserving, managing and making the most of the natural resources in our care.
    sustainability: balancing social, environmental and economic considerations with a relentless focus
    on improving our processes.

to ensure that we stay current on corporate governance and corporate responsibility trends, we maintain
memberships in several industry-related trade associations. these associations support and educate
members about such issues as community engagement, environmental stewardship and sustainability.
company leaders often hold committee and/or board positions in some of these organizations. doe run
employs an award-winning project management office (pmo) that utilizes a rigorous process to plan for,
manage and evaluate projects. the pmo has quantified improvements in areas such as project

completion times and budget accuracy. by utilizing outside resources and proven programs, we help
ensure we are looking at — and implementing as appropriate — best practices.

we believe that corporate governance is an evolving process. to that end, we are actively working with our
divisions to build our capacity for community engagement. in 2013 and 2014, doe run contracted with a
community coordinator to help build internal understanding and capacity of community engagement. we
are committed to continuous improvement in corporate governance so we can continue to operate
responsibly and with integrity.

identification and selection of stakeholders

we strive to maintain open communication with stakeholders both inside and outside the company. based
on input and continued dialogue with our employees, communities, industry groups and regulatory bodies,
we’ve determined our stakeholders consist of community groups and leaders; property owners;
neighboring residents; current and retired employees; local, state and federal government; business
groups; nearby schools; regulatory agencies; and industry organizations.

stakeholders can get in touch with their local operational facilities for more information, or through the
corporate office at communityinfo@doerun.com.

reporting process
   sustainability2014.doerun.com /governance/report-parameters/

based on the global reporting initiative (gri) definition of materiality, the doe run company (doe run)
determines what information to include in its sustainability report based on a variety of methods, including
third-party quantitative and qualitative research, one-on-one conversations, community meetings, tours
and special events. we include progress we have made on projects, processes, or challenges that have
significant economic, environmental and social impact (both positive and negative) on our company, our
stakeholders and the industries that depend on lead-based products.

several steps have helped doe run senior management and functional managers determine and improve
materiality for our sustainability reports.

    doe run initially adopted the gri framework in 2009 as a response to research that indicated
    audiences wanted to know more about the company, its efforts to operate safely and investments to
    minimize its environmental impact. positive response from the first gri report led doe run to
    expand the report in 2010. doe run added seven additional material indicators, reporting above
    and beyond the minimum required for level c reporting.
    a sustainability governance committee, established in 2012, is charged with implementing
    programs and processes to further integrate sustainability into doe run’s work, including the
    indicators and processes reported in the sustainability report. the committee chair also approves
    the material topics, content and indicators chosen for the reports.
    in 2012, doe run conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative research within the missouri
    communities in which it operates to improve how it communicates with stakeholders, including
    through this report. the research identified the major issues facing citizens in the community to be
    the local economy, job opportunities, environmental responsibility and community involvement.
    in 2014, doe run again conducted research within the missouri communities surrounding its
    operations to determine any changes to the major issues facing the communities. the research
    indicated that the local economy, job opportunities and environmental responsibility continue to be
    top concerns to community stakeholders, as well as the safety of doe run operations and the
    company’s involvement in the community. in addition, the company has received non-solicited
    phone calls from across the u.s. from citizens expressing concerns about the closure of the last
    primary lead smelter in the u.s. and its potential impact on access to lead material for security and
    outdoor activities.
    in addition, the sustainability governance committee and doe run’s general managers identified
    the main challenges, accomplishments and progress within the company in 2014, including the
    business restructure and progress on environmental projects.
    doe run then prioritized which data indicators and content to focus on in the 2014 report:

         environmental performance.
         workforce data and economic impact.
         community involvement.
         employee health and safety.

open communications with our internal and external stakeholders help us share achievements and

challenges. it also helps doe run understand what actions and information our stakeholders need from
us.

our sustainability reports and our online survey are two channels for this communication. intended
stakeholder audiences include community groups and leaders; property owners; neighboring residents;
current and retired employees; local, state and federal government; business groups; nearby schools;
public agencies; and industry organizations.

few questions via our online survey.
