during the years we invested in human and economic resources to
guarantee wellbeing and satisfaction in the workplace.

in this regard we carried out the analysis of the internal
organisational climate intended to record the appreciation degree
compared to the employment in all its aspects, in order to improve
and develop new initiatives (yoga classes, contest with prices, sport
competitions).

we also confirmed our commitment in joining charitable activities
that could help others, making donations to no profit foundations
both local and international, aware that our small gesture is, for
them, a big help. we actively supported environmental projects,
social and cultural activities in the local communities especially
involving the future generations.

recently we established new targets for the total gas emissions for
2018 & 2020, representing a total reduction of 15% within 2018, and
20% within 2020, based on 2012 levels.

over the coming years, we will continue to improve our economic,
social and environmental performances, always thinking of our
future generations.

palladio news


in 2014 our company newsletter was restored. it is now published
every four months with the main purpose of explaining about the
company, starting from the internal organisation, passing through
the main events, up to the latest products news, but also with the
important goal of promoting and increasing the sense of belonging
among employees, the spirit of collaboration and teamwork,
improving the climate for business.
with this additional communication tool we want to stimulate the
participation and involvement of employees, keeping them updated
about activities that are taking place and encouraging the flow of
information between departments.
the structure of the publication includes an editorial signed by the
ceo, "the focus" on a relevant topic of particular interest for the
company, then the various sections telling the news coming from
our operational sites and the final pages are dedicated to the events ,
corporate life and our people.

g4 ‒ 27

our sustainability principles (values) are both the result of material
issues that have emerged from the involvement of the various
functions and of the various forms of dialogue and discussions with
groupʻs stakeholders.


this document was the first step in the preparation of a
sustainability report in line with gri which led us to focus more on
the aspects that really matter, on which we will target our efforts in
response to the needs and expectations of our stakeholders.



over the year 2015 there no critical issues emerged from the
activities of stakeholders' involvement.

the drafting and publication of the sustainability report and other
reports on the assessment of our corporate social responsibility by
ecovadis enterprise has received appreciation from all of our
stakeholders.

procurement approach


g4 ‒ ec9
the group favours domestic suppliers and, in particular, companies
that can provide goods and / or services in the whole national
territory. most of the spending on supplies, for the three countries in
which the organisation operates, is made from local suppliers, i.e.
operators located in the same country and in many cases in the same
region or city, where the offices of the groupʼs companies are.
the raw material used for production is defined by the customer,
and generally produced / manufactured by multinational paper
mills.
we avail, as much as possible of local suppliers, as shown in the
paragraph g4-12.

following the evaluation of environmental impacts (lcia), in relation
to the annual production, our consumptions were monitored to
intervene significantly by establishing objectives aimed to:
-       reduce natural resources waste
-       reduce our contribution to global warming.
the extent of reduction was determined through the evaluation of
the carbon foot print for the years taken as reference.


focus on biodiversity
one of the environmental elements in which palladio group pays its
attention, is biodiversity. of course we do not operate in protected
areas or where there are endangered species, but through the
adherence to the forest management systems as fsc and pefc , we
confirm our interest in this field.
supporting the protection of forests and wildlife, as well as standing
up against the illegal trade in the wood industry; seems only right
given our kind of manufacturing.
our staff awareness in this field is very strong; the company
promotes initiatives which directly involve the employees, and in
some cases their families by advertising our sustainability activities
through brochures, posters and visits to our facilities, all this is
making sure that our vision and commitment in the environmental
field is also shared with them.

all the premises of the group water is mainly used for sanitary
purposes. there are no recycling / reuse methods in place.


in 2015 have been consumed 7,626 m3, for a consumption of about
14 m3 per head. almost all the water consumed comes from
municipal water while about 18% of consumption consists of ground
water, used only at the plant in dueville. to reduce water
consumption, flow reducers were installed to the taps in the toilets
of our sites, simple devices that mix air with water and double
buttons for draining water sanitation so as to minimise the waste of
this resource.

considered the value of co2 emissions per ton of raw material                      picture 7 total tco2 emissions d originated by use to raw material processing for each plant

produced, provided by different paper mills. specifically the emission
of co2 was weighed according to the amount of material taken. if
the supplier has not sent / delivered the value per ton of co2 we
applied the highest value available.
we also note that co2 emissions considered and referred to as "co2
from processing" is derived from the product of the conversion index

as stated above, natural gas is consumed for premises heating of the
italian and serbian plants while the irish plant uses for the same
purpose oil fuel. based on the data from the invoice relating to the
consumption of each plant were calculated emissions of individual
production units.
the total emissions are shown by picture 8, while picture 9 reports
the co2 emissions for each plant with the changes occurred in the
last three years.

the amount of co2 released into the environment has been
determined through the transformation of consumption (expressed
in kwh) in equivalent tons of co2 through the application of a
conversion factor, specific to the country in object, as recommended
by the iea (international energy agency report "co2 emissions from
