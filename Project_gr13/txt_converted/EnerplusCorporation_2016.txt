                                             more than just an idea,
                                                  it is how we work.
at enerplus, we are proud of what we do, how we do it and where we are headed in our sustainability journey.
we care about keeping our people safe, developing our resources responsibly, respecting the environment and
building positive relationships in the communities where we live and work.
our story began in 1986 when we formed canada’s first oil and natural gas royalty trust, which converted into
a corporation on january 1, 2011. over time, we have advanced our business and technical capabilities. we have
bought, sold and developed billions of dollars of assets, focusing on three distinct core areas in the united states
and canada which make up nearly 90% of our corporate production.
our sustainability report summarizes our business, responsibility, people and performance in 2015. this report
was prepared in accordance with the core indicators of the global reporting initiative (gri) g4 guidelines and
g4 oil and gas sector supplement (2013).

i am pleased to share our 2015 sustainability report. while 2015 was a challenging year for
our industry, our performance results demonstrate our continued commitment to grow a
successful and sustainable oil and gas company. our strong safety performance in 2015
reflects our continued focus on evolving our safety culture at enerplus. this is something
of which i am extremely proud.
going forward, we will continue to focus on safely delivering strong operational results,
prudently managing our financial position and continuing to meet our safety and social
responsibility objectives, while looking for innovative solutions to maintain and achieve
additional capital and operational efficiencies. i believe that while the current commodity price
environment presents challenges, it is also an opportunity for us to differentiate our business
from others and create significant future value for our shareholders over the long-term.

“the adopt-a-well program that was initiated by enerplus at the
mandaree school expands the horizon for students to see what
opportunities are available beyond the boundaries of their community,
and provides a motivation to strive for something that may have never
been realized otherwise. enerplus should be commended for their
investment in the education of the students at the mandaree school.”

“enerplus has played and continues to play a key role in raising awareness
within government and industry about the hazards of exposure to

stepping up to the plate to take leadership within industry to improve the
safety and health of the oil and gas workforce and it is making a difference.”
