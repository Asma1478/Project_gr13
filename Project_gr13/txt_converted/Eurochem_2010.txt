npk (nh4h2po4 + nh4no3 + kcl) (16:16:16,
8:24:24, 17:0, 1:28, 21:0, 1:21) is an
all-purpose complex fertilizer widely used
to balance nutrients for plants in all types
of soils as the main fertilizer, pre-sowing
fertilizer and for top dressing. the product
features a solid smooth grain. the high
nutrient content exceeds 40 percent and
allows significant reductions in transportation
costs, storage and application as compared to
single fertilizers.

npk (12:15:15) is a highly efficient complex
chlorine-free fertilizer containing all elements
necessary for plant growth such as nitrogen,
phosphorus, potash, and sulfates (at least 14
percent in terms of sulfur). it is used for all
types of soils and crops and is recommended
for chlorine-sensitive crops such as potatoes,
fruit and berries, vegetables, vines, and
tobacco. the fertilizer is mostly effective
in fruit and vegetable gardening and flower
growing.
