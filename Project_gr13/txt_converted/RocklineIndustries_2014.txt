     letter from the president




as our business continues
    to grow,                                  we understand the importance of further reducing our
                                              environmental impact. rockline’s sustainability
                                              program is now in its sixth year and while we have had
                                              both successes and challenges, we remain committed to
                                              doing the right thing.

                                              we continue to integrate sustainable practices into our
                                              business – from operations to product design. our
                                              green teams play an integral role in driving initiatives at
                                              our manufacturing sites - from finding re-use and recycle
                                              streams for our waste, to implementing process
                                              improvements that make us more efficient, to educating
                                              associates on what we can do at work and at home to
                                              reduce our environmental footprint.

                                              while our focus has been on operations over the course
                                              of the last six years, we are realizing the even greater
    importance of reaching toward our aspiration to create ecologically intelligent products. in the
    future, we will put greater emphasis on collaborating with our supply chain and our customers to
    develop products that are more environmentally sustainable.

    as in our previous reports, we have provided a transparent view of our progress towards our
    sustainability targets. transparency drives us internally and allows our stakeholders to understand
    our achievements and our challenges.

    we will retire our 2015 goals in the coming year and i look forward to celebrating what we have
    accomplished, but know that there is still much more that we can do. we will also be setting our
    next multi-year goals with targets for 2020. at rockline, sustainability is truly a never ending
    journey of continuous improvement.

    we hope you enjoy this year’s report, and we appreciate you taking the time to read it. as always,
    we welcome your feedback.

rockline industries is a privately-held manufacturer           global sustainability coordinator
of wet wipe, coffee filter, and baking cup products –
headquartered in sheboygan, wis. founded in
plymouth, wis. in 1976 by ralph rudolph, rockline
has grown to become a global enterprise, employing
over 2,000 people worldwide.

rockline’s environmental sustainability program was started in 2008.

our sustainability program is driven by the recognition that the world’s population is
growing and consuming resources at an unprecedented rate, leading to more waste and
more carbon emissions than ever before. we have always sought to deliver long-term
value to our customers, but today that means offering them the highest quality products
with the most sustainable business practices. if we can accomplish this, we can ensure
that future generations have the resources and opportunities to live full and healthy lives.
more and more, our consumers and customers recognize the importance of this and
increasingly expect best practices from us – and we aim to deliver. our program follows a
top-down approach with executive review annually and steering committee direction on
strategic initiatives. we have successfully embedded sustainability throughout the
organization through designated green leads within our facilities who are responsible
for implementing specific initiatives.

                                                                                                   3

scope
the greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions data in this report are comprised primarily of greenhouse
gas protocol scope 1 and scope 2 data from our manufacturing facilities and offices. this report
also contains a limited amount of scope 3 data (ghg emissions from outbound shipping of our
finished goods to customers).


boundaries
this report covers operations over which rockline exercises financial control, with the exception
of two minor subsidiaries, rockline netherlands b.v and rockline trading hong kong, which
represent less than 1% of our global business activities and environmental impact. we have also
excluded soshio (hk) industrial co. ltd., our chinese manufacturing partner, as we do not
exercise financial control over their operations.


methodology
unless explicitly indicated otherwise, all data, figures and charts cover the period of our fiscal year
ending in 2014, which runs from july 1, 2013 to june 30, 2014. the data in this report has been
collected from invoices and statements of account sent to rockline by our utility providers and
other vendors. we have calculated our carbon footprint using the greenhouse gas protocol
corporate standard, as well as emission coefficients from the united states environmental
protection agency (us epa) and the united kingdom department of farm, environment, and
rural affairs (uk defra). in 2014, the us epa updated the emissions factors and the numbers
in this report have been adjusted to reflect these updates. this is our sixth annual report. our
previous report was published in november 2013, covering our fiscal year 2013 (july 1, 2012, to
june 30, 2013)


stakeholders
our stakeholders were identified as customers, suppliers, associates, and communities in 2009 by our
environmental sustainability steering committee. in the past five years, we have engaged our
stakeholders in a myriad of ways. we have intergrated environmental sustainability metrics into many
of our supplier reviews and have engaged suppliers in designing their own sustainability programs. we
have engaged our customers and play an active role in many of their sustainability programs as well. we
have an obligation to the communities in which we operate to ensure we do our part to make them
livable, clean, and safe.

                  3-tier vision
    long term — aspirations
    aspirations are our hope for what a completely sustainable rockline might look
    like, at some point in the future.
    medium term — multi-year goals
    rockline’s current multi-year goals are set for our fiscal year 2015. these more
    ambitious goals give shape to where rockline is headed in a strategic sense. we
    will be working to establish new five year goals to put in place when the 2015 goals
    are retired.
    short term — annual goals
    rockline sets annual sustainability targets, as a way of measuring our progress from
    year to year. these goals are small, incremental steps toward sustainability.



                     aspirations
    fossil fuel independence
    rockline wants to move away from fossil fuels toward clean, low-carbon energy.
      • use energy more efficiently.
      • show preference for low-carbon fuels.
      • adopt alternative and renewable energy sources.

2014 highlights

energy
our springdale, ark. facility continued to install motion-sensing, high-efficiency lighting in the
warehouse space, as well as upgrade external lighting from halide to leds. in the coming year,
the springdale facility will put reflective window films on all remaining exterior windows to help
reduce air conditioning requirements. additionally, springdale will be adding air ducts to utilize
exhaust heat from compressors to heat the warehouse during cooler months.

our booneville, ark. facility continued to replace halide lights throughout the facility with
energy-efficient led and fluorescent lighting.




greenhouse gas
our montville, n.j. facility replaced two propane forklifts with battery-electric models. montville
will continue adopting battery-electric forklifts in 2015, and tentatively expects to have the entire
fleet replaced by 2016.

our booneville, ark. facility completed the expansion of their geothermal heating and cooling
system. the expansion allows a larger part of the production facility, as well as the break room, to
utilize the geothermal system for temperature control. the 1.2 million square foot plant is the
largest production facility to be heated and cooled by geothermal technology and is expected to
reduce booneville’s overall reliance on energy and natural gas by 65%.




    wastewater
    our springdale, ark. facility has replaced all of their lobular style vacuum systems with
    liquid ring vacuum systems; liquid ring vacuum systems operate at a lower temperature,
    pose no fire risk, and reduce water usage and discharge - all while providing a more
    reliable, stronger, and robust vacuum source.
    our redditch, u.k. facility installed a new sanitization system that allows them to use
    less water when cleaning out their solution mixing tanks.

2014 highlights
solid waste
our montville, n.j. facility reduced scrap on two coffee filter production lines by rebuilding
the backstands and upgrading the spindles and spacers.
our springdale, ark. facility implemented new shrink-wrapping equipment, which
significantly reduced shrink-film waste.



landfill
our sheboygan, wis. facility installed a baler for recycling stretch film. this will allow us
to divert this material from landfill.
our springdale, ark. facility began an employee-focused recycling program to capture
recyclables that are currently thrown in the trash. this will include both the break rooms
and the office area.
our redditch, u.k. facility implemented the recycling of glass materials.



transportation
through interleaving at one of our distribution centers in booneville, ark., rockline is
saving as much as 140 miles of empty forklift distance per month. interleaving is the
efficient combination of picking and putting away, in a warehouse. we will be using our
learnings from this approach as we implement similar solutions in additional dc’s.

rockline also implemented a co-mingling distribution center, which allows multiple
manufacturers for a single customer to convert inefficient less-than-truckload (ltl)
orders into more efficient full-truckload shipments.

rockline further implemented a de-consolidation center where 40-foot containers are
transferred to 53-foot trailers, eliminating one container being drayed inland for every 4
containers received. this will help reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions from our transportation fleet.

in 2015, rockline will be expanding our arkansas-dedicated shuttles to include more raw
material suppliers, eliminating empty miles. rockline will also be introducing new
order-management strategies that will minimize the frequency of ltl shipments.




                                                                                                9

  energy
  the energy we consume is used in the conversion of finished raw materials into consumer
  packaged goods, including wet wipes, coffee filters, and baking cups. the types of energy
  we use can be broken down into three broad categories: electrical, thermal, and vehicular.
  rockline’s electricity is sourced from public utilities.

  our two primary thermal fuels are natural gas and no. 2 distillate fuel oil. (the latter is
  used only at our montville, n.j. facility.) rockline procures these fuels from public
  utilities or traditional commercial suppliers.

  rockline vehicle fuels, which include conventional motor diesel and conventional
  unleaded gasoline, are procured from local suppliers.

  greenhouse gas
  we utilize emissions factors published by the u.s. environmental protection agency
  (epa) and the u.k. department of environment, farm, and rural affairs (defra) to
  estimate our scope 2 emissions. each factor is based on the mix of fuel sources used by
  the power plants in the regions where our facilities are located.

  for thermal and vehicle fuels, we utilize factors published by the international panel on
  climate change (ipcc) to determine our emissions. the same factors are used for all our
  our facilities.

  we have determined that energy reduction is our best strategy for reducing our
  greenhouse gas emissions.

     wastewater
     potable fresh water is an extremely scarce commodity representing less than 1% of all water
     found on earth. this fact, combined with population growth and economic growth globally
     could pose a risk in the long term as fresh water is a major component of our operations,
     including the single largest ingredient in our wet wipe lotions and one of the main process
     materials in coffee filters and baking cups.

     rockline seeks to reduce the water we use (outside of water used in products) per unit
     of production.

outside of finished goods, we use water for a range of other purposes. our products undergo
extensive quality testing before we ship them for public consumption, and many of these tests
require water. rockline also uses water to flush, clean, and sanitize piping and other machinery
used to deliver lotion to the production lines. each time a line changes from one type of lotion
to another, the entire pipe works must be flushed to prevent contaminating any product with
trace amounts of the previous lotion. the piping must also be cleaned and sanitized on a
regular basis to prevent build up.

our wastewater metric focuses on reducing the amount of water consumed by rockline outside
of finished goods. in 2014, rockline’s non-product water use per unit of production increased
5% versus our 2009 baseline. this was due, in part, to an increase in line trials and process
trials for new formulations at both our wisconsin and arkansas facilities. increased trials led to
an increased need for sanitization.


rockline will never sacrifice quality to save water, but focusing on more efficient water use,
even in testing and cleaning, is a priority.




                                                                                                 13

     solid waste
     waste is the inefficient use of resources. rockline defines solid waste as all waste leaving
     our facility regardless of how it is generated or handled. our coffee filter production
     generates a high amount of waste because the round filters are cut from square sheets of
     paper. even though the paper scrap is recycled, it is still considered waste, because a truly
     efficient process would use all of the paper.

     rockline focuses on measuring, reducing, and eliminating waste from our manufacturing
     processes to provide better value to our customers. every step we take toward reducing
     solid waste relieves a portion of the demand placed on natural resources.

  landfill
  all solid waste that is not recycled, reused or incinerated for energy recapture is sent to
  landfill. the greatest opportunity rockline has in diverting waste from landfill is finding
  customers downstream who value our waste. we continue to be challenged by our blended
  nonwoven scrap, which is our largest portion of solid waste. today, only a small portion of
  this material is recycled.

  rockline’s goal is to handle work in a way that has the smallest impact on the environment.

  to calculate our landfill rate, we divide the amount of waste sent to landfill by the total
  amount of waste leaving our facilities (which includes landfilled waste, as well as recycled
  waste, waste incinerated for energy recapture and waste donated for reuse).

  transportation -
  outbound shipping modes
  rockline’s logistics team is constantly seeking new ways to reduce fuel consumption and
  optimize shipments. we use all major modes of transportation to ship finished goods,
  including truck, rail, ocean, and air freight. for each of the shipping modes, rockline has
  established a per tonne-kilometer greenhouse gas emissions factor. the factors for all modes
  are based on published sources, with the exception of less-than-truckload (ltl) shipping. as
  there is no standardized method of estimating carbon emissions from ltl shipments,
  rockline adds a 20% premium to the truckload factor to account for the extra distance that
  ltl shipments typically travel.

 2015 and beyond
we appreciate you taking the time to read our 2014 annual sustainability report. my first year on the
desk went by quickly and i got to see, first hand, the challenges that companies face when trying to be
more sustainable.

as you read in our highlights, all of our facilities were busy working on initiatives that helped drive
down energy, greenhouse gas emissions, and solid waste, and our logistics team continued to make
great strides in reducing our emissions from outbound transportation.

as we head into 2015, we know that we will have our share of challenges, but we will find new and
innovative ways to reduce our environmental impact. and it doesn’t stop there.

we will use our learnings and experience to charge ahead as we set our 2020 goals.

rockline remains committed to maintaining the momentum in 2015, and beyond!

we invite you to contact us with any questions or comments.

                         kind regards,
                         nina schaub
